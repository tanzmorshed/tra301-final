"kingtanichi","Null","298","368","17 July 2003"," We were soldiers AND made a great film...
","Black Hawk Down is first and foremost an immensely effective war film, but beyond that, its one of the most subtly differently made war films ever. Most war films usually either have a single hero through whom we see everything (i.e. Platoon), or present us with a squad of soldiers, all of whom are identifiable ""types"" (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). Black Hawk Down takes a different approach, instead giving us a very wide array of characters, none clearly singled out as a hero or type to command the audience's attention. The general effect is to create that feeling of a team army that George C. Scott so ardently expounded to us at the start of Patton. Furthering this feel of military professionalism, the film never cheapens itself by putting too much emotional weight into one moment. The plot moves ahead at a constant pace, cutting from location to location, without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers. The effect is of watching documentary footage of a real military operation gone wrong. While the effect of this scripting approach may produce some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>And you'd better believe there will be subsequent viewings, because Ridley Scott has created one of cinema's all-time great pieces of eye candy here. The editing, cinematography, grading, scoring and visual effects all combine to leave a viewer just as drained upon leaving the theatre as these soldiers were on leaving Mogadishu. The intensity of this film's combat is easily equal to Saving Private Ryan, and leaves such pretenders as We Were Soldiers behind in the dust. Black Hawk Down lacks the former's emotional resonance, but unlike the latter, it thrives on the fact, creating a final product as mind-challenging in its construction as it is mind-blowing its visualization."
"shades033","10","438","558","12 January 2002"," One of the best war movies of all time
","When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After ""stirring up the hornet's nest"", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, ""Leave No Man Behind"".<br/><br/>Needless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells ""RPG's!"" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.<br/><br/>While the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play ""Dead Somali with a Gun #354"".<br/><br/>Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.<br/><br/>As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.<br/><br/>A big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.<br/><br/>In a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 out of 10"
"DesbUK","8","147","184","19 March 2005"," A very American war story directed by an Englishman
","I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.<br/><br/>Scott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clich√©s of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'."
"dberman-2","9","269","356","3 March 2005"," one of the best ACCURATE war movies
","Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general."

","I'm not a fan of war movies usually,but when i sat down to watch Black Hawk Down,i couldn't turn it off.Heres a war movie which doesn't sugar coat.There is no crappy dialogue,no soppy love story tie ins,just the real deal,brutal battle scenes,the gruesome reality of war.Black Hawk Down is based on a true story,the bloody battle at Somalia and it leaves one drained.Its confronting,and exposes war in its true light-there's nothing glamorous to see.In two hours and a bit the viewer is able to imagine being there at the horrible battleground,and suffering like the soldiers did.It really makes you appreciate how lucky we are to be in a free country,relatively peaceful,and not having our lives threatened every second of the day.Everything about BHD is right; the setting of the film,the Somalians,the American soldiers going through hell,the brutality,the battle,the<br/><br/>fatalities.Not for the faint hearted,or weak stomached,but a truly powerful,compelling motion picture.Ridley Scott takes the viewer on an imaginative journey through Black Hawk Down and appeals to our emotions.A brutal,yet bearable war film."
"ptheus","10","208","279","18 January 2002"," I Felt Like I Was in that Black Hawk
","Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.<br/><br/>Ahh emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from ""Good to Excellent,"" there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context,  and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional ""hooks"" for the characters.  As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of ""choke-up"" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class ""Hoot.""<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. That there were not more casualties is a credit to them and ultimately a credit to all of us."
"GridGirl03","10","149","198","31 August 2002"," So many elements combine to make this movie good.. especially the music
","I've just got this movie on DVD - I did see it on the big screen and it blew my mind.  Being from Australia we had practically no idea of what was going on in Somalia, and after seeing this movie and then reading the book - it is an eye opener.<br/><br/>Now that I've watched it a few more times, I've noticed one thing with this movie.  The music.  Aside from the story and the cinematography and the editing which all are so well done that you feel like you are there with them; the music is a big contributor to the feel of the movie, and in my opinion, more so than in a lot of films.<br/><br/>It is very subtle, it has taken me 10 viewings to even notice there was music there.  It really helps create the atmosphere, going from lighthearted, almost fun in the beginning with various rock/pop tracks into deep and moving operatic styles as the story progesses into the war and further.<br/><br/>It is the top of my list of favourites for many reasons, but I think mostly it is the way the whole package comes together to tell the story of what happened that makes it so good.<br/><br/>Well worth viewing many times over."
"Theo Robertson","8","112","153","18 September 2003"," It`s An Account , Not A Statement
","I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of "" The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam "" , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing it <br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie and have to take issue with some of the comments raised . First of all people complain about events and incidents being changed , I know how you feel but with any adaptation there`s bound to be bits condensed , the only real criticisms that can justified is that this film version totally negates the Somali point of view ( For those of you who haven`t read the book Mark Bowden writes his account in a similar subjective manner Corneilus Ryan wrote his trilogy - two of which THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR were made into blockbuster movies - dealing with the last months of the war in Europe ) but Bowden`s book is an account of the battle of Mogadishu , that`s what it is - An account that doesn`t really concern itself with wider issues like politics or anti-war sentiment , so it seems churlish to complain about concepts like character development because that`s not what the story is about . I`ve also heard teenage girls complain that Orlando Bloom doesn`t get enough screen time and that they found it too violent . I`m sorry to hear that girls , hopefully next time you go to the cinema you might like to find out what you`re letting yourself in for . As for the rest of the screenplay it is accurate right down to the friction between the Deltas and the Rangers and the fact the Americans were actually rescued by a UN force composed of Malaysians and Pakistanis<br/><br/>
Ridley Scott rightly deserved an Oscar nomination with BHD . It`s his movie and he surpasses anything Spielberg achieved with the overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN . War is hell and this is a film of stark and haunting imagery of victims of famine , of mutilated soldiers and civilians . Both editing and cinematography are superb with many great scenes like the small stream of American soldiers walking up the street while on the other side of the houses a massive torrent of armed militiamen are walking in the same direction . My only real complaints of what`s on screen is Ewan McGregor`s awful American accent ( It`s especially so when you stop to consider that most of the cast aren`t played by American actors )and Hans Zimmer score resembles that of most of his other movies , but I shouldn`t nitpick because I found this Scott`s best film alongside GLADIATOR"
"shea_bennett","Null","145","224","6 October 2002"," Outstanding
","When you break it down and look at it both honestly and cynically (assuming that that is possible for a minute), there are really only two kinds of war movie: pro and con. The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?<br/><br/>Pro or con?<br/><br/>What is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.<br/><br/>On October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.<br/><br/>Yet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.<br/><br/>And for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.<br/><br/>Ultimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.<br/><br/>Unlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.<br/><br/>We get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.<br/><br/>But any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'<br/><br/>Throughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.<br/><br/>The musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.<br/><br/>What is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.<br/><br/>Speaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.<br/><br/>I also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.<br/><br/>Also as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.<br/><br/>That, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.<br/><br/>Rating: **** 1/2 (out of five)"

","I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. <br/><br/>Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge. <br/><br/>I appreciate the Director and actors to carry out this War Movie with such accuracy. If you are a Defence Enthusist this movie is must watch and if not then too one must watch it to understand is WAR is nothing less then HELL. <br/><br/>Since this based on true incident let's pay respect to those who sacrificed their lives and salute those who have lived another day to fight."
"jotix100","10","16","24","24 January 2002"," War is hell
","This film is more realistic than the tepid pictures that were produced  in the Hollywood of World War II. You have to give credit to the director, Ridley Scott, to come out with a winning movie that is totally engrossing and that keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time. The only sad part is that we never get to know the feelings on the Somali people that battled the American power to the bitter end. So in that sense, this film is a one-sided account of what went on, told to us from the American viewpoint, which is well and good, but we never get to hear from the other side, except the short scene from one of the Somali warlord and General Garrison.<br/><br/>
This film is released right smack at the height of the Afghanistan conflict in which Americans are facing ""the evil enemy"", according to our president. In the case of the Somalian involvement, it was supposedly to help the Somalis regain peace from the warlords that dominated the country. The parallel with the war in Afghanistan is somehow similar as we are still battling the same type of enemy in a divided country, dominated as was Somalia by warlords that are more interested in the domination of the poor and defenseless people than in achieving democracy and freedom for the people of the country.<br/><br/>What doesn't make sense at all is why didn't the Black Hawks attack from the air the thousands up in the roof, thus providing cover to the troops on the ground. In fact, the whole nature of the fighting is a bit of a puzzlement because if the intention was to kidnap the kingpins of the conflict, we only succeeded in putting our troops in harm's way and to have 19 men killed, when maybe they would have had a better chance if they had better cover from the same Black Hawks the enemy keep downing. <br/><br/>The cast is very good. I never did like Josh Hartnett, and frankly, he is not a good actor. He doesn't show any emotion. The rest of the cast is great with actors of the stature of Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fitchner and the rest. As an ensemble they interact very well and you believe they are the people involved in the original conflict.<br/><br/>The gory details of war are realistically handled. The script by Ken Nolan serves the director very well even though, as pointed out at the beginning it's only one-sided, since the enemy then, as it is now is composed of people, as presented in the film, so horrible, they're very easy to hate.<br/><br/>In spite to these misgivings, the film is so fast paced that almost 2 hours and a half pass by so quickly, we don't even feel it's that long. Mr. Scott gives us here his own take of the Somalian conflict in very cinematic terms."
"avakian1","1","122","237","10 August 2009"," An unashamed propaganda piece
","I read Bowden's book by the same title. All of those who claim that this movie follows the book closely clearly lack in reading comprehension. The book took a balanced approach to the conflict. We learn about the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu. Bowden interviews both Somalis and US soldiers and we learn about their motivations.<br/><br/>In the Scott's work all of the characters are flat. They're cookie-cutter ""American heroes"" who are completely indistinguishable from one another. The Somalis are depicted as crazed hordes who are inexplicably hell-bent on US blood.<br/><br/>I could go on, but the opening ""background"" text says enough. It suggests that US soldiers were merely there on a humanitarian mission to rescue the population from a genocidal warlord. What they don't tell you is that shortly before the events in BHD, the Habr Gedir clan elders had met to discuss the peace proposal put forth by Admiral Howe the previous day. Due to lack of intelligence Cobra helicopters armed with TOW missiles attacked massacred 54 people. With this act they succeeded in making enemies of the entire Somali people. Note that military advisers were with the film crew and able to veto every decision.<br/><br/>Read Bowden's book or google the Battle of Mogadishu for more. Propaganda that is thinly dressed as entertainment gets 0 stars from me. The only difference between this and old Soviet propaganda is production value."

","Black Hawk Down (2001)<br/><br/>As much as this is a nerve-wracking, non-stop, high intensity war film that leaves you exhausted, you know that this is barely a whisper of a hint of the skim of the real thing, being there, being shot at and shooting, facing death on both sides. <br/><br/>But what this means more than anything is the movie comes as close as a normal movie can to the intensity of being there. Black Hawk Down is a director's nightmare, and Ridley Scott pulls it off, minute after minute, with lucidity. When the layering of images, the pace, and and the kinetic motion of the camera seem overwhelming, Scott (and his crew, notably Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and Italian editor Pietro Scalia) make this completely absorbing and sensible. The cutting and the multitude of images interwoven for scene after scene would overwhelm most people, but there is becomes poetic and logical without ever becoming easy.<br/><br/>The acting? It sometimes seems to tip toward a hyped up, grand version of archetypes that we know and sometimes expect in war movies, but each of the many main men are intensely believable and realized. The music, too, might threaten to be manipulative, but it never draws attention to itself. And so on. Meaning only that this is a Hollywood movie, for sure, but a really really good one. It plays up the cinematic drama that makes movies movies (and not documentaries) but it is so thoughtfully and artistically considered, it rises above.<br/><br/>Is it a masterpiece? Well, it lacks what you might call utter originality or invention, or even insight. When you finish, you sigh with relief that you've survived, but there is no inner searching left to do. This is partly because this is the truth of war, based on real events. And it's intention is to submerse you in that world, and hold your head under until you are screaming for air."
"Vishal_s_kumar","10","11","16","10 April 2010"," Ridley Scott's harrowing film is a revelation
","Black Hawk Down premiered in December of 2001, a mere three months after the world had faced the harsh reality of the September 11th terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. I vividly remember a small controversy brewing at that time, questioning the film's release in the wake of the attacks. Apparently, some critics felt that the film was arriving too soon after the attacks and that audiences weren't ready to see a film that dealt with the realities of the military and terrorism. Despite those concerns, the film was heralded as an instant classic; moviegoers responded by turning up in droves. Perhaps the reason behind Black Hawk Down's success lies in the strong sense of optimism the film displays, in spite of the tragedy that it portrays on screen.<br/><br/>Somalia, 1993: A small team of Army Rangers and Delta Force Troops on a peace-keeping mission in Somalia, attempt to help avert mass genocide and to protect Somali citizens from barbaric acts of violence and the various militias that occupy the country. When one hundred American soldiers are sent into Mogadishu to arrest a handful of particularly sadistic militia leaders, they find themselves in the midst of an international incident with deadly consequences. Each soldier will be confronted with the realities and horrors of combat as they protect innocent civilians and each other from the surging ranks of hostile forces. Black Hawk Down is a relentless, harrowing and true story of bravery, in the face of the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down can be a seriously difficult film to watch; its hyper-realistic portrayal of battle and in-your-face violence drive home the almost impossible adversity that the soldiers are faced with. The film is nothing if not extraordinarily unnerving. By situating the viewer in the line of fire and in the midst of the battle, Director Ridley Scott achieves the effect of rendering his audience in a near state of panic. It's an unforgettable, exhausting and purposely unpleasant experience.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing things about Black Hawk Down is that in spite of the seemingly random confusion represented on screen, the film brilliantly maps out the soldiers' strategies and tactics. There is, indeed, a method in all of the madness. Being a true virtuoso, Mr. Scott frames the action so precisely, and through such perfect camera angles and placement, that we are able to follow all of the action on screen as though we are participating in the battle. With just about any other director, this kind of controlled chaos could have led to a very confusing film experience for the viewer. It is clear that every last detail of this film had been thoroughly choreographed and intricately planned. Mr. Scott's under-appreciated skills as a visual storyteller make this film a success. Ultimately, Black Hawk Down is a painful film that shows us the realities of war and the horrors of the situation in Somalia. Whatever your political affiliations or opinions might be, this is an important film that deserves to be seen."
"Buddy-51","Null","11","16","20 July 2002"," great battle scenes; wafer-thin characters
","In October 1993, Americans watching their TV sets at home were shocked to see the bodies of a handful of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.  What had begun as an effort to bring humanitarian relief to that war-torn country almost a year earlier had somehow turned into a political quagmire out of which it was becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. forces to extricate themselves.  `Black Hawk Down' is Ridley Scott's nightmarish vision of that fateful day when the mission turned suddenly and hopelessly wrong.  <br/><br/>Based on the novel by Mark Bowden, `Black Hawk Down' is a technically astonishing look into the savagery and horror of modern day warfare.  Rarely have the resources of filmmaking been used so effectively in conveying the intensity and brutality of life in a combat zone.  It's small wonder that the film received Academy Awards for its extraordinary editing and sound. Using every technical trick at his disposal, Scott has managed to plunge us right into the heart of the action, making us feel every explosion and hear every bullet as it goes whizzing past.  Like the characters, we often find ourselves disoriented by the confusion of the scene, yet Scott also manages to keep the action geographically coherent most of the time.  This he does by providing aerial views of the scene that let us know where the men are in relation to their surroundings.<br/><br/>What Scott is not able to do quite so well is to keep the characters themselves sufficiently differentiated to make them matter as much to the viewer as they probably should.  We tend to lose the men in the mass of confusion, with each character looking pretty much like the next and being afforded very little opportunity to step to the forefront of  this massive canvas and distinguish himself.  In all fairness to the filmmakers here, one should note that this seems to be a trait peculiarly endemic to war films in general (the fact that combatants are all dressed alike doesn't help this situation much either).  In the last decade or so, special effects artists have come so far in being able to recreate the graphic realism of the battlefield setting that writers no longer feel the need to provide much in the way of characterization to go along with the action scenes.  More and more the fight sequences are being asked to carry these pictures alone. This was the case with the recent `We Were Soldiers' and it is the case here as well.  Perhaps because of the nature of the true-life events being depicted here, Scott felt no need to ease up on the accelerator much in getting his story told.  However, we do feel as if it would be nice to be able to distinguish his characters from one another and to get to know them a bit on a personal level.  In a way, one appreciates the fact that the filmmakers have chosen to feature less well known actors in most of the roles.  That heightens the realism factor since we don't feel as if we are watching movie stars playing the part of common soldiers.  In that respect, the anonymity works well.  Yet, I wonder if using familiar faces might not have helped a bit in allowing us to focus better on the characters as individuals, permitting us to catch our bearings a little more frequently so that we might be better able to distinguish who is who at all times.<br/><br/>
This is not to say that `Black Hawk Down' does not provide a number of emotionally stirring moments throughout, particularly as we see the young men dying heroic deaths.   Even given the minimal dialogue and character development, we do come to understand the sense of camaraderie that drives these brave men to do what they do.<br/><br/>As a result of this imbalance between the dazzling special effects and the wafer-thin characters, `Black Hawk Down' is a great technical triumph but a less-than-great (though still damn good) film overall."

","Nothing short of American war propaganda. Americans are portrayed as like Jesus in the bible, sacrificing themselves to save the world, or so they'd like us to believe.<br/><br/>Somalians are portrayed as barbaric cave-men, who are killed like flies without a worry in the world or fear of any consequences, where as Americans are firstly injured then die a dignified death, thinking of their loved ones and families back home.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe that this movie would have us believe that herds of Somalians would walk into American fire, well after all they are savages aren't they, well at least that's the message conveyed in the movie.<br/><br/>Reality is Americans shot and killed Somalians indiscriminately in 1994. When their lives were in danger they used human shields to protect themselves. Even before the events depicted in this movie, the Americans blew up a building killing numerous Somalians, many of whom were elders from Aidid's group, gathered to try and negotiate a peace deal with the UN.<br/><br/>Facts don't account for much these days, especially when it comes to goading the world into an endless war that only benefits a selected few. Clearly Hollywood is certainly one of these selected few that I speak of."

","I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why ""Black Hawk Down"" is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.  Those who say, in so many words, ""leave your politics at the door"" are the ones who are missing the point of a democratic society--even in something as simple as film criticism, dissent is not a privilege, but a right for all people who disagree with the preset opinions of others.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" is a film that offers up an indistinguishable cast of characters, Army men devoid of personality but all trailed by gold haloes (heavy irony here, as one reviewer mentioned, one soldier is presently in prison for rape), as they carry out a rescue mission that goes awry (although the plot becomes a moot point even before the troops arrive), which turns into the type of loud, exploitative, and soulless bloodbath we've come to expect from the prolific, oh-so-patriotic Jerry Bruckheimer. (At least ""Con Air"" had John Malkovich for comic relief.)<br/><br/>Inking his soul over to the devil, Ridley Scott employs the mandatory, quick-edit style of pretentious music-video directors the world over, and rather than drawing interest into the almost nonexistent story, instead makes the film bomb even harder.  The shameless cliches that are trotted out do nothing to build the characters (the phone call that came one ring too late; the 'kissing of the family picture', etc.), therefore it is impossible to relate to or care about anyone, even more so when they choke out the typical ""Tell my wife and kids..."" line.<br/><br/>On the other side of a particularly one-dimensional, racist ""script"" are the Somalis, who are presented with even less personality than the soldiers--their video game objective is to yell, wave automatic weapons, and act like utter psychopaths.  What better way to establish the Good Guys, eh? Just give the Bad Guys even less personality!  Personality is overrated, anyway--especially when the gory consequences of war are shoved in your face with unflinching horror!  BHD piles on the gore, mostly for dramatic effect, but since the characters are such cliches, it becomes pure shock value...gore for gore's sake.  I've seen better, more justified use of the red stuff in Lucio Fulci films.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Apollo 13,"" this is not a ""successful failure,"" but became a success (financially, that is) by being such a typical exercise in Hollywood sensationalism.  Riding high on the wave of nationalism, revenge, and general intolerance brought about by the 9/11 tragedy, BHD arrived at an opportune time, and gave audiences exactly what they wanted--a sink-your-claws-into-the-armrest propaganda film where the U.S. Army's angelic duty boils down to blowing away foreigners (a testament to this film's racial and nationalistic bias is the fact that 19 American soldiers died in contrast with 1,000 Somalis).  As if this shallow exercise in war pornography couldn't attest to its own ulterior motives, many critics hailed BHD as ""the best war movie ever,"" among other ostentatious remarks, right as the full-speed ""War on Terror"" campaign was gripping this country (makes you think, doesn't it?).  As for myself, I could only raise a skeptical eyebrow at the proceedings, as I pondered U.S. foreign policy, racial stereotypes through the years, and Hollywood's ability to make a mint by ignoring history.  This forum seems divided--as is the case in America right now--between gung-ho 'patriotic' comments and dissidents.  To disparage the flag or this film is unpatriotic--but is it patriotic, then, to accept everything you see and hear without question?  Or is it more patriotic to bask in the jingoistic arrogance of BHD?  If you believe that to be true, then by all means see this movie.  As for everybody else, ""Bowling for Columbine"" will soon be out on video.<br/><br/>1/10"
"Borut_Z","8","15","24","25 April 2004"," Say again... Why is this movie bad?
","In my opinion, this is the best movie about war ever made. It surpasses even such masterpieces as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or Stone's Platoon. Reading comments on this website, I came to conclusion there is no middle way (there are exceptions, of course) with this movie; or you love it or you hate it. Well, I love it. I can't agree with arguments given by people who hated it, furthermore, I can't even understand most of them, which mainly are:<br/><br/>A - Movie is too one-sided. Now, I never saw a war movie where both sides would be equally presented. In Saving Private Ryan we don't get to know Germans. In Platoon we don't get to know Vietcong. In Thin Red Line we don't get to know Japanese etc, etc. In a battle, you take care about yourself and your comrades, not about a person who is shooting at you, whether you will make his children orphans or not. There are complaints that Somalis are presented as angry, blood-thirsty mob. Well, according to the book, they did act semi-suicidal, without any knowledge about combat tactics, so on numerous occasion they ended up shooting their own people. No wonder why number of their casualties was so high.<br/><br/>B - Movie is flag-waving, recruitment ad, pro-war. First, to let you know, I'm NOT an American. Sure, it's patriotic, but what's wrong with that? I always thought patriotism is a value. If someone is confusing patriotism with nationalism, that's his problem. Some say it didn't address bigger picture, why Americans went in Somalia in the first place. But BHD didn't have these ambitions. It's about brotherhood in arms, not political thriller about US foreign policy. Like Bowden stated in his book: ""Soldiers cannot concern themselves with the decisions that bring them to a fight. They trust their leaders not to risk their lives for too little. Once the battle is joined, they fight to survive, to kill before they are killed."" It seems some people refuse to realize the movie is telling a story of America's elite soldiers in that particular event, from their point of view. However, there is a subtle message about uselessness of US engagement in Somalia, it's just not in a form of some angry speech, given by a bitter soldier. I also don't understand how this movie is pro-war. Don't know about you, but I wouldn't put images of Rangers being blown to pieces in a recruitment ad if I would be making one.<br/><br/>C - Poor character development. Now, I can partly agree with this statement, but it's necessary to point out, movie isn't a character study. Sure, Hartnett has a leading role which should be more developed, but movie is more focused on course of battle in Mog as such, on showing a perspective of many involved, so there really isn't much room for detailed personal portrait. Some say, it's hard to identify with characters when we know so little about them. In this movie, this doesn't seem to be the case. I found BHD very emotional movie.  Acting is very good, facial expressions and acts of soldiers showed us anxiety, fear, courage, sacrifice, grief etc. For many, Eric Bana as Hoot was too Rambo-type, but his character is based on real-life Delta who really was a tough guy (read the book). The music was also excellent to spur on emotions.<br/><br/>Of course, movie isn't perfect, but show me the one which is. US soldiers are just too nice, you-gotta-love-them types, dialogue is poor. But apart from that, it's visually perfect, as realistic as it gets, pure chaos and confusion, just like war really is. Most of the time it's like documentary. Sometimes images say more than a thousand words. Here, they say more than enough."
"bob the moo","Null","47","89","18 January 2004"," As an intense war movie it really works. But as a true story it is jingoistic and about as selfless and giving as masturbation
","In Somalia, warlord Farah Aideed controls the people and uses hunger as a weapon by stopping UN food supplies reaching his people.  The US military tries to usurp the rule of Aideed but, after 6 weeks, he is still in power and the US demands faster action.  When the military are informed of the location of two of Aideed's top men a mission is put together to catch them. However, when one of the Black Hawk helicopters is hit and crashes, several soldiers are left behind enemy lines, starting a battle for survival and rescue against the hordes of armed Somalis.<br/><br/>While most reviews seem to be of one extreme or the other, I think it is important to try and look at the film in the two ways that it should have existed and weight it up on that basis.  First of all, as a war movie there is very little wrong with it.  It is realistic and powerful and you do leave with the feeling of having been in a battle.  The lack of characters is not a major problem as all is required that we know is that these are soldiers - not what family they have or what they are like as people.  However this film would have been much better if it had been totally fictional and had existed just as a flag waving tale to American bravery and dedication to the fight.<br/><br/>Sadly this is not a fiction al story, it is based on a true story and it is a lesser film because of what it chooses to omit or spin in it's telling. Like I said, this was a very good film if you want a reasonably intense depiction of being in a battle, however it should have been an anti-war film, such were the lessons to be taken from the events of October 1993. However, because an antiwar film will never sell in post-11/9 America, the film cannot go down that road.  While it is generally regarded that the US attempt to launch an attack in this way was foolish and that the result was a `fiasco' none of that is shown here.  There is no room for comment on the wisdom of the action when there's cheering to be done.  In fact at one point one of the characters even explains the events by just saying `sh*t happens'.<br/><br/>This is just one example of how blindly patriotic this film is.  Does this take away from the impact of the film - no. Does it take away from how good a film it is - yes, and it should.  The film never stops shouting about how heroic and upright the US soldiers are and, in fairness, those involved deserve respect.  However the film ignores the fact that a significant number of those involved in the rescue and the fighting were actually Malaysian (who here are limited to serving glasses of water to the returning US soldiers.  Given that the film lacks characters it would have been no problem to replace white US faces with Malaysian ones (they all end up covered in dirt and blood anyway!).  However, to do that would have required the film to suggest that the US needs external help to bail it out - again not an idea that an audience would take.<br/><br/>While the film has no characters it is not a major problem, although I would have liked the US soldiers to at least not be all angels!  The cast were mostly good despite not really ever having to act, I was surprised how many well known faces were involved - Bana, Harnett, McGregor, Sizemore, Fincher, Sheppard, Bloom, Piven and Coates to name a few.  However there are no Somali characters to speak of (in fact - no Somalis at all! The extras were from other nations despite not looking anything like the people of that region).  The film early on has Harnett's character express respect and interest in the Somali people, but the film doesn't.  There is no back story about the country and there is nothing to suggest that this country is anything other than armed gangs of angry black people who are killing the good soldiers.  An antiwar film shouldn't really paint one side good and the other bad in a situation like this, and that was the point I understood the film wasn't trying to be antiwar - it was pro-US.<br/><br/>It is a shame that the film spares no thought for these people - yes they killed the US soldiers, but the US killed over 1000 of them during the rescue mission.  There's nothing wrong with the film bigging up the US soldiers, but to just totally ignore this fact other than a caption at the end is basic.  The caption may as well have read - `1000 of them died too but they weren't American so f**k them.'  The film's core is the dramatic and violent rescue mission and I can forgive them making it an `all-US' operation given the fact that it is an US film.  However the film made a conscious choice to remove everything about the story that would be critical (which is a lot) of the US, for this reason it suffered a lot - a film that criticises politics and the whole idea of war does not have to do the same for the soldiers.  These men deserve respect no matter how they got there - but the film wrongly carries this respect over to the whole concept and situation. This was a mistake.<br/><br/>I have gone on longer about the bad stuff than the good, so let me make it clear: this is a very good film if you are looking for a war film that is dramatic and very realistic.  Scott is a good director and he does very well to make the audience feel like they are in the midst of a battle.  I didn't want it to push an antiwar agenda but I didn't expect it to be as flagwavingly naive as this!  Of course it did well - the audience wanted a film that supports the military, it's just a shame that they didn't just make up a story rather than taking a real one and doing it so badly. There are other people in the world and they are still people regardless of race or beliefs - that this film fails to take that into account is a major failing no matter how exciting or realistic it is."

I had seen Saving Private Ryan and I was shook up by that movie but I rationalized well, that was a Great War...past...out of sight, out of mind...not real.<br/><br/>But when I saw Black Hawk Down I thought, wow so this is what war is really like. Brothers in arms, dying in each others arms.

If I was the downed pilot I cannot think of the emotions I would have felt if these two guys came to stand by me and possibly die with me.<br/><br/>To me the question being raised by this movie is not ""Do we avoid situations like this in the future?"" but ""How do we do it right next time?"".

Scott handles both the drama and action with flair and skill and the result is an epic-feeling movie which, following on from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, shows you what war is really all about. Forget the long-gone days of cinema where soldiers never got dirty and war was glamourised to the extreme; this is a film that puts you right into the thick of the action, making you feel like you're actually taking part in the battle. The realism is thick and at the end of the film you feel exhausted so you know the work has paid off.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is excellent, with fine action choreography and some great camera angles that are up close and personal. The various CGI effects are used to heighten the realism of the drama, but the main thing is that you never feel like you're watching CGI, so they are effective in the utmost. The film is bleak, violent and also extremely gory in places, so only strong stomachs need apply. A cast loaded with faces fill out their roles respectively and make you feel for the various characters ‚Äì in particular William Fichter, Jason Isaacs, Kim Coates, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner give fine performances, as well as the more famous leads.

","Black Hawk Down, co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott, is based on a true story taking place in Somalia, Mogadishu in the early '90s. Elite forces were sent there to participate in a UN peacekeeping action and the task was to abduct two of Farrah Aidids, a Somalian warlord, lieutenants. But it proves more difficult than they previously had thought after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and in turn led to a fiasco, a failure that has devastating consequences. Starring as Eversmann is the well-known actor Josh Hartnett, from Lucky Number Slevin. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) plays Danny, a tough and fearless sergeant, and as the comic relief is Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting).<br/><br/>The actual script is based from a book by Mark Bowden, a soldier who wrote it while he was in Somalia and it explains partly of why we get to see the U.S. point of view, which to me tend to be somewhat patriotic in these cases. When the bullets whiz past helmets, and the grenades explodes in the battlefield, you feel very much that you are there without getting hit. Elite units stood side by side when hell broke loose, and together achieve their goal - to overthrow the dictator. The idea to leave someone on the battlefield did not exist, it was one for all - all for one.<br/><br/>From a realistic way the film works very well, like when guts and body parts fly off from bodies, but I am slightly hesitant about the way Somalis was portrayed. Were they really a faceless evil enemy through and through? I got the impression that Somalia was ruled by criminals, drug addicts, drug dealers and murderers. In one scene the Somalis attacks one of the helicopters and they looked like a horde of ants looking for their prey. If it was a Somali film instead, it would probably look quite different compared to this American bias. Sure, all the historical facts is not always easy to get in a reality-based film and I accept that. <br/><br/>Some scenes are very daring and are nicely assembled. The color has a mostly somber gray tone, and the barren, cold realism that the film shows is great executed. The war ""only"" lasted in hellish 15 hours resulting in 18 dead and 73 injured U.S. soldiers and hundreds of dead Somalis."

Maybe if I had a joystick I would have liked this movie.<br/><br/>So we are led to believe that the US troops were there to carry out a mission in good faith? If you took time to read about the background about what REALLY happened, you will feel disgusted after having watched 'Black Hawk Down'. This movie was partially sponsored by Pentagon. Doesn't that tell you something? As a matter of fact, Pentagon dictated that the name of Ewan McGregor's role (the coffee-drinking John Stebbins) should be changed to 'John Grimes', because he in real life is serving a 30-years sentence for raping a 12-year old.

Ordinary Somalis began to look to the warlords for protection from what they saw as unprovoked American attacks.<br/><br/>No distinction is made between the Somalis caught up in the fighting and the combatants. No accurate figures exist for the number of Somalis killed during the fighting although the movie estimate is 1,000. It is unlikely that all of this number were Somali militiamen. Many ordinary Somalis were caught up in the streetfighting, pinned down and killed by fire from both sides. No records were kept at the time but aid agency estimates put the number of Somali civilian dead and wounded as high as 3,000. <br/><br/>While ""Blackhawk Down"" is meant to be a tribute to the courage of the US soldiers who fought and died in the 1st Battle of Mogadishu, it is also guilty of lazy racism and a selective, revisionist view of events. The Pakistani UN forces (who provided rescue vehicles and troops for American casualties) are depicted as surly and uncooperative in the movie. Pakistani UN forces were not afraid of a fight in Mogadishu and had lost 24 men killed in a single action against Somali militiamen before the American raid was launched. The Malaysian UN element is not mentioned, despite providing additional rescue vehicles and troops for the evacuation of US casualties. <br/><br/>IMDb is perhaps the wrong place to make political statements, but ""Blackhawk Down"" is little more than a gung-ho propaganda film in the tradition of such dire revisionism as John Wayne's ""The Green Berets"". It can be viewed as a gritty and realistic depiction of urban combat against incredible odds. However, it is also guilty of concentrating solely on the experiences of US troops without explaining why they were there. <br/><br/>""Blackhawk Down"" relies on the biased (after 4 US journalists were killed in riots in Mogadishu) American media perspective of events in Somalia far too much. Its one concession to reality is the admission that the ""Gothic Serpent"" raid should never have been launched. <br/><br/>Jerry Bruckheimer is a great producer and Ridley Scott is a fine director but ""Blackhawk Down"" is little more than a skewed snapshot of a greater tragedy. It is one of the few war films that I wish I had never seen."

","If you like war action films, this one is for you! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia.<br/><br/>Frankly, it was too much action for me, but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes. This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes. After awhile you want to just say, ""Enough already! Let's take a break! <br/><br/>I don't know how much of this story is true. When they say, ""based on a true story"" that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes. However, reports are that it is pretty accurate. Regardless, the film has some good things going for it.<br/><br/>First of all there is the military credo:: ""Never leave anyone behind."" That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter (named Black Hawk) goes ""down.""<br/><br/>With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities, you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes. That also means you get some gruesome scenes, too. This film is very bloody. It's intense and visually unique, I think, for a war film. Speaking of that, with director Ridley Scott, you get stylish visuals: lots of them. In this film, you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors, great lighting and great facial closeups. The sound also is excellent with bullets ""flying out"" of all the surround speakers.<br/><br/>In the end, a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military."

","Blackhawk Down exploits the tragic events of Somalia for use as a platform to unleash some of the best extended fighting scenes of any war movie. The scenes, at times incredibly life-like, are shot with outrageous depth and scale; missiles seem to come right out at you from the background, shots of helicopters feel so close you almost feel you're there, inside, and of course, a whole lot of bloody injuries, gunshot wounds, and lost limbs to bring it all home.<br/><br/>The reasons for why the US found itself there are presented in terse fashion, the historical component being largely set up in the opening few minutes of the film, including on-screen comments explaining the situation leading up to the loss of American lives.  After this point though, what we get is a highly stylized ""get to know the characters"" session, with a lot of male bonding and competitive angst between Army Rangers and Delta Force team members.  After thirty or fourty minutes, I feared the worst for ""Blackhawk Down"", it was looking like, despite Ridley Scott's involvement, it might seriously fall victim to the typical Bruckheimer shlock element seen in Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, etc.  I just didn't need the fluff, the male bonding-Top Gun testosterone crap.  What would have been good is a serious treatment of the political blunders and foreign policy conundrum that led up to the events.  But then, just when I let out a sigh, the fighting scenes kicked in and, almost as if the makers of BlackHawk Down knew it was precisely the right time to shift gears, I get swept up in the action.  If you've seen Private Ryan, you have some idea of what level of graphic violence Blackhawk down presents.  This film banks on its audience desiring action over answers, death of documentary, and it delivers.  Scott's direction, as usual, is fantastic.  But again, this is a film that serves as a catalyst for a war movie, the sad truth is that it really didn't matter what the historical reasons are that created the context for Blackhawk Down. Blackhawk down's war scenes could have been from any of a number of wars past and present.  Obviously, it does bring back into focus the tragedy that befell our American troops in Somalia a decade ago.  And the timing, of course, couldn't have been better.  But we really don't learn much about the real behind the scenes story of what went on back in DC, and the aftermath of the tragedy.  Now that I've seen the bloody but stylized battles of ""Blackhawk Down"", I'm hoping to see a quality documentary on this tragedy."

","Despite many reviews attesting to the greatness of this film and many awards and nominations it has and will receive, this movie is shallow, tawdry, Hollywood trash that profiteers off the lives of 19 American soldiers and over a thousand dead Somalians. It is no more an anti-war movie than Gladiator is an anti-Gladiator movie. I will hand it to Ridley Scott (who is English, if that matters) he has found a way to turn violence and death into Hollywood gold. He is an excellent director, and here he steals from Kurosawa's playbook using maps, diagrams, and aerials to keep the troop positions coherent, while at the same time showing the bloody chaos of war. I suspect this film will make a lot of money and will rake in the Oscars, which is sad. Aside from it's direction, it has little value. The writing and acting are poor, the film is riddled with cliches, out of place comic relief, and attempts at subtlety that beat you over the head. The subject matter has been covered much better in other films. I suggest the John Sayles film 'Men With Guns' for a better depiction of the perpetuation of violence in the third world. What bothered me most was the phony sincerity with which the film depicts death and war. Unless you enjoy seeing people get killed there is little entertainment. The film begins with a quote from Plato, which, contains more truth and depth than the entire film that follows it."

","This movie is a factually based, and done in a way of a real life documentary.  My friend Tony told me about the book, and its pretty close to the movie.    There is a mention(very lightly) about not having heavy armor, from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN, and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls, he would have lost the election if it was called right away.  I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again, when they called for the US to help out a country, and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out.  This movie shows why.  It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war/horror movie.  We see what army life is about, how well trained the special forces are, and the confusion, and horror of war.  The film is one constant feel of fear.  It was accurate, but according to Tony left  some of the grimmer parts out.  Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names, a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields, and spotters.  You really feel bad for the men, and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive."
"slavabro","10","17","30","19 January 2002"," This is not a movie to be entertained by
","From reading the comments by others who have posted here it seems that people were actually ENTERTAINED by this film?  Correct me if I am wrong but to me that seems rather sick.  This movie was a lesson.  It was meant to tell the story of the brave men who fought and died in the third world hole of a town in Somalia.  Anyone who calls this film racist, or that it makes the somali's look like savages is ignorant of the facts and uneducated as to the situation in Somalia in 1993.  The reason there was only one black ranger, was because Kurth and one other who did not figure into the story as well, were the ONLY black men who were members of Task Force Ranger.  The percentage of blacks who apply to Ranger School is very small, this is not because of any race thing,  many blacks serve in the combat arms, and other more specialized groups such as the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>
Yes this movie was well done, but to sit there and talk about how it was wonderfully done and exciting and other BS like that is sickening.  This is also upsetting that something that happened so recently in history can be so quickly forgotten, or called BORING and that the viewer was checking their watch halfway through... Disgusting and arrogant.<br/><br/>You don't have to like this film, but do not insult the memories of those men by speaking as if this movie was made for your entertainment."

","Films like this are more useful than gung-ho capers like ""Behind Enemy Lines."" They help audiences understand and sympathize with the actual experiences of combat troops, instead of trivializing them into entertainments. Although the American mission in Somalia was humanitarian, the movie avoids speechmaking and sloganeering, and at one point, discussing why soldiers risk their lives in situations like this, a veteran says, ""It's about the men next to you. That's all it is.""<br/><br/>The movie is based on an actual event the happened in Somalia. This shows what happened to the American soldiers that fought to help a country in need."
"chains01","9","8","12","14 May 2010"," Black Hawk Down
","In October of 1993, in an effort to secure the Somali town of Mogadishu, Task Force Ranger, comprised of Delta Force soldiers and Rangers, are sent in for a mission that is supposed to last no more than half an hour. But when two Black Hawk helicopters are downed by insurgents with rocket launchers many of the members of Task Force Ranger are left stranded in the city. The ensuing battle lasts for 18 hours.<br/><br/>The Battle of Magadishu (also known as The Battle of the Black Sea, Black Hawk Down, and for the Somali's The Day of the Rangers) was both a disaster and a success depending on who you talk to. It was a success in that when all was said and done Task Force Ranger accomplished their main objectives. At the same time, it was a disaster because originally the mission was only supposed to take 30 minutes, but in the end lasted 18 hours and cost the lives of 19 American soldiers and somewhere in the range of 500-2000 Somali's. How do you adapt an 18 hour battle into a two and a half hour movie? Very carefully, and had the movie been placed in a less capable director's hands than Ridley Scott's (Alien, Gladiator) this movie could very well have been a disaster. Ridley Scott, though, along with first time screenwriter Ken Nolan, do their best to capture the battle in a truly authentic light, and they do an amazing job. From what I hear (I have a lot more to learn about the battle) this is possibly the most accurate depiction of a battle ever put to film. I would also argue that it's the best example of modern urban warfare put to film as well.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are amazing as, despite a hugely recognizable cast (something I might just be saying because many of the actors in this movie have become huge since, and weren't as big at the time) there is no vanity amongst the actors. Their lack of vanity only adds to the realism, and also builds up the feeling of brotherhood as they act out the battle in the field.<br/><br/>All in all, if there was going to be an argument against this film it would really only be the fact that there's not much character development. In the end, though, it's not as much about the characters as it is about the units. It's not as much about the battle as it is a reminder that there are still soldiers that carry the DNA of bravery and brotherhood that we saw in the World War II elite. And it's not so much about Somalia as it is about the war fronts we fight on throughout the world whether in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely give it a shot.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

","while i was watching black hawk down, i was thinking that the movie was very pretty, very pleasant to watch. afterwords, though, i'm feeling a bit dissatisfied. i remember as we were leaving the theatre my friend was crying and that made me angry because i felt as though she was crying for the wrong reasons. the movie did have a strong emotional effect, but i believe it was very selfish. there were 19 american soldiers who died, and that is terrible. but a thousand somalians died. the movie listed all of the americans who died, and glorified their efforts to do...well... something. but what about the somalians? some died with no memory of them whatsoever. and what did the soldiers die for? after the movie, the reason wasn't really any clearer. it reminds me of sept. 11th, because so many people have an emotional reaction, but so few really know why or how or what. they just see death and feel sad. but there is such thing as injustice, and fault, and cause. this movie did a wonderful job of portraying the confusion of war. perhaps the fact that i don't really know what it was all about was the point, the point maybe being that war is pointless, meaningless. but i still will feel dissatisfied. the film should have tried harder to educate in my opinion."
"Joxerlives","10","9","14","9 December 2012"," One of the greatest war movies of all time!
","And one that should be shown to every cadet at Sandhurst/West Point.<br/><br/>Hard to know where to begin in praising this excellent film. The direction is terrific, the action sequences mind-blowing, the characterisations and acting very good, brilliant music, the list goes on. The gore is graphic yet never gratuitous. It is amazingly realistic, you really feel that you are in the heat of a genuine battle, right down to people being deafened by their own gunfire which always happens in real life but which I've never seen on screen before. No other film has ever captured the confusion and chaos of combat, the convoy getting lost because of the delay between the helicopters giving the directions and the convoy receiving them was the fatal flaw of the operation. The part where the helicopter commander begs the convoy to slow down so he can relay directions correctly whilst Colonel McKnight tells them they can't slow down because they're getting slaughtered is just the sort of thing you'd expect in real life. And the lesson here? Keep it simple! It's a thrill ride yet at the same time it's a thoughtful film, this isn't an exercise in US imperialism, the US (and UN's) intervention in Somalia must rate as one of the most altruistic and unselfish actions of all time, with the Cold War over Somalia was of no strategic importance to anyone and the military intervention purely humanitarian. <br/><br/>One thing that stands out is that this is perhaps the greatest example of the compromises inherent in film-making. Many of the characters are combined with other real life figures but otherwise you simply wouldn't be able to keep track of who was who, it would be a hundred stories in one. In real life everyone had shaven heads and wore the same headgear without their names on it but you had to have that for the audience to be able to recognise everyone. The film-makes pull off the remarkable feat of changing facts to aid the story-telling but keeping the integrity of the real events intact.<br/><br/>Favourite scene? The bit where Ranger Jamie Smith is badly wounded and the medic tells HQ that unless he gets evacuated immediately he's going to die. And General Garrison makes the decision that they've already had 2 choppers shot down and if they try a rescue they'll have a third and more casualties to deal with. His decision seals Smith's fate but you get the idea that it's unquestionably the right one. So often in films the top brass is portrayed as cold and unfeeling but here you realise why a General earns his pay<br/><br/>All told this is the war movie that sets the bar for all others."

"Quinoa1984","9","10","16","21 January 2002"," One of Scott's best films, but not quite on my top 10 list for 2001
","Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind) and Black Hawk Down, a war picture set in Somalia, is another prime example of his knack. Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much (or dare I say haven't seen at all) which is not going directly into the battle scenes, but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action. It is a daring move by Scott.<br/><br/>In ""Down"", a somewhat large group of soldiers are sent to the heart (or mindless brain) of Somalia to capture 2 lieutenants in regard to a civil war going on in the country that has taken 300,000 lives (""it's not war, it's genocide"" comments the major general played by Sam Shepard). At first notice it seems like they can get in and out of the mission in a few hours...but then everything goes wrong. The Somalians start a near unstoppable attack on the U.S. soldiers, shooting as many as they can and sneaking out from roofs and sides like cockroaches. It becomes a chaotic day and night for the soldiers as they try to stay alive while waiting for extra troops to come in to rescue them that could take time to get there.<br/><br/>Outside of the couple of flaws in the film (at the end it tells that 18 U.S. soldiers died in the attack but if you don't keep exact track it will seem more/the cinematography is alright however the editing cuts too much in the action and tension), Black Hawk Down is quite the war picture, one that will be memorable in years to come as the most accurate depiction of what went on with us in Somalia in 1993. Kudos to Scott and the cast; Ewan McGregor gets the highest praise from me if only for giving an amazing American accent. A-"

And this style helps to make that emotions of the cinema go deeper into you.<br/><br/>That wonderful script forms the strong base, in the building up of this classic. To write a screenplay upon a true WAR incident like this one, is no easy job. Well ken Nolan has done it flawlessly. And to make a movie out of it is still harder and uh... Ridely Scott has done an awesome work. The whole complexity of a military raid, involving many different troops and hundreds of soldiers,is told with great clarity (with no confusion) and simplicity. Hats off to that. The background score also worth a mentioning- it is in some unknown language (somalian?) but still sounds meaningful! The emotion, the pain, the uncertainty, the fear everything connected with a war finds a place in the movie. The emotional side to the story is also worked up quiet nicely.<br/><br/>By the end, while the troops are shown retrieving, you see an old man crossing the roads, holding a dead kid in his hands. There is no emotion to be seen in his face. You hear a music at the background. And with the single scene you are convinced about the brutality of a war. This single scene discloses the greatness of the cinema,reveals the talents of a film maker and greatness of an art form."

Before going to the movie, I knew that it was about war but maybe I expected to also see something intelligent and a human side to it instead of simply people shooting.  All I have to say is that I can't understand why someone would enjoy this movie.  If you tasted what war is in your life, you would hate the movie, find it sick & spit in on it.  From the beginning of the movie until the end, all you hear and see are weapons being shot and people getting killed like some video game.  There's not 1 minute in it where there isn't violence.  It's as if the point of the director is: shoot & kill as much as you can!!  I didn't find it entertaining and after a while I didn't care who was dying anymore, the whole time I was shaking my head thinking to myself that we humans are the most pathetic & sick creatures on earth.   The only refreshing thing about the movie is seeing a couple of DOGS and a DONKEY.  It reminded me the true value of life & that at least the animals do know how to appreciate it.  Watching people kill each others each second shouldn't be entertaining, if you had lost some of your loved ones in a war, you would DEFINITELY NOT FIND THIS MOVIE ENTERTAINING, YOU WOULD FIND IT SICK, no matter what the political reason is!  I really hope that they stop promoting war, there's another way to deal with problems.  Take out the weapons and everyone would be forced to sit down and talk.  Believe it or not, most of the weapons of those terrorists in the movie were actually BOUGHT from countries including the USA.  How pathetic is that?  Anyways, I'm not reviewing the movie about it's technical part and how well it's done, some people are even saying it could win oscars, but to me this movie is sick & not watchable unless you enjoy seeing us humans killing each others.  You may not agree with my view but I hope that you will at least understand."
"cashbacher","10","4","5","19 January 2019"," This movie is a history lesson contained within a war movie.
","While this is a tense and realistic war movie with a great deal of action and suspense, it also demonstrates that military valor is of little value when there is political ignorance and arrogance. The backdrop is the U. S. military operation in Somalia in the early nineties. The government of Somalia had collapsed, and the country degenerated into zones controlled by various warlords and civil war. They all used intimidation and starvation to tighten their hold on power and the U. S. led an operation to try to end the civil war and stop the mass starvation.
It was a mission that began with the best of intentions yet was based on a lack of understanding of the situation in the country. In many ways, it was based on the misbegotten belief that the Somali people would be grateful, and the Americans and UN personnel would be hailed as benevolent heroes. When there was some pushback, the U. S. command came up with a foolish and arrogant plan to kidnap General Aideed in the capital city of Mogadishu.
This movie is a well-done depiction of that raid, from the initial arrogance of the American troops to the disaster that followed, where the American soldiers demonstrated incredible valor and sacrifice. The Americans believed that it would be so quick and easy that some didn't even bother to don their body armor or fill their canteens. Furthermore, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin turned down the request of the U. S. military for armored vehicles including tanks, fact not well explained.
As battles go, it was a victory for the American forces, 18 American soldiers were killed while over 1,000 Somalis died in the fight. Yet, it was a defeat, demonstrating that even people starving in a civil war will take up arms against an invasion force and leading to the American withdrawal. This movie is a history lesson contained within a war movie."

","I didn't really had any expectations for this flick to begin with, I merely went because I loved some of Scott's earlier features like Alien and Blade Runner. Black hawk Down wasn't nearly as bad I expected it to be... it was much, much worse! As a modern action film it worked descent enough, I guess. I must admit though that i'm getting really tired of computer generated fx - unless it's used to express something new (like in Cronenbergs eXistenZ) it just ruins the action and make things dull. Anyway, the action part was quite well made.<br/><br/>This is what made me disgusted and angry: this movie is described by the director as a documentary-style war movie, that doesn't take sides and just show the truth of what war really is like. Ridley is either the biggest liar alive or simply unaware of what signals the movie is really sending out to it's viewers. It's a flag-waving morale-booster/recruiting film for the American public. It tells us that all American involvement in foreign affairs is good and honest, and that being a soldier equals being a hero. The Somalies are portrayed in a very one-dimensional, and in a way racist, way. The movie was partly funded by the pentagon so i'm sure it doesn't take sides¬Ö I'm not saying that patriotism is a bad thing or that America is a bad country (it's in many respects a great one), but i'm positively sure that this movie is not the movie that should unite Americans after 11 September. It will only add to the already dominant American view that ""we are the best & we're always right"" that I think is very destructive (both for America & the World). <br/><br/>So if you're really want some flag-waving see American Beauty again and rediscover the America we all love. If war movies are your genre, I recommend Three Kings, a fun and human third world-war movie that shows a more complex view on modern warfare and humanity in general.<br/><br/>
But avoid Black Hawk Down by any means necessary. Ridley Scott - you're out of my good-book."
"tieman64","Null","18","34","18 September 2008"," War porn in the guise of brotherly honour
","The Enlightenment introduced a new version of honour, based on the idea of war as a rule-bound, principled undertaking. This illusion was somewhat shattered in WW1, when millions were mowed down on the mechanised killing fields. It quickly became clear that national honour was nothing more than a deceptive veneer over organised bloodshed. As such, Hollywood's first few war films were largely pacifist.<br/><br/>Then came the so called Good War. In 1942 ""Sergeant York"" was released, a filmed biography of the Tennessee rifleman who by killing 23 Germans became the most decorated American soldier in history. The film recast WW1 as a reasonable national enterprise, not a deranged slaughterhouse. ""York"" can be viewed as the first movie to foster public support for America's entry into World War II by dramatising a new, democratised ideal of honour.<br/><br/>While Democracy was seen to be right and good, war itself was believed to be morally wrong, its causes connected with the aggressiveness natural to authoritarian regimes. Thus, over time, the idea took root that the only just war was a war in defence of democracy. This became the formula for almost all war movies made between 1942 and 1945. Under the guidance of the War Office, most of these films played up the skill and heroism of the ordinary GI, and played down the carnage of battle. This formula lasted into the post-war era because it was effective at promoting the democratic ideal of honour. Like its predecessors, this ideal posits a link between virtue and victory. Nevermind that the ""enemy"" fights as valiantly as ""you"" or that these wars are all fought for old fashioned colonialist reasons. No, on the level of myth it's deemed important to show the ""sons of democracy"" fighting more valiantly than the Other. In 1949 Hollywood released about eight war films that did just this.<br/><br/>In the 1950s we had a few anti war films (""Pork Chop Hill"", ""Paths of Glory"" etc""), most of which challenged notions of ""sacrifice"", ""nobility"" and even ""free choice"". Specious notions of ""honor"" now could no longer be rationalised. Henceforth soldiers no longer died for country, they died for their comrades. They acted out of loyalty and fear of dishonouring the unit. <br/><br/>The 1960s and 1970s saw the elimination of virtually all film industry controls over violent content in movies. Along with the fall of the Hays Office, this development made it possible to depict combat more graphically than ever before. The technical challenge of rendering the ultimate action sequence became an obsession.<br/><br/>Yet the 1970s also saw a growing realisation that Vietnam veterans were taking heat. So along with the challenge of making war look gorier came the challenge of making vets look nobler. The two goals were reconciled by amplifying violence and reducing war to nothing larger than the ethos of buddies helping buddies (ie- Bands of Brothers).<br/><br/>This ethos now dominates almost all war movies, with rare exceptions. If American war films are wandering back into dangerous, propagandistic and gore-glorifying territory, it is not because they're getting good at simulating the spectacle of combat. It's because, in an effort to avoid political controversy - apoliticism itself being a firm political stance which engenders only more violence - they offer underdeveloped plots and characters to serve an outdated and dysfunctional definition of honour. <br/><br/>Meanwhile ""Black Hawk Down"", one of Ridley Scott's dumbest film, is content to again rehash your typical fascist tale of victimised, out-gunned white men battling heroically, gloriously, against a savage horde. A remake of ""Private Ryan"" and ""Zulu"", Scott updates the White Man's Burden, everyman grunts subjecting themselves to toil in order to save the savage from himself. Unsurprisingly, Scott's Somali victims speak only to condemn themselves, displaying no emotions other than greed and the lust for blood. Their appearances are accompanied by sinister Arab techno, while the US forces are trailed by violins, oboes and vocals inspired by Enya. White troops display horrific wounds and clutch family photos, Somalis drop like flies, dispensable and unmourned.<br/><br/>Of course the film is a mighty misrepresentation of what happened in Somalia. In 1992, George Bush senior announced that America had come to do ""God's work"" in Somalia. Unfortunately, in Pentagon speak, ""God's Work"" means bombing nations to hell, Washington arming clan chiefs and warlords in a deliberate attempt to destabilise the region (largely for Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips). The US has been doing this for a long time, backing the brutal Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1978 and pitting him against Ethiopia, before arming Ethiopia and using it as a proxy force against Somalia. Through the IMF, the US loaned over three million dollars to both sides, most of which went to arms and led to untold amounts of bloodshed. The West, of course, has a history of backing puppet dictators and then backing their dictator's enemies when these puppet's get too big for their boots (eg -Saddam Hussein pitted against Iran and Kuwait armed against Saddam, before Saddam was taken down directly by the US). <br/><br/>With no conflicts to justify their presence in the area, the US then seized upon the buzzwords ""Somalian pirates"" (the pirates are directly caused by Western mega-corps dumping toxins and destroying local fishery populations) and ""war on terror"" as an excuse to intensify their overt/covert actions in the region. Through these buzzwords, the US - while the UN unconscionably stands by - justified their support of yet more warlords, pitting them against the democratically elected Islamic Courts Union, an organisation which has brought some level of peace, unity, stability and some semblance of nationhood to Somalia.<br/><br/>But of course the West doesn't want this. 30 per cent of America's oil will come from Africa over the next ten years. American hegemony depends on Africa remaining unstable and run by puppets willing to prevent the nationalising of minerals, resources or crack down on law-dodging mega-corps.<br/><br/>2/10 - Sexy evil."

","The timing of the release of this movie, and the content of this movie can only be described as fuel for the ever-growing propaganda machine of America. The movie portrays American marines, who were willing to kill as many Somalians and people they deemed inferior to them, so long as their already dead American comrades could get a proper burial on American soil, a completely stupid act, with no heroism whatsoever. This movie shows how the American Army will always try and police regions of territory, they simply don't understand, and will give no breathing room to any nation."

","Black Hawk Down comes, at what seems to me, to be a crucial time in the development of American Democracy. As a nation we have been through a great deal over the past five months. In many ways we have passed through this time with high marks. We have not interred innocent Muslims, Afghanis, Saudis, as was the response in 1942 to the ""parallel"" events at Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center. We have not yet (except for Afghanistan) bombed anyone back to the Stone Age.  For that, I am a grateful Human.<br/><br/>The film Black Hawk Down makes me worry though, that any sense of reasonableness may last. Despite the film craftsmanship of Ridley Scott, this is a very flawed war film philosophically. It is jingoism at a time when this nation and its citizen's need is thoughtful reflection.<br/><br/>
I came away from this film deeply disturbed by its need to resort to ""war film clich√©s."" That there is only one ""token"" Afro American US soldier, and at the same time the Somalis are portrayed as nothing but a swarm of angry bees is inexcusable. See The Thin Red Line to see a thoughtful portrayal of enemy.  The one character we get even a minute amount of information on is obviously the first casualty. The speech at the end about ""Why we do this"" (soldiers fighting battles) is nothing but an echo of the Tom Hanks' speech at the end of the ""anti-war"" film, Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>
Mr. Scott is not just any filmmaker. His gratuitously violent Gladiator won an academy award (sic). Like Mr. Spielberg, who has nothing but room to take chances to make the World a better place, only communicate to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>I've read an IMDb user's comment, ""I was there - where were you?"" My answer, I wasn't there thankfully. For a more honest version of what went on in Mogadishu, I suggest the PBS's (yes, the petroleum broadcasting network's) Frontline report, which was much more disturbing than this Gollywood version of ""War is Hell."""
"derwunderbaremandarin","1","31","66","16 January 2011"," Kicking ass for a good cause - no kidding
","This movie is fascinating and interesting for two reasons. It is fascinating because it is a 100% pro-war, pro-American propaganda movie in the style of Dr. Goebbels, and it is interesting because it is obvious that that kind of bold propaganda still finds an audience.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story of some American soldiers who are trying ""to kick some ass"" in Mogadishu - for a good cause as the movie tells us, leaving an uninformed audience with a wrong premise and doing an excellent propaganda job for all those who believe in what they are being told. On top of that, the intro tells us, that it all is based on a true story. False premises and alleged authenticity are mixed into a dangerous cocktail, typical for propaganda.<br/><br/>Then, the movie develops into a bold good-guys-against-bad-guys-story. All the American soldiers are shown as good people, they all have hobbies, play chess, basketball or draw children's books (no kidding). They make jokes and laugh, they are happy, good people who happen to be in the army because they want to fight a war for the good. The bad black guys all look gloomy, pray to Allah and shoot their machine guns for fun. The do not smile unless they do something nasty. When the Americans move out, rock music is played in the background. When we see the ""enemy"", you can hear some weird Arab music or threatening noises.<br/><br/>And so on. The reason for why the Americans actually are there is never questioned. They are there, apparently for shooting the bad guys in order to teach them that shooting is bad. Interesting.<br/><br/>Some reviewers claim that this is a good war movie. Well, there are two kinds of war movies: pro-war movies and anti-war movies. This is a pro-war movie. It shows glossy, beautiful fighting scenes with rock music in the background. It does not show what war does to the people. It does not show mushed heads, brains, bones, pus and horror. It shows fair, chivalrous and over all heroic American soldiers who remain fair no matter how unfair the enemy might be. It shows a clean war, where not too many civilians are hurt and where the US Army only hits those who ""deserve"" it.<br/><br/>I despise movies that propagate war like this one does. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a prime example of how the US film industry creates bold propaganda in a time when the US government needs it. It is a shame that a director like Ridley Scott does such stuff. And now I have to correct myself: it is not propaganda √† la Goebbels, because even the propaganda made by the Nazis was a great deal more subtle than this homage to American imperialism.<br/><br/>If you want a good anti-war movie, pick ""Das Boot"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"". Even ""Platoon"" shows you more of the cruelty of war. This movie shows nothing of it, on the contrary. It should be banned for lying so hard about such serious issues. A shame."
"LuxuryJesper","8","6","9","6 September 2019"," Why I think Black Hawk Down is the best war movie ever made
","This movie isn't trying to glamorize anything. Not about war, and not about ""Being an American, stand together, fight for and defend your country"". As the US army in this movie is actually fighting ""someone else's war"", in a foreign country, against an ""enemy"" which actually isn't a threat to them, there is no nationalism in this movie, only war.<br/><br/>A lot of people are criticizing the lack of characteristic, that we don't really get to know the characters. But to me, this is actually a positive thing, as it makes it a lot more unpredictable. You never know who's going to die next, you never know who's leg(s)/hand/lower body etc., is going to get blown/shot off next. In war movies, where there is a star actor playing the lead role, where you follow one specific division, platoon etc., you always know who's going to live/die. Besides Josh Hartnett (who back then, weren't exactly an A-actor), you have no idea of what's going to happen to who in this movie.<br/><br/>It had me on the edge of my seat. I've never been to war, so obviously I don't know what it's really like. But, never have I felt so sucked into a war zone, as the one happening in Mogadishu. Never have I felt such a feeling of realism, never have I felt such a feeling of how horrible it must be, to be in the middle of such a situation. The camerawork and editing/sound editing (which also won an Oscar) is amazing, and the score by Hans Zimmer makes it feel even more intense. There is no soppy music by John Williams, it's all in-your-face, it's happening RIGHT NOW, and you CAN'T escape it. Even if you wanted to, you're basically trapped, as there can be enemies anywhere. Given these circumstances, this is also the war movie, which - beyond anything, shows how much you really depend on your division and the guy next to you."
"210west","10","7","11","31 August 2017"," What puzzles me the most...
","I was thrilled by this film in the theater when it first came out, and I've subsequently watched it, or sections of it, dozens of times at home. Each time, I admire its brilliant direction, editing, sound, music, the rhythm of the action, and the sheer beauty of many of the shots. Ridley Scott has made some classic films and (more recently) some disappointing ones. This, I think, is his best.<br/><br/>But it's definitely confusing as hell, and even after all these viewings -- even after having read Mark Bowden's book (which the film follows very closely) -- I have trouble keeping track of all the various characters: the Deltas, the Rangers, and their complicated movements around war-torn Mogadishu.<br/><br/>Most confusing of all -- something that puzzles me each time I see the film (and which the book fails to clear up) -- is why this poorly planned military operation was ever okayed in the first place. As depicted on screen, it seems the most harebrained scheme imaginable, because it's so ridiculously vulnerable, just one tiny step away from utter failure.<br/><br/>All it takes to screw up the mission is a lone RPG fired at one of the low-flying helicopters. And hovering in the air just above the rooftops, the choppers make the easiest of targets; a single strike with a rocket can bring one down, and when one goes down (followed shortly afterward, of course, by a second), the entire mission turns into a colossal disaster.<br/><br/>Sam Shepard, playing the general in charge, is, as always, an impressive figure, but you want to shout at him, ""You idiot!

But the disastrous assignment during 15 hours turned out to be a flop in the deaths of eighteen US soldiers and by hundred African rebels. This is an accurate portrayal, second-by-second , of the bloody bath of the Black Sea battle.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott helped immeasurably by superb cameraman Idziak and an excellent creative team has created the ultimate vision of war as hell on earth, a nightmarish firefight, winning deservedly Academy Award for Film Editing and Sound. Stirring and emotion of the film is aided by an exciting musical score by the master Hans Zimmer. Conventional elements in the screenplay as heroism, comradeship, are based on a story devoid of sentimentality by Mark Bowden and balanced by a genuinely complex examination of courage in the field. It is overpowered by one of the most relentlessly and realistic harrowing war footage ever committed to a fiction film. This credible , accomplished motion picture about the dramatization of the famous disaster is perfectly directed by Ridley Scott as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film(Gladiator) and others(Someone to watch over me, Blade runner,Duelists , Legend) in which his visual style is impressive. Rating : Very good, above average and not for the faint of heart, for that reason ¬®Black Hawk down ¬® results to be an extraordinary work by Ridley Scott."
"prestonmarlowe","9","7","11","4 February 2009"," An account of a true battle, no more, no less
","When I saw the first trailer for Black Hawk Down, the tag line mentioned something about 100 American soldiers duking it out with 5000 unnamed combatants, then cut to scenes of Cameo clad GI's firing up and down blood covered streets, black helicopters crashing into the ground, and plenty of explosions. This was back when my heroes were the menagerie of characters portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenagger, and my understanding of war amounted to a one man commando raiding a compound, blow people up, shoot another sixty or so more, get wounded, then ultimately pull through to finish off the bad guy. Five years later, after I bought an Xbox and played a couple hundred hours of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and Ghost Recon, I realized modern special ops couldn't Schwarzenagger their way through every mission; they had to be smart. Then I watched Black Hawk Down, and I watched as a true special op played out before my eyes. US Army Rangers and Delta Force blow into town, nab a few of the warlord's Lieutenants, and prepare to blow right back out- until Super Six One gets its tail shot off, and crash lands in the town square. What happens next is a full day and night of urban war between a handful of highly trained yet very fallible American soldiers against hundreds of starving, angry militia men armed with Soviet Bloc hardware. War is an improper moniker for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of character development of the soldiers portrayed in the film. I say, what do you expect? Army Rangers and Delta Force on the job don't have time to be emotionally charged. As for some historical accuracies, then go buy the book and read it for yourself, learn something. And take Blackhawk Down for what it is: a well executed war movie that is actually true. And pay attention to the scene where Delta snipers Shugart and Gordon take on an entire mob of angry guerrilla's to save one pilot. If you're going to shun a movie based on a few historical inaccuracies even after seeing that scene, then consider yourself a small minded fool."

","Black Hawk Down is based on a real event in Somalia in 1993. It shows one of many mistakes made by the US Military and it is obvious as the movie progresses, you realize how utterly stupid the higher ranks were when it comes to resources needed to carry out a military operation and when it comes to ensure you have necessary backup if things doesn't pan out as planned...which is usually the case in the military. The commander of the Task Force Rangers had requested light armor and an AC-130 Spectre but Washington did not want to allow that as it would be ""too high profile"". Man...I think someone regretted that crappy decision. What you should probably do is ask the man on the ground what he needs and then give it to him.<br/><br/>None of the characters in the movie is really developed, which is a positive attribute. We are shown the military as a team where people care for each other and cover each others' back at all time, and even ready to die for their comrades as we see happen. It is actually amazing that some people can be that unselfish. The cinematography is just great and it goes very well with the music score. I find that Ridley Scott usually has a very good combination between these two elements of a movie (with Prometheus being slightly off to a certain extent).<br/><br/>The acting is top notch in all cases and the direction is very good. I have seen the movie a couple of times and I can actually mistake the actors for military personnel. Well, you have certain parts of the movie being a bit too much Hollywood (one of the reasons for the score of 8 and not higher), but overall the acting is very good. I remember when I saw this movie the first time...I just had to finish watching it and once the unit move into the city to get the job done...it is action sequence after action sequence...and it does not feel like too much. The build up in the beginning is a perfect prelude to what is coming later.<br/><br/>Too bad though they didn't have the equipment and resources they asked for...if they would have had, the ""skinnies"" would have stayed inside."

","I have to admit going into this film I had high hopes because I do enjoy war films and this is the up there with the best war films and films period. This film is based on a true story that in the early ninety's a group of Un troops are sent to capture a couple of Somalian criminals that are part of a dictator's reign. There is a lot of characters in this film and they look similar so at the beginning it is hard to feel invested in these characters but once they get into the battlefield this is one of the most gut-wrenching emotional experiences I have seen in film. Ewan McGregor is my favourite character in this film as he is the one character that seems to have the same feelings as we the audience would do if we were thrust in this situation just like he is. Now a lot of people would argue that this is just a mindless action film but oh my goodness how wrong that is these people grow on you as they are put in this undesirable situation. Also deep themes are played out such as freedom, sacrifice and liberation and this adds to the total realism that the action shows.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","2","28 March 2005"," A definite must-see for anyone who has just a hint of interest in war films
","After having taped this film off TV, me and my father(who is about as anti-war as you can get, partially due to having a little experience as a soldier) talked about seeing this at some point. It didn't take much more than a few weeks before we decided to see it, and from the moment we put it on, we didn't regret the decision one bit. This film currently holds the record as the best war movie I've seen(before held by titles as Full Metal Jacket, and after that, All is Quiet on the Western Front). It's by far the most realistic and intense war movie I've ever seen, and up there as one of the most effective. Contrary to what I had expected, the better part of the movie is action and intensity. I was under the impression that most of it would be build-up and there would be one or two relatively short war scenes near the end. Or worse, half the movie would be the general and colonels talking about how to get out of the situation. Instead, most of the film is action, and almost all of it is realistic, too. This perfectly illustrates how intense and chaotic warfare is, particularly urban fighting. While this doesn't have the beautiful symbolism and strong message of All is Quiet on the Western Front, it does have the more accurate and disturbing portrayal of war. The plot is good, and apparently mostly true(though I don't know how much is shortened and such to make for more dramatic sequences at the cost of realism). The pacing is incredible. Never before have I seen so long and yet so captivating film. Even more so than The Godfather, I was glued to my seat, barely ever even glancing at my watch. The high level of intensity is kept through pretty much the entire film, from the beginning of the war-scenes that take up almost all of the film. The excellent editing and cinematography also contributes to this. The acting was great. The characters are well-written, though I suppose there are a bit too many to keep track of(though this is because we are introduced to all of those who played an important part at this battle), and not all of them get enough character development or screen-time. The effects and action are fantastic. Amazingly accurate to the real thing, as well. The details, however, are what make the film the nearly perfect piece of war film history that it is; you'll see so many things in this that happen in real life war that are usually overlooked or ironed out, for the people supporting war to keep face. Friendly fire, underrating the strength of your enemies, ignoring a blind angle for even a second... however, the film also has a sour aftertaste of Hollywood and mainstream film to it. This film isn't completely free of the ever-popular and completely ludicrous slow-motion shot of the heroic soldier running from one point to another, while under fire of several automatic weapons at much too close range, and coming through without a scratch. It doesn't hold true, it doesn't happen in the real world, face it. Near the end there is also a dramatic silence, despite the ease with which the enemy could attack our heroes... again, most likely done for effect, rather than realism. There's not much of it, but it still hurts the experience far more than it adds to it. I didn't see this film to see heroic, American soldiers do impossible feats; I saw it to see what by many is being referred to as the most realistic war film ever made. In the end, this still stands as at least one of the best war movies out there, despite some shortcomings. I recommend this to just about anyone who can stand the violence in it, which is quite uncompromising and real. If you're able to see this, and you're not deterred by the reasonably high level of graphic violence, you really should watch it. 8/10"

It's not supposed to be heroic and it's not necessary that you know everything about the characters past. If you see this movie, and don't look into much about it, I think you will like it.

","Americans would like to know why the world hates them, not so? This movie proves why. It's (again) a case of 'experience how the poor little Americans die', shame, isn't it terrible. This time, however, unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', we're dealing with Somalia, a so-called 3rd world, dirt-poor ntion, not war-torn Europe. Let's face it, the attempts to show the Somalian plight are more or less perfunctory and in done in the name of political correctness, not genuine care. As usual, the main focus is the American male and his plight (in the midst of the butchery and savagery of Africa, this time). I'm not going to discuss the artistic merits of this movie, so what, I don't care. Suffice to say, American's are (generally) pompous and ignorant. This movie proves that (again).

Every detail in this movie is awesome. There's a time when you realize what heroism means- I'm talking about Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon. These two brave men payed the ultimate sacrifice just trying to rescue a pilot who's chopper crashed in a hostile area. They made it- Mike Durant, the pilot, is alive today.

What is strange is this war happened in 1993 , three years after the Gulf war yet at the time I don't remember hearing too much about it. While this is not in the class of Platoon or Saving Private Ryan this is still a good film which contains some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. You do feel at times that you are there and that you are fighting the battle too and that must say a lot for how good the film is. Some of the shots with the Grenade launchers are fantastic as are the devastating scenes following their hits.<br/><br/>One critisism is that you don't tend to get to involved with the characters , therefore you don't feel too upset when disaster befalls them.

","Not just of the movie, but also of its defenders.<br/><br/>""Save your political commentary for another website,"" says one reviewer, who goes on to add, ""Don't dishonor the memory of those who fought and died in an attempt to stop bloodshed and starvation among the Somalis"" and ""the personnel of our armed forces secure our freedom day in and day out"" and ""I'm grateful to our soldiers that have sacrificed for our nation so that I can type these words"".  (I presume this last reference is to the US soldiers who fought in the Second World War, rather than the ones who fought in Somalia, but you never can tell with someone who believes with apparent sincerity that the United States army is securing ""our"" freedom ""day in and day out"".)<br/><br/>Actually, political commentary (yes, even the sort of stuff quoted above) IS appropriate here.  This is a movie that opens with the words ""based on an actual event"" followed by a series of statements that purport to give an accurate history of what had been going on in Somalia at the time of the events the movie depicts.  It closes with a statement of fact and a list of names.  It's a hybrid work, NOT pure fiction, and not automatically immune to charges of inaccuracy in the way that pure works of fiction (like ""Star Wars"") are.  Some charges of inaccuracy (or confirmations of accuracy) will take the form of ""political commentary"".  There is just no way around this.<br/><br/>One can't even say, in defence of the film, that we should ignore its documentary pretensions and enjoy it as if it were a work of pure fiction. It can't be so enjoyed.  Almost all of the footage is in the form of a music video montage of gore, explosions and rushings to and fro; if this were a movie about an imaginary war between two made-up countries, nobody would give it the time of day.  (Contrast this with something like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", which is further removed from reality, but less likely to deceive - and in addition, thoughtful, imaginative, even-handed, suspenseful, well crafted, etc.)<br/><br/>By the way, my impression is that the majority of people here who object to the film on the grounds that it's deceitful have not only read the book, they object to the film BECAUSE they've read the book.  That's because the book was written in an honest attempt to enlighten its readers and tell the truth, while the film was a flimsy excuse for two hours of cool-looking (in a Ridley-Scottish kind of way) war porn.<br/><br/>Also by the way: if speaking the truth about America's involvement in Somalia involves ""dishonouring"" American soldiers who fought there - not that I have a clear idea what this word means - well, tough luck; we should speak the truth anyway."

","Why do we need an action film about the US fighting in Somalia? What do any of us gain from propaganda? If every US soldier fights not for a cause but to stand by his buddies -- as nearly every scene and certainly the ending insist -- then what difference does it make if he's killing people in Somalia, Vietnam, Europe, or anywhere else? The portrayal of ""the skinnies"" by Ridley Scott is despicable. Very few even have faces; instead they have screaming mouths and war cries to reinforce their inhumanity in the viewers' eyes. Of course, we don't want to think about""the skinnies""too much; after all, that could slow down the action -- and the action has to be the whole point. (Don't ask, though, why  Scott has time to make us hear about Ewan's coffee preferences.) The Somalians aren't real, and neither are the US soldiers. Scott manipulates all the characters to skew the telling of history as he wants us to see it. Scott isn't just ""on the side of the soldiers""; he's expecting his audience to give up their any critical inquiry into the nature of war and the immense power held by our military leaders. Not one soldier in this movie is enraged at the political decisions that have led to so many lives needlessly lost. Is Scott saying soldiers don't think - they just obey? And is he saying we should admire soldiers for that? If so, he's participating in the kind of film making that many of our country's enemies have been perfecting for years."

He opens the film with a line from Plato ""Only the dead have seen the end of war"". It seems a bit trite and pretentious, but overall, with a quote like that preceding the film, you gotta think that this is gonna be an extremely objective look at humanity's illogical partiality to war.<br/><br/>However, what follows is a blatantly American look at ""American heroes"" ""giving hope"" to all of those ""foreign savages"" off in somalia, back in that ""little skirmish"" of 1993. It is virtually 2 hrs of soulless combat footage of ""good 'ol american boys"" doing there duty and making a difference in the world, even if that includes killing 1000 somalis.<br/><br/>I will not go into the lack of emotional ""OOmph"" that this film had, or the frequently-proclaimed lack of ""characterization"".<br/><br/>All I will say is that it seems this film serves little more purpose than to rile the american spirit (contrary to what plato's opening quote would have you believe)...it has, rather, recoiled any residing american spirit I still had.

","First off: I am a white, middle class male from South-Africa. I find this piece of screen offal not only misleading, but blatantly offensive. Socio-Geo-political-economic concerns aside (and I could write a thesis on these issues alone), can a bloody, violent (but almost unnoticably brief, believe it or not) conflict like this from our recent past (and especially on a striken continent like Africa) really be seen as entertainment? THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT, IT IS A GROSS MISREPRESETATION. It is nothing more than AMerican nationalist propaganda in the wake of the overwrought 9/11 travesty to be used as justification for American involvement in sensitive current world affairs. Here are a few unsettling macro facts; if anyone would like references, I can supply them, they are reliable, I am an honours university student: Since the end of World War 2, the United States government has provided more than 200 billion dollars worth of military aid to foreign governments, the purpose not being to protect them from outside aggression, but to secure American economic interests in those countries. The recipients of aid have been some of the most notorious miltiary dictatorships, autocratic regimes the world has ever seen. America is a rogue nation, like it or not. <br/><br/>It was certainly clever for the producers of this film to single out an event in East Africa: America clearly doesn't have any economic interests in this region. Why not read up on some other positively heinous examples of American foreign policy gone awry: there are many sources, and believe it or not they are not hard to find, they are not obscure, and are written by intellectuals from Oxford, Camridge and he like. Go and find the information yourself instead of sitting on your couch, passively imbibing codswollop like this awful film. <br/><br/>Why do so many people dislike America: is it because we are jealous of their astounding material wealth?

"nullifie","1","13","26","19 January 2002"," Violence, gore, art and racism.
","I have seen this movie before it went on wide. ""Black Hawk Down"" represents a kind of non-stop violence that you'd expect from a real war. Based only on the artistic quality of the gore in this movie, I would have to vote that this movie exceeds what we saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"". But, that's where it stops. There is no art in the depiction of violence that engulfs the audience the moment the movie starts till the end.<br/><br/>Another point this movie misses, or ignores due to racism on the part of the original writer of the ""Black Hawk Down"" newspaper articles -- later a book --, was the amount of lives lost on the part of the innocent Somalians. Please understand, in this brief encounter, there were 18 odd American soldiers dead, and 500 (FIVE HUNDRED) Somalians militia and civilians KILLED (according to American-Somalian relationship Org -- as published on CNN). More than 1000 others were maimed. I find it hard to believe that anyone would ever want to make a movie glorifying this, and then completely forget the other side of the story.<br/><br/>Another thing that would stand out is the fact that this is a war of the white man against the black. The US soldiers (specially Rangers and spec ops) as dedicated here are white Americans (I found it odd that this was actually the case among the real Rangers). American soldiers were armed to the teeth, over six feet tall, with similar Aryan looks that made it almost impossible to follow the various soldiers (not that it matted, cause this was just about violence -- even though some of the acting was good). Another point I'd like to point out and point out in BOLD, is the fact that we've introduced a new racist word to depict Somalians, the ""Sammies"", I found it as offensive as ""N*gger"". This is plain tasteless. And just goes to show how clueless the average American film makers are.<br/><br/>The only redeeming features of this movie are, the good acting on parto of the almost unknown actors, and brilliant violence that would be more appropriate on another planet, against creatures that were not human (Thank you).<br/><br/>Furthermore, this movie represents all that is wrong with the American mentality. This movie is an excellent example of the reason why the rest of the world truly dislike America. This movie is an ugly gash on America, and I am not proud of saying this is a product of our culture. This movie almost justifies the violence that others inflict on us. I am saddened by how people might be influenced by movies such as this.<br/><br/>Two thumbs down."

The film isn't trying to explain the politics of the situation, because half the soldiers there didn't even know what was going on.

I had heard so much about this film being ""great"", ""best movie ever"" and like statements--I just didn't find that being the case at all.

I have--they fell out of helicopters, they tripped while exiting a doorway, they tripped while running--if the Somalians didn't kill them they probably would have shot themselves anyway.  The movie also lacked credibility which was much needed in this movie given the lack of storyline.  Com'mon, 1000 Somalis dead and only 19 Americans lost in battle?  Yeah, right--I too have a bridge to sell you!  I don't think I ever routed for the bad guy in a movie, but in this movie I made an exception.

","""Black Hawk Down"" certainly is an aesthetically strong movie. But that cannot justify such an oversimplification of the Somalian situation. ""It's just a movie,"" one might say, but if there should at all be the need to produce a war movie with a setting so detached from reality and with enemy troops so dehumanized, then please let it take place in some made up banana republic. African people are not the brainless herd animals they are depicted as in this picture. I remember how I laughed out loud at the scene with the young, beautiful Somalian mother and her child, which Scott so bluntly used as an alibi to hide the racism that is being conveyed throughout the whole movie. Considering that the story of the movie is (at least to some extent) a real one, it is surprising, how little you learn about the war in Somalia. The only thing that comes across is that it seems to be a country inhabited by not-quite-human creatures, whose only purpose is to look absolutely insane and be shot dead in hundreds per minute. Oh, and to serve as a backdrop for serious questions like whether Navy Seals or Delta Force are tougher. Somalia seems like Vietnam in a desert with shabby houses instead of jungle. If you just want to see a technically well made war movie, you might like ""Black Hawk Down"". If you have a conscience, you won't."

","Black Hawk Down really surprised me. No, it shocked me. I expected the usual patriotic we're-heroes-and-we-love-it stuff, but I was wrong. BHD tells the story from the soldiers point of view, how they suffer, how they are overrun and how they die. We get to see everything, whether it's Jamie bleeding to death, a dying Ruiz telling Captain Steele not go out without him or the horror in Eversman's eyes when he sees the Black Hawk going down. Through all the bullets and blood the film is asking: well what did you expect? This is what war is like. And in combat not everything goes the way it's supposed to go (they actually can't find the right way). Other movies give the impression that soldiers are no human being, like they don't have feeling, they are never scared and so on. But the nervousness shortly before the mission starts corrects that. The scene in which Blackburn falls out of the helicopter is a good example that even the excellent training can't prevent mistakes from happening. No supermen in the army, ""just"" normal people.<br/><br/>The film is not into politics and this is what makes it so incredibly good. Like Hoot says ""once the first bullet goes past your head, the politics go right out of the window"". And once the first bullet goes past our head (you really get the feeling you're standing in Mog) we stop thinking about whether it was wrong or right or too late to send troops to Somalia. During the film this is only background information, but as soon as it is over, the knowledge of the fact that this really happened and that even the names of the characters are authentic comes back with all force.<br/><br/>You want to see a good, believable war movie?

","Another sobering film of Americans fighting unwinnable wars in a foreign land wasting lives of civilians and American soldiers. Like Vietnam was Nixon's bleeding baby, this disastrous raid in Somalia to unseat a dictator was Bill Clinton's. Not forgetting other fiascoes of Soviet-Afghan war, Lybia, Iraq, Afghanistan and the list will no doubt lengthen with time since the US never seem to learn. <br/><br/>Politics aside, Black Hawk Down is stunning shock and awe film by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. Of huge epic production, the film show the full might of the US equipment and firepower. Body injuries with blood spurting from femoral arteries and severed body parts were too real for comfort. Although better equipped, the white US soldiers were hugely outnumbered by the Somalian 'skinnies'that relentless attacked in guerrilla style and would win in the end by sheer numbers and relentless determination. Seeing the black Somalians crawling and rushing at the white American soldiers, it was strangely reminiscent of another Ridley Scott's Aliens. The masses of blood thirsty aliens attacking the outnumbered Ripley and his US crew fighting in on a foreign asteroid far from home. <br/><br/>Some scenes were just beautiful and weirdly reminiscent of Coppola's Apocalypse like the fleet of military choppers flying over panoramic stretches of the beaches and ocean into the war zone of Mogadishu. Director Scott told the fiasco story of Black Hawk Down in his typical style of detailed accuracy and hugely epic dimensions with loudly rousing music score of Hans Zimmer. Some of the body dismembering and appendages dismembering scenes of blood jet fountains were no less shocking than Spielberg's Normandy beach scene in Saving Private Ryan, only less sustained and intense. The most thrilling part of the film for me was the star studded cast giving fantastic performances. Josh Hartnett took centre stage and gave a sensitive unforgettable portrayal of competent young sergeant yet compassionate over the injuries and deaths of men under him. Like a child in a candy shop, there were also many other eye candies but lesser billed actors in the film. They were no less amazing, such as the future GOT bad boy Jamie Lannister or Niholaj Costa-Waldau, the coffee perfecting making obsessed Ewan McGregor, future Entourage star Jeremy Preven, the mercenary and highly effective soldier Eric Bana and the capable medic Tye Burrell. At the end of film, we learned that at least 1000 Somalians and 19 American soldiers. Different folks in USA would probably take different sides for sure in the light of on going racial tensions in the country. For all the fiasco wars US got their fingers in, chickens are coming home to roost."

","Ridley Scott is an amazing director with over 3 decades worth of movies to his name and Black Hawk Down is not only one of my favourite war films it's also one of my favourite Movies by Ridley Scott. For one despite the fact that the story being told in this movie is quite gruesome and ugly it's very entertaining I could watch this movie anytime it's able to honour to suffering of its characters while still being able to entertain the viewer and make them want to come back and watch the movie multiple times. The way they tell the story is by just showing the brutality of war not putting focus on a romance or one character in particular but showing them all just showing what the war has done to these men and the people they are trying to protect. This is one of the best directed movies I have ever seen it cuts at just the right moments the framing is perfect the action sequences are all perfectly handled and should have gotten Ridley Scott an Oscar for his efforts. While you probably couldn't tell all the characters apart the actors who play them all given terrific performances with Ewan McGregor and William Fichner probably being the standouts. You've still got Tom Hardy here in one of his earliest roles he's not in the movie for long but does the best with his limited screen time and the same goes for Orlando Bloom. My next point is one that is both a positive and a negative for the movie, the lack of character development. This adds a bit to the movie for what Scott is trying to accomplish he just wants to show the brutality of war and having to spend time developing its many characters would subtracts from that greatly. But it detracts from the movie as well as this movie has got a lot of characters and because of there lack of development as I previously said you can't really tell them apart. If your hoping for subtlety Black Hawk Down is not the movie for your u but if you love War movies or just Entertaining movies Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is definitely the movie for you it's one of his finest films and one of the many for which he will be remembered for.

","First I am a fan of Ridley's direction I loved his Body of lies film very much and last night I watched ""Black hawk down"" on my phone it was huge entertaining film and it was also emotional.<br/><br/>This film has managed to make a serious military tone till its end the scenes of war were amazing and some scenes like a broken hand, a half body of a soldier was very hard to watch.<br/><br/>The film has shown the real face/ scenario of war and I liked the most in it. Plus the acting also makes it a great film.<br/><br/>Scott's direction was awesome the film is very well made and the most of it scenes were of war which it was expected to show us it never concentrates in Comedy and silly things it is totally concentrated on war.<br/><br/>Overall the film was a must watch."
"matjpi","6","3","4","12 March 2012"," Technical masterpiece, historically selective
","As always Ridley Scott delivers an audiovisual feast. I would expect that the on-set ex-military advisors ensured that the scenarios and skills, including the language and tactics were as authentic as filming and military policy would allow. The DVD extras shows that the cast was sent to taste boot-camp (McGregor, Bloom) and Ranger training (Fitchner) so the commitment to realism was evident. For all those reasons: six stars.<br/><br/>Many people, however, rightly dispute the film's casting of the soldiers as a peacekeeping force. No government in the world uses special forces people for peacekeeping operations, by which I mean: restore order. It's entirely opposite to what they normally do, i.e. be used as a top-grade scalpel: only when ""necessary"" surgery is needed.<br/><br/>Decaptiating Aidid's regime would only create a power vacuum. It would not help the UN peacekeepers. Without a long-term commitment to the region, it was simply a period of upheaval that cost thousands more innocent lives. If only Somalia had oil reserves...<br/><br/>As a film, it's beautifully done. As propaganda, it probably hit the mark for people (i.e. Americans) who didn't bother (or want) to look too closely. Watch it for its beauty and its (at the time) groundbreaking tight camera shots and skillfully choreographed and executed events."
"tvspace","5","3","4","26 February 2002"," An intense experience
","Black Hawk Down is an intense, raw, documentary-like war movie; it's as if the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan just kept going....and going. Most of the film is a series of brutal, heart-pounding firefights between heavily outnumbered American special forces and wave after wave of Somali, machine-gun-toting brigands.  The film is exhausting to sit through, as the relentless attacks fall one upon another, the Americans pinned in shattered buildings, or in the cockpits of crashed helicopters, or inside their own Armored Personnel Carriers.  The movie doesn't just depict war as hell, it is hell itself... endless carnage served up without meaning or reason. <br/><br/>
The film isn't a masterpiece.  It doesn't offer much in the way of story, or a cogent point of view.  Actually, it could have been a masterpiece if it had deliberately and consistently avoided all efforts at classical storytelling and adopted a strictly clinical approach.  It is the occasional attempt at turning the film into a classical Hollywood movie (i.e. Castaway or Saving Private Ryan) that keeps it from achieving the kind of single-minded artistic purity of the best war movies, like Das Boot and The Thin Red Line.  Its efforts at organizing the carnage are too cursory to turn the movie into a well-crafted drama, but they do spoil its chance at being a different kind of war movie, one that presents war as pure experience, without narrative.<br/><br/>The movie is not helped by the careful touch director Ridley Scott takes with the image of the U.S. military.  Certainly the U.S. was on a heroic mission in Somalia, trying to ameliorate the terrible famine that Somalians were suffering at the time, yet the film seems too self-conscious about avoiding any negative images of the U.S. military whatsoever, whether it is incompetent officers (the usual standby, of course) or grunts committing questionable deeds.  Amazingly, though the U.S. soldiers are being assaulted seemingly at random in a dense urban environment, not one accidentally guns down a civilian, or even shoots at an assailant who is in a non-aggressive posture (i.e., running away).  These guys would have to have supernatural powers to differentiate immediate threats from false alarms in such an environment, and it simply isn't believable, in a movie that places all its bets on being ""realistic"".  <br/><br/>I had the good fortune to see the movie in Hollywood with the director  and producer (Jerry Bruckheimer) in attendance.  In their remarks after the screening it was clear that the movie was made with substantial cooperation from the U.S. military.  While the pyrotechnics in the film might have suffered without this cooperation, it's fair to wonder what sort of substantial compromises were made to the story to accommodate the military's cooperation, and neither director nor producer seemed to recognize the inherent problems with such a relationship, and it shows in the film.<br/><br/>Nonetheless Black Hawk Down is an exceptional film, one of the best war movies to come out of Hollywood in the past 20 years, and one that at times illustrates a fresh if brutal approach to the genre, and as importantly takes us deep inside a nightmare that has receded into memory as a minor if unpleasant international incident.  This film shows that, if you're on the ground, there's no such thing as a ""minor incident"".  You're either behind a desk, or you're out there living in hell, and what you see on CNN ain't the half of it."

","As with any plan, the devil is in the details.

One of saddest chapters in American warfare, portrayed with anguish, grit and long-suffering by a talented and very enormous cast."
"Steffi_P","7","4","6","28 March 2012"," ""One hundred caskets to fill""
","After the success of Saving Private Ryan in 1998, the war movie was rebranded from the moral fable of the Vietnam era to something that was essentially an exciting experience for its audience. Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.<br/><br/>However Black Hawk Down differs from a lot of modern action pictures in its pacing, as orchestrated by director Ridley Scott. Eschewing the usual frenetic overkill, Scott takes a relatively relaxed approach. In the first Lord of the Rings movie, which was released the same week, the average shot length must be something like two seconds. In Black Hawk Down the average shot length is more like three to four seconds, and it makes all the difference. There is time to savour expressions and notice tiny details, making up for the lack of rounded characterisation earlier in the movie. Scott allows the interplay between the men to come out, not in the script, but in glances, grimaces and carefully-placed props. The earliest scenes are eerily calm, providing a moody build-up for the action that is to come.<br/><br/>And it's all done with such grace and smoothness. The timing of shots is rhythmic and the images are beautiful. Scott and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak create some extremely stylised colour schemes which evoke temperature as much as mood. When we move from Garrison's meeting with Atto (browns and yellows) to the hanger with his troops (blues) you can practically feel a whoomph of cool air hitting you. Add to this mix a musical soundtrack that dances from the power of contemporary and classic rock tracks to the haunting sounds of Denez Pringent and Lisa Gerrard. Black Hawk Down has an aesthetic quality rare in war movies.<br/><br/>Although this isn't really a movie about deep performances, it's worth making a few points about casting, which seems to follow types rather than talents. For example, Tom Sizemore was then your go-to man for mean-faced sergeant characters. It seems unusual to cast Scotsmen Ewan MacGregor and Ewen Bremner as US soldiers, especially as MacGregor in particular can't really do the accent. However I think the fact that they are outsiders among the rest of the cast feeds into the impression they give of combat virgins.<br/><br/>The trouble with Black Hawk Down is that it actually needs to be as visually sumptuous as it is. There isn't really much to go on here, dramatically; apart from a little chitchat in the first half hour, the whole movie is essentially one very long battle scene. When there are talky scenes, all we get is bland, one-dimensional dialogue ‚Äì the usual trite ""A man's gotta do¬Ö"" stuff. The only way it actually really conveys anything meaningful is through putting us into that combat zone and giving us a little taste of the terror and the exhilaration. And perhaps, for this, it is a stronger war movie."
"Spleen","2","11","23","25 July 2002"," Two-thirds glamourised carnage, one-third whitewash
","""It tells the story from the soldier's point of view""; ""It shows us what it was like to be there"" ... at least, that's what we hear from people who want to excuse Ridley Scott's myopia and shallowness.  Not so.<br/><br/>We aren't told the story ""from the soldier's point of view"", because we aren't told the story, period.  Nor do we really get the soldier's point of view.  Scott shows us ample footage from the point of view of the odd Somalian sniper, and from the point of view of command central, and (albeit rarely) from the point of view of a civilian, and from no particular point of view at all; he focuses just as much on what the soldiers aren't looking at as he does on what they are looking at.  There's an unmistakable attempt to pull off a god's-eye perspective.  It doesn't succeed.  Actually, it's more as though Scott found himself in the middle of a REALLY COOL war, and he photographed all the REALLY COOL stuff around him as though he were shooting a beer commercial, making a mental note to edit it all later.  Then he edited it as though it were a beer commercial.  And who's surprised? That's how he makes all his movies.<br/><br/>That's why the movie fails on the second count, too - showing us what it was like to be there.  There's no ""what it was like"" anywhere in this film. Actual soldiers who fight side by side can, at least when staring one another in the eyes at a distance of half a metre, recognise one another, which is more than we can do without straining our eyes and struggling to remember if this is the guy who makes coffee or the one who made that phone call earlier, you know, the one next to the pin-up - assuming the coffee guy and the pinup guy were distinct, which isn't certain.  Besides, ANY real life event has a continuity missing here.  Maybe the soldiers were as confused as I was about what was going on, but they couldn't have been as confused as I was about what (at any one point) they were trying to do.  The early parts of the mission, in which everyone knew what was going on and what they were doing, are shot in precisely the same bewildering, arty, choppy fashion as the later bits, in which the bewildering, choppy artiness is allegedly meant to convey the soldiers' own confusion.  I don't buy it.<br/><br/>Moreover, there's clearly an attempt to provide some political context at the beginning - or more accurately, a pretence.  Now, I don't demand political context.  A good film could be made - possibly in the vein of Kafka's ""The Trial"" - in which we don't know what the war is about or how it started or what the soldiers were doing there.  But if you're going to TRY to tell us the story, or ACT as though you're telling us the story, then it's as well to get it RIGHT.  The half-a-dozen sentences of context at the beginning are completely unhelpful.  And misleading, if not actually false. The Americans weren't there to provide famine relief.  They weren't, as the film obliquely suggests, obstructed in any way by UN troops - in fact, the chutzpah of the Pentagon, who had control over the script, claiming such a thing, blows me away.  Twenty-two countries obediently pooled their forces under United Nations command, but the United States, as always, refused to do any such thing - partly to leave the US army free to indulge in whatever war crimes it pleased.<br/><br/>One or two moments are unintentionally revealing.  A fresh soldier arrives and innocently refers to ""Mogadishu"", but an older hand immediately corrects him: ""Firstly, it's 'The Mog'.  Nobody calls it 'Mogadishu'.""  No, nobody, except perhaps the people who live there.  If troops from a foreign power were to walk around my country as though they owned it, terrorising the locals (accidentally, according to the film, although there's ample evidence that much of it was deliberate), I would still find it an added insult if they were to contemptuously refer to our capital city as ""The Can"" and to other cities as ""The Syd"" and ""The Melb"" - unless they were inspired to do so by local practises, which, something tells me, wasn't the case here.<br/><br/>Then there's the note at the end.  It says: ""...over 1000 Somalis were killed and 19 Americans lost their lives.""  (That's a ratio of 53 to one.) The Somalis were ""killed"", the Americans ""lost their lives""; Scott doesn't even have the grace to say something even-handed like, ""1000 Somalis and 19 Americans were killed.""  In case the double standard weren't obvious enough, we see a LIST of the 19 dead Americans (but not, of course, the Somalis). For a second I suspected that Scott was being subtle for the first time in his life, and that this sick joke was deliberate.  Then I remembered the rest of the film and thought: no, probably not."
"dixxjamm","4","8","16","16 April 2011"," War Porn
","Being a fan of war movies and history, I remember watching this one when it came out and be impressed by the production,but feeling guilty about watching and liking it (because the of the biased script and the direction of the movie).The reason I'm commenting NOW is because I noticed, to my surprise, that this movie is used as a reference for a very good and accurate war movie and I want to make some points clear: <br/><br/>1.Where a movie like Platoon was accused of cramming in too many scattered historical events into one story, BHD manages to take one much more simple, recent and better documented event and be incredibly selective and subjectively focused in its depiction. Hence - war porn,we see the actual act in vivid detail,but are treated like retards regarding the why and the how. Nobody is interested in an elaborate script of a porn movie because it is assumed (and rightfully so)that nobody gives a toss.However this is war and history,not a sexual act.And the effect is the same, we get turned on.And whoever doesn't feel guilty about being turned on merely by human slaughter and misery should really start thinking about it. Aren't we supposed to learn something from movies and books instead of just be entertained? <br/><br/>2.I read that Ridley Scott said that he wasn't interested in politics at all when doing the movie.That may be convenient but it's an absurdity,at its best. Surely he must have realized that it would turn into a recruiting tool for the military, just like Top Gun (incidentally directed by his brother). He also must have realized that by not telling the whole story (trying, I mean) he distorts reality to a point where it doesn't become entertaining anymore, it becomes insulting.<br/><br/>3. The funniest and scariest part (just like in Top Gun) is that this is a story about elite forces, people that do this for a living, and yet SO many people identified with the characters. Most men couldn't even hold and shoot a Minimi light machine gun without probably killing their own mates in battle, due to stress and confusion. The friendly fire rate in Iraq and Afghanistan is nearing 40%, that says a lot about even the real training of ordinary troops and yet people in movie theaters eating popcorn or watching the DVD at home on a comfortable couch confuse reality with Call of Duty (VG)...if that doesn't scare the heck out of you, it should.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would have liked to give a top mark to this one, because the production is really spectacular and it's a guilty pleasure, but thinking about it, it doesn't even deserve a 4/10 because of its sheer irresponsibility."
"doug1717","2","8","16","15 April 2008"," Poor Film That Could Have Been A Zombie Epic
","Ridley Scott has made a mess. Much like his later effort ""American Gangster"", Scott throws the viewer into a world with no introduction and you are left to pick up the pieces and catch up. Either that or he assumed the audience knew it all before going in. That might explain his use of tiny illegible subtitles to convey information, just like in ""American Gangster"". The actors were almost all wasted. You couldn't tell who was who. They all looked the same. You don't care about them at all. To drive this home, Scott portrays the interchangeable soldiers as arrogant, ignorant cry babies who run when the going gets tough. The American command is portrayed as an electronic age Custer, and the Somali and the Mujahadeen who came to fight the Americans are portrayed as Indians in a 60's western. The whole film is whites vs. black stereotypes with sunglasses and guns. What a terrible film that goes on way too long. Just wasted effort."
"nelliebell-1","10","5","9","24 December 2004"," Code Name-""Irene""
","The Movie,""Black Hawk Down"" is an excellent story of what it means to come to the aid of civilization.I certainly as a viewer and even as a reviewer were slow to respond to the impression that this story told of on the silver screen.This recommendation is done because there is territory that is covered, that involves not only the truth but the welfare of civilization.It is a film that unlike some films when they open,you are immediately struck by the moment.Perhaps like Saving Private Ryan with the landings that were to occur in minutes on the beaches of Normandy,France.Saving Private Ryan though looks back through the eyes of Ryan.A son who because of the efforts made on his behalf through Captain Millers company was able to ""earn this""and indeed our introduction to the story of Saving Private Ryan is a powerful testament to the sacrifice offered in exchange for the life saved.Even now though not the reason for this review the powerful underpinning to Saving Private Ryan makes it a very memorable film,one which equates with great,A truly exemplary motion picture.However we have here a film that is about an event that took place in 1993 and it concerned the peoples of Somalia.This film opens on a subtle,almost eerie note with dark gray colors with music that won an academy award.The dramatic event begins ever so slowly almost to draw you in,perhaps even as a curiosity.To be certain we are looking at the dead and how the mass deaths were part of the picture of whatever life there was left.It invites an almost shocking perception as to the scale that this story tells off.We are told through the sayings of Plato that only the dead see the end to war and we watch how mass starvation due to the wars of clans and the like have provided the grounds for a loss of life that is described as Biblical in proportion.The numbers offered are said to exceed 300,000 dead due to starvation and counting.So dire were the needs of the Somalis that the World Community got wind of the disaster and in response to a terribly inhumane state, the UN with the full cooperation of our nation(USA)sent in front line U.S.Marines,some twenty thousand strong to restore order and re-establish a food line to assist in an attempt to save a future here too.We come to expect great things from our greatest and we got what we wanted as historically it will indicate that order was restored and food as well as supplies were finding there way to the population.However,the front line force was to be replaced soon and very capable units involving US Army Rangers as well as Delta Force commandos were on the ground in Somalia with designs to sever the head of the serpent by denying it some of its functioning pieces.Gun dealers,political as well military personnel are rounded up in an attempt to limit the effect of Aideeds faction.The claim as to the state of affairs that provided for the calls for help were an illustration of a failure of a governing body to be responsible and responsive to the many that they had authority over.This failure was and is a very present circumstance that cannot endure permanently and society or civilization will die as a result.However,this film does not as a rule look at the film as a political film it does though attempt to establish some methods as to how to deal with the events that we were watching unfold.The UN position was to do all we could without getting ourselves involved in what was considered somewhat of a civil war.We watch aid-ides militia shoot unarmed civilians and as the film takes us into Mogadishu,we learn that this is one of the most dangerous cities in all the world.The streets have vendors selling guns,which are AK47s with so many different small arms that you would probably equate its place likened to selling umbrellas,Belts,or neck ties.It is that pervasive and indeed that eerie feeling felt at the start of the film does not go away.This is a very dangerous community and not at all shy about it.The political position has an effect on just how capable a presence we wish to provide when there are final plans drawn up under the code name""Irene"" to move into the heart of what is considered very unfriendly territory and kidnap or capture these important pieces in Aideeds organization.The political climate suggested a low profile would be more fitting our place in the eyes of the world,so that a request for some of our special weaponry was disallowed.It may have contributed to the fact that we had to engage the enemy at all,however that withstanding our combat loses were to be nearly 19 dead and 71 wounded with the enemy having lost some 1,000.00 dead and wounded.The battle scenes don't end and there is a continuous involvement of the fight until the nighttime when though the militia may of thought it was there time when in fact they were dealt a blow through our helicopter gunships that by day light things were a-bit more peaceful.This is a very warrior type of picture,where our men in uniform provided outstanding commitment to peace and a unequivocal ability to gain that objective.In a final note this is a excellent film worth seeing more than once plus its not winning more academy awards than just two may have had something to do with timing more than anything else because this film is that good.The two categories in which it won were Best Film Editing and Best Sound.This film is worth the Soundtrack by its self,it is as good as it gets worth many many a listen.Highly recommended and rates equal footing with the very best in war time films."

","The fact that this movie was made is almost as embarrassing as the decision to send troops into a hellish, tribal war pit that fateful day.  Who's to blame?  The book is loaded down with detail and characterization that the movie somehow disregards for the sake of placing the audience in the cockpit of terror.  The movie made me angry because of its utter lack of development on several key factors that any important war movie should contain.  How can this film be important on a patriotic level?  Do those of you who actually give this movie a 10 feel that the closing lines somehow deliver an important or revelatory message after watching hundreds of Somalis get mowed down by U.S. force?  How do the families of these soldiers feel?  The movie is a spectacle; however, it's anything but spectacular.  Why Mr. Scott decided to get into a cinematic bed with Jerry B., whose odor throughout this film is unmistakable, is a mystery.  Don't waste your time or money."

"Dr-RJP","10","4","7","24 July 2008"," Hands down, the best COMBAT movie ever made!
","**SPOILERS AHEAD** The reason I said, COMBAT movie, instead of WAR MOVIE, is the perceptions that we, as Americans, have sown over many, many wars. We tend to think of wars as being either noble or ignoble, just or unjust, and won or lost. For the people who serve in the military, there is none of this lofty pretense about why they fight.<br/><br/>Two of the more memorable lines in the film could have been made very kitschy, as is the typical style of Hollywood filmmakers. Unlike the war films of the 40's and 50's, BLACK HAWK DOWN is not a ""feel good"" movie that paints heroes in all white, and villains in all black. Unlike wear movies in the 60's and 70's, there isn't any internal angst about ""Why we're here."" Unlike the movies of the 80's and 90's, BHD does not present gratuitous graphic violence, and does not try to shock you with the ""horrows of war."" And, unlike ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,"" BHD is not weighted down by the star power of its cast, or the creds of the Director, or the cheesy -- yes, cheesy way it tries to portray the ""fog of war,such as when Tom Hank's"" character is temporarily rendered deaf by an explosion.<br/><br/>In fact, there is a comparable seen in which two soldiers are pinned down, and attempting to cover each other as they reload. One soldier turns to his buddy and says, ""Quit firing that thing so close to my head,"" and, not more than a few seconds later, his buddy sees Somalis approaching from that side, and fires his automatic weapon right next to his head, and the other guy goes deaf.<br/><br/>With anybody else at the helm instead of Ridley Scott, we would have gotten the now overdone, ""muffled silence,"" a la SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. b(There was a scene in BHD where Scott did hit the ""mute button,"" but it was only done as a means of creating the POV.<br/><br/>I've been in a similar situation, standing next to a cannon, and being deafened momentarily. When that happens to you, you do exactly what the soldier did in BHD: you have a dazed, wide-eyed look on your face, and start screaming because you cannot hear your4self speak.<br/><br/>Soldiers rely on all six senses (five + intuition) when on the battlefield, and losing one's hearing can be catastrophic. Rangers and Delta force are trained to use hand signals to maintain silence, but the chaos of the battle in ""Mog"" as they called it, rendered that skill superfluous. BHD handled these scenes rather well.<br/><br/>What makes this both a poignant and believable scene is that no soldier ever stops to think about, ""Gee, I'd better stop firing my weapon near his head,"" when he's got unfriendlies coming at them by the hundreds.<br/><br/>And by the hundreds and thousands they came. Not disciplined Somali soldiers, but ever male who was old enough to carry a gun in a society where dying for your God in battle was glorified above all else.<br/><br/>When you're a soldier, and you are alone, cut off from help, your first thought is to stay alive and your second is to do your job. When you're with one of your fellow's soldier, your first thought is keeping your buddy alive.<br/><br/>This was the second time I had seen BHD, with the fist coming when it opened in theatres. It felt as though I was watching for the first time. The battles are as intense as it gets. What you see is not the typical, unrealistic ""scenes where some of the soldiers seem to get through it without a scratch.<br/><br/>Not in BHD-- EVERY soldier was wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Another realistic scene that most filmmakers ignore, is how often a soldier has to replace an empty ammo clip with a filled one. How many times have we seen guns being fired like they have an endless supply of bullets? Also, BHD doesn't make a seminal scene about it -- none of this slo-mo in watching the empty magazine being released and falling to the ground. As a total opposite of that, Scott not only has the soldiers accurately removing the empty magazine with their dominant hand, and loading in the hew one, BUT ONLY after they tap the FRONT of the magazine with their other hand or against their boot or helmet.<br/><br/>WHY is that important? Because the bullets in a magazine do shift positions in all the movements in battle, and if the back of the bullets are not flush against the back of the magazine, they can jam the gun or misfire.<br/><br/>People who know about weapons appreciate things like that.<br/><br/>The movie wastes no time in getting into the heat of battle, and the scenes are so intense, so graphic, that you may want to wear a mouth guard to keep your teeth from clenching throughout it. Basicially, until the move is over, you don't move an inch because you really do feel like you may, yourself, get shot if you do.<br/><br/>The musical score is superb as Ridley Scott again chose Hans Zimmer, as he did in ""Gladiator"", to compose it. You may notice the similarities in it with ""Gladiator,"" as well.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a ten out of ten. Not a perfect ten, mind you, but one that earned it the hard way."

"hissingsid","Null","4","7","4 February 2003"," Technically magnificent, but otherwise lacking.
","It's funny how a film like this can provoke such aggressively political critiques; it isn't a particularly political film, after all.  Yes, you could argue that it has propagandist tendencies, but that is just a hazard of the genre, even with the most well-meaning films.  Yes, the emphasis on 19 American dead seems rather disproportionate to the 1000-odd Somali dead; but then, the film is the story of the US soldiers, not the Somalis.  It is told from a Western perspective, and it is entirely natural that the story - which is in any case an adaptation of a book - should focus on the US forces.  Critics with an anti-American agenda should perhaps note that not only did an Englishman direct this film, but it features two Scots, a Welshman and a couple of Kiwis in significant roles as US servicemen.<br/><br/>One of the primary intentions of this film appears to be to relate events as they happened.  That is, the film is not about what is good, or what is bad, but simply what IS - was, I should say.  In this the film appears to be reasonably succesful, conveying the chaos of modern battle in a way that I can imagine is very realistic.  (Not that I'd know.)<br/><br/>This does not excuse the film's many flaws. I shuddered a little when I saw Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner all together again - not that any of these three is an unwelcome presence on screen, far from it - but rather that I was immediately reminded of Pearl Harbour - a film which presents the viewer with an operatic mythologising of warfare and real events, comparisons with which Black Hawk Down would truly be best served by avoiding.<br/><br/>This was not helped by moments such as when a soldier rips a cast from his arm in hyper-macho fashion, or when a dying soldier actually says 'Tell my mom I done ma best', or words unbearably similar to that old cliche.  These may well be real for all I know, but in the context of a film which has pretensions to seriousness, they simply feel crude and obvious.<br/><br/>I actually went into this film expecting to enjoy it - I enjoyed nonsense like Pearl Harbour, and my expectations of a Bruckheimer film had led me to believe that whatever its flaws I could enjoy BHD.  Tragically, BHD commits the greatest sin for an action film - it isn't actually very exciting.  This strikes me as a terrible shame as the story really is a gripping one, and a BBC documentary of a few years ago conveyed this very well.  However, the battle scenes in this film are, if anything, almost too routine.  As an exercise in verisimilitude it is a technical feat to behold; and yet, there is a feeling of detachment from the events.  Perhaps it's the blandness of the characters, perhaps because they're TOO real, but there's a feeling of general anonymity about this bunch of bald guys that I haven't really felt in a cast since Alien 3.  Only Eric Bana really is memorable as the quiet soldier who demonstrably knows his job.<br/><br/>And what does the film actually give us in its discussion of war (if discussion it is)?  There is a good moment concerning an accidental shooting, another concerning the simple bad luck that can befall a soldier before he even sees battle, and an appropriately horrible scene with a wounded soldier... but these are perfunctory and even that last is undercut by the dialogue which is stilted and cliched.<br/><br/>I suppose ultimately this film provokes indifference in me.  It's difficult to enjoy as an action movie because it's too serious.  It's difficult to appreciate as a 'serious' war movie because it's not quite serious enough. If anything, it's like playing a computer game... and that's not the feeling I would like a film about armed conflict to provoke in me."
"Chris Knipp","Null","4","7","20 January 2002"," One of the most impressive bad war movies ever made
","Black Hawk Down could indeed have been one of the best war movies of all time - if it weren't so mindless, numbing, and demoralizing.  Ridley Scott's new movie about the failed US action in Somalia certainly is one of the most exceptionally vivid and detailed cinematic depictions ever of an extended sequence of combat in all its horror, futility, and suffering. But this depiction unrolls without sufficient context or point of view. As I watched it, I kept thinking of the forgotten German Sixties film, The Bridge (Die Brucke).  In The Bridge, a similarly futile and murderous, though smaller scale, combat sequence becomes a devastating indictment of war; but significantly, the Bridge begins with a long background sequence on all the young soldiers' lives before combat.  That doesn't happen here, nor does the movie take a position on war. I realize Scott followed Mark Bowden's historical account of the events of 1993 and has sought to represent the events `accurately.'  But is it `accurate' not to comment on the fact that this was an effort to relieve famine, and all it ultimately did - despite the success of the operation (because it was a success, though people call it `disastrous') was kill off a thousand men, women, and children of the country as well as eighteen American soldiers?  Ridley Scott's visual spectacle with its chaos and accurate war machinery isn't enough.  A movie about warfare has to do more than present a spectacle of violent action. It has to provide a context and present a viewpoint that takes sensitive account of the people and events it depicts - which in this case would be a whole lot more than the insane little message, `we're good guys and we're heroes, even when we lose,' that the movie leaves us with.  Since this is the story of a huge snafu, an operation badly botched from above that the soldiers salvaged at great loss to themselves, the movie would also have benefited from some of the brilliant ironies David O. Russell brought to the Gulf War in Three Kings, but Black Hawk Down unfortunately is a film without irony and almost without humor, with its violent close-up action so intense and constant, with its personalities so sketchily dramatized, that it actually becomes boring at times.  And that's as cruel to the people depicted as it is to us.  To go through 144 minutes of grueling action and learn nothing is deeply depressing. Young actors like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom do their very best to give soldiering a human face.  So do more mature ones like Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepherd.  But it seems the camera and the equipment and the special effects are the real stars.  This is not entirely surprising coming from Ridley Scott.  Scott has done a few great, even classic, films:  Alien,  Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise.  But he hasn't always scored a win and he has never been noted for subtlety. Last year's Gladiator was much more interesting than this, but still highly overrated. This time he has used a very blunt instrument to dissect an enormously complex subject of contemporary warfare and American foreign policy and he has created a spectacular disappointment."

","To begin with there is almost no story in this movie. And then, theres shooting through the whole movie which one could find amusing but when strange things start to happen. Like 5 soldiers shooting into a mass of villagers with weapons and almost noone gets hit, thats just impossible. And the fact that a rocketlauncher cant harm a chopper laying on the ground is just insane. These thing actually take place and when you see it over and over again it gets boring and you start complaining and laughing cause the movie sucks. I regret I saw that movie cause I didn't get anything out of it, there's no message. I would have rather watched a comedy of some kind.

"SilkTork","7","5","10","2 November 2004"," Flat Perspective
","The consensus of opinion on Black Hawk Down is that as an action film depicting the reality of a battle it is extremely well executed.<br/><br/>But that the personalities of the film's characters are mostly vacant, that they simply react to events without any real engagement with the wider issues of life. <br/><br/>And that, even though it is clear from the film's portrayal of what happened that the raid on Mogadishu was badly handled, that the film somehow makes heroes out of the Rangers.<br/><br/>That even though we are clearly told that over 1,000 Somalis died, that the film ignores their plight.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the film is working. The soldiers personalities are largely vacant. We get enough to show that they are distinct enough to be real people, but that they mostly lack depth. That's all we need.<br/><br/>The wider issues are there. Not exactly hidden. Not exactly in the background. There, clearly in black and white. In every frame. You can't escape from what is happening. We are shown and we are told. And the balance of opinion, as with the balance of weapon technology, is tilted very strongly in favour of the American soldiers.<br/><br/>We are given the flat perspective - just like the aerial pictures of the battle scene the generals are staring at - and we make of it what we will.<br/><br/>I saw an honest and brutal film that depicted quite clearly the imbalance of the battle in terms of numbers of people killed and weapons technology used. I saw the fear and thrill of the American soldiers. Some wanted to go back into the fight - other's were less keen. I saw the mess and the confusion. I saw angry Somalis, intelligent Somalis, violent Somalis, and lots of dead and dying Somalis. I saw the whole complex issue played out in front of me with astonishing clarity given the constant action of the film. I saw points in favour of the Ranger's philosophy of looking after your own. The beloved team spirit of the soldiers versus the clan spirit of the Somalis. The sense of community.<br/><br/>""This is not your war."""

","To see this movie on the top 250 Movies of All Time is just ridiculous. The first 20 minutes is pretty nice.  The breathtaking helicopter shots flying over Mogadishu, the shot of the Muslim praying before the orange sized sun setting in the ocean, these are great images.  After that it's non stop 90 minutes of people getting blown to shreds.  How many helicopters going down and people getting shot, how many people got blown to pieces and had their intestines spraying everywhere shots can one throw into one movie?  I had to see that to figure out that war and violence is pointless?!  They forgot to spend part of there 18 gazzillion dollar budget and get script or a story, not to mention original ideas, concepts or perspectives(see Three Kings if you want to see what this movie was trying to be and failed); they spent it all on the cinematography, film and squinty pretty boy actors.  This doesn't make a movie good though. One of the most soul-less movies I have ever seen. Why people continue to pack theatres and pay 9 dollars a ticket for this movie or movies like this is beyond me.  I need to stop going to the multiplex.  I'm in a bad mood because of this.

"scifiducky","10","3","5","27 July 2017"," Favorite War Movie
","I just want to weigh in on a few issues...<br/><br/>Lots of people are giving 1 star because the movie, based on a true story, skipped some historical context. First of all, show me a ""based on a true story"" without spin; good luck finding one. But moreover, many commenters seemed to leap to the conclusion that due to its absence this film tacitly supported US actions and that US could do no wrong. That's a very different film than I saw which depicted a blundering general feigning sophistication. If you're of this mindset, I challenge you to consider what people would say if the Somali militias were made to be the heroes. Do you think the US was there for no reason at all? They just showed up and started bombing everyone? Of course not, there's a whole long chain of cause and effect, and the fact that the writers selected a particular point in time because they thought it would make the most compelling movie doesn't make them blameworthy for not cataloguing the totality of human history. Moreover, there's nothing particularly nationalistic about this movie. Everyone is acting based on necessity, not some kind of patriotic urge. The mission is about rescuing a downed pilot and the perils involved with that mission. There really isn't any flag-waving, very little back- patting (and what there is doesn't last long) and no discussion about the enemy being barbarians or whatever else other reviews would have you believe. The Somalis were very adamant about fighting off the American intruders, but they weren't depicted as fighting each other, looting, pillaging, raping or anything else like that. Nor was there ever a time where waves and waves of them were being mowed down, and if anything, given the resources depicted in the film, they acted quite cohesively and effectively for a poor militia against the greatest military in the world. You might want to check your own assumptions before saying they were like barbarians or savages or whatever.<br/><br/>I also don't agree with users who think the characters were shallow. The characters were not all cookie-cutter facsimiles of each other. Josh Hartnett was a green platoon leader, sympathetic to the locals in the face of jocular ridicule from most of his platoon. The Captain was a stubborn SOP junkie with ridiculous sports metaphors, the general, as mentioned feigned sophistication, cracked jokes in the TOC, and ultimately came to understand the consequences of his actions, Tom Sizemore was a fantastic gung-ho major (I think) with some of the my favorite one-liners (""Nothing takes 5 minutes!""), Orlando Bloom was a wet-behind the ears nervous, anxious newbie hoping to prove himself, Tom Hardy was just trying to make it through, Ewan McGregor was resentful of his lot in the army and then jumped on the opportunity to be all he could be, and on and on. Moreover, if you've actually served in the army, you'd know that most of these guys are basically kids and don't really have much character chiseled into them yet. As a veteran, it FELT like they were soldiers. When they were prepping for the mission, ribbing each other, and generally chewing the fat, THAT was where it was MOST real to me. I can't attest to the combat because we never had an engagement of this magnitude in Iraq (mostly chasing snipers and dodging rockets, mortars and IEDs), but the characterization of the soldiers was spot on. It also made a lot more sense that the general and the major had the most depth, the special forces guys (who were obviously older) had some gravitas to them, and the rangers were mostly nervous, youthful and similar.<br/><br/>So if you buy all that, then even the detractors admit that the acting, directing, production, sound, etc. were all amazing. I'm not a huge war buff, but I've seen a healthy share, and for me this tops them all. I prefer it over Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Heartbreak Ridge, American Sniper, Full Metal Jacket, Zero Dark Thirty, We Were Soldiers, Three Kings, and slightly but surely even over Hurt Locker and Glory. I think Jarhead is comparable in terms of realism, but that's not really a war movie. Hope this was useful!"
"Monster0352","10","3","5","2 January 2017"," Tier 1 military film!
","This film was one of my favorite films growing up as a child. Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down hits close to home as I grew up in Fort Campbell, Kentucky home of the 101st Airborne division. Mostly all of the people involved in the incident were from that base including my father who served in Mogadishu, Somalia. I remember seeing the film as a child and being blown away with the visual effects and sound. I have always been keen the quality of film. Meaning cinematography and sound editing have been one of the most important parts of making a film and Black Hawk Down hits the nail on the head. Scott has always been an amazing film director and he always manages to choose the best cinematographers and film editors on the market. With this film winning two Oscars it has proved to be one of the best war films ever made. <br/><br/>When it comes to cinematography and film editing, it is the most important element in a film. It can seriously make your film or damage it. I have seen films like Open Water or 50 Shades of Grey (or 50 Shades of Crap) that had poor editing and camera work. In the film Black Hawk Down, the camera work is above par. The brilliant movement makes the viewer believe that he is actually in Mogadishu. And with its Oscar winning editing the film makes you believe that you can actually be getting shot at. As a Marine Corps combat wounded veteran it is very difficult to watch films that can trigger flash backs and unwanted dark memories. There is a reason I don't normally watch war films. But this film has always been a classic for me and my family. The story is not as beautiful as one would want but it is beautiful how the camera makes it. War can sometimes be beautiful. It was sad to see people you knew get injured so severely. But I guess that's what drove me to joining the armed forces. I love to fight. And the will that was presented in this captivating film only gave me the inspiration to fight for my country as well. Yes, films are inspiring whether they are real or fake. Ridley Scott has taken a true life disaster and turned it into Hollywood magic. One of my favorite scenes is the scene where Josh Hartnett's character Eversmann is trying to save his buddy's life in some make shift table. The soldier was shot in the leg. The bullet hit a main artery and his attempt to stop the bleeding makes the viewer believe that he is actually in the room as well. The camera does a magnificent job in producing a realistic environment for the viewer. This is what real cinematography and film editing is all about. Making the viewer believe. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film has changed my life. With the decisions I made as a young Marine, this film has played an influence on how I wanted to carry out my Marine Corps career. With balls of steel. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to watch this film and also to be affected by the film to this day. The camera work and editing has motivated me to either go into cinematography or editing as a career. Scott continues to influence people around the world with amazing directorial skills. One can only be grateful to catch a glimpse of his work."

","After reading the NY times review (which slammed it for not being emotional enough and 'racist'), I need to mention that this film is probably the most realistic and honest war film ever made.<br/><br/>Other works like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan all have a 3rd context, whether its the man vs man, man vs himself or man vs. barbarity as seen in the conflict between Sgt.Barnes and Elias in Platoon. But Black Hawk Down offers none of these and does not dwell on a 'higher meaning', which is this film's greatest strengths.<br/><br/>As one of the Delta characters, Hoot says ""once the bullets go flying past your head, all the politics and all that sh-t goes right out the window"" This film captures the raw, visceral intensity of a group of men trying to stay alive in a hostile city. There is no emotional or philosophical wondering, only a fast paced, gut wrenching fight for one's own life. Ridley Scott masterfully puts the viewer into the combat boots of US Rangers and uses color and scenery to add the depth and character to this situation. Reality and accuracy dominate over philosophy or politics in this film. All your philosophy and all your conflicting emotions go right out the window when a heavily armed mob starts shooting at you."

Director Ridley Scott does a brilliant job depicting the brutality and ruthlessness of war on soldiers. Scott also shows the personal and humanistic side of the soldiers with the care and compassion they show for their comrades. Although short stints following the protagonist Josh Hartnett, the movie really follows the situations of a tight-knit group of brothers. You really get a sense of the loyalty they show for one another as they risk life and death in order to aid their comrades. Although you may not agree with the decisions and principles of the U.S. which resulted in the invasion, the movie will grip you and force you to feel for the soldiers who lived through the hellish event. This movie demands an audience with its realistic portrayal of war and tasteful acting. Overall, the movie gives a brilliant background to the historic battle and illustrates a gruesome picture of the real tragedy of war. The U.S. works hard to fight for what it believes. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in history and war movies. The cinematography is amazing and the severity of the situation brilliantly depicted."

Not a lot of character development, but that's how it is. You realize quickly that what matters is not whether that guy over there has a mom, cat, and girlfriend back at home who are going to miss him, but simply that he is a human being, and he is putting his life on the line for something that he doesn't really understand. I would say more than anything, this movie is pro-solder, pro-human. These guys are shipped to a country they know nothing about, to fight in a war they didn't choose to start, with people they don't know very well, and they get killed for it, and the only thing that matters is right there, right then, living through that moment, and saving the guy next to you, even if you just met him.

","(I saw this in the theater, YMMV)<br/><br/>I had heard how great this film was, that some people called it the greatest war film ever.  Although I knew that was very unlikely to be true, I was shocked at how bad this movie was.<br/><br/>The first, and largest, problem is the latent racism of the movie.  As has been pointed out numerous times there is a creepy racist feel about the film as wholesome, All-American white boys mow down savage, thoughtless black men.  Not a single Somali is portrayed with any depth.  Adid and his followers are relegated to props for the army to shoot.  It is difficult to appreciate this point without seeing the movie.<br/><br/>The next problem is supposed to be it's strong point.  The violence is so stylized, it has no depth.  I never felt anything for any of the characters. For one thing, except for Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor, I had a difficult time telling the actors apart once they were covered in blood and grime.  In addition, I never felt the frustration of the soldiers as they struggled to find the crash site.  There was just one firefight after another.  One part of the movie that does work is when two army snipers make a request to guard the wounded pilots of the second Blackhawk helicopter crash (erm, yes there are two Blackhawks that go down).<br/><br/>Finally, the script is just bad.  This movie jerks the ""get the boys out"" and the ""leave no man behind"" chains throughout the entire movie.  In the few parts of the movie where nobody is shooting at something, the writing is so corny it's painful.<br/><br/>Skip this movie.  There are much better war films to rent."

","Black Hawk Down: a movie that never should have been made.  It depicts the ugliest possible victory in battle:  the attackers extremely unprepared, yet with vastly superior training and coordination they take heavy losses and somehow don't fail.  Does it work as a movie?  It's a full two hours of carnage.  The tension builds from the beginning.  Certain political and ideological motifs run through much of the movie, but fizzle out into exhaustion.  These events led (unfairly) to years of my blind hatred for President Clinton.  I don't understand how Americans will pay to see Kalashnikovs ripping into GIs.  This was front page news a mere 9 years ago. There is always a gap between what people think war is about and how things really are.  How do you rationalize the indiscriminate brutality?  Put it on film.  I'll watch."

It's no wonder that Black Hawk Down, stripped of the Hollywood veneer, is essentially just a very entertaining, very expensive 2+ hour reel of U.S. military propaganda that attempts to portray our involvement in Somalia in the very best light, when in fact there were all sorts of ulterior motives.<br/><br/>For a much more balanced perspective of what really happened, read this article about the movie: www.onlinejournal.com/01-03-02_Chin.pdf"
"rdarlington","Null","4","8","20 January 2002"," A new type of war movie
","Like `Behind Enemy Lines', this is a movie rushed out in the aftermath of the World Trade Center horror, apparently on the assumption that it will make Americans feel better about themselves. It would seem that, in the US, there has been a `Let's kick ass' response but, to this British viewer at least, such a reaction is hard to fathom. Certainly the film is a celebration of comradeship and heroism, but it reminds us of an appalling military misjudgement by the Americans and a lack of political will by the international community.<br/><br/>It depicts in savagely graphic form the outcome of an October 1993 operation in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu when an attempt to detain henchman of the local warlord gave rise to a 15-hour  `firefight' in which 18 American soldiers lost their lives and more than 70 were injured, while something like a thousand Somalians ¬ñ men, women ands children ¬ñ were killed. Elite soldiers of the Rangers and Delta Force regiments go in, supported by Black Hawk and Little Bird helicopters but, from the start, it is a mess, as one soldier falls from Black Hawk, resulting in it being downed by the local militia. This is war as we have never seen it before on the big screen: brutal and confused combat in city streets and houses where the enemy does not wear a uniform or fight by the rules and rescue is far from hand.<br/><br/>This was always going to be a better work than `Behind Enemy Lines' because it is helmed by one of the finest directors around and presents a very much less ¬ëgung ho' depiction of war. Fresh from his success with the wonderful `Gladiator', British Ridley Scott ¬ñ the son of a Royal Marine - has taken locations in Morocco and used magnificent camerawork to produce a stunning visual and visceral record based closely on the book by journalist Mark Bowden. Indeed such is the verisimilitude of Scott's action that one can't always hear what is said or understand what is happening.<br/><br/>As I left the London screen where I saw `Black Hawk Down', I found myself in conversation with the cinema attendant who incredibly happened to be a Somalian who was there in 1993. He assured me that the events were worse than shown in the film ¬ñ we didn't see (fortunately) the parading of the dead Americans through the streets - and the situation is just as bad now as it was then, with four clans controlling different quarters of Mogadishu.<br/><br/>
A year after the disastrous American intervention in Somalia, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan and we all looked the other way until the appalling events of 11 September 2001. If Scott's film serves to remind us that we cannot forgot the injustice in Somalia ¬ñ and other parts of Africa ¬ñ perhaps it will have served a higher purpose than entertainment."

But Black hawk down wasn't in 1945 but in 1992, the soldiers fighting during that movie aren't old or deceased but are in their thirties.  In this war, there are no ""bad guys"", the soldiers only shoot when they get shot at in the first place.

"mattymatt4ever","3","5","11","25 June 2002"," I'm proud to be an American, but does that mean I have to like this movie???!!!
","When I went to my local West Coast Video to return my 3 DVDs (""Black Hawk Down"" being one of them), the clerk asked me, ""How were the movies?""  I succinctly told him, ""'The Majestic' was good; ""Rollerball"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" sucked.  He replied, ""You didn't like 'Black Hawk Down?'  What are you, a Commie?""  I didn't laugh at the joke.  He assumed I took it seriously, but I didn't.  It's just I happen to live in the 21st century and I don't find a joke like that offensive, nor funny.  But I knew where he was getting at:  This is a war movie!  I'm supposed to like it!  It depicts unrelenting American heroes who died face down in the muck for the sake of patriotism.  Well, I respect those heroes--I really do.  And I actually found the (real-life) story of ""Black Hawk Down"" to be touching and powerful.  During the opening and closing credits, when the title cards gave us a vivid idea of the beginning and aftermath of the tragic event, I was really moved.  It's everything between those opening and closing credits that had me anesthetized.  <br/><br/>Many critics and audiences have given Ridley Scott great appraise for creating such ""realistic and groundbreaking war scenes.""  I honestly didn't think they were that great.  I didn't feel the same intensity I felt while watching ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Maybe it was because of Scott's continuous cutting.  Ridley Scott is one of those directors who doesn't believe in staying on one shot for over 2 seconds.  We continuously cut from one area of the battlefield to another to another, etc., etc.  And that's probably what took me out of the film.  That's not including the thinly developed characters.  I especially wanted to get to know Ewan McGregor's character better.  He provided occasional comic relief, but we don't know much about him, other than he loves coffee (and I completely relate, being an avid coffee drinker myself) and is timid when under pressure. <br/><br/>
The acting is good, despite poorly developed characters.  The whole cast gives their all.  I was impressed to find out that a good deal of the characters weren't even American, yet they feigned very convincing accents. I haven't seen Eric Bana, previously to this film, and all I know about him is that he's gonna star in the upcoming ""Incredible Hulk"" movie.  I didn't have a clue that he wasn't American.  I didn't know until I saw him in an interview in the featurette.  Jason Isaacs, who I didn't recognize until the end, was also very convincing.  Josh Hartnett delivers another fine performance.  He's one of the few young actors who I think has great potential in becoming a talented character actor in the future.  I hope he does, so if he wins an Oscar about five or ten years from now, I can tell people that he knew him when he was just a struggling young actor. <br/><br/>
Another thing that irked me was the DVD:  the special features sucked!  As a matter of fact, there were almost no special features.  Usually, a big movie like this is jam-packed with special features like audio commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries about the real-life event, etc.  It has a pretty good featurette, but that's it.  I guess they're gonna wait 'til 2 years from now to release the Collector's Edition with a 2-disc set, like they did with ""Independence Day.""  <br/><br/>Many will probably disagree with my thoughts on ""Black Hawk Down,"" but I'm not gonna pretend to like it to prove I'm a patriot.  The real-life story is powerful; the movie is simply a pointless display of violence.  I know it's a war movie and it's supposed to be violent, but if ALL you're left with is violence, then you have the equivalent of a flashy video game.  And how am I supposed to feel sad when the characters die when I hardly know a thing about them?    <br/><br/>My score:  3 (out of 10)"

","Be prepared for a battle scene that's the longest and most relentlessly intense one you'll ever likely find in a war movie. It all results from a failed mission to extract a Somali warlord's top two advisers, going horribly wrong when first one, and then a second Black Hawk helicopter are brought down by enemy fire in the Somali city of Mogadishu on October 3rd, 1993. Operating under the military dictum of leaving no man behind, members of Delta Special Forces and Army Rangers go into action that's extremely up close, violent and bloody. What one witnesses almost makes it feel like you're actually there, as the drawn out battle makes you wonder if it will ever be over. Oscars for sound and film editing went to this picture and it's not surprising to see why. It's almost two and a half hours of gritty war footage that tests the camaraderie, spirit and resilience of American fighting forces in a virtually impossible situation. Not without it's casualties, the American side loses nineteen of it's bravest while inflicting untold damage on the Somali capital and a thousand of it's fanatical adherents to Mohammed Aidid. A brief moment of triumph is allowed at the finale as regular Somali citizens enduring hardship and starvation under Aidid welcome the American soldiers who tried to make things right. It's not enough though, to make it seem like the Special Forces and Army Rangers were victorious."
"harrylosborne","7","2","3","14 May 2019"," A big budget, low substance war film
","If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this is a good war film: a cast ahead of its time (such as relative unknowns Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor) dropped into a war zone very different to those often portrayed on the big screen. Beyond this, however, not a lot more is on show - the fight scenes are predictable and simplistic, and a script isn't really required in between the bursts of gunfire. Black Hawk Down also leans fairly heavily on the trope of ""down but not out"", as every squad seems to be afflicted by someone who is a magnet for shrapnel and bullets, but continues to push through the swathes of war.<br/><br/>The production value salvages a lot for this movie, creating an atmosphere of legitimate danger often missing from action films. Furthermore, the use of aerial combat shows a degree of confidence from the producers (often avoided when budgets are slightly more restrictive). Black Hawk Down doesn't quite exceed the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but certaininly is above average on the merits of its hectic battle scenes."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","2","3","9 March 2018"," Black Hawk Down is a competent, confident and chaotic war film.
","It tells the true story of a raid in Mogadishu that lead to the first battle between the Somalian Militia and American Rangers. As the title suggests, a Black Hawk does indeed go down. This is a mighty difficult flick to rate. As a representation of modern warfare, it succeeds substantially and sits in the elite group of visceral war films. But as a complete movie? Questionable. Firstly Ridley Scott is such a consistent director in terms of tackling a genre and producing a film that defines that genre. Black Hawk Down is no different, his eye for technical technique and production is second to none. A war torn Mogadishu, practical explosions and effects, utilisation of real Black Hawks and army equipment. It's authentic, and that is a real important factor for a war film. The narrative subtly explores the cost of war on both sides. The US army losing valuable soldiers and equipment (which financially would set them back quite largely) and the Somalian families who are living in ruins. There will always be one view point that towers over the other, but there is the gritty imagery of war and the aftermath that it leaves behind which proves to be effective. This has a massive ensemble cast, with Josh Hartnett being the lead I guess (he is on the cover, sooooo technically...he is the lead). He doesn't deliver, in fact many of the actors don't. That's not their fault though. Scott purposefully chose to focus on the aspects of war rather than glorified American heroes. Even so, there is such limited characterisation that any loss of life delivers no emotional impact for the audience. It's no spoiler that many succumb to their wounds, and yet we're supposed to feel saddened. I physically cannot feel emotive towards someone who I can't relate to, or even care for. That is what prevents this from being an outstanding war film like many classics before. Jason Isaacs was probably the stand out performance for me. Still a decent war flick, it's powerful imagery just about saves it from being lifeless."

","'Only the dead have known the end of war.'<br/><br/>This is the statement by the classical philosopher Plato with which the film commences. And it is well chosen for this is the theme of this magnificent and thought provoking film. <br/><br/>I don't need to say any more on the excellent cinematography and pacing of Black Hawk Down, as so many of the threads have noted. It is a Ridley Scott film after all. His eye never fails him but he is always reliant on a good script and his failures have been films lacking them but here the script is for its subject spot on. <br/><br/>I wish to make my own personal, political observation, which is what the film provokes in me, beyond, of course, its excellent entertainment value. <br/><br/>In the jargon of geopolitics, Somalia was, and today tragically still is, a 'failed state'. Without preaching at you, Black Hawk Down gives you the visceral experience of what fighting in a failed state is like, from both the American and the Somali perspective. The film hints at the limits of American power with echoes of the previous American defeat in Vietnam but also at the idealism which brought American soldiers into the country in the first place, trying to bring peace, justice and food to the desperate, starving and cruelly exploited Somali populace. The fate of the West, and perhaps the fate of the world, now more than ever will depend upon a hundred more such missions as depicted in Black Hawk Down and whether we win them or not; indeed, whether we fight them or not. This is the ultimate test of humanity, to be borne by both civilians in the midst of a brutal civil war and the peacekeeper soldiers brought in from outside whose story is told in this film. <br/><br/>This entertaining but also harrowing film provides the cue for the more thoughtful of us to reflect on the human condition. Given the perfect geopolitical storm, is any country on this earth, , entirely immune from the risk of becoming a 'failed state'? We should not arrogantly assume that any of our countries could never, ever descend to the level of Somalia, with brave but stressed soldiers struggling to hold the ring and civilians caught in the murderous crossfire. This is what Black Hawk Down means philosophically to me, a warning for the future for any country, however prosperous and peaceful it may presently be, and a warning for the future of humanity. <br/><br/>With regard to the performances, I thought that Eric Bana was particularly good in the film as a reflective, quietly competent, decent and brave American soldier. I wish we had subsequently seen more of him."

","Bullets flying, bodies dropping, explosions, and quick making decisions is constant with this film. Black Hawk Down based off a true story gives you the idea what the soldiers faced when having to run through the town trying to regroup, and rescue their fallen comrades.<br/><br/>This movie is a double punch from the moment they entered Somalia to extract the drug lords from the homeland. A simple capture mission turned into a rescue mission for the black hawk crew that's helicopter was shot down during flight. With the whole black market of mercenaries and regular citizens totting around assault rifles and rocket propelled grenades opening fire on the united states special forces, the small group of military was overwhelmed. Shooting in the streets of Somalia, soldiers getting separated, convoys with drug lords and soldiers under siege, with helicopters shot down, and soldiers injured and trapped within this is the ultimate chaos all the united states soldiers are facing."

","Many people may disagree with this but in my opinion, this is one of the best war films ever made. Sure, it's not a masterpiece but in my opinion, it's very close to being one. This movie is a highly well-done experience.<br/><br/>123 U.S. soldiers are dropped into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and they find themselves in a desperate battle with a large number of heavily-armed Somalis.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has created one of the most realistic war movies ever. I actually felt that I was in the middle of the war-zone as it was going on. Because of how much it felt like the actual story, the movie creates a high amount of tension and it makes the viewer realize what exactly went on when the real event happened. The movie does an especially superb job on this because of the realistic environments, shots, and acting.<br/><br/>The score is fantastic. When certain scenes happen, it draws emotions out of us. Unlike a lot of movies, Black Hawk Down's score works with the movie. This means that without the music when a certain character dies off or when another important scene happens, it will have an impact on you regardless. But the score makes that feeling you had more massive.<br/><br/>Many people dislike the fact that this movie didn't have much character development. It is true that it's light on it but this film isn't focused on developing the characters, nor does it have to. It's completely dedicated to providing us with a first-person perspective of being in the middle of combat.<br/><br/>This movie does have a lot of suspense but it can be a bit mundane getting to the good parts. The opening is quite overlong and dry. It is full of military jargon and diagrams. But despite this, this movie is definitely worth seeing. After the opening is over, you're in for a big treat.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, this is a truly outstanding movie. Even though the opening is slow, this movie will impress you because of how realistic it is. It has realistic environments, shots, and acting. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest war films ever made."

","Ridley Scott, director of Gladiator (2000), takes the audience into an intense and realistic re-imagining of an ill-fated mission that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia back in 1993, with gritty performances by a strong ensemble cast and spectacular combat action-set pieces. Set in October 1993, Black Hawk Down tells the story of 123 elite U.S soldiers sent to Mogadishu on a mission to capture Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aided, who has lead mass starvation to the country. Before too long, the mission goes terribly awry when the two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leaving the U.S army in a brutal fight for their lives against the Somalian army. The film features a stellar cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Willaim Fichtner, Ewen Bremmer, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, and many others.<br/><br/>What I expect from a war movie is for the horrors of war is to be demonstrated in a strong and authentic manner, and this movie sets a great example of how they should be portrayed. This movie does an incredible job on depicting the harsh reality of soldiers in combat. The plot follows the story how these soldiers are caught in a highly stressful situation when their helicopters are shot down and how they struggle to survive with no help on the way. The combat scenes are absolutely amazing, the camera work and sound editing are very well done and as you are watching these scenes, you get the feeling that you are actually in the middle of the battle. The combat definitely does not hold back in terms of intensity, they are extremely bloody and graphic, and can be tough to watch for those with weak stomachs. At the same time, they are very realistic and give the scenes a gritty atmosphere.<br/><br/>While the film does an amazing job on portraying the realism of active combat, the only thing I think it struggles with is the character development. While few of the characters like Josh Hartnett's character Sergeant Matt Eversmann is well constructed and easy to remember, the lot of the characters feel a bit thin, and therefore, not very comprehensible. However, if you really get into the plot and the action, it will be pretty easy to forgive the flawed character development.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is certainly one of the most realistic and powerful war movies Hollywood has to offer. Ridley Scott did a magnificent job with this movie, and I am proud with the awards it received. This film does get extremely intense, but it is a must-watch for those who have yet to see it."

Black Hawk Down boasts a fantastic cast which includes the likes of Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Jason Issacs, Ewan McGregor and others. It also hosts many future stars such as Orlando Bloom, Hugh Dancy, Tom Hardy, and Ty Burrell. Their performances were very good, but the real star here is the fantastic direction of Ridley Scott. His atmospheric style is in full effect here and it provides unrivaled intensity. No movie will be able to immerse its audience into its action as well as Black Hawk Down until Gravity in 2013. Adding to this immersion and intensity is Hans Zimmer's fantastic score which resonates the setting and themes of the movie. For as visually stunning as Black Hawk Down is, it lacks character development. This however is expected with so many characters and so many stories to follow. This negative is not enough to warrant giving Black Hawk Down anything less than a ten. It is an experience that very few other movies can rival."
"RossRivero99","10","2","3","15 May 2014"," Ridley Scott's boldest motion picture since Gladiator
","Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is not only one of the best war movies ever made but it is also a great movie at the same time. The movie tells the horrific story about 123 U.S. soldiers who drop into Somalia to capture 2 top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and end up finding themselves in a desperate battle with the Somalis. The movie stars Josh Hartnett in the title role as Eversmann one of the soldiers who fought bravely in that war,And as Oliver Stone said in his second Oscar acceptance speech "" That we learned nothing from the Vietnam War"". Just like we learned nothing from the battle in Somalia,Director Ridley Scott really showed how he really felt bad for those soldiers that suffered the casualties of war. The movie compares to war classics such as Patton, Saving Private Ryan, The Deer Hunter, Platoon,From Here to Eternity,The Devil's Brigade, Heartbreak Ridge, and Flags of Our Fathers. Also the movie had the exact emotional impact as Saving Private Ryan because what Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan was that he tried to show how bad the World War II was, But Scott does the exact same thing here but has nothing to do with the WWII topic."
"faulklane","9","2","3","11 April 2014"," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","Director Ridley Scott based his movie Black Hawk Down off of the events that happened in Mogadishu in 1993. This movie, in my opinion, is one of my favorite war movies I've seen. Ridley Scott did his best to reconstruct everything that happened on the day of the raid. The acting was superb, showing the emotions that might have been shown by the soldiers. The acting was fantastic, almost as if they were in the battle themselves. The movie is very suspenseful how Ridley made you want to know what was going to happen next. The movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen. Black Hawk Down is one of those war movies that make you appreciate what the military does for this country."
"kari-lh","10","2","3","17 November 2013"," Some where there to kick ass, others to try to make a difference
","This film is about a simple mission that is supposed to take an hour maximum. That soon changes into a full blown battle when a black hawk is shot down. At that moment the U.S. forces loose their initiative and complete chaos breaks out in the streets of Mogadishu as the soldiers are heavily outnumbered trying to stay alive and most importantly keeping their friends alive too. The only advantage they have is their training although many lack the experience.<br/><br/>But what is it that makes this film so good? For me it's the reality. Although I have never seen war with my own eyes this film is what I think comes the closest to showing the brutality of warfare. Ridley Scott is a genius in making the perfect atmosphere and that is not lacking in this film.<br/><br/>But why is this film more realistic than most other war films? I noticed one thing while watching which takes a huge part in this films excellence. In the battle scenes, everything happens very fast. There are no pausing moments even though something tragic happens there are no close ups of the soldiers faces or emotional music in the background. The battle continues in the same speed as before much like in reality. Now you may be thinking ""but what kind of a war film doesn't have emotional scenes?"" Well this film has emotional scenes and lots of them. They just don't happen in the heat of the battle but instead when the battle slows down or when the soldiers are in a safe place for the time being. It's then when they have time to take a breath and get their minds straight. Thats when they realize all the horror that has taken place. That has a lot of effect on the viewers as well because now we have time to think about the previous events. If you have ever been in a tough situation where you are suddenly in a danger of harming yourself you would know that you don't really think about what to do, you just do it. It isn't until it's over when you realize what has happened.<br/><br/>Another thing that helps to make this film so real is that there is no main character. You get to know a few characters but none of them is more important than the other. Ofcurse some have more screen time than others but I think it's very well balanced. Having many characters and no hero that tells the story makes it much easier to connect to them and place yourself in their steps.<br/><br/>I think this is the best anti war film ever made. Yes this is an anti war film although it tells a true story about a ""successful"" mission. First of all because the amount of reality as I have talked about, and secondly this mission wasn't really that successful. The tragic truth is that 19 men died in vain. Aidid was still in command. Although he was not the key to the crisis because if you look at Somalia today 20 years later it's still pretty much the same.<br/><br/>This film isn't about the mission itself or whether it was successful or not. It's about the men that fight the battle. Even though I think those men died in vain, they are no less heroes as other brave soldiers who die in war. They are heroes because they always look out for each other and leave no man behind. Hoot describes it very well when he explains why he is always on the front lines. ""They wouldn't understand why we do it, they wouldn't understand that it's about the man next to you."" And for me that is what this film is all about. These soldiers are trying to make a difference, to watch out for each other, make sure every one gets home alive. It's just that you don't have much luck trying to make a difference with a gun in your hand.<br/><br/>I said earlier that I haven't seen war with my own eyes, but this I know well. My fathers older brother worked for the red cross in Afghanistan 6 months before the battle of Mogadishu. He was shot down trying to safe wounded men. He is the only Icelander that has died working for the red cross. Although that is 3 years before I was born I fully understand this event. He knew the risks but the will to help people who needed it badly that is what kept him working there. It's pretty much the same for those soldiers fighting on the streets of Mogadishu watching out for each other. But their job was not to help people, their job was to fight back. They were all trying the best they could to help but that doesn't really work well with a gun in your hand.<br/><br/>In the end this film tells the true story of the soldiers fighting the battle of Mogadishu. No Hollywood style action and no unrealistic events. It tells the truth."
"Chase_Witherspoon","8","2","3","12 October 2012"," Mission into chaos
","Graphic, full throttle account of the fatal mission into Somalia in 1993 where two US Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by improvised Somali rebel forces. What starts out as a seemingly straight-forward (though not without risks) mission to abduct two high ranking rebel soldiers under the expert guidance of Sam Shepard, soon turns to rubble forcing a number of elite special forces soldiers to risk their lives to retrieve the survivors and casualties as the local population turns against them in droves.<br/><br/>Eclectic cast is a bit of an ensemble without a clear headliner, each top-line cast member essentially starring in his own vignette from a different perspective of the battle. Ewen McGregor drops his trademark Scottish brogue as a sheepish, inexperienced marine who's suddenly thrust into a recovery mission more deadly than he anticipated, while Eric Bana also parks his familiar Aussie accent to play a gung-ho urban warrior who lives and breathes firefights. I don't think Bana conveys the swingers to pull that character off, but fortunately the supporting cast of William Fichtner and Tom Sizemore have more than enough testosterone to leave no doubt they're hard-boiled.<br/><br/>It's a cut above the more recent offerings, doesn't do pathos and while there's a modest amount of jingoism reflected in the dialogue, it's not over-bearing. Some of the stunts are impressive and the raw and realistic manner in which the Somali rebels are played, is a pretty terrifying enemy to contemplate, despite their apparent lack of resources and professionalism (in this respect there's shades of the embassy battle scene from ""Rules of Engagement"", though more relentless). Hard-hitting, highly entertaining modern war movie."
"jdkraus","10","2","3","19 January 2012"," Visually gripping...it will leave you thinking about it
","Years ago, I read Mark Bowden's novel Black Hawk Down. I found it engaging, powerful, and emotional. What made the novel such a successful was how well the author described the perspectives of the men who fought that long day battle in Somalia. Though it is usually unfair to compare the book to the movie (since the book is generally better), the film Black Hawk Down is a visually gripping adaptation. Like the novel, the sum of movie's story is about how things go to hell in a handbag. This film is unlike most other war pictures. There is no hidden, anti-war propaganda like in Platoon. Nor is it even about heroism like Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Instead it is about trying to survive from the gates of hell, and working as a team to do so. <br/><br/>It is 1993. The Somali leader at the time holds an iron fist over his people. 123 soldiers are sent to capture a warlord and his lieutenants. The operation is supposed to take no more than an hour. The mission immediately goes wrong when one of the soldiers falls from one of the helicopters. Medics rush in to take the injured soldier out of action. As this happens, the entire city turns on the US ground troops. Within less than an hour of fighting, two helicopters are shot down. It then becomes a game as to which platoon of soldiers can reach the crashed choppers and rescue any potential survivors. The phrase ""No man left behind"" took on a new meaning for me as more and more soldiers attempt to rescue these survivors as well as the dead at the expense of their own lives. In the end, the 19 American soldiers are dead and another 70 are wounded.<br/><br/>Like the novel, the movie has the tendency of jumping around a bit, from one character to the next. This is intentional, for as the battle gets worse, the divisions of soldiers become separated and lost within a sea of hostiles. This puts our confusion with the characters. We feel for them for we don't know what's going to happen next. Most of the time, we do not even know where they are within the city. The lack of radios and walkie talkies make it harder for the soldiers to communicate with another and the limited gear, such as no night vision goggles, body armor, or canteens, makes it all the worse. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Slawomir Idziak gives us the grittiness of the situation. The use of the hand-held camera makes you feel as if you are right with the soldiers as bullets and RPGS whiz by. The various color filters used throughout the movie reiterates the grim and sad experience of death and destruction. For instance, the opening sequence of the dead and dying Somalis has a tungsten (blue) setting. This is an unusual filter to use for a desert location. It would seem more suitable to use bright, highly saturated colors. However, the use of the bluish tint creates a very forlorn, almost dreamlike experience. The green tint that is used during the night fighting in Mogadishu is not only reminiscent to night vision goggles, but it also creates a chilling feeling as the American soldiers desperately fight to survive. <br/><br/>The sound design puts a heavy emphasis on the gunshots and explosions. When an RPG is fired, you know when it is time to duck. The movie does not shy away from bloodshed either. Though not nearly as bad as Saving Private Ryan there are many grisly images. One that still sticks to my mind is when a soldier is blown in half by a RPG. Worse, the man is still alive when he shouldn't be. This was vividly described in the novel and it is more alarming to see on a TV screen. Scenes like these are not meant to make us feel nauseated, but rather it depicts the inhumanity of war. It is an emotionally draining experience as we watch such brutality. <br/><br/>The final shot of the film shows all the caskets of the soldiers who lost their lives. This poses an important question to the audience. Why? Why did this happen? Why didn't the strategists plan for such an ambush? Why were we in Somali in the first place? By the end of the film, you cannot help but think of the lunacy as to why all these men were maimed and killed."

","In 1993, American Army Rangers were in Somalia, participating in the OPeration Restore Hope, where they were to help out the people of Somalia gives fresh food and water. Within minutes, all of that was ended up in war. Ridley Scott directs the war epic, Black Hawk Down. Josh Harnett plays one of the soldiers, who participates in the mission. The mission was a raid to contain the people in the raid as the Rangers seal up the area. Soon enough, the raid turns into a disaster as one of the helicopter is shot out of the sky. The raid turn into a rescue and survival mission. While watching Black Hawk Down, I felt the rush of action and war fill up completely. Black Hawk Down is about the mission failure of taking down a Somalia warlord during the 1993 Mogadishu raid. 19 American soldiers died during this raid and over 1000 Somalis died during this event. I really was hooked by this movie because it was loud, yet remarkable and outstanding. The director, Ridley Scott, filled the screen with buckets of blood and gunfire. I salute the 19 American soldiers who lost their lives during this raid and they will never be forgotten.

","I'm used to typing fairly lengthy comments on IMDb by now (nearly 500 at this point), but I can't think of much to say about ""Black Hawk Down"". I can't really express in words how this film made me feel- it's brutal, tough to watch, unpleasant, completely captivating, stunningly well-shot and edited, quite well-written, and ultimately one of the most uncompromising and unromantic war films ever made. Ridley Scott is an inconsistent director but when he's on form he's really on form, and ""Black Hawk Down"" is a great film. I don't care for the cast all that much, but this is still an absolutely stunning film. After half an hour of introduction to the characters and situation we are thrust into battle. The effect on the audience is tremendously powerful in how sudden and explosive it is, and aside from the near-constantly playing music, ""Black Hawk Down"" is pure, unadulterated carnage which seeks to accurately depict the events in Mogadishu and succeeds.

","The best war movie ever!!! Very inspiring, full of courage...even from the plot line you can figure out that the message is very strong and full of compassion for your fellow next to you, that maybe is not on the battle field, but struggles a life battle!!! I would recommend this to all war movie fans but not only. I watched it with a friend of mine (19years old girl) and she loved it... So girls don't think that just because it's a war movie it's bad, or out of order, plus...it's the history of our nation, by watching this you can get into the lives and feelings of our soldiers... The action takes place in Mogadishu/Somalia where two Amnerican troops are sent to make peace among the Somali citizens and Aidid (drug Lord), who have all the power in the state. A mission that should have been a simple exercise for the Delta Force team and the Rangers' team turns out to be a horrible war in which many of American soldiers loose their liefs and many got injured."
"ihc3","8","2","3","16 November 2006"," Review
","Black Hawk Down: Good Movie Ian Cook 10/28/06<br/><br/>US Military Forces had been in Somalia outside of Mogadishu for six weeks in October of 1993 in an effort to capture two top officials in the Aideed regime and restore order in the wake of civil war when the events of Black Hawk Down transpired. Black Hawk Down is a film based on a book that takes the viewer through an intimate perspective of the prolonged mission that went awry as a tribute to the Americans that died during the conflict.<br/><br/>The screenplay provides a good and thorough description of the Rangers and the mission from beginning to end, but fails to develop the characters fully. The film does, however, demonstrate incredibly well the comradery between the troops in the grim face of war. The action remains overwhelmingly engaging for the entirety of the movie without unnecessary drama that is common in war-like action movies.<br/><br/>The film also manages to successfully include more political issues surrounding the conflict including general US involvement, the seizing of food distributions, the interaction between the US and UN forces, and the disruption of civilian natives. The faceless acting also demonstrates how strongly the Somalis feel for their cause as many armed and unarmed people emotionally and bravely storm the crash site, or as children run with the exiting Rangers.<br/><br/>The cinematography in itself is quite impressive, but moreover compliments the special effects incredibly with the integration of medium and over the shoulder shots, which provide an intimate interaction with the viewer without losing realism or context of the scene with tight shots. While the opening track is a little distracting and misleading along with the visual portrayal of Somalia, the tonal music beds throughout the movie set the emotion of the scene effectively when necessary. The sound work is also quite well done because it takes a realistic, not emotional, approach to convey most scenes.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Black Hawk Down provides a detailed chronological perspective of the operation as well as some background to the conflict in well managed entertaining manner. Well worth seeing, even to write an essay about."
"Mister-S","6","2","3","19 March 2006"," A movie of wishes
","Whilst this is an undoubtedly well made film which gets into the heart of battle in the same way the opening to Private Ryan does, it is spoilt only by the insertion of far too many ""gung-ho/emotional"" comments from the soldiers themselves. A kind of Oprah Goes To War.<br/><br/>The simplistic heavy-handed way in which American forces fight is shown (and the consequences thereof) but despite the way in which the film tries to turn around the mistakes it does leave them in a bad light. The shouting, the poor training, the mistakes and wrong decisions are all displayed.<br/><br/>The final credits begin with a display of the name of 19 soldiers killed in the event. It also mentions in passing the 1,000 Somalians who died and it is typical of the film that they are anonymous and far, far less important. Americans are worth more than Africans it seems."
"mr_impatient_5","9","2","3","28 August 2005"," One Of the best War Films Ever
","As a war film, ""Black Hawk Down"" is first rate. It's exciting, well paced, and full of lots of action. Director Ridley Scott proves to be at home with the adrenalin rush of modern technological warfare, piling on the firefights, helicopter crashes, and bloody carnage. Continuing the visceral tradition of war films post-""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Black Hawk Down"" scatters body parts round the screen like confetti.<br/><br/>The problem is that its subject - American soldiers fighting Somali Muslims - is too close to the current world situation to suit a no-brains action story. In a belated attempt to mould the film to suit the post-September 11th climate, the film makers have added a series of opening and closing titles that desperately try to say something about the Battle of Mogadishu's wider significance, but these simply seem hastily written and ill advised.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" doesn't so much lose sight of the political factors behind the action, as never actually notice them until after the event making it less a film about the American experience in Somalia than a patriotic airbrushing of what was actually America's worst day of combat since Vietnam."
"keys2494","8","2","3","3 August 2005"," Black Hawk Soars!
","Black Hawk down in an amazing film, portraying the bloodshed and tribulation faced by American soldiers in Somalia. The film was as gory as it was real. The story is based around a platoon of soldiers, who went unsuspectingly into War Lord territory to give supplies of food and medication, and to attempt to keep close surveillance on these War Lords. The film changes direction and feeling as soon as it is made quite clear that they are not going to be out by night fall. In fact, they may not even get out alive. Starring Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGreggor, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom this film is both honest and tragic.<br/><br/>The performances were excellent. Acting is an art of being able to display the exact mind frame and mannerism of those who you are portraying. I wouldn't go so far as to say I felt what they felt, but rather that the pain was evident in the actors eyes. I believe this is an amazing ability. No doubt the film was excessively gory, which really cannot be avoided to be honest. Not of my taste, but it is honest which is the most important thing. No one can ever know how terrible war REALLY is, until they have seen it like this. It is so violent, and so disgusting that it changes the way you perceive the military (at least for me). Black Hawk Down brings you back to the reality and suffering of others. It also makes clear the reality of the African situation. The corruption and villainous behavior of African DesPots is made even more real and reminds you of how despicable they really are.<br/><br/>A thrilling film. Not one for a cheer up, but definitely worth seeing from an intellectual point of view. A wonderful film truly worth your time and money."

The best part of this film is the fact that it kind of put you in the shoes of the soldiers and their feelings and emotions another great aspects in this film is the way the soldiers communicate with one another you can really imagine American working class men talking like that with one another. the fight scenes in the film are also great The action in this film combined with the realism and speech makes this the best war film ever and one of the greatest films ever"
"cseavers","9","2","3","2 March 2005"," Not an Ordinary Movie
","Many films have many purposes. Not only that, but many films have many clich√©s. Black Hawk Down is not any ordinary film. War is an undervalued subject; many people do not understand its principality. Unfortunately, things in Somalia did not go according to plan. The mission was to be an in-and-out, only lasting an hour. But one minor mishap, combined with the determination of American forces to not leave behind any of their number, produced the bloodiest U.S. military action since Vietnam. Saying this, Black Hawk Down is no ordinary film.<br/><br/>The screenplay and character development could've been more persuading in some instances. Quite Frankly; Black Hawk Down tells us nothing we didn't already know about the hell of war and the nature of bravery. Separating itself from other war movies, Black Hawk Down tends to fall back from the familiar clich√© of the usual solo-hero. Black Hawk Down compresses so many tales of courage under fire into one, big narrative that it leaves little room for individual heroics. The audience comes into contact with a newly promoted Sergeant Eversmann who does his best to keep his platoon strong and intact; and he seems like the closest thing to a hero. Otherwise, the movie doesn't focus on one main character, which in a way is good because it allows the audience to escape from the good ole' fashioned scenario of an ordinary hero.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Hawk Down is an enthralling movie that I would recommend to any viewers above the age fifteen and those that underestimate the true concept of war."
"brianakarobin","8","2","3","11 August 2004"," Good movie
","I just saw this movie last night, and thought it was an excellent movie.  I liked it for many reasons, but mostly I felt it was an accurate depiction, and especially in that they did not try to make any of the rangers or delta force guys out to be some supernatural hero, but instead displayed them as they are more likely to be - human and vulnerable, and perhaps because of that, even more heroic.<br/><br/>I also felt like posting because I just read the last review (by Shea someone - forget now) and had some comments about that.  The first are nitpicky - Tom Sizemore did not play the Delta Force character you mention - Eric Bana did (who later played in Hulk).  Sergeant Matt Everston did not lead the raid by any means.  He wa sin charge of one of the 4 Ranger Chalks, which think are kind of like platoons.  An Army Ranger Captain was over the 4 Chalks, and a Lieutenant Colonel was in charge of the ground mission as a whole (both of whom participated in the mission, not just from the sidelines).<br/><br/>I also wanted to comment on their comment about it as well taking a negative stance on war (pro vs. con).  I didn't think that it did.  And there was also a statement that this was a war they should never have been involved in.  I think that is a difficult thing to say.  Perhaps the wrong move was to take them out when the going got tough.  It wasn't that they were interfering in a civil war.  It's that they were standing up for human rights.  Warlords were hording food and hundreds of thousands were dying. Certainly that justifies some intervention, but we could debate to no end whether war is justified of not, and so I won't even go there.  But it is easy to say they never should have been there, but also not fair to say that.  I personally think they should have stayed, but this is my opinion, and not a fact.  <br/><br/>Anyway, in short I thought the film was good, and based on documentaries of the same event, it seems to be fairly accurate in protraying the situation as it was in Somalia in 1993.  A job well done."

","Not quite as realistic and soul searching as certain scenes within Saving Private Ryan, but the sheer length and ferocity of the battle scenes within Black Hawk Down make it well worth viewing. In my opinion the lead character Josh Hartnett is slightly lacking in personality and is outshone by Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore (both of whom provide an amount of humour within the battle). Not giving any of the plot away here (the film title tells you), but the moment the first Black Hawk is downed is atmospheric and tension drenched, and still sends a shiver down my spine when I watch the film subsequently.<br/><br/>The film does clearly show how horrific war must be, and with surround sound and large screen, you can almost imagine being there on occasions. If the film has a fault, it is the way that the ending seems to peter out to nothing, but otherwise it is well worth the video rental."

"minnow-6","9","2","3","20 January 2002"," Focus is the reason Black Hawk Down is a really good movie
","Black Hawk Down **** One of the best movies of 2001.<br/><br/>A story about a moment; a story about a feeling, a story about an accomplishment can be really good or even great when focused. Black Hawk Down does this brilliantly. The moment is 16 hours, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. The feeling is confusion. The accomplishment is doing the job you are trained to do. Black Hawk Down stays focused for 2 ¬Ω hours on the lives of couple hundred U.S. soldiers that are ordered into a very dangerous situation to arrest two men that the United States and United Nations believes are stopping the distribution of food to Somalia civilians. The men to be arrested are in a market district of Mogadishu that is very heavily defended. The firepower provided to accomplish the mission is restricted by Pentagon or Washington D.C. directives.<br/><br/>Given their orders, the U.S. soldiers move in for what is planned to be a 2 or 3 hour mission. The arrests are made but then two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The soldiers are ordered to secure the crash sites and wait for the rescue units to come in and retrieve them. The well-armed and organized Mogadishu fighters that control this part of the city, hold down the U.S. soldiers. The U.S. convey that is moving in to rescue and retrieve is lost on the narrow and unmarked streets of the city. Roadblocks have changed the planned route of entry and egress. Overhead cameras on surveillance helicopters are sending pictures to the command post. Routing instructions are useless because the convoy passes the turn points before instructions can be relayed.  All the while, the men in the convoy, the men moving toward and at the crash sites, and the men with the prisoners are under intense and constant enemy fire.<br/><br/>Even after watching for 2 ¬Ω hours it is impossible for me to imagine the fear and confusion that must have been weighting on these men.  Ridley Scott uses all the special effects technology available to him as a filmmaker to make bullets, rockets, blood and guts seem real or at least terrifying.  And after 16 hours (the real time for this battle) these men stayed true to their mission.  They accomplished what they were trained, asked, ordered to do.  Only sixteen Americans died which seems amazing when watching this reenactment of the battle.  <br/><br/>The best line of the movie comes at the end when one soldier explains to another that he doesn't even want to try and explain what he does and why he does it for the people back home.  `They won't understand.'  I know he's right.  This movie knows he's right. And that's what makes Black Hawk Down a good movie. The movie stays focused on the 16-hour battle and the U.S. soldiers doing their job and the conditions under which they had to do this job.  Focus is the reason Black Hawk Down is a really good movie.<br/><br/>
On a side note: whether you see the movie or not, I highly recommend the book by Mark Bowden.  Bowden's book relates the same confusion, fear, and resolve that we see in the movie.  While focused on the 16-hour battle, the book is able to go beyond the fight and tells us about some of the men.  It also sets up the political situation that contributed to U.S. soldiers being put into this situation.  The epilogue to the book is a fascinating, yet brief, telling how Bowden was able to find this story and learn what happen so he could write the book.<br/><br/>Read the book.  Go see the movie.  Both are ****."

That's the thing with these films - they highlight things that people may not be aware of or remember.<br/><br/>My first impressions were of sheer awe (as usual) at Ridley Scott's visual control and pace, the battle scenes being among the best I've seen, easily comparable to the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan - only longer. The action was well handled, and the events accurately recreated. I have to say that the beginning was a bit timid, and felt like more of a chore to try and establish characters.<br/><br/>The amount of work that went into recreating the battle as accurately as possible is perhaps this film's main downfall. At the beginning we are really only given faces to recognise rather than characters, and I for one couldn't remember any of the names of the guys we were watching. Eventually I just gave up and enjoyed the view. Also, had I not heard the general plot before seeing it, I might have forgotten why the marines went into the town in the first place. The dialogue was the usual, cliche ridden macho marine talk, you know, like ""Go go go!"" etc., but the brotherly nature between the soldiers is very evident. There are other war movie cliches involved, the ""Tell my kids this that and the other thing"" when a soldier's on his death bed, and the guy tending to him going ""No, you can tell them yourself, you're gonna be OK"". Of course, this scene has been done so many times with the same outcome you have to really wonder why they still do it. My final gripe is that the 'War is Hell' motif has been done to death.<br/><br/>This is by no means a subtle film, and that can either be a strength or a weakness, depending on your point of view. I reckon that it's a strength in that it brings the reality to light of what happened in '93. I was amazed that they managed to cosily fit in some comic relief in this hellish battle. I reckon that things like that are a mark of a good director (or writer for that matter). To be able to make the audience laugh through such a serious film is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this is an excellent chronicle of what happened in Mogadishu, with the biting, gory reality well depicted, and shot by a master artist - Ridley Scott is a pure photographer. However, where this film succeeds as a chronicle is maybe where it fails as a movie.<br/><br/>7 / 10"

"fredroyer","8","1","1","27 December 2019"," Sam as our Shepard
","Ridley long passed the point where he makes movies about the story... somewhere around Black Rain. His movies since then have been about the making of that movie. What you might call self-referential. I call it folding.<br/><br/>There's a reason Sam Shepard was cast as the General devising the mission. He's our stand-in for Ridley. Sam himself was a playwright, and as a fringe celebrity himself, hanging alongside the margins of the 1975 Dylan Rolling Thunder tour. Then he got into movies where he's almost always cast as The Man. Watch as Sam ""directs"" the proceedings, then has to adjust to things on the fly. This is a movie about making movies.<br/><br/>This is the movie making phase where Ridley is into his second wind, the experience of Gladiator and digital cinematography having inspired him. This was so well made, I could not tell the seams of the digital backgrounds until I invested in a top of the line thin screen TV.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not intended to explain anything or illuminate anything. It's just a movie.<br/><br/>Full disclosure, I attended a college class with one of the Ranger survivors. This was 1996, most Americans had no idea what went down. He told the story of how they were there to help feed those people, and his friend was killed in the battle and his corpse dragged through the street. I'll never forget the sound of his voice as he talked about his friend. It was 100 times more harrowing than any movie I ever saw."

","""Black Hawk Down"" was a huge hit way back in early 2000's & i loved it from the first time i rented it from Blockbuster on video!!!
I was already a Josh Hartnett fan from Halloween H20, The Faculty & Pearl Harbour & yes i like those films & think Hartnett is a very good yet way underrated actor, he's a solid intense actor who proved himself once again as a great leading man with his excellent performance in 30 Days of Night (2009) & here in Black Hawk Down he's great once again but this time he's part of a big ensemble cast.<br/><br/>This shockingly violent & gritty real to life true story of survival war film is set in a hot zone war torn part of Somalia, a group of US Army Rangers get caught in an extremely violent conflict of war in the most dangerous hostile part of the city & basically have to run & fight their way out to safety, it's an intense & scary situation with bullets wizzing by not stop & angry violent Somalia warriors everywhere hunting down our soldiers.
The huge excellent ensemble cast has lots of good actors & know the face types, we have of course Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, Tom Hardy,
Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Kim Coates & more!!!
This is also excellently directed by legendary Ridley Scott & boasts fast paced intense action & exciting edge of the seat moments, the cinematography is sharp & raw that shows the grittiness of the broken war torn city, this is one of the greatest war films ever made in my opinion.
The fact this actually happened is very scary & makes everything even more intense & emotional.
Just a fantastic survival tale in a deadly savage place where killing is common everyday acts."
"iquine","7","1","1","29 June 2019"," Powering Through a Flawed Mission
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Prototypical war action movie with oodles of gunfire, emotional American heroics and pride with a constant stream of tension and concern. Objective: abduct two top Somali warlord lieutenants and return to base. Estimated to be a swift mission, it turns into a long and deadly ordeal with the initial crash of a Black Hawk helicopter. Now they had woken up the hornets' nest of enemy combatants in the 'danger zone'. Apologies to Top Gun. The high contrast lighting and lots of camera movement added to the hecticness of battle. The movie flowed without a lead character and jumped between assorted tense conflicts and endless gunfire with the screen often littered with flying debris or bullets. Early on the soundtrack had notable big hits that faded away as the plot got serious. There was a huge cast of notable male actors sprinkled throughout. Anyway, with the moto of ""no one left behind"", how will the rescue turn out? How much emotional drama will ooze out in this high quality production war movie?"
"matthewkickhafer","10","1","1","18 January 2019"," Battle for Survival
","Heroic and Intense, Black Hawk Down brings you right into the thick of the war in Somalia pinning you to your seat with your heart pumping scenes. Intense, Action filled scenes keep you engaged throughout the entire film. During the film, we see the heroism demonstrated by each one of the Army Rangers and the camaraderie they have with each other.
Based on the 1993 raid in Mogadishu, Somalia, we get a first-person point of view into the events of that fateful raid. The United Nations and the United States began setting up bases in Somalia after civil war broke out and the central government had been ousted. When UN forces began to withdraw the Insurgents led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining military personnel still there. In an act to try and weaken Aidid, the Army Rangers plan a raid on October 3rd, 1993 to capture two top-ranking officials. The mission fails and two Black Hawk Helicopters are shot down hence the title name.
The director of the film, Ridley Scott, uses modern film techniques incorporated with older props to recreate the setting of 1993 and tell the story of the film. Scott uses many different film techniques one of which being slow motion. During an important part of the film or when explosions and heavy gunfights are occurring Scott slows down the speed of the film to give it a more dramatic effect and to convey the significance of the moment. Scott also incorporates the use of close up shots to show the raw emotions of each of the soldiers as the violence around them breaks out.
One of the pivotal points in the film is when Private First Class Blackburn falls to the ground out of the Black Hawk Helicopter. Blackburn is a brave 18 year old who is just checking in when he has to leave to go on his first mission. Following this near-fatal fall Sgt. Jeff Streucker played by Brian Van Holt risks everything and he leads three humvees to pick up Blackburn and bring him back to base. On the way back to base, one of the gunner's is shot and killed instantly.
Sergeant Eversmann played by Josh Hartnett is the starring role during the film. Throughout the film, Hartnett plays his role with a methodical way of moving around so meticulous and detail oriented, every single movement is rushed, but you can tell he his putting everything he has into mastering his role to portray an accurate representation of that failed raid. Each scene is another battle that Eversmann must overcome in order to survive. In the end of the film, Eversmann says ""Nobody asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way"". Every single soldier who took part in the raid played a role in the safe exit of the situation and they are iall heroes.
Major General Garrison played by Sam Shepard is another key character. Shepard plays this role with such passion that you can see the raw emotion he shows during the raid and the casualties that are unraveling before his eyes. He keeps his composure to get the casualties and survivors out of the ""hot zone"". Garrison says ""Danny, you understand me? No one gets left behind!"". Risking everything, Garrison assures his soldiers that nobody leaves until the casualties and survivors are recovered. This shows heroism because risking their own lives the soldiers must stay in the hot zone until they can recover every single person.
Ridley Scott uses the right balance of sound, film and settings to portray the fateful raid in an accurate yet dramatized version. We see the importance that camaraderie and teamwork that is a necessity in achieving success. Each soldier who participated in the raid are hero's that day and Scott and the actors played each of their roles exceptionally well. The movie is a great tribute to the tragic events of that fateful raid."

"metalrage666","5","1","1","10 September 2016"," Hooah! Hooah!
","As a piece of fiction based on actual events, Black Hawk Down works a treat, however as a accurate account of those events, this is nothing but a one-sided, one dimensional modern day western. We know who the cowboys are, we know who the Indians are and the cavalry will arrive at the last minute to save the day, so all in all very little has changed in the art of movie making. The whole thing reeked of ""Go America!"", as the whole incident was supposedly only fought by them, they were the only ones there and no one else ever had a hand in it. <br/><br/>You know those old b&w Sci-Fi movies where an alien ship lands somewhere and within minutes the entire might of the U.S military is on the case, guns at the ready, full of idealism that it can handle anything right before they get their butts handed to them? Well this is pretty much the same. Despite all the hooah's thrown around, intelligence briefings, training, superior equipment and air superiority things very quickly go awry and all at the hands of alleged savages that apparently can't shoot straight.<br/><br/>As a straight up action flick BHD is great, it could have easily been another Schwarzenegger movie. It's visceral and fast paced with choppy editing and good special effects, so why does this have to be so inaccurate? Why turn an already misunderstood event into something that tries in vain to be patriotic but just smacks of propaganda. It comes as no surprise that the Somali's were annoyed with the film as they neither look or sound like how they were depicted given that no Somali actors appear in the film. Even the soldiers who were actually there have voiced their dismay at the portrayal of all concerned. I've lost count on how many war movies I've watched where a group of U.S GI's are all holed up in some bullet riddled and unsecured ramshackle building, running low on ammo and getting picked off one by one. It's Custer's last stand minus the horses, but unlike Custer, all these modern soldiers seemingly need is a stirring speech a few more hooah's and they're all OK again. <br/><br/>Overall this is good but not great. If you look past the fact that what you're watching is a conflict from a biased perspective and through a Hollywood lens then you'll enjoy it. If you bother to read up on what really happened as it happened and watched this again you may feel differently about it."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","1","23 May 2015"," A non-stop explosion of a movie. This is fantastic action.
","War movies either give you a flat-out horrifying portrayal of the hardships faced when killing to resolve a political crisis, or they sugar coat it to make it less realistic and hard to watch. Wimps. Ridley Scott thankfully gives us a masterpiece of modern day warfare, reflecting how every soldier's contribution to war is impactful, and how the bonds of brotherhood are at risk in battle. Scott directs a true story from 1993, where 123 elite U.S. soldiers fly into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord. What they find is themselves caught in a battle with a large force of heavily-armed Somalis armed to the teeth after one of their helicopters is shot down. Yikes. Time for plan B of the mission. This true story is filmed to perfection. Edited perfectly with all shots and camera angles adding up perfectly to deliver realistic gun shots and explosions, you'll be brought right into the battle that took place years ago. The intensity Scott and his team deliver is mind-blowing and dangerously hardcore. With over two hours of a non-stop battle, you'll be hooked and at the edge of your seat the entire time. What's really interesting about ""Black Hawk Down"" is that it always stays true to history, never trying to be something it's not. Ridley Scott never gets carried away with Ken Nolan's powerful and action-packed script, keeping it's written roots true by simply portraying what a hardcore modern day war scene looks like. Scott takes us into the battle. He doesn't just have us watch it. With gorgeous cinematography and outstanding editing, ""Black Hawk Down"" provides hours of realistic war violence that help us gain a better appreciation of the difficulties of foreign diplomacy, and what can go wrong when a plan crumbles. Plan B was never so dangerous."

","This film is an account of the devastating battle between American soldiers and Soamli warlords in Mogadishu back in 1993.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" is a tough film to watch. Almost every scene is chaotic and intimidating, reflecting what battles look like. It features constant gunshots and explosions. It is scary and intimidating to watch at first, but gets tiring as I have become desensitised by the sounds of the deadly machines. If it was not for the occasional gory scenes, I would have forgotten that each shot had the potential to kill someone. It lacks dramatic plot twists present in most other Hollywood productions. This unconventional take on battles adds realism to the film, enhancing the brutality without using excessive gore.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" is not a film to be enjoyed. It depicts the senseless brutality of war."
"snsh","6","1","1","4 December 2004"," confusing and chaotic
","Beyond what everyone else has said, I found this movie totally confusing. Not bad confusing, but chaos confusing. For the bulk of the movie, the characters are dressed alike running back and forth a lot, it's hard to tell them apart. They have the same haircut and uniform, and the same voice when they're shouting. I couldn't tell one from the other. Even the buildings look all alike.<br/><br/>The chaos made the whole film feel kind of Impressionist -- you absorb bits and pieces of it. Hollywood movies aren't often like that. If you have a personal talent for remembering names, you might enjoy the movie differently from how I enjoyed it."

","Contray to Mr Taylors opinion, i would rate this film as easily of the standard of SPR or Platoon, perhaps even better, whilst these films were good I find this one to be much more accurate to true events. Due to the number of Soldier featured you don't get as involved with them as if there were 2 or 3 main characters, but being a true story every time a soldier dies it is a real man who really died 5000miles from home in some stinking city. many have commented on the lack of poetry in this film, this i personally find one of the films strongest attributes, it is a down and dirty film about what these men went through, there wasn't a lot poetic about it. Rather than trying to make any big political points, what this film delivers is the courage of these men. what really hammers home the point is the coffins in the back of the hercules as the film ends<br/><br/>A fine tribute to the men who did not return, i feel everyone has a duty to see this film."
"Misspoe93","Null","1","1","5 July 2004"," True Story Epic of how things appear
","One thing that I can say about Black Hawk Down from a personal point of view is the setting is the year that I graduated from High School. It was quite amazing to learn later how a mission could go so wrong so quickly. Incidentally, this was a good break out role for Orlando Bloom, as the catalyst for kicking off the storm that ensues in Somalia. The action sequence is much like Pearl Harbor in that is conveyed to you a sense of endless time that the fighting commenced. There are many moments where the viewer is left aghast and horrified, wondering when it will end, and how much more can possibly happen to our fellow Americans as they attempt to get themselves out of this chaotic mission gone askew. I was fooled into thinking that Josh Hartnett was a main character here, but he is part of an excellent ensemble cast of people. Tom Sizemore remains an underrated actor, his performance in this movie was once again stellar and complete."
"heat95pd","Null","1","1","5 July 2004"," It's about the man next to ya...
","With stunning visual movies such as BLADE RUNNER and GLADIATOR, Ridley Scott brings us yet another spectacular film.  This time, it's in the form of one of the greatest depictions of war ever to be brought to the big screen. <br/><br/>
The film is based on actual events in Mogadishu, Somalia, 1993.  At the time, Somalia was a nation conflicted with civil war.  Somalian warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, commanded a militia whose methods of control led to genocide.  Elite American soldiers, Army Rangers and Delta Force, needed to extract Aidid's two top lieutenants.  Major General Garrison, played by Sam Garrison, scheduled a raid that was to take no longer than an hour.  What was supposed to take an hour, resulted in a 24 hour firefight in which 19 American soldiers lost their lives.<br/><br/>A major objective in the mission was to not leave any man behind, and the soldiers certainly obeyed and were discipled to that rule.  The actors were familiarized with how the Army Rangers and Delta Force trained by participating in a week long training demonstration.  From learning how to properly hold a gun to blowing up doors, the actors learned a lot.<br/><br/>Great performances from all the actors, especially Eric Bana. This film, and the Australian drama, CHOPPER, catapulted Bana to international stardom.  A true depiction of what war is like and what soldiers go through out on the battlefield.  ***1/2 out of ****"
"frost82","Null","1","1","15 June 2004"," This may be my favorite modern war movie...
","What I think makes ""Black Hawk Down"" stand out from other modern war classics, and this generally refers to war films dealing with anything about or after Vietnam, is its grittiness and realism. I love war films and have seen many, but I always walk away feeling disconnected, but this film helped me understand. With ""Apocalypse Now"" it was the utter surrealism of the experience. The film is a surreal, mystical, acidic trip through Vietnam, and while it is a beautiful film, too much is about the imagery and surrealism of the story. With ""Saving Private Ryan"" there was too much focus on the characters and their development. It was a film about how people react to war far more then about war itself.<br/><br/>That's what I loved about ""Black Hawk Down""--it was a war film about war. I have also read the book and despite the small changes (Eversmann leaves with the initial convoy), I feel the film still carries the spirit of the book and story. It never cheapens the integrity of the soldiers or makes their sacrifice seem unimportant. In fact, I think the film stands a testament to their bravery and courage and casts more negative light on those in command.<br/><br/>There is minimal character development and while there are lead characters, the actors' screen time is very evenly spaced. There are also no female characters, which I greatly enjoyed, because love stories often detract from the point of the film and are just thrown in for shallow commercialism--fine most of the time, but not when dealing with a subject like this one. The focus of this film is not on one specific character, but on the men as a whole and the war that surrounds them.<br/><br/>And I think this film offers one of the most honest interpretations of war, and might be one of the most straight-forward anti-war film ever made. There is propaganda and jingoism--how could there not be when this battle was considered a national tragedy? But I mainly walked away from this film feeling as if war accomplishes nothing. I felt for the Somalis, I felt for the soldiers forced to do a job whether they believed in it or not, and I resented Washington and their negligence towards human life--but that's war. There are no winners or losers, everyone suffers, and I think this film summed that up perfectly. <br/><br/>The film was also done beautifully. The photography is truly stunning in some places, and the contrast of harsh sunlight and dark shadows parallels the characters' inner struggles throughout the battle. The photography is clear and almost arty in places, yet it never seems out of place. For example, when the first helicopter crashes and the shot immediately fades from the crash site to the JOC's view of the crash site, the photography trick doesn't seem gratuitous--it simply points out how disconnected the JOC is from the soldiers on the ground. I enjoyed similar moments throughout the film, like Grimes' eye, symbolizing the soldier's-eye-view of the war and how it affected those actually fighting.<br/><br/>But most of all I felt this film explained war how it is, ugly and painful, even for the victors. It shed some light on American foreign policy, even more applicable with the situation in Iraq these days. But most of all it provided a view of war without resorting to cheap tricks, gratuitous violence, or a simpering love story--difficult in Hollywood these days, but much appreciated by myself."

","I Really loved the movie and want to read the book but haven't had a chance. Perhaps one of you who has or has some insight could answer a question of mine.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie that shocked me was when Hoot came back from the ""tax-payer funded, Delta safari"" and basically showed a really disrespectful attitude toward a superior officer (No, I didn't say HIS superior officer). You know the part I'm talking about. It's when the Captain (I believe his name was Steele) berates him for not having his safety on when they were feasting on the roast boar...mmmm roast boar... I remember saying to myself: ""There's no way an ultra-elite member of the military would address a higher ranking officer that way."" If only for the example it would give the other men. And I don't give a rat's ass how long it had been from his last meal. Don't misunderstand I really thought the character played by Bana was cool but I had a hard time swallowing that. Your thoughts would be appreciated. Any Ideas?<br/><br/>P.S. Does anyone else have a problem with Josh Hartnett's casting as a Ranger Sergeant. I think Josh Hartnett is a fine actor but he just didn't convince me he was a Sergeant. I could have seen him as one of the Privates though. He just didn't have that Hollywood Sergeant persona...if you know what I mean. He seemed too young and idealistic."

","Black hawk down does well with the depiction or war, it certainly is better than Saving private Ryan in every way. Visually it comes very close to the 'real thing' and seems very accurate. It is also very exceptional in that it conveys some tones unheard before, the tones that tell about the fallibility of the US army. This in my opinion is very good and healthy, critizism is always good. <br/><br/>But the problems lie with the depiction of the crisis, the film makers are unable to take a good look at the crisis from the somalis point of view. Also I wish there could have been more emphasis on the futility of the situation because now the action in the film makes it too adventurous and Rambo-like. It also has a 'Readers Digest'-feel about it, with the moral being that Americans equal 10 or perhaps 100 somalis."

","whereas saving private ryan introduced the hand held camera mode, this film is its culmination.<br/><br/>there is a great deal of shooting in this movie but for once it is an integral part of the action. war and combat are very violent and you need to properly portray that in a film like this, especially one based on true events. if you don't know, an RPG is a rocket propelled grenade, and there seemed to be a lot of them in the hands of the somali warlord's camp. by the way aidid, was a real bastard. there seems to be a type that, given the opportunity, will use conflict to make an advantage for themselves and sacrifice the freedom and lives of their fellow citizens to maintain that advantage. collaborators during WWII, east bloc dictators, and office politickers are counted in this group. aidid used the famine in somalia to establish a private army which would confiscate the food aid meant for his starving countrymen. the U.S. under clinton stepped and sent delta force soldiers to establish some order and capture aidid. this attempt ended in tragedy and this film depicts the circumstances and events of the raid.<br/><br/>I remember the news about the failed somalia mission and to this day I feel that blacks in Africa have no one but themselves to blame for the fact their continent is the most backward, undeveloped and violent today. rwanda genocide, civil war in congo, massive corruption in nigeria are a very few examples of the situation. you try to help them and all that happens is they drag your soldiers' dead bodies behind a pickup truck to shouts of glee.

The lack of well-built characters makes you feel a bit uncomfortable through the film but this is how you should be feeling.<br/><br/>There are some very good scenes in the film with true potency. However, in a post September 11 world, the director compromises the grim reality for a ""go USA"" feeling which left me feeling let down.<br/><br/>(Slight spoiler below)<br/><br/>The ending of the film list all the names of the Americans which gave their lives for their country but only casually mentioned that 1000 Somalis died. Indeed, throughout the film the Somalis are treated as subhuman like the aliens in Aliens which just keep attacking and never seem to be repelled. It almost as if the director wants you to cheer and high-five everytime a good-ol' American boy survives the onslaught of these zombies.<br/><br/>In truth, many Somalis were fighting under fear of the retributions to their families if they refused.<br/><br/>The film makes only a weak attempt to look at the justification of the West's involvement in such conflicts.<br/><br/>The key element of war which it fails to capture is the pointlessness (for all parties) and because of this the film is flawed."

","Ridley Scott has been fumbling recently, making more producer type of movies then his own. He established himself with ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". Thelma and Louise, G.I. Jane kept it going. Hannibal really screwed it up. His direction is coarse, he wants to be focused on the photography, focused on the action. He wants YOU to be there with the soldiers, fighting along side with them, watching them die watching them kill. He succeeds. Ken Nolan on the other hand wants to create a war drama, an embodiement of the human fighting spirit and about the sadness of war. He fails. Jerry Bruckheimer wants to make a movie so over- the- top in it's own patriotism, it'll make money and hey, it'll be called ""good"". He succeeds. Ken Nolan's script should come first. What he tries to show is the bleakness of war, with the characters of Eric Bana coming into play. He also wants to show the seasoned veterans who disobey orders and who actually help win the fighting: William Fichtner's character, Tom Sizemore's character. And there's the rookies; Josh Hartnett and Ewan Mcgregor. They aren't developed. Words don't ooze from their lips with power and drama as they did in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. They say the same things over again. They run and duck as RPGs blow over head and as bullets knock their friends down. The acting is solid, but there isn't much acting required. They just have to look proffesional and even acted scared. Ridley Scott's direction wants to go deep in there, he wants to give you a camera and let you follow these men. He does a fine job with this movie, deserving an Oscar nomination. Yet at the same time there's the patriotism provided by Bruckheimer. Scott's vision of bleak warfare is turned into ""Wow! America is so good at fighting!"" The photography, editing, sound all come together masterfully to give the experience to the viewer. But remove all the fancy camera angles, the tight editing and the detailed sounds. What is there? Nothing. That is the problem with this movie, it is hollow. Gunfire, pants, blood, they all come together well but what's the significance? When the movie ends, and the factual subtitles start to roll, the movie is briefly remembered then forgotten. Recommended for people who want to get a good view of the war, but for those looking for depht, it's recommended that they pick up ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" 6/10"
"ichabod81","8","1","1","15 January 2003"," Ridley strikes gold again!
","How does this sound: intense war film directed by Ridley Scott. Not bad, ay? What about this: intense war film from the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Not so good anymore. Luckily the second part has understood to give the first free hands. I admit that action has always been Bruckheimer's strong point, but when it comes to drama.. well, witness Pearl Harbor (= not good). Although BHD is based on a true story, it doesn't mean that the combat happened exactly like the film describes it. That aside, this is still a very strong piece of material that is only straightened by the great cast, supreme effects and most of all, the lack of any romance. I'm not saying that romance is a sure thing to bring any film plummeting down, but it's so fresh to see a film where it's not present just to suck up to the women in the audience. One thing, though.. there's one tiny problem with the fact, that because the soldiers are in full combat gear and most of them are wearing the goggles, it's VERY difficult to recognize them from each other. You often just don't know who's shooting and who's getting hit. The filmmakers have tried to solve the problem to some extent by writing the characters names on their helmets. It doesn't work well. But these are just minor problems and by the time the end credits roll on, you know you've seen a kick ass war movie that does not stop much to draw breath!<br/><br/>**** / *****"

","Well, I have just seen it on rental.<br/><br/>I remember the reviews... Did I expect a glorious presentation of the way America fights battles? - a sort of 'We teach the World - OK?' kind of movie? Or a 'We f****ed up - we all learnt' kind of moral tale?<br/><br/>
Well it wasn't either of these. I'm still not quite sure what it was...<br/><br/>The fear/desperation/futility was clearly there - men dying, men fearing death, equipment & lives lost to careless errors and ignorant leadership. It is certainly a war movie, like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. It is actually anti-war - but not simply putting flowers in gun barrels - it is about real life and death.<br/><br/>Just who were the people they caught? Stooges? Warlords? On my copy the credits were too small to see - and besides most people would have left by the time they came up.<br/><br/>How many of the 19 deaths resulted because 'We don't leave anyone behind'??? Is this really the way war is fought by America? If so - be afraid - be VERY afraid. How do you score a result against the Satan USA? Hit a few of their men - the others will be sure to come back to get them - even if it is only bodies. It is better to claim bodies and lose more than it is to cut losses and get out? `Well, Mrs Robinson, I can tell you that we got your son's body out, we are proud of that. Excuse me if I don't stay to chat, but the parents of the 20 people that died getting him out are here too...'<br/><br/>I know this isn't an artistic point - but hey, your enemies watch these films too! I don't have reason to doubt that this is what happened - but it spoilt the film for me.<br/><br/>As for characters in the film - well, my Blue Burmese cat has far more character. By the time the grunt with the photo of his family died I had no idea if he was a pilot, crew member, a cameraman or whatever. The moment in the film that conveyed the most to me was of  a Somalian carrying his injured infant son across the line of sight. This is real life in war. This is what war does. This is what we would be doing if war came here.<br/><br/>

","Remember that small hit (if it was one) in 1998 with Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington about New York being attacked by an terrorist force. I was disappointed in that movie because the 'force' laying 'siege' to New York was just a bunch of crazy loonies with TNT strapped to their chests running around and blowing stuff up. Boom!<br/><br/>With a title like ""the Siege"" I expected an invasion force rolling off at NY harbour and starts running through buildings, people running in panic and entire buildings being toppled. Then the US army would come in, try to take control of the situation and run around, trying to chase the invasion force out of New York after much have been destroyed. But I didn't get that. The closest I came, that year, to that sorely missed movie experience was GODZILLA!<br/><br/>Then, out of nowhere came Black Hawk Down to rid me of a movie I had wanted to see back then! Not that it had toppling buildings, demolishing tanks, and Mogadishu remained as intact as what it was before the battle depicted in the movie. But instead of the US army chasing around the invades it turned out the US army was the invaders and the Mogadishins were trying to chase them out and that was good enough for me!<br/><br/>On a more serious note BLACK HAWK DOWN wasn't as much as an anti-war movie (which it is) as a warning to America that said ""keep your noses out of nonsense that did not involve you!"". After September 11th this idea, which was indirectly caused by operations such as this one.<br/><br/>All the acting is superb, the location was excellent and breathtaking and looks like a warzone. The action is grizzly, the pain is practically real. It will make you laugh, it would make some cry, but it is definetly the best war movie of the new mellenium and all others, especially those in a modern setting, would have to be compared to Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>And if Black Hawk Down doesn't take your fancy as a warmovie you could always view it as a comedy of errors."

Died for their country/beliefs didn't they?) getting gunned down systematically was pretty sickening after a while.

Because of that they went from (possibly) just one soldier captured, to 19 dead.

"FlickJunkie-2","8","1","1","10 August 2002"," Realistic depiction of modern warfare
","For producer Jerry Bruckheimer (`Beverly Hills Cop', `Flashdance', `Top Gun', `The Rock', `Armageddon', `Remember the Titans', `Pearl Harbor'), this is a departure from the crowd pleasers he usually produces.  Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood because he knows that crowd pleasers make a buck.  Even `Pearl Harbor', wasn't really about Pearl Harbor, but about a love story with Pearl Harbor as the backdrop.  Here, Bruckheimer produces a straight, no nonsense action film with controversial subject matter and none of his standard crowd pleasing elements.  Oh, and by the way, he still made money.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the squeamish.  War is hell and this film turns up the fire.  It is a frank and realistic representation of war, much the same as the beach scene of `Saving Private Ryan', only once the action starts, it never lets up.  Ridley Scott gives us a raw depiction of modern warfare, based on actual events from the US military action in Somalia.  Despite a lot of criticism of Scott for not delving deeper into the political issues, I believe he made the right decision in staying focused on this as a combat film.  <br/><br/>What is so unlike a Bruckheimer film is that there is no workup of any single character.  There is no attempt to get us to love someone and have us pulling for him.  He just gives us a bunch of ordinary grunts that get thrown into a fire fight and try desperately to fight their way out to survive.  No one is a hero, and everyone is.<br/><br/>Scott's direction of the action scenes is superb.  This film maintains a dizzying pace and Scott never lets us catch our breath with stunt work and pyrotechnics that defy description.  There is no safety net in this film where we know that certain characters won't die.  Everyone in the cast is a potential casualty.  While this is extremely realistic, it is also one of the shortcomings of the film.  By the end, the viewer suffers from battle fatigue and there is no emotional consolation that at least one character we liked came out okay.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast does a fine job of creating realistic battle scenes, though there isn't a lot of meaningful dialogue.  The actors had to go through real military basic training in preparation for the film and it hardened them for the exhausting rigors of their roles.  Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore stood out slightly from the rest, but only because they each had slightly meatier roles.<br/><br/>This is an intense and credible war film that doesn't so much engage viewers as it does overwhelm us.  From an action perspective it is a 12/10, but in the area of storytelling and character development it falls short.  I rated it an 8/10.  See it, but brace yourself."
"Li-1","Null","1","1","13 July 2002"," I never thought I'd call a Jerry Bruckheimer production the best film of the year.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>To call Black Hawk Down the best film of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's career might not say much, considering he was responsible for silly action thrillers like Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Bad Boys,  but that would be short-selling this amazingly crafted war film, brilliantly helmed by Ridley Scott, a director who's on a critical and commercial streak unlike any filmmaker since Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The opening scenes, played over the haunting sight of dead bodies, recounts the events that led up to the disaster in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. In 1993, warlord Mohamed Aidid is more concerned with keeping power than feeding his starving people, claiming the food brought in by the U.N. as his property.  Once Aidid starts attacking American military personnel, U.S. American rangers and the Delta Force are sent in to deal with the situation, namely by capturing two of Aidid's top aides.<br/><br/>The mission was estimated to last only an hour, but everything goes horribly wrong when a ranger misses his jump and is wounded.  A black hawk is then shot down, and eventually, the rangers and Delta Force are stuck in enemy territory, engaging in a fierce firefight with thousands of Somali militia that would last 17 hours and claim over a thousand lives.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is an interesting war film in that it never pushes and force feeds us any moralization or blatant, patriotic flag-waving.  It's not necessarily concerned with giving us the political background, only the chaotic warfare, because let's face it, these soldiers didn't give a damn about politics once the fighting began.  All that mattered at that point was survival and keeping the men next to you alive.<br/><br/>There have been plenty of complaints about this film's political stance, that being that it's pro-American all the way, but I can't entirely agree. One of the film's major strengths is the unbiased, neutral manner in which<br/><br/>it views the situation (something that was also accomplished by Steven Soderbergh's Traffic).  After all, the film also shows how the plight affects Somali civilians.  True, the militia is almost a faceless mob, but to the soldiers, that's exactly what it was.  Another strenght is that Ridley Scott never tries to tell us how we should think or feel about United States' foreign involvement.  He simply presents the facts at hand, and lets us resolve everything else with our own opinions and deductions.  To some, that will seem like lazy filmmaking, but I find much to appreciate in a film that's open-minded and willing to respect its audience's intelligence. True, whatever opinion you held about America's involvement in foreign nations may not change, but it says a lot that Scott's film makes you think about it.<br/><br/>But for now (meaning the duration of the film's running time), forget about politics.  Where Black Hawk Down excels (and magnificently so) is in the battle scenes, and Scott choreographs some of the best action sequences I've ever seen.  For nearly ninety minutes, we're bombarded with over a dozen firefights, all of which display a gripping intensity that rivals Saving Private Ryan.  The fear of being outnumbered, outgunned, and being killed is presented in a harrowing, all-too-believable fashion that makes this film an effective emotional powerhouse.  Despite frequently going back and forth between several groups fighting in the city, it's a credit to Scott's direction and Pietro Scalia's editing (which received an Oscar, by the way) that the battle scenes remain intelligible and clear, even if it's confusing and hectic for the soldiers.  Scott's aim to show the hell a soldier experiences in combat leaves nothing to the imagination, so be prepared for graphic, realistic violence.<br/><br/>Another critical backlash against the film is the so-called lack of character development, with many critics and viewers pointing to We Were Soldiers as a better film overall because of its rich characterizations. I also disagree on this matter, since I found Soldiers' characterizations often corny and unbelievable.  If anything, Black Hawk Down never loses sight of the characters.  It may be a bit unusual for some viewers to see that Scott wasn't striving for a star-driven vehicle, but a team effort, because it was as a team that these rangers and Delta Force fought for their lives.  Even then, there is attention paid to several specific individuals.<br/><br/>Coming in top-billed is Josh Hartnett as Sgt. Matt Eversmann, an idealistic, young soldier who's first taste of combat leaves him reeled and conflicted. Hartnett has never been a great, or even especially good, actor, but he's fine here.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as Danny Mcknight, the colonel heading the convoy as they make their way through the streets of Mogadishu.  Ewan Mcgregor brings some humor to the role of Grimes, a coffee-maker who's suddenly been plopped into combat.  He's shaky at first, but never loses his confidence.  As good as those performers are, for me, the best performance of the film belonged to William Fichtner.  Fichtner, always a solid character actor, is simply superb as the take-charge, courageous Sgt. Jeff Sanderson.  With each tense situation, he keeps his cool and strategizes he and his men's way through each firefight.  If I were in battle, this is the kind of soldier I'd want fighting beside me.  The film also plays a developing friendship between Sanderson and Grimes, and Fichtner and Mcgregor have good, palpable chemistry together.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good, with Jason Isaacs as a strict, but well-meaning captain.  Ewen Bremner plays Nelson, one of two soldiers who gets left behind by the convoy.  His barely contained panic is so effectively conveyed, you almost feel like you're right there with him. Eric Bana is good as the Delta Force soldier trying to retrieve his comrades, and Ron Eldard is fine as pilot Michael Durant.<br/><br/>
There is much technical merit to be lauded, with Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography conveying the haunting, tragic mood. Hans Zimmer's score is among his better work to date, even if parts of it feel a little too derivative of his own work in Gladiator.<br/><br/>By the end of this 144-minute experience, it's unlikely you'll ever view modern warfare the same again.  This is a clear display of the fact that the U.S. is not a perfect fighting force (though they certainly, as Roger Ebert put it, ""gave better than they got""), but even more importantly, this is a film that delves in important issues such as foreign involvement, fighting for your mates, and more importantly, the horrors and reality of combat, without ever insulting the audience's intelligence."

Don't expect either any critical reflection about the motifs or the moral side of this conflict and the dealing with it, you will simply be disappointed.

The key theme was that ""nobody get's left behind"". This was proven when that one soldier placed a hand in his bag.  Let's face it, this is war!  Lots of men died in a very violent way.  This movie was true and it wasn't sugar coated.  Ridley Scott didn't use too much of his SKIP FRAME PHOTOGRAPHY which was a relief.  However, he did use some strange techniques.  Like the hand in bag scene.  I guess he's trying to come up with some new techniques that will place him in a unique catagory along with Marty S and Stanley K.   Oh, I was surprised that Ewan McGregor pulled off such a good act.  He is good at changing his accent.  There is a scene at the end where an old African Man is carrying a baby and walks RIGHT BY THE CONVOY.  I thought for sure that the old man had a bomb inside the baby or a gun hidden behind him, but no.  Ridley Scott wanted to keep true to this story as possible.  One thing I did wonder is what they ever did to that POW.  That guy was really messed up!  The Somalian that was interrogating him said it all when he mentioned that war is just a way of life for his people.

Can we live with the fact that we had sacrificed soldiers for the safety of others?  How many need there be before it is justified to return?  Can we live with soldiers who fight for us knowing that should they be down one day, their own troops may not come back for them?  If so, can they be psychologically prepared to still fight?<br/><br/>These disturbing questions rattled through my head as I watched the rapid escalation of violence and loss of life that accompanied the decision to return.  <br/><br/>The first vivid scene of the apparent death of the first soldier after he fell off the chopper rifled home the psychological shock of the closeness of death that no amount of simulated military exercise can bring.  The following two scenes that were to me the best two were those of the realization of the team of two soldiers that they Humpheys were not coming back for them, and the scene when the Somalian mob descended upon the soldiers in the chopper.<br/><br/>The feeling of being alone in a violent crowd, just waiting to die, must be unbearably lonely and desolate.  ""Politics are immediately forgotten the first moment a bullet whizzes by your ear"".

"baumer","6","1","1","6 February 2002"," This is why the rest of the world will never understand the U.S.
","I have always found it interesting to see how films get hyped through the Hollywood machine.  This is an event that no one cared about when it happened.  Vietnam was an event that the majority of Americans didn't care about and it took the U.S. years to commit themselves to WWII.  But now when you watch films made by Americans all you get to see is events that surround these times that are told through their eyes.  And I guess that only makes sense when you are spending millions of dollars making the film and more millions marketing it.  I mean, who would want to see a film where another country either does more than the U.S. does or at least helps them out?  You can look at one of the great AMERICAN War films like Saving Private Ryan for example and poke holes in the entire beginning of the film ( were the Americans really the only ones on the beaches of Normandy?)  But Hollywood can make jingoism like this and sell it to their patriots because this is what everyone wants to see.  Rocky Balboa is not only spoke of with reverence as a character, he symbolizes the great American struggle, the good guy vs. the bad guy, the underdog vs. the favourite, David vs. Goliath. Black Hawk Down is a film that I'm sure has many accuracies to them, but you can't tell me that this is the whole story.  We only get to hear things from an American point of view.  That is always how it is.  And that is fine, again, is any true patriotic, flag waving American going to want to see a film where the Americans aren't the heroes?  Even though they are the big bad Americans, for some reason it is prudent for film makers to present them as the underdogs, the Davids, the Rockys.  Now think about it, how funny is that?<br/><br/>I mention this in utter futility because I am Canadian and I realize I will never understand the true spirit of what it is like to be American so this film perhaps is not really made for me.  But when people comment that a film like this is unflinching in it's realism because it shows us how the government betrayed it's soldiers and this is why so many died that day. Well here's a news flash for all of you.  That theory has been going around for years and this is the not the first film to suggest that.  But when it is mentioned in popcorn movies like Rambo, people just brush it off like it is just good entertainment.  But mention it in Black Hawk Down and it all of a  sudden becomes some hidden dogmatic like piece of information that we have never heard before ( let the soldiers do what they do best and all is right with the world, but once the politicians get involved, it is FUBAR). Does this sound familiar?  I think Chuck Norris even had that theory in Missing In Action. <br/><br/>I do not really want to say to much more about this film.  It served it's purpose, especially in the wake of 911.  But it is films like this that upset the rest of the world at times because although this is an accurate depiction of what happened on the streets of Somalia, it is not a true depiction of why the U.S. was there and this is a microcosm of how sometimes the U.S. sticks it's nose into everyone elses business and how sometimes it can go wrong.  But as one of the characters in Mississppi Burning said ""Your in Mississippi now, the rest of the world don't mean s**t"".""  I'm sure that is how most Americans feel about the rest of the world. <br/><br/>
America and American's need something to feel patriotic about and this is the perfect climate to stir up those feelings of patriotism and it let's the rest of the world know that you really are the home of the brave.  I just don't know if this film is all that it is hyped to be.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a masterful director and he has made a good film, but, I guess me not being American, I just have a few more questions. Look at the positive reviews on this page and look at the not so positive reviews.  Most of the reviews that praise this film are from Americans.  Most that are like mine, are from people that don't live in the U.S. and will never understand what it is like to be American.

","Blackhawk Down. <br/><br/>By the sound of the title you probably think it's a movie about some Native American tribe fighting the cavalry or something else. But it's about American soldiers unexpectedly fighting endless hordes of armed local people in Somalia. <br/><br/>On October 3, 1993 a group of elite soldiers consisting of the top secret Delta Force, Rangers and the 160th SOAR helicopter squadron conducted their mission of capturing Mohd. Farrah Aidid's important people in Mogadishu, the capital city of (if there is a capital) Somalia. The fighting was supposed to have lasted only an hour, but two choppers (well, in reality four but the other two made it back) were shot down and the escape vehicles they were supposed to use got lost. They had to stay over for the night and got 19 men killed in action.<br/><br/>If you have read Mark Bowden's book of the same title, you probably have a general idea of what the fighting is like and what the city is like. And Ridley Scott managed to visualize it in such manner that the scenes are pretty much exactly like you pictured. Except for the first helicopter crash site, which is very wrong.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good, especially Tom Sizemore who is always natural in a uniform. But it is the ensemble which stood out. If you look for individual performances, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book you're probably confused with the characters under fire. You can only recognize them by the names on their helmets, but not all of them put their names on it. You'll probably have trouble putting names on faces, but as the story rolls it can be overlooked.<br/><br/>The movie shows a lot about the US Army elite units, the camaraderie within them, the rivalry between them, and their relatively new creed, which is ""leave no man behind"". I take it this is born after the experiences of Vietnam...<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie especially that it is based on a true story. I have been interested in US special units, and after watching this I grew more respect for them. You probably will too.

","Settle down in your seat and hold on.  This movie, after a fairly brief scene setting, moves right into high gear.  From the time the shooting starts, it is like the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", but stretched out over the next hour and a half.  This was a real event, not a plot from a novel. This is not any sanctimonious sermon like ""Platoon"". There is no flag waving. There is no political posturing--it is just a matter of the Rangers, Delta Force and pilots all trying their best to make sure they and their buddies get out alive--""leaving no man behind"".  For them, the only way out is to knock down every Somali militia man between them and the helicopter crash sites and ultimately, safety.  And those Somalis just keep coming. The steadfast pursuit of the Americans by the Somalis, with no apparent regard for their own mortality, brings back scenes from ""Zulu"".  The closest recent comparison for street-by-street battle was probaby the US Marines fighting to retake Hue's Citadel in 1968 Vietnam. The battle scenes are realistically portrayed, and the viewer does not even see that common war movie phenomena wherein the good guys appear to have an ""endless magazine"" for their weapons.  These guys actually change magazines, run through them, then change again, and continue firing, ultimately having to conserve what little they have remaining (per the book, the Rangers and Delta did get one sorely needed ammo and medical resupply during the night of the actual battle).  The noise is overwhelmingly and realistic loud (the nearly deaf machine-gunner was not a figment of the script-writer's imagination). I speak from experience as an infantryman in Vietnam.  But I fortunately never had to run this kind of gauntlet for an extended period (few ever have). It should be required viewing for current and future military people, for it illustrates that ""Murphy's Law"" is often the companion of a military mission.  It is at such a point that training, instincts, initiative and unit cohesiveness must kick in if the unit is to survive. This group of Rangers, Delta and the pilots supporting them demonstrated the concept in an extraordinary manner. A definite ""10"" rating."

","When I went to see this movie I thought `great! Josh, Ewan two of my favourites' when I went out I was thinking `WHAT WAS THE POINT!'<br/><br/>I have previously said that I would not comment on movies I thought were bad because I think they are a waste of time. I have now changed my opinion. I do not want you all to suffer and pay to watch a ridiculously stupid movie.<br/><br/>Okay it starts of good. Then it gets pathetic.<br/><br/>For one thing there are so many characters, you do not connect with any of them. One character calls his wife/girlfriend. We don't know who he is, what he want's with this woman, and how it has any importance in the movie. Another guy says he cannot go back in and another soldier tells him a speech of how everyone is in the same boat as he is and there scared. Then they look at each other and nod. I'm sitting in the cinema thinking `What? Did I miss something?'<br/><br/>What the hell was Ewan McGregor role. He did the movie Moulin Rouge, then he want's to do a masculine movie. So he goes into this movie, and all he does is make coffee.  HELLO?!<br/><br/>There is this scene were a soldier sees a hand of a man with a watch. The solder picks it up and puts it in his pocket. I'm sitting there thinking, `What is he going to do with it?' keep it as a souvenir? Give it to the man's wife? The poor lady would freak.<br/><br/>Another stupid thing is that they would get the bodies of dead soldiers, and put them in the truck/trailers ¬Ö whatever they are called, and the living people would be in danger by running outside. <br/><br/>There is this guy that gets captured and he is in the prison. In the movie we do not see if he is rescued or if any think of him. He just gets captured and that's it. WHAT THE HELL!!!<br/><br/>The sad scenes are so predicable. I was laughing during those scenes.<br/><br/>I left the movie thinking if that was based on a true story....<br/><br/>God this movie really was stupid."

","The movie depicts Somali militia as a bunch of black, vicious monsters who should be killed, and they are - in thousands. <br/><br/>I've never seen a more obvious propaganda movie than this one - no wonder US army agreed to lend their choppers. <br/><br/>How convenient for then, to have such a release in the wake of the second Iraq war. <br/><br/>And the image of Somali people clapping as the Rangers run their Mogadishu Mile is the most silly I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Shame on you, Ridley Scott, for tapping into testosterone-fulled, ""patriotic"", cruel redneck fears."
"realtab","1","5","12","12 August 2002"," I am so sad I wasted my time
","Blackhawk down is perhaps the worst war drama ever created, and this comes from a fan of the genre. I found it too claustrophobic, inane, and very BORING. If this, Scott's worst (by far) effort had not been based on actual events I would maintain that it was made up by an incompetent army newsletter writer. There are no characters that seem in any way believable nor do you have any level of empathy with a single person (and these are American soldiers). Mr. Scott should despite many glowing reviews be made to sit in a corner and really think about what a pitiful movie he threw together. Of all the films I have seen in the past five or so years this has the least (if any) redeeming qualities, it is that bad. I will not take the actors to task they had nothing whatsoever to work with, so we have no idea what the performances would be. So I will stick to the real problems story, direction, and editing. First, I love America and I respect and admire our men and women who serve. That said every conflict we take part in does not need to be captured on film. Blackhawk Down had no more business being made than Heartbreak Ridge, and the Eastwood flop is sadly quite a bit better in everyway except special effects. As far as direction I am shocked that Ridley Scott would put his name on this fiasco. He fails to get a single memorable performance or to provide any feel other than being in a coffin with explosions in the background. The guys(including the talented Scott)in the film cutting room also come up short but maybe they just threw in the best of a bad lot and hope that patriotism would cover the almost endless flaws. On a positive not the film is not extremely long and there are some pretty good effects, but too few for this to deserve much merit for them.<br/><br/>1/5 .5 for being a great Army commercial(though I prefer the 30sec variety) and .5 was for a token few special effects scenes that were effective. A failure on every plausible plane."

War stinks, and will always stink, no matter if your operating a man-to-man combat war or a push-button war, where things are remotely controlled - people still get their bowels blown up. <br/><br/>Even though hundreds of skilled actors, stuntmen and cinematic wizards helped making this film it doesn't tell us anything new - and it isn't that good at telling it either: Harrison's Flower is a masterpiece in comparison, and that film's story is still just as brutal and as scary, but so much better told.Go see it instead!"

","""Nobody asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way"" In the movie Black Hawk Down directed by Ridley Scott depicts the day that the US military fought in the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. The Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid had control over the city of Mogadishu. He had his power by taking the food that was given to the people of Mogadishu. Essentially he controlled the people by starving them. It was either starve and die, or join forces with Aidid and fight for him. The US military planned to step in and stop this from happening by taking out Aidid . When going in to execute this plan the worst happens and two of their black hawk helicopters get shot down. The movie then goes through the heroic acts that the military went through to save the survivors of the crash and get them out of there. <br/><br/>This movie was made very well. The director Ridley Scott had already made plenty of action movies before this and this fit right in his genre. Some of the acting by the characters could have been a little better but the special effects and action scenes were amazing. The movie budget was $92 million which isn't too cheap or too expensive, it's just about average for the making of a major studio movie. Obviously they couldn't film the movie in Somalia because it's way too dangerous, so they decided to film it in Rabat, Morocco which has similar scenery and geography. This film was made 16 years go, released on December 28, 2001, and was very good quality. During the movie making there was no delays so the movie came out on the date they were shooting for. <br/><br/>During this movie it was clear to see that the director was showing that the US military was very brave during this battle and fought through it. The director made this movie not only to show how brave and strong the US military is but also to show how good of a producer he is and prove himself to the Hollywood community. To figure out why the film was made you have to dig a little deeper to find out why and really pay attention during the film. It seemed pretty clear, if you payed close attention, that the film was trying to inform the audience that the US military is the best in world. The film was clearly made for the people of the United States to show that we are being protected by the greatest military in the world.<br/><br/>The film was good for history and facts but they did manage to mess up in a few ways. The helmets the US soldiers were wearing in the movie were not issued when the actual events happened in real life but this is only a minor issue. Besides this very minor issue the actual battle scene is very factual and true. In the beginning and ending scenes the director did omit some important facts to bias the film in the US military's favor. Some facts they left out were that it might have actually been as much as 2000 Somalis killed and 4000 wounded. Also, this battle was seen as a huge victory for the warlord Mohammed Aidid because he managed to hold off a military superpower and keep his regime intact. They left these facts out to make the US military look great and not insane murderers. Although the director was very bias it did not really get in the way of telling the story. <br/><br/>The characters were very believable in this film but the acting could have been a little better in their dialogue. For the most part though the dialogue in this war movie was appropriate for it and fit right in. The only thing that i would criticize about this film is that they should have put the Somalis point of view in way more. This would make the film seem way less bias and more factual to the true events that happened. Overall I thought this film was great and i would recommend it to everyone to watch."

A group of elite soldiers arrive in SOmalia to capture a war lord, which is a success...However this is were the film only begins.<br/><br/>An entire city descends on the soldiers with RPG's and weapons, to stop them, leaving soldiers dead and wounded...And we witness their battle for survival...<br/><br/>The film is raw and intense, with some amazing shoot-outs that leave nothing to the imagination as soldiers are blown to pieces and shot to smithereens. We become attached to certain characters that will either die or become severely wounded.<br/><br/>I found the sequence were the Black Hawks fly over the city mesmerising, the black smoke that clouds the actions of the enemy, the roaring noises of the mob, the firing of the gun and recoil...<br/><br/>Personally I became attached to Eric Bana's character, Hoot as he tries to fight threw the enemy in order to save his comrades..<br/><br/>Simply one of the greatest war movies ever made..."

"abum190","9","3","6","22 December 2006"," A blistering experience
","Black Hawk Down is simultaneously bruising to watch and impossible to look away. It is not the first war movie to place us in the middle of the action so skillfully, but it is definitely one of the best and one of the most harrowing. And it is not necessarily the endless and endlessly realistic action that makes this movie such an achievement; Scott manages to say something with that action and because of that we have a better understanding of war and those who fight it.<br/><br/>Too much happens within the fabric of this film for me to provide a genuine summary of the plot, so I'll give a brief outline: a team of Special U.S. Forces is deployed in Mogadishu, Somalia with orders to apprehend a warlord who has created famine in his area when one of their Black Hawk helicopters is shot down and they become entangled in a never-ending battle with the Somali militia, fighting to save their own lives and the lives of the men around them.<br/><br/>Scott has assembled a genuinely ensemble cast with virtually no standout names at the time except for Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor, who both do a fine job, but the character that left the deepest impact on me was Eric Bana's Hoot. Hoot is one of the few Rangers that knows his way around war and fighting and is almost ruthless in his tactics. However, he never loses his compassion and he reveals at the end that he truly understands why he fights- ""It's about the men next to you. And that's it.""<br/><br/>The fact that this conflict was not even supposed to be war in the first place makes the movie all the more powerful. We are audience to many mistakes by the leaders of this outfit; the ground forces are led by helicopters from above and the navigators in these Black Hawks lead the Rangers astray many times. It seems to go on forever sometimes, but that is not to the detriment of the movie. On the contrary, it only adds to the reality of the situation. We are not subjected to nonstop fighting; there are moments between the soldiers and sometimes moments between the Americans and those attacking them. Even in these moments, though, Scott never relents from his indictment of war or his appreciation of the compassion of these soldiers."
"wereuat06-1","10","3","6","12 December 2006"," One of the Best..
","Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and one of best war movies I have seen. It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me with fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.<br/><br/>All emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from ""Good to Excellent,"" there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context, and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional ""hooks"" for the characters. As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of ""choke-up"" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class ""Hoot."" Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. ."
"dwood-4","3","3","6","9 October 2006"," What I would expect
","Despite the fact this movie was made by a British director and it was made before 9/11, this is what I would expect from an era of such jingoism as we are now experiencing in the US.<br/><br/>The somalis are nothing more than faceless savages. Even the main US characters are given no thoughts or dreams. They are simply facades of manliness and destruction. How do they feel going to somalia ? Do they feel that their country has the right to intervene in affairs of other countries ? Are they scared ? Do they enjoy what they are doing ? Is militarism always the best strategy ? Do they want to go home ? Do they feel they are being sacrificed for a nobel cause ? What do they feel toward the people in the towns, cities, countrysides of somalia ? None of these issues are explored in this movie. Isntead it is 100+ minutes none stop death and destruction. After the second persons insides were blown against the camera I felt it was too much and walked out of the theater.<br/><br/>Okay it is an action movie, fine. Then do not base it on real events if exploration of real issues is not important.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie concentrating on the depravity of war see JOhnny GOt His Gun, All Quiet on the WEstern Front, even the Big Red One, not this junk.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 stars. The three stars were for the technical merit and choreography of the action sequences, which were outstanding."

I remember going to the theater with my wife and mom when this movie came out. All three of us left in tears. I have tried to explain my experiences in Somalia to people, and none of them seemed to take it seriously. The media must not have covered it that well. Trust me, I was in Iraq for ""Operation Desert Storm"" and Somalia was much worse.<br/><br/>Scott did a brilliant job at recreating Mogadishu. There were only a couple minor flaws in the movie and only someone who was there would be able to identify them.<br/><br/>As far as it depicting all Somali's as mindless warmongers. I totally disagree with people who make this claim. Only the ones who were shooting at us were the warmongers and that is what this movie is about. Who in the hell would watch a movie about the nice side of Somalia. Besides they did not want us there and tensions between civilians and soldiers escalated to the point where we hated them and they hated us. It was not worth loosing one soldiers life.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, please do. Every bit of it is true. I was friends with a couple of the guys who died in this battle and I want people to know how they died as hero's."

","I'm tired of talking to people who say they love this movie because of all the explosions and violence. Am I the only one that watches this movie understanding what those valiant men sacrificed on that day in October? Even though the movie doesn't explain exactly what occurred, it gives the viewers a good idea for what happened. But if you want to know everything that went on that day, I strongly suggest reading the book by Mark Bowden after seeing the movie. I did that, and was able to really get a feel for what both the Delta men and Rangers went through. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should see it as soon as they can. It has some of the best editing and effects I've ever seen in a movie. The sounds in the film are astonishing. From the gun shots to the whistling of the RPGs, it's very well done. I'd have to say that Black Hawk Down is by far my absolute favorite movie."
"fwgrhouse","10","3","6","1 May 2006"," One of the Best
","After I this movie I had more respect for the military than I ever had before in my life. I also had a better understanding of what combat is like in this day in age. The plot is very good and is also based on an actual event that happened. It also shows the bad things the people of the military go through on a daily basis while fighting a war and it also shows that war is a terrible thing regardless of the cause. I also feel that the people who made this movie made good choices in the cast because it was made-up of mainly actors that starred in other war films like Tom Siezmon form Saving Private Ryan. This is a must-see film for anyone interested in war films and I guarantee you that you will be moved by this film."
"jmverville","8","3","6","21 October 2004"," Honest & Beautiful
","When watching Black Hawk Down, I could not help but observe how honest and beautiful the film was -- portraying, in the beginning, soldiers as how they are (often rowdy and good natured, ready to serve, wanting to serve); a portrayal that you often see, but was done especially well in this film; it takes a lot of the past depictions of war film's portrayal of soldiers and modernizes them, and turns them into something that we can relate to very well. <br/><br/>And above this, it took some painstaking steps to remain true to its' genre of war film through incredibly realistic portrayals of the calamity that is war; there are a few scenes in the film that truly show what war is, and what war can be all about. It had moments that were shocking and quite sad, and it really makes the viewer feel and sympathize with them. And, thank God, it takes no Hollywood side-bar love stories further than they ought to be taken (as in a film called Pearl Harbor).<br/><br/>In addition to this, the film makes a good effort to give historical background to the film and to show Somalia for what it was during this era of warlords. Although the film may not follow history to a T, it certainly follows it enough to give someone a good idea of what was happening so that we can properly understand a conflict that many of us had forgotten about, and that many of us were ill-informed about. So in addition to the very realistic portrayal of war, we see a very realistic portrayal of the event -- something honorable to the sacrifices that were made by those men.<br/><br/>Overall, as far as war films go, this was one of my more favorite films for a very graphic depiction of war as it is, and for a film that was not overly dramatized. The truth was not stretched, no real political message was made to clog the piping of the story/film, it stayed true to its' genre, and the execution of the script was grade A (Ridley Scott directed very well). It was a very honest and beautiful film."
"gray_ghost","Null","3","6","29 August 2004"," Rebuttal for Daniel
","Daniel from France, I must post after reading yours.<br/><br/>In my point of view, war is bad. So I prefer movies which criticize this activity.<br/><br/>-Yes of course, war is bad. The US should never have invaded Normandy to liberate France from the Nazis. This movie was about the soldiers who fought and died Somalia. Do you criticize the Somali woarlords who stole the U.N. food aid for the starving people there?<br/><br/>Like someone said : it's a ""pop-corn movie"" with no ideological purposes. Except of course, the soldier's macho friendship as the ultimate life value. In the movie, every soldier is obsessed to be useful and says : ""Yes Sarge, I can't fight ! I want to go back to fight !"". And the classical ""war clich√©"" (present in every war movie since the 50's) : ""Say to my wife I was courageous ! - You will say it to her yourself !"" and the soldier dies.<br/><br/>-How would you know about fighting? France hasn't won a war by themselves in 180 years. To think so many Americans died 60 years ago so you can say ""pop-corn movie"". Please do not dishonor their memory. What they said in the movie is pretty much what they said in real life.<br/><br/>Frankly, where is the originality ? Some say the movie is almost a documentary. Are you kidding ? The historical frame is ejected in one minute after the movie starts. The enemy ? End titles say there were 19 killed US soldiers , and about 1000 killed Somalis. And what this movie shows us about the Somalis warriors ? Nothing ! They are just targets, with no personality, no humanity, they are ""objects"", like in a shoot-them-up video game. Like the monsters in ""Aliens"" or ""Starship troopers"". Soldiers US are the goods, the others are the villains. But the reality is more complex.<br/><br/>-Somali warriors??? They were thugs and rapists who murdered other Somalis who dared challenge them. They stole the food the U.N. sent to feed the starving Somali people. You want to see their humanity??? I have news for you Daniel, they had no humanity. They were cockroaches. You are defending vermin. Typical of the French. The movie focused on the soldiers. Why would it give time to the criminal thugs??<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me ! I'm french, but I'm not giving a judgment about American policy, but about a movie. And the base of this movie is stereotypes. Sometimes, I like stereotypes ! Like everybody. I like ""Rambo"" (really !) but it's fictional ! And if BHD would have been a fiction, directed by Peter McDonald or Roland Emmerich, I would be OK. But I was waiting a little more from a director like Ridley Scott and more from a movie about a real event.<br/><br/>-I know you are French. Thats why I feel sorry for you. This movie isn't about stereotypes. Its about men who fought for each other when our own socialist coward of a President wouldn't fight for them. They fought and died in a place you wouldn't even want to defecate in. They did it to feed and protect innocent dying starving Somalis. This movie honors those men. It is about honor and sacrifice. Something the French forgot when the Nazis were marching under L'arc de Triomphe.<br/><br/>So it's really a very good action movie, (among the bests, I admit it) but it's not a ""great philosophical analysis"" about the war or about an historical event.<br/><br/>-This movie is one of the few movies made that portrays the brotherhood soldiers have when faced with insurmountable odds. It does not insult them nor make them antagonists. It was never meant to be an ""action"" movie. There isn't much ""great philosophical analysis"" when an entire city is trying to kill you. Please read the book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden. You will understand much, much more about this saga. If you are offended by my comments, I am sorry, I am offended by yours."
"rochambeau83","Null","3","6","31 January 2003"," Highly Overated Spectacle Driven Drivel
","Quite a long time ago on opening weekend my friend and I went to see this film.  We both had High Expectations of it hearing so many great things.  However when the credits started rolling we both had major problems with this film.  Problems that could not have been fixed by simple time spent in the editing room. One review I have read declared this film amongst the pinacle of other great films such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan (He forgot Three Kings, Platoon, and The Deer Hunter but Oh well.) back to my point the difference those films have that this film is lacking are the two most important aspects of story telling.(Film making at its core is storytelling remember.) Plot and Character Development.  Black Hawk down is missing both of those. It has a little bit of Conflict Exposition, then just crashes into an hour and a half battle scene.  Believe me I enjoy battle scenes as much as the next film buff.  The invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan took my breath away.  But when it just carries on to make up the bulk of the film as this does there is no way someone can follow a story because there is no story line to follow.  There is a guy that gets captured and that went no where.  There are people just running and shooting a the Somalians with loud gun fire covering over any possible dialogue making none of the characters worth remembering.  It basically has the plot and thematic equivalent of a Steven Segal movie and that is far from a complement.<br/><br/>Many people talk about how realistic it is, but film making is not realism, it is supposed to be heightened realism, and you should be left with something more than just an visual memory of a guy holding a wound shut as blood spills on the floor.  This did not deliver.  Like most of Scott's other Indeavors he just does not have what it takes to be a distinguished director.  Though I guess his movies can be pretty fun to watch at times."

","We americans are so hypocritical, we don't see reality. This is what I get from many on this website.  I find that odd, seeing as most of these oh-so-enlightened folks has never stepped foot in danger, never felt bullets rush past their head, never seen their best friend bleed to death on a filthy table in a dirt town of Somalia.  I find it disgusting, and insulting that the automatic assumption of viewers is that the US is always rushing in to do evil.  That is what they expect.  Though they would be hard pressed to deflect the fact that it is the blood of American soldiers that keeps their lands free, and has done so for that past 100 years. No one is doubting the bravery and courage of British and Aussie troops who fought for their own countries, but who maintains that freedom??<br/><br/>It is not that the users on IMDB are excersing their right to free speech that insults me.  What insults americans, and members of its military like myself, is the fact that these people sit back on their lily white butts and forget the young men who should have lived long lives and never worried about their next breath.  Instead they insult their memories with their scathing reviews.  Believe what you will about American foreign policy but do not insult my countryman's names and memories to make yourself feel intelligent and insightful."

","And that is what makes BHD a horror movie rather than a war movie really.  What we have here is a case of mixed genres.  This is not a film about the evils of war, or even really about war itself.  Is a propaganda piece for thinking locally and acting locally and horror movie designed to make one paranoid because it turns out that the people who are supposed to be protecting us, are incompetent in all the ways that we usually figure that they would be.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, what makes this movie a particularly bad piece cinematic endeavor is that Scott and company are afraid to allow the force of that insight to shine through.  Plenty has been written about the 'Fog of War'--that is, the fact that when the bullets start flying, not only do politics go out the window (regrettably the politics seems to have gone out the window when the film cameras started rolling as well), but so also do the best laid plans and what small levels of good sense there were to begin with.  But, you see, Scott hasn't the stomach for that film.  So he front-end loads the reasons for the fog of war.<br/><br/>We find out that in the midst of the Delta Force and the Texas Rangers, we have asthmatics and epileptics.  I did a little checking, and discovered that asthma and epilepsy (and I don't mean to knock anyone who has either of these ailments--you can live perfectly normals lives with both of them), are generally considered reasons for reassigning soldiers to desk jobs in Ft. Worth, or Laramie.<br/><br/>So what we have is Scott afraid to make a movie about the fact that war goes wrong just because war always goes wrong, and instead making a movie about how war goes wrong because our Special Ops are populated with people who either can't breathe when the going is tough, or having seizures when the going is tough.  You see, it makes the world safe again.  All we need to worry about is that the next time, we don't send in any asthmatics and we can be sure that the operation will be a tidy success--just like Afghanistan was (with certainly no errant bombs and no mis-information).  Once, you have that set-up, that's when the politics really is deplorable--because of the fall back on such idiocies as 'heroism' and just looking our for your friends.  I am less interested in heroics than I am interested in people (not just soldiers but them too) thinking about why we are in such places as Somalia in the first place.  I'll forgive a movie about the brotherhood between soldiers as long is it seems like those soldiers are aware that they have a place in the wider world, but this is not that movie."
"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","5","5","13","19 March 2002"," Blood, sweat, bullets and RPG's: the protagonists of Black Hawk Down
","Black Hawk Down makes it intentions very clear when Eric Bana's character says `when that first bullet goes flying past your head, politics go right out the window'. It is not a study of the situation that lead to the Mogadishu incident portrayed in the film. It's not an in-depth analysis of human action in the midst of horrible conditions. What it is, in fact, is a frontline film, concerned with giving its audience a experience as close to real war as a film could ever hope to come. The last film to really try this was Saving Private Ryan, during its ragingly intense battle sequences. Well, Black Hawk Down pretty much stretches that into a full-length feature. The first 30-so minutes may be all exposition (starting off pretty badly, telling the whole back-story to the conflict in title cards), but after that it's all-out action.<br/><br/> The question it raises is the following: is Black Hawk Down what we'd expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, just another action flick, or did Scott do something more with it. The answer may not be the first OR the second, but rather a little bit of both. Black Hawk Down is not a polished actioner like Pearl Harbor. It doesn't feature too much (read: any) vomit-inducing American flagwaving. It is often spectacularly brutal although we're largely spared the pornographic violence of Ryan's harsher scenes. What Scott focuses on indeed is using all cinematic techniques in his reach to create a movie experience which is as intense and energetic as possible. It has the dynamics, the trickery and even the spectacle of a traditional action flick, but it doesn't have any real form of making us feel secure and happy about it. Black Hawk Down is so unforgiving in its pacing and in its bluntness in presenting a modern day armed conflict, there'll never be any doubt in your head, that war is a horrible, horrible thing.<br/><br/> But, wait, the Bruckheimer has not left the building. Black Hawk Down is good, but it's not great. I am willing to accept the absence of political debate over the situation, the absence of any critical inquiry into the U.S. policy and strategy deployed. After all, this isn't about such abstractions, it's about the man dodging the bullets. The way the Somalis are treated here is less easily accepted, though. They are mostly seen as an overwhelming, never-ending wave of hostiles, more reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens than any human group of adversaries seen on film. Two scenes do present the Somalis as fathers or men trapped in their situations respectively, but it's not quite enough. Therefore, there's something to be said for the film mourning the 19 American fatalities more than the 1000+ Somali ones (considering the film's American perspective, one could argue this makes SOME sense). What I really can't accept though, and I'm looking at the film from a storytelling instead of a political standpoint from now on, is the characterisation. There's an argument to be made for this film not needing any really well-developed characters. They could have been archetypes for sure, but I would have liked to have seen them a little bit more defined. Basically I gathered Ewan McGregor's characters likes coffee and Eric Bana's character was really tough and that's it. It's a film that aimes to make you 'participate' in the experience it's offering and as such doesn't require a fully developed set of characters that explicitly experience everything for you, but a little bit more would have been nice. Now, the fact you're frequently watching generic figures dodging another hail of bullets somewhat distances you from the experience.<br/><br/> This is the script's (and film's) main failure and not necessarily the cast's, who all do a pretty reasonable job with the limited material. The mid-war scenes are well-performed and it's only when the actors are asked to deliver some speeches on why they would do these things, that they are unable to compensate for the screenwriter's inability in answering this question in any manner beyond Hollywood sugartopping or Pentagon propaganda (which, by the way, was very supportive in the process of making this film). It's a shame then, the film has to end on such a false note, with josh Hartnett talking into camera about how 'sometimes people just turn out to be [heroes]'.<br/><br/> All in all, this is not a smart film. It doesn't have the level of sophistication Three Kings brought to its Gulf War-subject matter. In fact it's little more than the cinematic retelling of the events. What could've been provocative piece about the Somalia situation or U.S. political influence throughout the world is Bruckheimerized into a film which is about nothing more than not getting blown up and not making sure your fellow man doesn't get blown up either. While that's not anywhere near revolutionary, it's a testament to Ridley Scott's great directing that it's nonetheless shocking enough to be a worthwhile addition to the war movie  genre.<br/><br/> Rating: 6"

","Black Hawk Down is probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I don't see how you can even call it a movie. It has no story line and 90% of the movie is taken up by shooting scenes. A shooting scene may be alright here and there but when the movie contains nothing else it gets extremely boring after two hours. I found this movie more boring than ""The Story of Us"" which I previously believed to be the most boring movie ever made. The makers of the film were able to get the special effects and sound effects right but they forgot to make the movie entertaining."

He needs help from Pakistani Stadium (Pakistanis should know how to handle elephants, after all). In the end: 19 Americans dead, about 1000 Somalis dead.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this movie (a multi million dollar affair that won two Oscars) does not comment on this stunning ratio. Its purpose is to honor the 19 dead Americans. According to what I perceived in this movie they were badly trained, narcissistic amateurs under an abominably bad leadership. (They are not conscripts but professional career soldiers of en elite outfit, I got that right, didn't I?) Their getting into the china shop is based on a crass case of error of judgment, their problems seem to stem from a complete ignorance of local conditions. The population of Mogadisciu are supposed to be either bad-guys or extras. There's black, there's white (yes, apart from one guy all the soldiers are Caucasian) ¬ñ and no gray in between.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine a movie that causes more harm to American foreign policy than this one. What makes it really bad is the fact, that the aim of the whole intervention is a selfless, purely humanitarian one, which makes the operation part of a noble cause. However, the movie does not dwell on the basic objectives of the operation or the mistakes and its consequences but shows a lot of action which does not help the story development and becomes boring after a while. The source of inspiration for the soldiers seems to be solely their own personal glory, they are individualistic sportsmen rather than team-players. They put, as they are depicted in this movie, contemporary US military involvement in a bad light. And it is not your ideal recruiting propaganda, either.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in Morocco, the Somalis were played by West Africans. That's like making a movie about Mexico in Alaska, taking Escimos for Aztecs. The disrespect for geography and ethnicity the movie displays lead me to suspect that this is the way the world is seen by many Americans: Somewhere out there there are some bad-guys who have to be wiped out, getting a similar treatment like the unruly parts of the indigenous population inside the national boundaries in the 19th century.<br/><br/>Let me finally point out, that my comments are referring to the content of the movie which forcibly has to differ considerably from real events. I think that the world owes a lot to the intervention of American troops who risked or even lost their lives during the past decades ¬ñ including hot-spots in Europe, not too far away from the place I live. But one wants to be sure that those guys who command all that high-tech machinery know what they are doing and what for. This movie did not convince me that they do."

"fairchild_media","1","4","10","20 January 2002"," More Bruckheimer Junk
","Two words tell you everything you need to know about this film: Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>Remember, he's the man responsible for inflicting the painful Pearl Harbor on us. His involvement in Black Hawk Down more than cancels out anything director Ridley Scott might have been able to make out of it.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is the story of the disastrous US raid-gone-wrong in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the early 1990's. The story itself is extraordinary, and the book by Mark Bowden is much more exciting than the film, which ought to tell you something.<br/><br/>As for the actors - who cares? With so many actors, an incredibly small amount of time is spent in what should have been crucial set-up, so we neither know nor care about the characters, and most of them are reduced to fake two-dimensional stereotype caricatures (a Bruckheimer hallmark).<br/><br/>Horrible, trite dialog which you see coming a mile away and is just embarrassing to hear come out of anyone's mouth (another Bruckheimer hallmark).<br/><br/>One of the soldiers calls his wife just before mounting up for the mission, and leaves her a sappy message on the answering machine, and she walks in and picks up the phone just as the soldier hangs up, missing his call. Any guesses on what's gonna happen to THAT guy (another Bruckheimer Hallmark)? Put a classic Star Trek red shirt on him, for god's sake.<br/><br/>Much of the combat scenes are very well done, but the movie is plagued with horrible editing, both visual and sound. Many times a character speaks words with his mouth way out of sync with what we hear.<br/><br/>Music score by Hans Zimmer's California corporate music factory excellent. Superb version of classic English hymn ""The Minstrel Boy"" over closing credits.<br/><br/>Crowd scenes very well done, something which modern movies regularly screw up. The extras portraying the Somali savages really did a great job, were very well-drilled and choreographed, and looked very believable.<br/><br/>And for the usual nit-picking criticism - major continuity errors throughout the film. My favorite: A column of US Hummvees is driving through the streets of Mogadishu, and we get a great shot from the top of one of them, clearly showing the Hummers mounted with M60 machine guns atop each. Cut away to side shot, and all the Hummers are mounted with M2 heavy-barrel machineguns. A small thing, but when you spend that much to make a movie, and it is one which is going to be viewed and analyzed by military hardware fanatics, one which you'd better freakin' well get right - especially if you're charging us $8 to see it. For those of us who AREN'T military hardware fans, an M60 is a Viet Nam era weapon which almost everyone would recognize... and an M2 heavy barrel machinegun is a WWI era weapon still in use. The two are totally different and look nothing alike.<br/><br/>In all it's generous to score Black Hawk Down a 4 of 10. I would say wait for it on video if you're going to see it at all, but then the film's only powerful impact - the battle scenes - would be greatly diminished. So maybe a dollar movie?"
"Laserwolf65","Null","3","7","30 July 2010"," This could be the most unpleasant film I've ever seen.
","What an awful experience. Do you remember all the buzz about the D-day scene from Saving Private Ryan? Imagine a whole movie that's just that. Black Hawk Down is that movie.<br/><br/>Giving a synopsis is very difficult simply because the film does a horrible job of explaining what's going on. Basically the Somalians are bad and the Americans go in and fight. We follow a bunch of random soldiers as they fight their way through.<br/><br/>The problem is that we don't ever get to know anything about them. They are just names and faces. One minute after the credits rolled, I could not remember the name of a single person in the entire thing. Not a single name! That is how unimportant these characters are.<br/><br/>It is impossible to care about what's going on if the reasons behind the chaos are vague at best, and the movie gives us no reason to care about its protagonists. Because of this, all I saw were random explosions and people getting maimed. Unfortunately that isn't even done right since I could never tell where anyone was in relation to anyone else or where/when these goings on were... well... going on.<br/><br/>I suppose that it could be argued that it was done this way to simulate the real confusion and chaos of the battle field, but I disagree. Real conflicts are complex things. They are not just random acts of violence. They involve real people; people with a past and family and friends. They involve complex political and social issues and conflicts. Ridley Scott's vision of war, on the other hand, has none of this so it cannot be simulating any kind of reality. Ridley Scott's vision of war is that of a hyper-active fourteen-year-old who just watched Saving Private Ryan and thought that the D-day scene was ""cool"" but that pesky story was boring and disposable.<br/><br/>1/2 out of 5 stars"
"chthon2","2","3","7","4 March 2003"," Good Acting & SPX Can't Save This Racist Piece of Propaganda
","In short, Ridley Scott attempts to summarize what exactly went down with the US soldiers in Somalia in 1993.  I would be more inclined to forgive this film's propaganda motive if it weren't for the fact that it was poorly directed at times.<br/><br/>There are definetly too many characters.  There is no development, and the only way an audience could feel a connection with these characters is if they wanted to, and forced the feelings out for some ideological reason or another.  Tom Sizemore was good as always, as was the rest of the cast considering the material they were working with, but they just can't save this.<br/><br/>I won't go into the many reasons as to why this film is such a racist and factually inaccurate piece of work, but I do have an interesting side note. Brendan Sexton, who played the role of Alphabet, was very publicly critical of this film after they edited it.  Apparently, his character had a monologue near the end about how the US shouldn't have been there in the first place, but in the wake of the Sept. 11th attacks, it was cut out to give this film just another piece of brainless insta-patriot spin.<br/><br/>On the upside, Ridley Scott did wonders visually.  Like Speilberg in Saving Private Ryan, another lackluster and unrealistic war film, Scott pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in the violence department. He has guts, and knows how to show the physical aspect of war very accurately. I've seen things similar to Somalia before (seriously, don't ask), and that is really what it's like.<br/><br/>When looking at this film from a critical standpoint, it's full of extremes in the areas of battle direction and story/developement, which still tend to balance out to a somewhat poor film.  This is one movie that, no matter how much I dislike many aspects of it, I would recommend seeing even though it isn't good.  Even people who dislike it even more than me admit that it stays with you.  So, see it for yourself."

After introducing us to the characters and explaining what they are doing in Somalia the action starts and when it does it hardly lets up until the final scene. The action is filmed in an exciting way without being overly frenetic. The ensemble cast does a fine job making us believe in the characters. The film is almost two and a half hours long but it doesn't seem like it as the action is so engrossing. At times it is a bit gruelling as it doesn't shy away from showing us the casualties. It isn't without flaws though; at the very end we are told that during the operation in which nineteen US service personnel lost their lives over a thousand Somalis died yet during the film they are almost entirely depicted in an unsympathetic light¬Ö at least there are a couple of scenes that depict innocents caught in the crossfire counter this.

When I saw the Black Hawk Down trailer, I thought that this would be one of those movies that would only have about 1 to 2 battle scenes (similar to what I expected from Tears of the Sun, although it was a good one). I didn't bother to pay and watch it at the theaters, but Id rather receive a copy once it was released. However, that changed after the first weekend of the movies initial release. I literally heard people talking about it everywhere I went. That concluded me to see the movie ASAP. Im not a theater person, so I planned to buy it. My dad sold DVD's a few years ago. Luckily for me, my dad received an overstock on the film, and he let me have a copy of it. Right when I got home, I immediately fed the DVD into the DVD player. Three hours later, I knew that this was the best war movie ever made, with Saving Private Ryan only coming close. <br/><br/>Today I own the movie, book, and the game. Black Hawk Down is the most excellent movie I have ever seen. It has everything needed in a war film, including a graphic field surgery. The movie was well organized, partly because most of the actors underwent real boot camp training. From the first half an hour or so of the movie, I was beginning to become upset since I nearly waited about half an hour until the intensity started flowing. But it was well organized, looking as if the movie was a documentary. <br/><br/>When the violent started happening, I was surprised! I have never seen a movie this graphic in detail, that within the first 15 minutes of the war scenes going on I needed to get the kids out of the room. (This movie shouldn't be watched with kids, some images could be too frightening for them, one of the most disturbing scenes showing the the overrun of the 2nd crash site. DO NOT LET CHILDREN VIEW THIS SCENE.) A lot of violence, including the defending of helicopter crash sites, the main concept of the movie. Most deaths in this movie are emotional, including a scene where the a lost rescue convoy is taking heavy fire, and a man is shown severed in half. It isn't shown until after he tells fellow soldiers at his aid, ""Tell my girls, ill be OK"", contributing to emotional deaths, one of the many counted in this movie. (Again, do not let children see this movie, since there is at least 1 person dying or getting shot every 10 minutes). Another concept I liked is that the movie is based off a true story. And also, the ending was great. The soldiers, finally returning to base after nearly 15 to 16 hours of intense, horrific firefighting on a mission that was only suppose to take an hour. They return to base at the end of the movie, only to remind the viewers that there are still men out there in the fighting area. One soldier, is shown getting ready to return to the the fight and find the men, prior to giving his final words in the movie, including the words ""Its about the man next to you."" (Soldiers are believing that the crew from the 2nd crashed helicopter, including pilot Mike Durrant and 2 delta snipers are still trapped in the city, marked as MIA, but viewers already know that the snipers and crew were killed, and Durrant was being held hostage.)<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was the greatest war movie I ever seen, if not THE greatest movie ever seen. I think explained enough. Great job to all the people involved in this movie."

","This stunning masterpiece ranks high up alongside such great war epics like Saving private Ryan and Apocalypse now. With a combination of Ridley Scots phenomenal directing and an array of well written and acted characters, the film really stands at the top of the action- war genre. The film is based on events which occurred in the early 90's when U.S. marines were sent in to capture two top Somalian lieutenants and hopefully end the bloody battles. The cinematography, directing and editing were the key points to the film. It was made to illustrate the danger faced by the military in such a situation and i think it achieves this well through the graphic battle scenes. I give this stunning film 10 out of 10 and if you liked saving private Ryan, you'll love this."

","This is my favorite movie. I've seen more times than any normal person should. The movie is an excellent war movie, that only shows 24 hours of the American operation in Somalia in 1993. The battle scenes in the movie were authenic and did not use any of the cheesy bs that you see in some other movies today. It is a real look at the operation that went horribly wrong. The scene where the Black Hawk is shot down was put together so well and did not overdue the CGI effects.<br/><br/>The scene in the movie where Jamie Smith was dying was shoot perfectly. The acting was superb, and the light hit the screen, so I felt bad for him.<br/><br/>I show this movie to all my friends, if you like good movies. See this movie. I cannot see how people could not like it."
"dundaswest","7","2","4","15 February 2007"," good action movie
","It is an action-war movie. Unlike the other war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line or Platoon, Black Hawk Down focuses on short period of the modern war in Somalia. Instead of the essential character building sequences, movie starts with the action and never it stops. <br/><br/>In the movie sound effects and cgi effects are outstanding. the movie has also a powerful editing style which creates very realistic and intense feel its audience. <br/><br/>Amazing cinematography, great direction style and atmosphere are also important elements for the movie.<br/><br/>Technically, Black Hawk Down is a good movie. Scenes perfectly manage to give realistic impression of the soldiers. But I believe that the real victims of war, civilians, more important than two or three American soldier's life. In addition, all Somali soldiers are shown as ruthless killers and the Americans are shown more humanitarian. <br/><br/>In that point of view, Black Hawk Down loses its point as a war movie."
"general-melchett","9","2","4","14 October 2006"," A realistic, gripping depiction of modern war!
","Black Hawk Down definitely beats Saving Private Ryan out on the violence stakes - this film does glorify war, but it glorifies it in a way that brings you closer to the action, and takes you back to that fateful day, in which the Americans learned that not all stories had a happy ending. Though we never get to know any of the characters or care about them, we do witness the struggles they go through, and learn that, in the film's words, ""nobody wants to be a hero. It sometimes turns out that way."" This film has a 30 minute or so beginning where we build up plot and get the film set up for action, and after that, it's solid war the rest of the way. The fight scenes are beautifully directed, choreographed and made - Ridley Scott's film should have won more Oscars, but it wasn't fortuitous that the first Lord of the Rings came out in the same year. The film was evidently filmed on a massive budget - nothing looks cheap about it - but it shows us that even stylized battle scenes can depict war just as realistically as non-stylized ones. On top of that, the film has a simply-written yet powerful ending, and a script that captures the true feel of war. Ridley Scott deserved more from this film than he got - though it wasn't a sham either. The exact opposite, in fact.<br/><br/>But what made Saving Private Ryan great was its varied and interesting characters, cracking script, realistic looking battle scenes and truly believable research. Black Hawk Down doesn't deliver as much in any of these aspects (save the battles), and will never be taken as seriously as SPR. Though it will never capture Ryan's heights, Black Hawk Down will stick in my mind forever as possibly this decade's greatest war film.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are any self-respecting fan of Ridley Scott, this is a must-see - it shows his true talent as a director (he got an Oscar nomination for this), and also shows his bravery at tackling the times that Americans don't remember so fondly. This film is great - do not miss it if you get the chance. 9/10"

","This movie isn't about, you know one hero, or a couple heroes, its about everyone being a hero, for the fact that No one gets left behind, and it shows, as characters did in fact give their lives for their comrades. This movie has some of the best special effects you'll ever find in a movie, thats why it won an academy award for it, two in fact. Certainly one of the best war movies, you can really feel the drama, especially with the music. These are the sad, but true events of the invasion of Mogadishu. The thing that amazes me is that this is'nt an all-star cast here, by no means. Josh Harnett is very new, Tom Sizemore is probably the most known, but a few others are in a couple other good movies. Its almost impossible to give this movie a low-rating. The acting was great, which made a bunch of no-name actors, big-time actors. A instant classic and a must-see. I really don't see any flaws in this film, honestly its worth the money."
"shino","10","2","4","29 August 2005"," Scott's best
","Oddly enough, I was underwhelmed by this film on first viewing--it was not the non-stop action-packed Bruckheimer-style thrill-fest I was initially expecting. But Black Hawk is in fact a remarkable film. Its slow and meticulous buildup is masterfully executed. The viewer is rapidly introduced to about a dozen characters during the long setup, and throughout the film, we see the action through their eyes. Scott segues from the frenetic to the lyrical effortlessly, from the cold-blue hardness of military action to the warn tones of the sun-drenched country.<br/><br/>Despite my opening comment, the film does have plenty of action, some of it the best ever filmed. The DVD shows some of the remarkable special effects (most of which were completely transparent to me, the before-and-after CGI comparisons are remarkable).<br/><br/>Acting is first-rate, especially considering most of the non-American cast had to adopt some remarkably powerful southern drawls--take Eric Bana for example.<br/><br/>I've always thought Scott was talented, from Alien and Blade Runner, but considered him somewhat superficial and technical. When Gladiator came out, I just remember sitting in the theater saying to myself ""when did he become such a Great filmmaker?"" Black Hawk confirms his greatness.<br/><br/>A number of sequences are beautifully executed, such as the capture of Atto, the men on one Blackhawk going out to get Bana, the other Blackhawk coming in to bring in Bloom crossing each other over the beach . Another wonderful sequence is the Mogadishu's early warning system as the raid flies in. Sequences flow into each other seamlessly and effortlessly. The scene where the soldiers drop down to secure Blackhawk #2 is one of the most harrowing in memory.<br/><br/>I think Scott makes absolutely no miscues in this one, every scene is deliberate and counts, and there is nothing throw-away or gratuitous.<br/><br/>I read Mark Bowden's book, and the film does inevitably compress some events and combine a few characters, but some of the more memorable characters, such as McGregor's Grimes and Sergeant Pilla were all real.<br/><br/>A final plus: lots of Elvis music."
"arthurclay","10","2","4","20 August 2005"," One of Ridley Scott's better pictures *SPOILERS*
","*SPOILERS* And certainly one of the three most bloodiest war pictures I have ever seen the other two being Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers. This is the story of a simple mission gone horribly horribly wrong. It happens because one idiot General (played wonderfully by Sam Shepard) orders a daylight raid in the heart of Mogadishu to capture some top level members of General Mohammad Farrah Aidid's militia. What results is nothing short of a complete disaster that turns into a military fiasco. A Black Hawk helicopter is shot down and the American General, being a true American, shouts ""Leave no man behind!"" despite the soon to be obvious fact that those men are already dead. So he needlessly puts more of his men's lives in serious peril resulting in yet another helicopter being shot down and more men being killed. Think he would have learned his lesson the first time? No he sends more soldiers into harm's way to recover those doomed men! By the end of the film the viewer is practically demanding that this U.S. General be shot by firing squad for extreme incompetence. The end result is that 19 U.S. soldiers and 2,000 Somalis are killed in a single day, resulting in the eventual pullout of U.S. troops after they kill Aidid. This film needed to be made to show the world both how horrid war is and the price that has to be paid in order to make the world safe and I commend Scott for having the guts to make it."

","I saw the DVD today and was so enthralled, I watched it twice. I sort of knew the story but since this event occurred during the beginning of the media venerated clinton administration; the whole story was never explained. The movie only makes a passing reference to the major reason why 19 soldiers died needlessly. Clinton and his minion, les aspin refused to allow light armor and c-130 gunship support for the troops; so delta force and the rangers were left to fend for themselves against a rampaging horde of somalis. <br/><br/>Hollywood would never say anything to disparage clinton so we are left with a cryptic statement regarding ""Washington"" refusing the aforementioned mechanized support. The fact of the matter is that if the soldiers had went in with support, the sad event would never have occurred.<br/><br/>This is clearly not what any good clinton-left winger want's to hear. That doesn't mean it isn't true. <br/><br/>I usually don't go into the politics of something but this needs to be said.<br/><br/>Now back to the movie: visually the movie is stunning, the cinematography and battle scenes are amazing. War should never be depicted as something glamorous; it is bloody and brutal. The violence in the movie is absolutely positively necessary. <br/><br/>I have heard 2 major complaints about the movie, one that the characters are not well developed and that the movie is one sided and racist.<br/><br/>Making some type of central character with a love story and other Hollywood clich√©s would truly detract from what this movie is about. It is about a group of soldiers fighting for their lives, not some inance piece of fluff in which the battle takes second place to some ridiculous love story.<br/><br/>The movie is one sided to an extent. It is not about the Somalis; it is about US soldiers. I agree that it would have been nice to have them explain themselves. Is it racist to point out that the US went in to help these people and had it's proverbial hand bitten. These people do not value life as most people. The Somali's statement to the effect that killing is negotiation is emblamatic of their belief system. If they valued life, they would not practice middle age tribalism. 1000 Somalis died in the raid; I have heard ad nauseum about those people. What about the 300,000 Somalis that starved to death, are those people not worth as much as the 1000 terrorists who died? Think about that.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, have you noticed that the comments from the UK and Europe are overwhelmingly negative? Interesting isn't it? I saw a few comments from Denmark. What the hell does Denmark have to contribute--besides something rotten?<br/><br/>Finally, this is a story that needed to be told in a gritty, brutal way. <br/><br/>A 9/10"
"LAKERS34","10","2","4","13 May 2004"," Men In Battle (With No Frills)
","Someone previously wrote that this film focuses on ""as much action as possible"" at the expense of story and character development...I think it's obvious the filmmakers made a conscious decision to take this path...The action IS the story...character development is relegated to supporting the ACTION. It's important to note that the action in this film makes us stop, think, and consider...it's anything but gratuitous.<br/><br/>There is a moment in the film when an unknown soldier, just prior to leaving the U.S. base for Mogadishu and the epic battle to follow, makes a last-ditch call to his wife. The film cuts to the soldier's residence stateside, where the silhouette of a woman moves to answer the phone as the answering machine clicks on. The brief shot of the home reveals comfort and the presence of children. The soldier leaves a brief message and he's off...just as the wife picks up the phone. We all know what will happen to this soldier... A simple yet memorable scene that tells us in broad strokes who these men are and what they are risking for Country. In another scene, Tom Sizemore (a U.S. Colonel) and his men are being cut to pieces. An RPG rips through one of the Colonel's convoy trucks, blowing a man in half. The Colonel unflinchingly walks over and takes the man's hand and looks into his eyes as he breathes his last amidst gunfire and explosions...A chilling moment, masterfully shot and anything but gratuitous! The whole film takes this path...<br/><br/>The action sequences in this film are incredible and match the standard set by ""Private Ryan"" and Spielberg. Ridley Scott has been considered part of the elite for many years and this film cements that reputation. Difficult to watch yet hard to look away from, Black Hawk Down proves timeless in its message and in its method...As we slowly lose control of the Middle East in the 21st Century, there will undoubtedly be new films that try to convey the same message...Men caught up in hells not of their choosing doing the best they can; ""It's all about the man next to you""<br/><br/>9 out of 10!"
"Equitas","Null","2","4","24 April 2004"," Worst war movie... EVER
","One major thing was missing from this movie. A little thing called character development. The characters were introduced and killed within about 5 minutes. One thing that generally makes war movies very powerful and different from other genres is that you get very attached to a character (it can even be the main character) and then he/she dies. This is powerful because you care about the character. When I was done watching Black Hawk Down, I didn't even remember any of the characters' names, let alone anything about them. Why should I give a damn about any of these guys? In short, this movie is the polar opposite of Saving Private Ryan in terms of character development. That said, the cinematography was incredible at times, and some of the battle scenes were very well done. But if you don't know anything about the guys who are fighting and dying, you might as well be watching Battlebots"
"Sennin","5","2","4","18 February 2004"," Fine Scott's incursion into the war movies, but it somehow tends to the average
","In first place, to be able to appreciate any movie from this genre you must be a-. a nationalist-imperialist green-go (or in the exterior, a pro-yankee that still thinks (or prefers to think) that the U.S. are the good guys of the movie); or well b-. ignore the strong propaganda that is patent on it, and to separate the moral/ethic judgment we may have about the facts from the movie it self. In this movie's case, as hard as it could be, I could achieve this last thing, and, from this position, I may say that it is a fine movie, but nothing extraordinary, and, when compared with other movies from the genre, it may become one more of the lot. Anyway, the tension is well managed, as well as the camera work and the takes, achieving some really interesting scenes. In addition you may notice the direction of someone that knows what he wants, and the plotline, though all the distracting factors that may attempt against it, manages to make it through the the movie and to perform without problem. Other than that, I can't bear it anymore, it's all cheap propaganda (as you may see it isn't that true that I managed to achieve the previously said). About the director, without regarding any personal opinion one may have about him, we can't deny that he is one of the most versatile directors there are in the medium, as there are not two of his movies that belong to the same genre, but, in an opposite way, he has made a foray into every genre he has been able to: from K. Dick's science-fiction, to the historical film, passing through the space terror; and later making he's epic megaproduction. In this terms, being this his first (and probably the last) incursion into the war genre it is not bad, but as said before, it doesn't go further than that."
"Kabumpo","3","2","4","6 July 2003"," Stupid and Tedious
","So this film is better than Scott's _Gladiator_, which isn't saying much, _Gladiator_ being up there with _Rocky_ and _The Greatest Show on Earth_ as films least deserving of Best Picture, and it has a good cast including Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Orlando Bloom, Sam Shepard, and Tom Sizemore, but if I had been one of those marines, I'd feel insulted by this movie, despite the tribute to the fallen officers at the end, which seem more to give the picture clout.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst war movies ever made. It's 2 hours of video game action and 5 minutes of character development, and 10 minutes of credits. All the best war movies let you get to know the characters, and this does it less than the most stereotypical films, do, and only then in the worst way possible, in the form of what Stanley Kubrick called the ""mandatory"" scenes he and his source novel avoided in _Full Metal Jacket_. That created a film with much richer characters and much more believable fights in just under 2 hours. _Black Hawk Down_ has none of what made _Full Metal Jacket_, or _Platoon_, or _Catch-22_, or _MASH_, or _Three Kings_, or _No Man's Land_, or even Armando Crispino's _Commandos_ so good. In _Full Metal Jacket_, the Viet Cong were an unseen enemy. Here, the Somalis are the evil hordes of _Dawn of the Dead_, a mass of savages, or ""skinnies"" as they're called, who are there to be slaughtered in a war that was supposed to help the people. The few Somali we see as more than cannon fodder are melodramatic villains ill-befitting a realistic film about war.<br/><br/>None of the necessary irony that a failed mission needs to have comes through, nor any of the tragedy. Since we don't get to know these people at all, Scott goes the Paul Verhoeven route by having them die the most gruesome ways possible--getting halved, a severed finger, an exploding body that looks straight out of _Dawn of the Dead_ (why is Scott getting good work when Romero is getting DTV?).<br/><br/>When someone is severely abused by the system, such as Alex Murphy in Verhoeven's _RoboCop_, a gruesome death can work effectively as a means for gaining sympathy, but routine horrific war violence has minimal impact without giving good definition to the characters who are being harmed. _Saving Private Ryan_ gave us graphic war violence, even if some of it was a little over the top (the guy picking up his own arm in a lame reference to Kurosawa's _Ran_, which probably should have been snipped), but it gave us characters to focus on who were viewing on this, and we learned more about them as the film progressed, and even while it relied on the tired one-of-each style, they were fleshed-out characters. These are ciphers.<br/><br/>On the technical point, the CGI is far less noticeable than it is in _Gladiator_. The artificiality of all the scenes made that film feel like a video game because of the look, even though the bad writing was pure Hollywood. This film is a live-action video game with ""cinema scenes"" to advance the story. All of this exemplifies why Jerry Bruckheimer productions suck and why he ought to be involved in video game development. His style is inherently distancing since it fits in so well with interactive media, and watching video games without playing them is rarely exciting for me anymore, and this film was unrelenting tedium. Maybe I grew up and Bruckheimer didn't. Scott should have known better, but he was never that great a director, and it's all been downhill for him since _Blade Runner_, despite the honors he has undeservedly received. Maybe Bruckheimer picked him because he shares his first name with a space pirate in the _Metroid_ video games, since video games are all he seems to understand.<br/><br/>Almost everyone I know had a similar reaction to this film, but it kept coming up in my Amazon ratings, and got largely good reviews, so I gave the film a look. Critics have to watch hundreds of films a year, and so perhaps they'd be best equipped to compare due to having that broader knowledge base. Why this picture struck so many so strongly when so many war films in recent memory are so much better I don't understand. Perhaps the convergence of cinema and video games has become so strong that what I regard as tastelessness and simple-mindedness is now regarded as classy. The extra star is for the cast that had to be in this dreck with barely functional lines and for the use of color, particularly greens, Scott imbues on it."
"mercybell","10","2","4","23 March 2003"," Compelling, profound look at modern warfare
","Black Hawk Down is an important film to watch in these times of war. It vividly and brutally portrays what war is like in an era of computers, helicopters, far range missiles, and select highly trained soldiers, without ever losing it's touch with the human side of the story or falling back on clich√©. <br/><br/>The film often feels like you're watching jazzed up news footage, with shaky news-camera type shot framing; the information always given bluntly through officers and soldiers giving orders. Thus, the profundity is taken from the visual cues, characters, and the chain of events of the story itself. The movie is extremely intense, the action and violence rarely stopping, yet unlike a lot of war films, it never feels gratuitous (shooting-for-the-heck-of-it-with-no-cinematic-reason), and the violence, special effects (crashing, building destruction, explosions) and gore don't look fake and are probably the most realistic fighting scenes I've ever seen. It all just adds to the realism and psuedo-documentary feel of the film. Suprisingly enough, it all helps the storyline as well. <br/><br/>You must pay attention or lose track of the storyline and characters (hint: keep an eye on their helmets, their names are written on the helmet band, and it proves VERY useful in keeping track of the characters). Unlike some war films, the many characters, despite their fairly divided and limited amount of screentime, endear themselves to the viewer, and the actors showcase some excellent acting. This isn't an acting film whatsoever, with very little scope, time, or material for the actors to create memorable characters, but this film seems to overcome that, and the acting is one of the shining points of the film. In one bloody and intense scene (and my favorite scene of the film), a young soldier (who we're inconspicuously acquainted with earlier in the film) is seriously wounded, and the ensuing scene, though intensely bloody and not `mushy', is also highly emotional. Scott and the actors just let the scene roll scene honestly and let it play out. The film is full of many such scenes, but it never once tries to manipulate your emotions. It is brutally honest and technical, sometimes confusing, but it was the news, is the stories of these men, and will one day be history. <br/><br/>But even more than the freshly conceived look at the human cost of the war and the amazing street fighting sequences, probably the most compelling and exciting aspect of the film is learning about what happened in Mogadishu and seeing how modern wars are fought. I had known almost nothing about it, but the film very clearly lays out what happened, and shows the tactics and dangers that modern soldiers face while going into hostile territory.<br/><br/>
This film is an important look at modern life that will be a very important source for people in years to come, to see what modern combat is like. Ironically enough, a year after it was made, the world is seeing, live on the news, what modern war is made of. Hopefully it will shed some perspective on the dangers that our soldiers face on a day to day basis. It also shows how great filmmaker can still take an old subject and make it fresh and new, but most importantly, the film brilliantly shows that through the years human cost, bravery, suffering, and sacrifice hasn't and will not change."

","Ridley Scott directs this excellent war drama. America Elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers and the 160th SOAR are sent into Mogadishu to remove the warlord Aidid and his lieutenants hopefully to restore some order in Somalia. A Black Hawk is shot down in the middle of the combat zone, and now it is a rescue and extraction mission full of confused misdirection. The viewer is up close and personal and F/X are superior. This movie is hardly emotion free and is not easy to forget. John Hartnett leads a notable cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs. I especially got a kick out of Elvis' ""Suspicious Minds"" as the mission took flight. There is not a lack of action or drama. BLACK HAWK DOWN will reinforce pride in those that put their lives on the line for freedom."

","I may be biased, based on the fact that I was in the 10th Mountain Div. in somalia, at the time. This was the most ridiculously misrepresented and inaccurate movie I have ever seen- If I hadn't paid to see it, I wouldn't have stayed past 5 minutes. ""Everyone calls it the Mogue"" - maybe they should have pulled a grand away from that massive special effects budget to hire a real military advisor and get it right! This movie was a joke from beginning to end. I truly believe that this movie makes our military look idiotic and pathetic.

","Before I comment about ""Black Hawk Down"", I would like to address the fact that some viewers are not impressed with this film for reason such as having a lack of plot, no character development, or being too violent.  While I can agree with the fact that this movie has little character development, but saying ""Black Hawk Down"" doesn't have enough plot or is too violent is too much to swallow.  This movie is a reinactment of a battle that actually took place in Oct. of '93.  While it isn't 100% accurate, it stays as true to the event as it possibly could.  This is what happened, people.  This is the story of the men who were there and what they had to endure.  There aren't supposed to be little plot gimmicks like character betrayal, and what not. I've heard of people complaining about the fact that it doesn't have a love story either.  This isn't ""Pearl Harbor"" people.  This movie doesn't have to have a rediculous love story to keep it interesting.  This is what ""Pearl Harbor"" should have been.  Second, this movie doesn't have to rely on character development to create an emotional connection between the audience and the characters.  We are given their names, and we've come to understand their personalities before they are thrown into the midst of battle.  What they have to face by the angry Somalian Militia is more than enough for us to care deeply about them.  We really don't need pointless info about where they grew up or what their parents were like.  Finally, some people have moaned and groaned about the amount of violence in the movie.  First of all, this isn't a Disney picture.  If you don't want to see realistic violence, go see ""Snow Dogs"".  Secondly, this is a war movie.  It portrays what soldiers have to face during battle, and sometimes violence is on that list. That's reality people, it happens during war.  What do you expect when thousands of bullets are flying is all directions?  There's going to be a very considerable amount of blood and gore.  People are going to be(SPOILERS!!!) blown in half, people are going to lose limbs, and yes, a bullet is going to rip through a leg and damage an artery.  That's the grim reality of war.  If you don't like it, don't go see a war movie.  It's as simple as that.  That aside, Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" is a masterpiece.  It is very well acted, and directed, and it's the most honest portrayal of what war is like is to date.  The score, by Hans Zimmer is classical in every sense of the word.  Its melodies are haunting yet uplifting.  It's one of Zimmer's best, bested only by his score for ""Gladiator"".  Everything else, from the camera work, to the special effects, is superb.  While I hesitate to call this the best motion picture of all time, I do feel, however, that it is the finest war picture ever made, and it is easily the best movie of 2001."

","""Black Hawk Down"" is everything that ""Saving Private Ryan"" wanted to be and should have been. But the film is smarter than Spielberg's masterpiece and director Ridley Scott (Oscar-nominated) took a few pages out of Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" to convey some really strong messages about war and what the U.S. military is in this day-and-age. It is 1993 and warlords are controlling Somalia and the capital city of Mogadishu is an important initiative for the U.S. to control as they try to prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of poor people who are unable to get food and supplies needed to survive. The mission is simple: capture the warlords, seize the city and clear the area so supplies can be transported to the starving people of the country. A 30-minute mission then turns ugly as the U.S. is ill-prepared and they under-estimate the fire-power of those on the ground. What follows is total chaos as two helicopters are shot down and a 30-minute exercise turns into a frightening 15-hour battle for survival within the walls of the city. In all dozens of Americans were wounded and 19 ended up dead in the event, not to mention 100s of Somalians as well who lost their lives. Ridley Scott spares no expense in the gore department as the film is brutally realistic and sometimes very difficult to watch, but Scott's film is very honest. Early on, he shows how the U.S. acted before the attack and it is not complimentary at all when it comes to the military. It shows a group of young men that are unaware of where they are and ignorant of the fact that danger is looming from every direction. Some were turned off by this, but I felt it made the film much better as it showed why this tragedy happened. The best performances came from Sam Shepard, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor, but this is a director's movie from the word ""go"". This is the best film of Ridley Scott's illustrious career and with much competition, it was the best film of 2001. 5 stars out of 5."

The action is pretty much non-stop the acting very solid overall very good war movie. The violence is realistic the personal stories from the actual soldiers make this a movie that feels very real and true. Not just shooting and death there are a number of stories showing the real men(and boys) that fought this battle. The only reason I didn't rate higher was near the end when, after the rescuers ran out of room in their armored vehicles, refusing to ride on top, a dozen or so soldiers run back to the safe zone. Called the Mogadishu Mile, they were running and fighting multiple technicals (vehicles with mounted heavy machine guns) In these scenes the technicals should have and would have just chopped them up. Instead they just drove back and forth not really shooting just for effect I guess. One other scene near the end has Hoot gearing up to co back out by himself, this most likely didn't happen. Once the rescue was completed there were no more engagements, only negotiations.
Still very good movie!"

","Black Hawk Down was based on the real incident where an American military raid in Somalia turns into a massive rescue mission. The film was pretty much an extended fire-fight: after 30 minutes setting up the characters and the situation it turned into near non-stop action. For fans of war films it will be a delight with Ridley Scott using a similar approach to Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. The war scenes were frantic and chaotic. Black Hawk Down had an ensemble cast that featured many emerging actors for the time e.g. Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewen McGregor, and Tom Hardy. Because of this, the film was more about the action and the characters surviving the waves of attacks. Although some characters stand out more than others like McGregor's Grimesey who goes out in the field for the first time. The focus on the soldiers and the tactics gave the film the feel of an older like A Bridge Too Far or even Zulu which Scott is a fan of.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down acts like a template of war films in 2010s, such as Lone Survivor, 13 Hours, and 12 Strong, all films focusing on American soldiers in seemingly impossible situations."

The atmosphere and tension was natural and there's no necessity of using music to amplify that. Even with the inconsistencies of certain characters, events and other armed units,the movie showed the operation of Delta Forces and helicopter crash correctly. Never I felt the raw tension and palpitation of Somali combatants creeping up to the injured pilots.All in all its a pretty gritty and on most parts accurate depiction and action grounded in realism. Revisiting this movie after watching ""Hacksaw Ridge"", made me appreciate it even more. We dont need over the top gore to depict horrors and tensions of war.

","What an extraordinary production BHD is, the attention to detail is everything that you would expect from a Ridley Scott film, and is astounding. It's an extensive and interesting cast too, with Sterling work from Eric Bana, William Fitchner and Josh Hartnett; although arguably it is Jason Isaacs (Hello Jason) who has the most to work with in terms of his character. Clearly the groundwork for BHD was laid by the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line', each released three years earlier, and BHD is more of a frenetic onslaught of near-constant combat than either of those game changing war films. It is also the most jingoistic of the three, managing to paint the ill-fated raid in the colours of victory despite the fact that it appears (I admit I'm no expert) to have been misguided and ultimately fruitless, and required the UN to bail the US troops out. In my opinion BHD is every bit as one dimensional as 'The Hurt Locker'. BHD lacks the questioning stance of films like 'Syriana' and 'Body of Lies', although it is a different animal, and being a historical piece BHD perhaps has to be forgiven for that lack. For all its failings BHD remains highly watchable if you are not put off by the constant tinkle of shell cases."

","Black Hawk Down is a movie about the events surrounding the Battle of Mogadishu where 18 American soldiers were killed. This movie takes no time giving the background or developing the characters. We see that Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his militia had been taking UN aid from the people who needed it and that's all we need to know. We get a brief glimpse of the Rangers and Delta Force operatives. We see that the Rangers are mostly comprised of well trained, but inexperienced young men. We also see that the Delta Force operatives are mostly older veterans who are very professional about how they do their job. Ridley Scott must have had a lot of assistance from the military when making this movie because the planning and execution of the raid seemed to right out of something you could see today in Afghanistan or Iraq. The Delta Force operatives come in with overwhelming force and capture Aidid and everyone at the meeting. They are fast and precise. Black Hawk Down highlights how professional our military has become. We only see brief glimpses of the Rangers or Delta Force losing their cool. Throughout the battle they are trying to find a way to get through the battle and keep as many of their men alive as they can. The only time they really have time to reflect on what occurred and the men they lost was after they were safe outside the city. You aren't going to see another Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line here. The movie does not go too deep in developing the characters and it does not try to send a message about war. It's an accurate depiction of what happened that day and what our men had to go through in order to make it through alive."

","In an attempt to deliver a serious blow to the warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid, American special forces on the 3. October 1993 went in to the capital of Somalia to catch two of his Lieutenants. Aidid was to some extent guilty in making the civilian population starve and an estimation of around 300.000 people died from this.<br/><br/>The Achilleus' heel of the American forces was, that they would leave none of their fellow soldiers behind. The turning point in the mission is then when a ""Black Hawk goes down"". This makes it necessary to secure the crash site and bring all dead and wounded back and in this process the American forces looses the initiative and speed and makes it possible for Aidid to counter-attack. The fighting escalates further and about 18 hours later 18 American soldiers are dead. This incident apparently made Defence Minister Les Aspin resign and also made USA more cautious about getting into conflicts abroad - at least until the Bush Doctrine.<br/><br/>Journalist Mark Bowden decided to write a book about the incident and later Ridley Scott decided to make a movie based on the book. When you have read the book you will notice that a lot of odd and sometimes funny anecdotes from it are present in the movie. Although the book as well as the movie tells the story from the American soldiers viewpoint the book tries to show how the fighting affects the civilians in Mogadishu. I think that this is an important aspect when you are trying to show what war is about. War is not just about the (American) soldier - war is also about the ""enemy"". Who is he? Does he care for those who are killed? Does he feel that he protects something of importance? Does he act aggressively because he has been manipulated or maybe even because he feels that he has something to revenge? Without his perspective any description of a war will be superficial and this is in fact one of my critical claims. Both from an ethical point of view but I also think that the story itself suffers from this one-sided perspective. I think that the movie feels quite ""lengthy"" and that it wouldn't necessary be so if we had gotten some of stories from the ""other side"". I think that there are always moral dilemmas involved when the decision is to go to war (as well as when you don't) but that this movie doesn't deal with them. Why not? Moral dilemmas are interesting and showing them isn't the same as not being loyal towards those soldiers who went in and put their life in danger. Why not show some of the more controversial stories from the book? If you spot an enemy trying to advance towards you, who at the same time holds a woman in front of him as a shield - what do you do? A Delta Force Ranger knows what he will do - and can you accept that? And of course this example isn't just a product of my imagination.<br/><br/>A large part of the movie consists of American soldiers trying to secure the Black Hawks who has crashed. We also follow the American convoy around in Mogadishu, for a long period, who has a difficult time finding the crash sites. These parts of the movie could, in my opinion, have been minimized to create more progression in the story.<br/><br/>There are several highlights though, like Mike Durant, Shughart and Gordon defending themselves against a big crowd.<br/><br/>Still this movie doesn't get a top rating from me as it didn't contain enough contrasts; too much repetitious fighting.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
"HelloTexas11","9","0","0","1 June 2008"," unflinching and disturbing war film
","'Black Hawk Down,' a riveting account of a US Special Forces raid into Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993 has come under criticism from various quarters, but not for reasons that are substantial or even make much sense. One of the Somalian warlords captured in the raid says it is not truthful because his party was in one car, not a convoy of three, and that only Somalian women wear earrings, not the men. Malaysian authorities are upset that their contribution is minimized (shades of the Brits and 'Objective, Burma') and assorted critics claim the film misrepresents the Somali people and is 'pro-war.' If 'Black Hawk Down' does not portray the situation in Somalia with complete accuracy, it is surely only in those things that films traditionally take license with, just as is done when compressing a 500-page novel into a two-hour screen entertainment. The salient facts are there; what you see in the movie is essentially what happened during those horrific hours between the time the raid started and the US forces, the ones that survived, were finally extracted. In fact, I daresay 'Black Hawk Down' is a great deal more accurate than the vast majority of war films based on true stories. Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991. It is more an area than a nation; numerous warring factions fought and continue to fight for control and the general populace are often caught in the crossfire. Many of them habitually chew khat, a plant with amphetamine-type effects. As portrayed in the film, many civilians are, frankly, stoned, some of them to the point of appearing zombie-like. Whether or not this is an accurate representation, I will leave to the experts, but it does not seem an unreasonable portrayal to me. As for being 'pro-war,' that seems an odd criticism. If depicting a military operation in which US soldiers are killed, sometimes brutally, and where so many aspects of that operation went terribly wrong, and in which the conclusion can hardly be considered a 'happy ending'... if all that qualifies a film to be considered 'pro-war,' well I guess it is. Doesn't seem that way, though. 'Black Hawk Down' is, however, a nail-bitingly tense movie that at times has the nightmarish feeling of a horror film; it shares many of the same qualities. Generally, I think, it is the feeling that help is so close but tantalizingly out of reach. Director Ridley Scott once again uses his considerable talents, this time to paint a picture of a region on earth that has fallen back from a state of civilization into a vicious, lawless condition, where gangs run by warlords make the rules, control food, water, and medicine, and mete out their own murderous form of 'justice.' I suppose the one recurring thought that kept running through my head as I watched was, what the hell are our soldiers doing there? I recommend this movie for the raw power of its images and its realistic depiction of a horrific situation, but be advised it is very unsettling."

","I enjoyed Black Hawk Down: the music is excellent and really sets the tenor and tone of the film; and the action is well portrayed by the cast and well filmed and very exciting, though it do go on for a bit too long without a break for this old man and was a lot to take in. It is seemingly very realistic; although I am not qualified to make any kind of judgment on its actual realism as I have never been in action, thankfully, and had to fight in battle. However, I will say that that is an objective of many, if not most, war films: seeming true to real war to a lay audience who have never been in action and seen battle and are not likely to. The lighting effects in filming the battle sequences, too, were very good and effective, though at times the film's visual tones did remind me of looking through lightly tinted sunglasses at dusk. Overall, though, I did very much enjoy watching Black Hawk Down."

","Please click this link for real images:<br/><br/>http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/ showpost.php?p=2389615&postcount=18<br/><br/>Good Day to everyone, I always like combat movies/TV series such as Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. In any film there might be inaccuracies. For example in this film it was the Royal Malaysian Armed Forces that actually provided the UN Search and Rescue Mission of Rangers and Delta Force with Condor Armoured Personnel Carrier (beside Pakistani tanks). It was depicted wrongly as 6X6 APC (Condor APC is 4X4). A dozen or more were contributed to the rescue effort, beside Pakistani Force the Royal Malaysian Army which also had casualty in the Battle of Mogadishu is not shown at all by the movie maker or at least put it in as a credit at the end of the movie. Its a great movie. I hope any Hollywood movie in the future will not take lightly the facts behind any story especially those involving life of man's trying to save others."

","Basically I agree with the majority of the critics, a good movie, but I didn't find it to be as outstanding as most claim.<br/><br/>I missed the background information at the beginning, then a lot of necessary info regarding to the why's and how's of the various battlefield decisions and situations. The movie was sometimes difficult to follow. Another thing that puzzled me, and I don't know if this is true, but the film portrays the Rangers as a bunch of idiots, or better said a bunch of ordinary soldiers, ""cannon food"" as the Germans would put it, not in any way the elite troops they are supposed to be. Only Delta is portrayed as an elite force, it's members are seen as self confident, knowledgeable and experienced, and the difference between the two in the movie is mind-boggling.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I found a lot of scenes, dialogs and ideas (especially at the beginning of the film) have been ""borrowed"" from films like 'Apocalypse Now' and other Vietnam classics.

It was a war that didn't need to be fought, and a victory that didn't need to be hailed. Only 19 soldiers lost their lives that day, but for the men who were lucky enough to survive, will never forget it.<br/><br/>'Black Hawk Down' is inspired by a true story in October of 1993 about American soldiers who give food to Somalia to prevent starvation. The warlords, led by Mohamed Aidad, take the food away and give it to the soldiers fighting for Somalia. America plans to make a quick attack by eliminating Aidad, but it ends up as a long battle (17 hours) for their lives once the American helicopters are shot down by heavily armed Somalians.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a quite talented director. He's given us the amazing 'Blade Runner',the disappointing 'Hannibal', and the thrilling 'Alien'. And now, 'Black Hawk Down' is, in my opinion, his best work. He does a brilliant portrayal of war and the horrors that it resembles.<br/><br/>Though the Somalian war was for not very long at all, it was still very brutal and non-stop. It is visually dazzling and very long. Throughout, we see soldiers helping other soldiers and risking their own lives in order to save others. That is one of the bravest things that anyone could do, and this film shows exactly that.<br/><br/>There was very little conversation going on throughout the fighting. We didn't really get to know the characters very well, but then again, there were many of the soldiers to know, and I think Scott didn't want to make the film overlong by doing so.<br/><br/>Even though we don't get to know the characters very well, director Scott still delivers dramatic and tragic scenes throughout, for both the Americans and Somalians. There is one scene involving an American soldier (Yurek; Thomas Guiry) who is almost shot by a young Somalian boy, who instead shoots his father on accident. The boy hugs his father and tries to help, and Yurek aims his gun away because he can't shoot a young kid.<br/><br/>Many people didn't like this film because of it's overuse of war scenes, little character development, and thought that it was trying to ""rip-off"" of 'Saving Private Ryan'. The acting was very good from about everyone. Josh Hartnett soars in the lead role, doing much better than the other War film he was in that year (Pearl Harbor, 2001). Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, and Sam Shepard do very well in the supporting roles. This film does remind me of 'Saving Private Ryan', but just with much more combat and a better message. If people thought that 'Private Ryan' was a slap in the face to moviegoers, then 'Black Hawk Down' is like a punch to the gut.<br/><br/>'Black Hawk Down' gives one of the greatest messages about war that I have ever seen. It is everything that 'Pearl Harbor' should have been. If a child were to see this, I recommend for a parent to see it with them. Not because the child may not be mature enough. So the parent can guide the child into not thinking that the war is ""cool"", but instead describing the horrors of war and explaining to them why it is wrong. War is the biggest fear nowadays, that sometimes may never be confronted. One of the best films of 2001 and quite objectively excellent with it's direction, acting and cinematography. 4.5 stars out of 5."

","Bravery without sentimentality, thats the way these soldiers perform their military duty. The filmmakers have rightly tried to produce their film to reflect this fact.<br/><br/>This film has become more significant in recent years. The U.S.A. has learned the lesson of Vietnam regarding war fighting (2003 Iraq war victory) but has not learned the lesson of Mogadishu (lack of advance planning for the Iraq police action since 2003).<br/><br/>Remarkable special effects, such as all those crowds running at night, helicopter crashes, etc. Good acting by the cast members. Well-made film in all respects.<br/><br/>Read the book either before or after viewing the movie. You can check out a copy free at most local libraries. It will enhance your understanding of the overall military operation, which does appear a bit too ""condensed"" in the movie. It will also detail the drawbacks of the amazing real-time view from above that the commanders actually had during the battle. The book humanizes the unfortunate citizens of Mogadishu (the film does a very poor job of this, but just doesn't have time). <br/><br/>Some other movies are pretty realistic, but ""Black Hawk Down"" is the definition of stark reality."

""Black Hawk Down"" is one of those cases. It tells the (real) story of an US Army troop which gets into Mogadiscio in order to oust some wicked Somalian generals, but this time the US got their fingers burnt, 'cause once they got into the downtown they realized that the zone was a terrible wasps' nest. From that moment on we assist to one of the more shocking and thrilling war-movies of the last years. Everything looks so goddamn real in ""Black Hawk Down"", it reminded me of the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with that camera that never quits on moving, it seems like the blood that comes out from the soldier's injured bodies is gonna splash you, you can even feel the heat (that yellowish tones of the photography increases the sensation of heat).<br/><br/>This time there are no fascist-reactionary-kingsoftheworld messages like in most of US war movies. This time the US army was there just to pay real help to the Somalian people. So it was the perfect situation to show the starkness and the brutality of war.

","I recently saw a copy of Black Hawk Down with only the knowledge that it covered the U.S.'s involvement in the events that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia. After seeing the movie for myself I must say that I was highly impressed. Director Ridley Scott did a great job depicting the gruesome realities of war. Throughout the movie we are presented with various characters, most of which are strongly developed. What impressed me the most about the film was just how many people they got to act out the Somali attack. There are many scenes in which the viewer sees hundreds of Somali with weapons rushing down streets towards the stranded American troops. The fighting was very realistic and made the horrors of war all the more clear, at least for me. With a long running time, the movie does a great job of depicting the sequence of events that occurred before the attack, during it, and after it. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in War and foreign affairs. It does an excellent job of depicting the idea that the U.S. is not always as strong as it thinks it is."

","This film try to show what the modern war is, in a very realistic way. Screen shots are incredibly powerful. You even don't understand all the action ! It's shooting from everywhere. You feel like any soldier into the battle.<br/><br/>The film doesn't let you take a breath: there's always something going on !<br/><br/>It's true to say that we can't have many feelings for the soldiers: Events are shown with such a distance that makes war no sense. But this is what war looks like. ""only the dead have seen the end of war"" (Platon)<br/><br/>From a wider point of view, it also shows that no external solution is really possible in case of a civil war. ""here, killing is doing politics"" says the guns dealer, caught early by the special forces.<br/><br/>It shows that even with the best intentions, the worse is always possible.<br/><br/>The film shows that sometimes, brute force is not a solution. Peace couldn't be won if all the civilians want to strike back (read at the end of Mark Bowden book: black hawk down). The army isn't the police of the world. Relationships between nations are more complicated than that.<br/><br/>The film also show that a war could start easy but could rapidly become quite more complicated. Tactically speaking, on the ground, this is called ""fog of war"" Polically speaking, this could be called a ""mud spool""<br/><br/>So, to my mind, the film says one thing: See what the soldiers really live. See their sacrifice. Is this really necessary ? Does the war goals (is there is any) worth this horror ?"

I think he dived out of the way of a rocket about 7 or 8 times. I'm sure Andrew can give a far more comprehensive list of who in it was cute so I won't bother.

","Black Hawk Down depicts how things went wrong in Mogadishu, but doesn't dwell on its history. The director Ridley Scott makes his intentions clear at the beginning of the movie that he's not interested in this events genesis; a few minutes of text on the screen gives a brief background of what has gripped Mogadishu; of warlord Aidid looting all the food and money meant for starving people.<br/><br/>BHD scores when re-producing the terrors of war on screen - the same depicted so realistically in Saving Private Ryan. Both movies walk hand-in-hand when it comes to conveying what war is all about: of pain, blood, and death. But the similarity ends here. SPR had plenty of room for character development, while BHD apparently did not. Or, Ridley Scott was too focused on war itself with the some male bonding instances that seemed to be reluctantly sprinkled around in the movie. Josh Harnett looked lost, and it looked like the character of SFC 'Hoot' Gibson had little time on screen. Tom Sizemore at his best as usual, but one gets a feeling that he's getting stereotyped in such war movie roles.<br/><br/>But it is unfair to put down BHD comparing it with SPR. BHD stand on its merit with tense and well shot war sequences. Exploding debris, dismembered limbs, a major medical procedure being performed on a soldier without even local anesthesia - all reinforcing the horrors of war. With some documentary style filming thrown in, BHD takes us right into the battlefield. But BHD could have been 20 minutes shorter. Towards the end, the continual images of war are taxing on the viewer.<br/><br/>Go for this if you are war movie fan. Avoid if you are allergic to blood, gore, and war."

The film focuses on the U.S. invasion of Somalia to capture a warlord who is starving his people in a vicious civil war. What the movie basically shows though is that war is indeed hell and that anything can happen at any given moment.  The camera herks and jerks around to follow the action and even if it is not, the camera appears to be hand held.

"Hunky Stud","8","0","0","25 April 2004"," A very realistic, bloody war movie. Is this accurate at all?
","I wonder where I was when I first saw this movie in 2004. I totally don't remember it. I just watched it again, a few days ago. And I was going to submit my rating on here, then I was surprised that I already rated this movie. <br/><br/>Anyway, I was wondering where Mohamed Farrah Aidid is now. And I found a news report from BBC, with the title of ""Warlord thumbs down for Somalia film"", if you search for it online, you can read it yourself. It seems that what we are seeing is a Hollywood version of that story. Could it be accurate as some viewers claimed on here? Were they there when it happened? After all, did they read the news directly from the Somali news agents? I doubt it. As the warlord told the BBC reporter, ""I don't recall myself that somebody has interviewed me in this regard and I have never given neither written nor verbal authorisation to anybody.""<br/><br/>If they are doing a movie about someone in the US or Europe, I am sure that they will have plenty of lengthy interviews with that person. This is indeed the typical US arrogant attitude toward third world people. <br/><br/>There are always two sides to the same story. So you might be deeply moved by what you saw in this movie, but you don't really know how the Somali people think about that event? After all, only about 19 US soldiers died, while over 1,000 Somali people were killed. How would you feel if someone killed that many people in your very own city in your own country?<br/><br/>This movie is good entertainment for anyone who wants to see how soldiers fight in an urban setting, but just don't assume that everything you saw is all real.<br/><br/>The following was writing on 25 April 2004. <br/><br/>Even though I have never participated in any war activities, and I hope that i never will, I think that this movie has given us a very realistic powerful view on the cruel bloody war. <br/><br/>close to the end of the movie, it is emotionally shocking to see an old man holding a dead boy's body walking pass right in front of a war tank car. Whoever decide to put that scene in the movie did an excellent job of giving out the powerful message about the importance of peace.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes or so, there were several clues about the soldiers making wrong life decisions, because they thought that this mission would be easy and short. And I was also thinking the whole mission will probably be over in the next 30 minutes of the movie. I was wrong, the war was so dangerous, full of blood, full of chances of death. Even thought it is more than two hours long, I was complete clued to the screen.<br/><br/>The thing is that this real war all happened when I was living happily in the US. the soldiers were killed, the local people were fighting for their own justice. it is a war that neither side wants to happen, but they defend for their own believes. and i wasn't even aware of it, like the rest of the people, we were just minding our own business. the war in Africa was only a gossip to most of us. <br/><br/>It is futuristic and ironic, when one of soldier mentioned that the war in that African country was much worse than the war happened in Iraq. Comparing with the war that is ongoing in Iraq, what this movie is shown is only a tiny fraction of the cruelty of the modern wars, yet it is very powerful to give us the realistic view of what a war can bring. <br/><br/>I hope that everyone who watched this movie would come to realize that peace is the best solution that we can ever ask for."
"William03","Null","0","0","11 April 2004"," Mogadishu Firefight
","Mogadishu Firefight `Black Hawk Down', directed by Ridley Scott, is based on an actual event. The movie starts out in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993, where it gives some background information about how the Untied States intervened to help stop the starvation caused by warfare among rival clans. The most powerful of the clans was the Habr Gidr, led by Muhammad Farrah Aidid. General Garrison (Sam Shepard) found out that there was going to be a meeting between Aidid's two top political advisors on the day of October 3, 1993. A force of about 120 men was assembled, made up of Special Forces, and went out to capture some of Aidid's advisors. However, things began to wrong after Todd Blackburn (Orlando Bloom) fell from a chopper. Later on, two choppers were shot down by RPGs. This lead to an intense firefight (biggest one since Vietnam) and some brave Americans died. The men there on that day were extremely dedicated to each other and they would not `leave no man behind.'<br/><br/>The movie's central idea is to show that war is hell. Ridley Scott (director) does not give the viewer the `fun and games' view of war in this movie and he defiantly does not glorify it. Once the movie gets going, it does not slow down. There is so much RPG, machine gun, and rifle fire around the whole time. The viewer is almost seized into the battle itself. The utter intensity and graphic violence is unbelievable. Mr. Scott wants the viewers to realize that war is a complete hell. He also shows us the good characteristics that come of it though (i.e., the gallantry, bravery, loyalty, and dedication).<br/><br/>
(MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A SPOILER HERE)<br/><br/>The feel a person receives from watching this movie is incredible, mainly because this movie is true for the most part. One powerful and emotional scene is when Corporal Smith (Charlie Hofheimer) was shot in the leg and the bullet struck his femoral artery. When Sergeant Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) and Captain Steele (Jason Issacs) call for a medivac, the people in charge decline, because it's too risky. The viewer can see the saddened, yet angered look in their eyes, and can feel sorry for Cpl. Smith, as he lay dying. Once again, Scott shows the horrible tragedies of war, as well as, the human emotions (i.e., gallantry, sadness, bravery) during war."

This is how a war movie should be: no romantic cliches of two soldier friends in love with the same woman, no flag waving glory crap, and no clearly drawn good guys or bad guys, even if our sympathies lie more with our own troops than the Somali war lords.<br/><br/>Anchoring the film is a strong cast that features Sam Shepard, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana (in the role that made him a star in American eyes), Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom in a small but crucial role as the man who falls out of the helicopter. It's an ironic bit of casting, seeing as how Bloom himself broke his back in real life and his claim to fame is playing the sleek, cat like Legalos in ""Lord of the Rings"". Just an actual incident recreated flawlessly and featuring violence so raw and powerful that you'd swear you were there (the first time I saw this film I swore I could taste the heat of the desert). Rarely is the horror of war so well depicted.<br/><br/>This is also probably Josh Hartnett's best performance to date. He's not eye candy for the girls here, he's just playing a regular guy (who ironically was not that involved in the real incident). If he keeps this up, he might actually have a career worth remembering after his pretty boy looks have faded.<br/><br/>Take it slow with this one."

Black Hawk down gives a realistic view of the fighting in my opinion. The director has succeeded well in capturing the mental state of the soldiers. This and the excellent acting makes Black Hawk Down a war movie better than average. Definitely a movie worth watching!"

There are simply too many people in the movie that you are supposed to get to know. If you don't know a character then you can't feel anything for them when they die or fall over sleep with someone's wife.<br/><br/>I mean don't movie makers think it's important for the audience to know who they are supposed to be watching?<br/><br/>Saying that the film LOOKED absolutely brilliant.

","Those of us who are or were soldiers call this a training film, and its very good. While I am not a Ranger, I was in a unit that had some former Rangers that were there. There take on the movie was ""it's about time.""<br/><br/>This is not a movie about the situation in Somalia. It is not a political movie. It is not a pro or anti-war movie. This movie is about extraordinary soldiers placed in an extraordinary situation in a  struggle to survive.<br/><br/>This is the first situation that the Rangers were forced to fight in close-quarters. The US policy makers having direct access to USASOC (that is the United States Army Special Operations Command) sent the Special Forces, Rangers, and Delta to kidnap the warlord responcible for the death of the somali people. Yes the Special Operations Command are the most highly trained soldiers the US has to offer, this situation was unlike they have experienced.<br/><br/>This is a story of what the soldiers went through that day. It is the hope that this movie would educate the world that the Special Operations Forces Soldiers are our mother's sons and your next door neighbors forced to fight a war a dictated by a nations foreign policy. This movie is about the soldiers life and their will to survive and their creed to ""leave no man behind."" This is also a story of how the soldiers have to perform a mission on less than pefect intel (a reality to be sure) yet train to succeed non-the-less. They fight to make sure their fellow soldiers make it back alive. As Hoot says in the movie: ""its all about the man next to you"" thats all.<br/><br/>If you ever wanted to see the Rangers and Delta in action, see this movie. It was because of the situation in Somalia that the training of the Rangers has been augmented with fighting in close quarters. Good acting, wonderful action, tearful moments and beautiful cinematography."

","While it certainly isn't perfectly accurate (what war movie is?), ""Black Hawk Down"" does what few war movies ever do - it portrays a battle without endless prattle about how horrible and futile war is.<br/><br/>Confused? Basically, it boils down to this: every acclaimed war movie has implicitly been anti-war. BHD is neither jingoistic or pacifist; the American soldiers and Somali militia being portrayed on screen are neither heroes nor villains. Rather, Ridley Scott lets the viewer interpret the actions of the people involved and make up their own mind.<br/><br/>That being said, I have to confess I especially loved the part of the movie where Shughart and Gordon selflessly drop in to save that second helicopter crew. I'm certain their families and their comrades are proud of the bravery they displayed in the face of overwhelming, hopeless odds."

","When this movie first came out I have to admit I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. To me it just seemed like another of the war movies coming out post 9/11.<br/><br/>Then I saw the History Channel Documentary and it made me want to see the movie that much more. So I waited until the DVD came out and bought it.<br/><br/>
It was the best 20 bucks I've ever spent, I've probably seen this movie close to a hundred times by now and I always find something new and interesting.<br/><br/>I have to admit I'm not your stereotypical war movie fan, I couldn't watch Saving Private Ryan, and the only two other war movies I'd enjoyed were Das Boot and Stalag 17. I'm also female.<br/><br/>But for some reason this movie hit home, probably because I'm old enough to remember the battle of mogadishu. Most of the complaints I seem to see about this movie are 1: There's no charachter development, honestly in the midst of war all soldiers look the same, and there are people you feel for when they die, Jamie Smith, Ruiz, Dom Pilla.<br/><br/>2 the lack of political commentary, this wasn't a documentary about the entire war, this was a movie about one day, and the things that happened during that day.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were realistic because most of them were filmed practically instead of with digital effects. The acting was great, especially Sizemore, Hartnett, and Johnny Strong who played Shugart. William Fichtner sticks out in my mind because of how well he potrayed Delta Operator Sanderson, as does Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>
What really impressed me was they managed to really convey just how loud a convoy of armored tanks can be, I live ten miles from the School of Hard Knox (Ft. Knox) the premier tank training facility in the us army and most days I wake up to the sound of tanks roaring across the landscape.<br/><br/>
All in all it was a great movie. Maybe my favorite of all time because it showed that yes war is cold and unforgiving. And you don't know what you're going to do until that first bullet wizes past your head."

","Black Hawk Down just tries to be honest about the 1992 experience in Mogadishu, and does not make claims over and above the events.  Rarely is a 'war movie' not about someone's notion of patriotism, or pacifism, or peace, Shakespeare, ethics, morality . . . The audience gains dignity by witnessing events without being spoon-fed something 'more.'  The soldiers gain dignity without having something 'more' deemed necessary over them for a worthwhile movie.  This might be the best war movie for those who appreciate an honest approach to an event as terrible as war, and, because of its seriousness, to be allowed to form their own judgements. There are great actors in the movie too.  They give great performances, and as such they don't . . . stand out.  I remember that the New Yorker called their performances, ""selfless."" People who think it was an ordinary war movie have perhaps so little an idea (based on having no interest) of the realities of today's army that they just don't know when they're being shown something false, and when they're seeing something pretty genuine.  I figure that's the case."

Based on a true story. <br/><br/>I usually don't like war films because far too often they are gratuitous and pointless, but what we have here is not just a good film, but a classic war film. Indeed something that can be put alongside Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far.<br/><br/>(While the above are not among my favourite movies they give us a good insight in to what other people had to go through on our behalf. A place that you hope fate doesn't drop you sometime in the future.)<br/><br/>Usually you criticise films for their chaos and lack of overall clarity, but here the moments of confusion and ambiguity are appropriate. When you watch it first time you can enjoy (if that is the right word) the ride, when you watch it the second time you can see the detail and structure. Director Scott brings us in to the movie through angles and emotions (the stone cold war room trying to figure it all out like a chess game versus the grunt in the line of fire), to the point where we are ducking with the actors as the flack comes our way. <br/><br/>(Some of the scenes set to music are just strangely beautiful. Soldiers running for their lives to wailing middle-eastern music haunted me for days after seeing it. There is no real reason for it - in the telling of a story - but the image and the music somehow work magic.)  <br/><br/>The soldiers mission is simple to comprehend: Let us try and complete our mission and then get out of here alive; but there is a real sense of the honour and bravery that has to make up a modern army. You have to know that if the worst happens, no expense will be spared to try and save you. This isn't just Hollywood - it is true.<br/><br/>This is a message film whose message is only just being understood: that well intentioned actions can go horribly wrong and no matter what your technological superiority there has to be a price to pay: and the everyday soldier is the person likely to pay that price. <br/><br/>A film that can be enjoyed as a simple action piece or as a message picture; or if you smart enough a combination of both. One of these films that - while hardly unregarded now - could grow-and-grow until it becomes an all-time classic. I guess it all depends on how world history plays itself out and how common situations like this become."

","I read Mark Bowden's written account of the events in Mogadishu some years ago and came to the conclusion that it was the most gripping and disturbing account of real live infantry combat I had ever read. The book has been read many times since.<br/><br/>When I heard a big budget Hollywood production was in the offering I was horrified - letting that monster loose on such a recent and sensitive event seemed a terrible prospect. With the film listed as a Bruckheimer production it got worse, this was a producer whose past efforts clearly showed that as long as he got big bucks and big bangs, everything else could go take a flying jump. Big bangs would obviously be needed, but so would a respectful and sensitive approach to a event that is still recent history. This could not be another Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>I could not have been further wrong, and this may well be the finest war film I have ever seen. How Scott managed to rein in the usual Bruckheimer excesses I will never know. Even the usual Bruckheimer trade mark, that sickly sentimental patriotism that is so provocative to a non-US audience is, thankfully, largely absent. <br/><br/>The availability of US Rangers and the correct aviation assets from the 160th SOAR add greatly to the films authenticity, as does the location.<br/><br/>
Obviously translating the events of that day into a film that a lay person in a cinema could follow, while still staying faithful to what actually happened and the confusion of infantry combat was going to be near impossible. Here is where the films makers have achieved that impossible goal, and comments from witnesses have endorsed that. <br/><br/>Critics have said the film does not follow the expected conventions of storytelling and characterization. I can only say that that is a great relief. To take such a well documented event, and make it into a piece of entertainment to fit the expectations of critics and viewers alike would have been an absolute disaster and for resisting that approach Bruckheimer and Scott must be applauded. <br/><br/>It is not a easy film to follow, and is all the better for it, but I believe that Black Hawk Down is perhaps arguably the finest war film I have seen."

","When I saw this movie in the theaters, I walked out thinking to myself that I had just paid to see a two hour action scene. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it somewhat. Upon first watching though, it's kind of hard to tell exactly what's going on. They don't really make too much of an attempt to humanize too many of the characters and when they're running around later getting shot at from every direction, you really won't be able to tell who's who. I think this movie is definitely worth seeing at least twice because in my case, the story didn't really hit me until I saw it the second time on DVD. What's amazing about the movie is that even if only half of what was portrayed was remotely true, it still shakes you up to think that these things go on in our world. One thing I found interesting was that the movie isn't necessarily a gung-ho pro-American movie. Yeah, it's patriotic but the film serves more to show how well-trained the soldiers trying to escape the city actually were. I found the movie to be really intense. I mean, you get about twenty-five minutes of set-up and then the rest of the movie is literally a huge battle with the citizens of the city. While the ratio of American kills to Somalian kills was pretty low (something like 19 Americans to over 1,000 Somalis), you still feel it when the Americans take casualties. The scenes with the helicopters going down and the aftermath are really grim and the thought of actually being in a conflict like that makes one feel a bit tense. The battle scenes are very violent and you will not be bored watching this movie. In fact, you may think it has too much action. I recommend the movie strongly, at the very least for the technical design and Ridley Scott's direction, which is always spot-on. <br/><br/>RATING: **** out of *****."

","Black Hawk Down is one of those rare movies that I find myself watching repeatedly and pressing on friends, family and anyone else who cares to listen. It is without doubt one of my favourite movies and I will tell you why. In 1993 America intervened in Somalia. First by sending in 20 000 marines (maybe not exact figure but it's in my head from somewhere) to aid UN efforts to feed the thousands of starving Somalians, later that year they brought in their special ops, their Task Force Ranger to track down the warlord Aidid. When I first saw Black Hawk Down I did not know any of these things, I in fact knew nothing about this movie other than it was a war movie and it starred Josh Hartnett. Seeing this movie made me realise something, I was alive in 1993 (okay only 7 at the time) and yet I knew nothing about what had happened then, you could i guess say the film was an educational experience for me but it was more than that. The movie inspired me and afterwards I read the book by Mark Bowden and have done research of my own to bring myself to the point where I feel that relatively I know what happened that day. <br/><br/>So now I know the facts and I know the movie is not completely accurate, and that certain people's roles have been beefed up or amalgamated into one person however I still watch it because this is a GOOD movie!! Ridley Scott throws us right into the action on that day. We see war for what it really is. Yes war is hell but in that extreme situation we see other humans doing amazing things; the best example I can think of is Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon roping in when the second helicopter went down. Their bravery speaks for itself, amazing people. <br/><br/>The movie has been criticized for having all the characters look alike and blend in but that's the point, no person should stand out as ""the star"" they are a team. The acting is very good and some of my favourite scenes are the ones showing the camaraderie between the men such as the scenes in the hangar before the mission. I have seen the movie countless times and yet I still cry during the scene where the medic and other soldiers battle to save Jamie Smith.<br/><br/>Yes this movie has flaws, it is hugely one sided in parts showing the Somalians as an evil mob. However the good things outweigh the flaws. this is a great movie with great performances.

If you want exactly what happend to be put into a movie be ready to watch a movie thats 18hours long, and has mulitipul things happening at the same time (possible each person could have their own box!) This is and unrealistic notion, and though the movie does cut some stuff, and change things around in order to give what was litterally total chaos an easy to follow plot, it does so in such a way that people are exposed to the bravery and courage of the young men that were really there. As for the claim that the movie has no plot, thats simply not true, however if they mean that they didn't care about what was happening in the film, then they are forgetting that this event really happend, and that the script is somewhat dependent on people knowing this.<br/><br/>Personally I loved the film, Ridly Scotts direction was surpurbe, and the way he brought you into the battle was horrifingly effective. It is ture that the movie drops a lot of the history leading up to the events it portrays, but then again the movie isnt about the history of the Somalian crisis. All considered the film accuratly depicts war, and to a great degree the events on October 4th 1993. This combined with the excellent direction, FX, and story lead me to give this movie a 9/10.<br/><br/>Disagreement is what makes America, and all other democracies great, so nothing personal to people I disagree with, and no offence taken if you don't agree with me.

Other soldiers have different agendas while being stationed in Mogadishu until they are called by General Garrison (Sam Sheppard) to go inside the city where all hell breaks loose. The townspeople are now in war with the U.S. soldiers where the film cuts to different sections with different actors from Tom Sizemore who leads one part of an infantry by cars; Ewan McGregor plays Grimes who joins in with William Fitchner after being separated from his squad sees what it's like to be in the war rather than typing on computers.<br/><br/>After movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" came out in theaters, directors wanted to make realistic war movies and Ridley Scott does one hell of a job without having to bring in a sermon lesson. The list of actors feature an all-star cast from Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan Bremmer and William Fitchner who all worked in ""Pearl Harbor"" and do much hell of a better job than in ""Harbor"" while having other cast members from Ewan McGregor, Sam Sheppard, Jason Issacs, Eric Bana and more."

","I felt like many of the times in the movie I was watching a combat cameraman's footage of the fight. Very similar to how I felt in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (remember the fight at the radar site). As far as character development. This is a 24 hour almost-continuos firefight. Kinda hard to solve the mysteries of life when your buddies are being shown blown in half by an RPG. There is enough, Eversman from scared first timer to combat vet leader. Grimes from office clerk to young warrior. Durant from cocky spec op heli pilot to eyewitness to a supremely brave act and then resigned P.O.W.<br/><br/>This movie is an example of the change that has occurred in recently from the 50's, 60's, and 70's war movies. The actual horrors and stress of war were only briefly shown or alluded to. They were an almost glamorization of war. Yeah, I bought into it too. Now days you see that to be a warrior requires a sacrifice, of limb, mind, even life. You see the chaos and disorder of war (the fog of war).<br/><br/>I wish this would have been available in my days as an officer in the US Army. As a tool to prepare a young combat arms officer to be a combat leader, this would have been invaluable. Perhaps someone in the Pentagon will realize the need to teach about combat stress and not about sexual harassment or equal opportunity."

","I love military-action movies, and this was by far the best. It won 2 Academy Awards (Best Film Editing and Best Sound) and I can believe it. It is about 100 U.S. soldiers who were dropped down over a crowded market in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993 to capture two top lieutenants of a brutal Somali warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid. Aidid's militia has been starving the Somali people by taking control of all the UN food aid that comes in and he is basically starving people to death (when he's not shooting them). The soldiers' mission was supposed to take an hour (many soldiers didnt even care about wearing a flak vest or not) but they ended up surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis fighting for their lives throughout the night, with many, many casualties as well as two seemingly-invincible Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The acting is great, and Josh Harnett proves that he can play an aggressive soldier just as well as he can play different characters in other films (The Faculty, Pearl Harbor, etc.). The special effects are completely incredible, by far beating out the action scenes in Saving Private Ryan. If you like action or modern-war movies, or just like any exciting film, you have to see this! Feel free to email me if you have any questions."

","Black Hawk down is a very interesting movie based on a true story. It takes place in Somalia in 1993, after the U.N. had helped deliver food to 300 thousand starving Somalis. The U.S. left some soldiers behind, and when a Somali warlord rises up to challenge them, the U.S. responds. Things go wrong when several squads of U.S. army Rangers and Delta Force are ambushed in the capital city of Somalia. The action heats up when what was supposed to be a half-hour mission to capture a Somali warlord's top ranking personel turns into a rescue mission when two UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopters are shot down by Somali militia armed with RPG's (rocket-propeled-grenades). The movie has a dizzying number of characters that all somehow tie into the plot, but some of them serve no purpose at all except to prove a point (i.e. when a soldier gets shot in the back and dies because he removed the armor plate in the back of his vest, just so he doesn't have to carry as much). The action sequences are beautifuly filmed, much like the opening D-day scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but they also make it hard to follow who's who. At several points, I found myself asking ""Who was that who just got shot?"" or ""Was that a main character or not?"", it's nearly impossible to keep trak of what's going on! The human factor is well displayed through multiple sequences and add to effect of relizing the actual horror of combat and the general sadness of what the movie is about. All around, I'd give this movie 4.5 out of 5."

I'm surprised it didn't do so well at the european box office(although it didn't do that bad). It was critically well received. All the downsides (there were very little) featured in the reviews in Europe were the same as the ones in the States. There is no flag-waving BUT: THERE""S NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! and 'IT'S A SOMALI-SHOOT-EM-UP'.<br/><br/>I get a little angry when I hear that. Why won't they understand it's NOT about the characters. We don't want to know if one of the soldiers is a schoolteacher like in SPR!!!ITS ABOUT THE EVENT!!! ITS ABOUT HOW THEY DIED not HOW THEY LIVED!!!And as for the somali-shoot-em-up; That's what it WAS!!! more than 1000 somali's were KILLED!!! OK? So basically this movie has no bad aspects. I did however discover one tiny mistake in the sound editing. I don't remember exactly but there was a scene where - I believe it was Twombley - is running towards the rest of the men during prayer and you can see impacts of bullets on the ground yet we don't hear gunfire. Tiny mistake... Overall this movie is better than any other war movie I've ever seen... It would have been a worthy nomination at the Academy Awards.

","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I was mentally exhausted.  Take the ending battle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and stretch it to two hours, and that's the intensity of ""Black Hawk Down.""<br/><br/>Following the introductory prelude, the ultra-realistic battle action was unrelenting.  Character development was not stressed (although all the acting was solid), but that wasn't necessary to the structure of the movie. Story was, and it was quite good.  I learned a lot about a battle about which I knew virtually nothing.  <br/><br/>My favorite movie moment of 2001 occurs over halfway through, when American helicopters zoom across a battle zone with Gatling guns blazing, pinning down the opposition and freeing up U.S. troops.  Seeing and hearing that as an American soldier had to be one of the greatest feelings of all time.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  I find it fascinating that a story can be so good w/o much character development, but in this case, it works very well.  The story basically tells itself, and Ridley Scott and company produced great war visuals.  One of the top five of 2001 and in the top tier of turn-of-the-century war movies.  8.5/10"

It's not a bunch of talking generals, planning out their war strategies.  It's about actual combat, and the combat lasts for an entire day in this movie.<br/><br/>Basically, Black Hawk Down is a survivor movie.  The characters are flung into total havoc in a hostile area in Somalia, and must battle for their lives and return to base.  Usually survivor movies appeal to me (such as Jurassic Park), and I was so surprised to see just how good Black Hawk Down was.<br/><br/>The characters are kind of shallow, however, as there isn't TOO much dialogue in the beginning.  But it's not really necessary, because within fifteen minutes of the movie, the action begins... and never ends.<br/><br/>But it's not a dull action.  It's suspenseful (and sometimes comical).  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  However, there are SOME gory parts, but not as many as, say, Saving Private Ryan.

My best friend in school joined the Army shortly after high school and became a helicopter mechanic. An admirable occupation for sure, but we sure worried about him when he spent the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia/Kuwait/Iraq. And shortly after hearing about trouble in Somalia, he was on his way over there. I admit that before this movie, I didn't know that much about this incident. I had heard about the book, but didn't really know the details. Shortly after seeing the preview for the movie, I emailed Charlie to find out more. Yes, he was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia, but he had come home shortly before this event took place. However, he did know many of the people who were involved in it. He told me about what he went through personally waiting for the outcome and how hard it was for him. His story really brought it home for me and personalized this movie like no other war movie. It was more real when seeing the soldiers injured and killed. I just watched this movie for the second time and the effect wasn't lessened. I found myself getting chills like never before when watching a war movie. The movie itself is excellently and realistically filmed. It definitely puts you in the middle of the battle. The most frustrating thing for me was watching the poor command decisions being made by guys in charge that lead to this incident being worse than it had to be. Keeping the chopper circling over head, when those on board wanted so much to get in there and help the trapped soldiers. I know the chain of command is important in the military, but sometimes I think it's important to trust the soldiers who are there in the battle. I have always had a great respect for soldiers who are willing to put their life on the line for the sake of the country, but am often frustrated by the leaders that put them in such awful situations in the first place. It's a great story of comraderie between the soldiers. The scenes where the soldiers make it back to base, but go back out again are very touching. It is so hard for me to fully comprehend having one's life depend on the randomness of where a bullet happens to fly in battle. I'm pretty sure I could handle myself as good as the next guy, but I don't ever want to be in that situation. Because if it's not you, then it's probably your buddy next to you. I definitely sleep better at night knowing Charlie has retired from the military and is now launching rockets for Boeing. I respect his service that he put in for our country, but am happy to know that I'm not going to get a phone call that he's off to some God awful part of the globe.

This is a war movie that is about the process of fighting and nothing more. The action does suggest the fallacy of assumed superiority and while it is clearly portraying the mission as misguided, it does work at portraying the individual soldiers as heroes. This may or may not be acceptable to you depending on your personal ideology but that's where the movies heart is at. I read Bowden's book and the works of others on the subject. The film seems to stick closely to reality except for the manufactured scene of Aidid's men shooting people at the food distribution center and the made up character of the captured arms dealer. It would have been interesting to learn more about some of the soldiers and to maybe hear of the mis-steps the Americans had made that provoked such anger from the Somali people. A more critical reviewer might say that the films setup is a lie, but I don't think the film really has a setup. It's all about the action and the action is superbly rendered. The performances are all good enough for what the cast is asked to do, with Eric Bana being a standout as the consummate professional soldier. Strongly recommended."

While the movie makes clear that some sort of ""policing"" force was necessary to try to establish at least a semblance of order in this completely chaotic and starvation-riddled country ruled by rival warlords, it also clearly questions the effectiveness of the U.S. forces, points out the tensions between the U.S forces and the Pakistani U.N. peacekeepers and demonstrates the uncalled for bravado of some of the American soldiers, who seemed to think this was going to be fun. In the end we see a horrific example of urban warfare as U.S. soldiers have to rescue the crew of a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down. At the same time, one has to admire the commitment of the Americans to ensure that ""no one gets left behind"" - even those who were killed.<br/><br/>The cast is clearly secondary to the story here.

The movie is a little slow starting (although in the first five or ten minutes there's a good introduction to the situation in Somalia) but once the action begins it is chilling. As I said, the violence is extremely graphic. This is not a movie to watch with your seven year old. But it is a very good movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The battle of Mogadishu was in some respects America's Roarks' Drift.  A handful of soldiers are trapped and surrounded by overwhelming numbers of enraged locals.  In the case of Roarks' drift, the locals were Zuli wariors, fresh from slaughtering a British army at Ishwandla.  Against them were a tiny group of British soldiers.  Yet against the odds the British held off the Zulus and most of them survived.  <br/><br/>Roarks' drift was, of course, made into the fantastic film ""Zulu"" with Michael Cain and Stanley Baker as the two mis-matched lieutenants in charge of the impossible task of defending the British position.  ""Black Hawk Down"" could have been a great retelling of this classic--reflecting both the heroism of the soldiers and the uncomfortable links between British colonialism and modern ""nation building.""  Sadly, Scott opts to stay as close to the events of the real battle as possible.  This means flooding the audience with a confusing array of soldiers from several distinct organizations.  I didn't understand it all until I read the book.  Even then it took many viewings to get everyone straight.  <br/><br/>Scott should have taken more liberties with reality if he wanted to make a great film.  There are many great potential conflicts in the story, but none are expanded upon.  Scott should have focused on two or three main characters and used their conflict to tell the larger story. <br/><br/>
But, as it is, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a fine war film, especially if you can watch it several times with the book in hand.  It gets high marks for using the actual sound of the weapons in quesion, from the big fifties of the Technicals to the SAW's and M-16A2's.  This may have upset some in the audience, but it improves the film in my opinion.  Firearms should sound like firearms, not like some bizarre combination of cannons and .38 Special blanks.  The combat scenes also get high marks in my book.  They are nasty and brutal.  When the first soldier gets hit in the head, he falls like a dead piece of meat.  It hits home.  The rest of the fatalities follow reality pretty closely, down to a severed thumb and a live RPG stuck in a body.  This is how combat should be shown."

I agree that the end where they list the 19 Americans who died was a little bit bad, but what did you want them to do? List all the 1000 somalis who died? How would they ever find out all their names? They didn't have to list any names I suppose, but at least they went to the trouble of honoring the Americans (as if they need any more of that). I suppose what they could have done was just put ""We also remember the 1000 Somalis, names unknown, who died bravely in this tragedy.""<br/><br/>All in all though, a very entertaining and accurate depiction of one of the greatest blunders in US Military history.

","I haven't seen this movie in some time but now feel compelled to offer my opinion, First off this is just that, an opinion. I realize that this movie provided a lot in the way of, not only entertainment, but patriotism and a unified belief in what America stands for. So, I'm not trying to belittle any of that. Having said that I have to admit I was quite disappointed with Ridley Scott's effort here. I love a good action flick as much as anyone, but I also watch other genres and with:<br/><br/>1) a fantastic & untapped story like this- for any interested in what actually occurred I would suggest reading the novel by Mark Bowden; it's much more clear.<br/><br/>2) a director of Ridley Scott's caliber- which I personally disagree with. Alien was great and Thelma & Louise was good too, but Gladiator & Blade Runner are highly overrated movies and Hannibal, GI Jane, White Squall, Black Rain and Legend are all pathetic.<br/><br/>3) the budget, the cast, etc., etc., etc. I expected something (epic, enthralling, moving) and ended up with a film with at least 18 main characters. The story is all over the place, never once gaining any discernible focus other than ""we leave no one behind"" or some such nonsense... Ewan McGregor has no part in this movie, Orlando Bloom is better as Legolas (much), Hartnett should stick more dramatic/less action because he's a good actor though has received less praise due to 13 yr old female's obsession with him....and as for Tom Sizemore, he's become one of the biggest jokes in the film industry since Jean Claude Van Damme. There are good parts to this movie but I felt like the masses were blindly praising this movie and needed to get this off my chest. 5* out of 10*"

","Blackhawk Down, directed by Ridley Scott, is a film based on the book by Mark Bowden about a 1993 U.S. military special-forces battle against an oppressive Somali warlord named Mohamed Farrah Aidid. He cuts off shipments of food at the ports of East Africa in a time of mass starvation in order to build himself an army and raise himself into power. After a brief, but beautifully shot exposition, most of the film takes place in the invasion gone wrong on the streets of Mogadishu. While the film carries a powerful message about the indiscriminateness of war and questions the role of US military aid in other countries, it falls short because the true nature of the story does not allow enough of the characters to be developed as much as they should be. The characters that should carry an emotional obstacle to overcome are trained to suspend fear and do what they are told. Every soldier in the film is willing to help out without question, so the only obstacle they have is to watch out for each other, accomplish their mission, and return alive. Although almost every character shows acts of heroism, including Ranger Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, played by Josh Hartnett and Delta Sergeant 1st Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, played by Eric Bana, it's simply the duty and brotherhood of a soldier that compels them. The editing in this film is excellent; done by Pietro Scalia, who won an Oscar for Best Editing. Since most of the film is a long stretch of action scenes, it was a complex editing job. There are many fast cuts edited together with slow motion, subjective and objective shots. It was an accomplishment to intersperse shots of the enemy's struggle as well. Although the teams of Army Rangers and Delta Commandoes are difficult to track, this lack of direction adds to the chaotic experience of combat. It brings a new appreciation for the rigorous training that these soldiers go through because the audience experiences combat gone wrong, and the courage it takes to endure hardships on the battlefield The cinematography in this film is all very attractive to the eye. The shots in the day are blue and dusty tinted, and at night there are lots of contrasting greens and reds. The real Blackhawk helicopters themselves create an exciting visual element that allows for gorgeous shots of the soldiers cruising past landscapes such as the run down city and glistening ocean. The computer generated `Little Bird' Delta commando helicopters that swoop into the city also allow great long shots of the action. In addition, handheld shots are used frequently in battle scenes to effectively to add to the chaos. Overall the shots are skillfully composed, but due to the amount of action in the film, not every shot has a deeper meaning. Lighting is used extensively in this film to portray emotion, such as when Hooten tells Eversmann to think about withdrawing his men, for example. The sinking feeling as he realizes that he will soon be taken out of the fight and replaced is conveyed with a distinct blue tint and jagged lines of light across Eversmann's face. In the chaos of the battle, and all of the fast cuts in this film, light becomes an important visual indicator of emotion. The theme of the film is a question that nobody knows: should they be fighting another person's war? This film is definitely a strong reminder that the next time our country engages in conflict, things may not go as planned. The film gives off a pacifist stance on the subject of war, but also reaffirms the heroism of the soldiers who are ordered to carry out our country's best interests. Overall this film is a big feat considering the constraints of time in proportion to the large amount of action that took place in the actual fight. It is also realistic in its depiction of the randomness of war: no one can choose who dies or not. Although character development is not as complete as a normal film should be, it is not what this film is supposed to be. Through a visual perspective, it is a successful film in its realistic depiction of the actual event. Through a narrative perspective it is successful in conveying its theme."

","Director Ridley Scott re-creates the true story of the war between American troops and the Somali Militia.  This realistic film captures the devastating Battle of Mogadishu.  Black Hawk Down kept me on the edge of my seat with action packed scenes with bloody, graphic details.  The movie stars an excellent cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Tom Sizemore. Josh Hartnett plays the chalk leader Sergeant Eversman, the idealist likes the Somalis.  Ewan McGregor, as Grimes, is the man who sits behind the desk and makes coffee.  Because another Ranger is hurt, Grimes is sent in his place on the mission as the scared, inexperienced, new guy.  Tom Sizemore plays the tough and fearless Lt. Col. McKnight, the leader of the convoy. On October 3, 1993, one hundred twenty Rangers and Delta Units were sent on a mission to kidnap two Somali Warlords.  The two men are lieutenants of Mohamed Aidid, who is the leader of the Somali Militia and the cause of the starvation of over 300,000 civilians.  This capture is supposed to be a quick extraction, taking only thirty minutes, but ends up turning into a deadly fifteen hours.  The Rangers and Deltas enter the Bakara Market where they are met by hundreds of armed militia.  Two Black Hawk Choppers are shot down in the city, almost all of the men with the convoy are injured, and the groups of soldiers are spread all over the city.  The convoy has to keep returning to base and there are seriously injured men going back to battle to make sure `No one gets left behind'.  Now their real mission is like First Class `Hoot' Gibson says, `...it's about the men next to you, and that's it.  That's all it is.'  All the men who fought in the war returned as heroes.  Eversman says, `No one asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way.' This is a must see film.  It could be considered one of the greatest war movies ever created.  Its realistic scenes kept me entertained all the way through its two-hundred and eleven minutes.  Most people would enjoy the film, especially if you are in to war movies."

","Black Hawk Down is so technically well-made and vivid in its depiction of the incredibly technologized way America fights wars, that it's frustrating how little it comes to in the end.  Mark Bowden's book hasn't been Hollywoodized in the<br/><br/>conventional sense-- there aren't love stories a la Pearl Harbor or moments of wacky military comedy, as you might expect.  But it has been Hollywoodized in another way, which is, stripped of all geopolitical context on the assumption that an American audience would not be interested in anything other than the fates of some handsome young actors playing Americans (though many aren't,<br/><br/>actually).  <br/><br/>We're given little sense of the African side of things-- what the appeal of<br/><br/>warlords like Aidid was, how the country has broken down and why you'd ally<br/><br/>yourself with one strong man or another.  This led some critics to see the way hundreds of anonymous Africans are mowed down without a thought in the<br/><br/>movie as essentially racist.  Yet it wouldn't have to be; they could be essentially an alien menace to the main characters and yet be granted a logic and even a<br/><br/>dignity of their own, as the Zulu hordes in Zulu are.  But to do that you'd have to understand them a little, and this movie seems profoundly incurious about Africa itself.  There also might be sharp points to be made about the clash of a highly technologized army with an almost pre-technology one (except for its stock of Western weaponry), but again, the lack of interest in the African side makes it impossible to draw such a picture.  The movie doesn't have to turn into<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now, this was an entirely different war for different reasons, but it doesn't even seem aware that there's anything interesting about the contrast.<br/><br/>In the end, what makes Black Hawk Down a frustratingly insubstantial<br/><br/>experience is that the real-life civil war in Somalia just becomes a prop for a story of movie guys in peril-- like an Alien movie, or that thing where Emilio Estevez and his yuppie buddies get lost in inner city Detroit."
"Matador07","8","0","0","12 November 2002"," Really Good
","Really good war movie, with both its greatest strength and greatest weakness being that there was no attempt to really make a larger statement. Thankfully it avoided an agenda, either excessive flag-waving or political finger pointing, and just stuck to the action, which was exceptional.  The movie managed to simultaneously express the chaos of the running street battles that evening in Somalia while keeping the audience always up to speed on what was going on.  The movie also benefitted immensely from being able to show about 2 1/2 hours of a 12 hour long battle.  You are dragged into the battle along with the soldiers instead of just being shown a highlight package, and the brutality of war is conveyed by war itself rather than a bunch of preachy statements or Hollywood plot cliches.  All of which makes it a very good war movie.  But its lack of ambition to be anything more than a war movie probably does keep it from going beyond its genre and a notch below a classic such as Saving Private Ryan.  An 8/10 and one of the best movies of the year."

"dust-7","Null","0","0","6 November 2002"," Not quite the whole story
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>The Battle of Mogadishu, 3 OCT 1993. The failures of General's Garrison and Montgomery are sort of glossed over as the actors that play them sort of go glassy-eyed a lot of the time. There's just the 'full responsibility' line at the end credits, and only for Garrison. The whole chain of events is confused. And it suggests just more the LA riots if more of the looters had been armed with military rifles or civilian equivalents, chasing away a few LAPD stragglers. No justice, no peace, kind of thing, as one of the clansmen actually says to the captured pilot, Durant.<br/><br/>The blame also has been placed, in reality, on Les Aspen and Bill Clinton for refusing to equip forces with Abrams tanks and Bradley APCs. They didn't want to send the wrong 'political message' to Somali civilians, and refused to take the blame for poorly equipped forces, after the fact. But of those 500-1000 or so killed by American/UN forces in the 'extraction' effort, most surely were civilians, who would have been at less risk if the UN forces had gone in better armed with a better plan of attack. It would have been less bloody and safer for all concerned.<br/><br/>As it is, you have Montgomery knowing that armored units were required for house to house street fighting and getting the troops in there, at least 10th Mountain or whatever support. You had Garrison go in with intelligence about on a par of that preceding the Battle of Little Big Horn. All the tanks and tracks in the stadium were not brought up to the ready, when requests for just that and more had been almost demanded by the very generals ordering the 'extraction', days and weeks before. The attention span of those generals must have been less than that of the proverbial knat not to at least incorporate what armor they had available. And that insanity is utterly missing from the movie.<br/><br/>At any rate, the movie is a record of almost point by point how not to conduct a military operation in a house to house urban scenario, where the enemy is even just a mob. In fact, what organized 'gang activity' did face the UN forces may well have been not just armed, but directed on the ground, by members of Al-Queda cells. And the movie, furthermore, does present a somewhat clean version of the battle, I would guess. There aren't enough helicopters. The high shots of mobs in the streets were probably a little thin compared to the reality. Imagine more people, fewer guns, faster running, more confusion, etc. Just lots more people in the streets. The smoke and dust were probably worse. It was hot. They should have all been soaking in sweat. And so on. That is, the real situation was probably much worse that it is made to appear on screen, if one could imagine. 500-1000 Somalis were killed. 1000 bodies is a lot of bodies.<br/><br/>There's also something missing that you see in other war films. And that's the gutty change of plan, the improv, the something entirely new to turn it around on the enemy. In fact, in reality, that was missing in the actual battle. They didn't give and take. They didn't have the quick retreat and regroup plan. And as the plan started to splinter, and units started to get isolated, and the intel failed, the one and only plan forced an increasingly confused execution. They didn't adjust. And I kept wondering not so much why the black hawks hovered so much, cause they did in the real battle (and it was stupid, and not just for lack of a smokescreen, or counter-measures, cover fire, etc), but why without the tanks and apcs the units still tried to run around the outskirts of town? That didn't make sense. And I don't know if it actually went that way. Why not get the cobras or a black hawk to use the cannon and rockets to clear a path through the furniture/car wreck blockades, and just drive to the crash sites? even if all they had were humvees.<br/><br/>So, I think it's unfair to say one can't care about the characters. But they seem painted almost too mechanically, as men with guts, and bravery, but little imagination or personality; almost as if they were too green, or too young, to exhibit such. Things go wrong. And they just keep going wrong with them, instead of using their heads or being resourceful. The doc does well in that. But you almost don't see enough of him, and there are plenty of wounded.<br/><br/>So if I'd fault the movie, overall, it wouldn't be for lack of characterization, but because I spent a couple of paragraphs explaining what the movie left out it would be lack of backstory or narrative. That's what hurts. People can't really see how they get from there to here, or what is really happening. It's all a loud muddle of small arms fire and grenades, and blood spurting. It may be the grunt's point of view that Scott was after. But maybe the movie suffers for that narrow tunnel vision. It might have been better to present the movie as a flashback from a board of inquiry, or committee investigation, to point to areas of contention, poor planning, horrible lack of coordination, exclusiveness and professional 'jealousy', and all the rest. Maybe even just a voice over. I don't know. Then one would cut to the action to see how things went so predictably wrong in hindsight. Not an uplifting film, in either case. But it might have been easier to understand."

","Others have criticised the film for its lack of character development. To me, this adds to its realism. We barely know these guys before we see them fighting for their (and others') lives. And they're nearly indistinguishable in the way they behave - which is sort of the point: they're elite soldiers, trained to the point where they're interchangeably excellent at their jobs. The disasters, the successes, the bad judgments, the good luck, all reflect the (very real) randomness of war. Not the 'classic three-act' structure of conventional film.<br/><br/>Personally I found this a lot more credible than the storyline of ""Saving Private Ryan"" which felt like a rather clicheed plot laid onto very realistic war scenes.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down left me stunned by the futility and waste of war, and the incredible conditions soldiers deal with and things they do.

Especially in dolby surround or DTS.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws, well A LOT of flaws, like, as noted before, the political statement ...what political statement? Like ""behind enemy lines"" BHD tries to be ... political engaged by a few words at the beginning and at the end and a little bit about the somali clans that run mogadishu just before the fight.

If Scott had stayed with that plan nothing would have gone wrong, except that the movie would have been just another war movie (except the setting -somalia- and that it would have been a great war movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we meet lots of soldiers -and I mean a lot... the only 5 I could distinguish were Bana, McGregor, Sizemore and the guy from armageddon and pearl harbor ...fichtner. But even then : the all wore the same clothes, helmets and had the same hairstyles It really made the feel of confusion poor from the screen because the viewer had no idea who was shot to pieces. But I can't help to wonder if that was the idea. This way all the imposed tearjerk-moments (like the guy who can't get his wife on the phone just before they go into action -you know by now, of course he won;t make it back alive or the guy that loses his backplate bodyarmour whom you know is gonna get shot in the back lose their dubious purpose. I can't tell one soldier from another so I have to ASSUME that when one is shot in the back it is the guy without his back plate.<br/><br/>And even then this film could do without all sentimental moments, it is too much, it is like every trick in the book is opened so you, me the viewer will feel even more with these poor americans. WHY? they are CANNON FODDER? Maybe it is to get the girls into the cinema, I don't know.<br/><br/>Of course all Somali are portayed as 3rd world trash and even more sentimental tricks are used to make the americans seem even more heroic.<br/><br/>In a ""realistic"" depiction of war we could do without all of that embellischment. There is nothing heroic about war, it's hell incarnated.<br/><br/>
AND now the circle is complete, for hell incarnated is perfectly depicted by scott.<br/><br/>OF Course another thing to think about are the 19 americans thet died, they are NAMED, and though I think that they should be remembered,<br/><br/>putting the somali casualties in as ""several 1000"" ... I don't know I don't have the right words for it. It shows the lack of respect for the somali. I guess That's why they are depicted as savages with AK47 instead of spears...<br/><br/>""oh shame where is thy blush""<br/><br/>It makes the film not as neutral as it should (or could, take your pick) have been.<br/><br/>But look on the bright side ... if you take away all the needless sentimental embellishment and remove the useless political themes it still is one hell of an action rollercoster, brilliantly directed, edited, scored (as in music) and shot (as in cinematographic)"

She fell asleep after about an hour or so, while i forced myself to watch the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>What is the main problem with this movie? The camera work is great (which isn't really a surprise... I guess Ridley knows what he wants...) The acting is okay, the fx are good. The problem in my opinion is that there is little to no plot through the movie. We get maybe 15-25 minutes of plot and story explanation, and the rest of the movie a lot of soldiers are running around shooting black guys and being shot at. As we are not told ANYTHING about the soldiers, I really did not care who got shot. We have McGregor and one of the helicopter pilots... the rest of the soldiers looked the same to me. And when they were running around the city, I had NO idea where they were or how long apart they were. <br/><br/>I understand that a lot of people will get angry when reading this, but I mean no disrespect to the 19(?) American soldiers who died in Somalia... and maybe we should remember that thousands of non-Americans died during the war?<br/><br/>This movie is highly overrated... If you want a good movie on war, see Full Metal Jacket or maybe Enemy At The Gates.... Don't waste your time with this ""all-action-no-plot""-war movie"

","Maybe this film is supposed to make a point.  It's supposed to be one of the most realistic, and best war movies ever.  But I thought it was boring. Maybe this is Hollywood's way of saying ""See? Real stuff is crap.  That's why we spice everything up"" or something.  The problems with Black Hawk Down were things like character development.  There wasn't any.  We didn't know anything about the characters and we were supposed to feel sorry for them? I didn't even know their names! And on the back of the box, it says that the mission turned into ""a living nightmare"".  That sounded like it might have some cinematic promise.  It lied.  Sure, people died, and the mission was supposed to be easy, but it definitely wasn't the worst thing to ever happen.  It would have also been nice to get to know the enemy.  He had, what, like six lines? Ten minutes of on-screen time? I can't work up hatred for a bad guy unless they actually show why he's so bad.  For example, The Patriot (2000 - I think) with Mel Gibson.  The British dragoon (don't remember his name, I haven't seen it in a long time) was a really evil guy. He killed Mel's kids, ordered the burning down of a church, etc, and showed no remorse whatsoever.  Basically, I'm saying, Black Hawk Down nowhere near lived up the hype I heard.  I give it a three stars out of ten."

","A cinematic dramatization of the intense 18-hour gun battle in central Mogadishu between Army Rangers and Somali irregulars, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a 120-minute roller coaster ride with bullets and grenades. Accurately following the terrible events in October 1992, director Ridley Scott seems to chronicle every gunshot and rocket as a band of Army Rangers tries to extricate themselves from deep inside enemy territory after a failed attempt to capture high-ranking associates of a local warlord.  The gun battle and rescue attempt encompass the final three-fourths of the movie. Its stunning realism is on par with the Omaha Beach opener to ""Saving Private Ryan"". But unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" that's all there is to ""Black Hawk Down"". The first quarter of the movie is not used judiciously to introduce the characters and we don't know them very well when the action starts. And after the bullets start to fly, that's it till the end of the movie. Don't get me wrong, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a very good war movie, but if the first quarter had been better written, it could have been a great movie."

","When it comes to DVD's there's nothing more annoying than renting a 2 disc movie(which is becoming a standard with the block busters) and then realize the movie sucks which means there's no point in watching the 2nd disc because it's usually about the making of the movie. Well this movie wasn't bad on its own, but it was quite a bad war movie. All the remarkable and beautiful photography(the scene where the hawks are hovering above the sea is forever burnt into my mind)the brilliantly done special effects and Zimmer's score couldn't fully compensate for the poor story and lack of character development. If you watch the extra disc you actually hear the screenwriter and some other people say that they excluded a majority of the actual characters from the original events in order to give the viewer a chance to understand and feel with the important ones. They failed miserably, I couldn't care less for the people portrayed in the movie. War movies usually have some meaning, a moral ending, an abstract ending, something to show how terrible and useless it is. This movie was more like a documentary, but who cares if 19 American soldiers died in some war where so more innocent people were killed before the free world actually did something about it. They didn't have to go to Somalia, they certainly weren't forced. And how does Ridley Scott honor the fallen men. Well, the note at the end speaks for itself. A disgrace, that can only be surpassed by that dear dear movie entitled pearl harbor. It seems that when Jerry Bruckheimer doesn't produce excellent action movies he makes terrible war movie with excellent directors instead. What a waste, because the production value, the acting, the visual and sound effects and photography, even the score(which sounds suspiciously like Zimmer's ""The thin red line"":) ), all is sadly spoiled by the story.7/10"

In this movie you observe what war is actually like, almost feel like you are at the battle. Bullets flying past your head, dodging rpg's.

","Brilliantly directed combat-movie that stirs up a lot of controversy despite(or because of)it¬¥s unwillingness to commit itself to any kind of wider political or moral commentary.<br/><br/> First off...like in most of his films, this is essentially a movie about Ridley Scott¬¥s filmmaking craft. The cinematography, the acting, the use of sound are all melded into a brilliant composition of complex flowing imagery. It really brings a tear to the eye of any true fan of his.<br/><br/>The story really isn¬¥t about how glorious theAmericans are, or how evil the Somalis are. The movie is reasonably even-handed in that respect, regardless of how you might feel about the fact that we follow the viewpoint of the American troops. The tone of the movie is mostly just: ""everyone does what they do"".<br/><br/>The Somalis are p****d at the Americans for invading their turf and meddling with their affairs. And the soldiers just want to get out of it in one piece. The movie honours the soldiers for going through this ordeal and watching each others backs. Fair enough.<br/><br/> Like in many of his other films(Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, 1492, Gladiator and even Hannibal), the theme is of people striving under, and finding a form of redemption through severe physical or psychological distress.<br/><br/> We don¬¥t get to know the characters deeply. Only glimpses of who they might be. Most of the drama is relayed through the reactions and choices made under fire. There are no real stereotypes here, and neither any heroic foreground-characters who might take over the story. After all, the real star is Scott¬¥s direction."

","This is an American movie. As such, it feels the need to portray the American soldiers as heroes and tries to make us feel sorry for them and hate the Somalis. The Somalian soldiers drop like flies and I'm surprised the credits didn't read ""Dead Terrible Somali terrorist that we hate # 57, Dead Terrible Somali terrorist that we hate # 58"" etc. American ethnocentricism is splattered throughout the film. Aside from that though, it has a ""Private Ryan"" grittiness to it which will appeal to some. The film is technically well done so Ridley Scott deserves the credit but the script is way too Americanized. Patriotic? Only if you're a redneck who hates everything. Boo for you Hollywood. If you want a good war movie see one that isn't necesarily from an American perspective like the classic Das Boot. This kind of material about a true event requires an objective take on it. Don't get me wrong. There are good American war movies. Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket (especially), but this isn't one of them.

"Committee-X","9","0","0","5 October 2002"," Good war movie.
","This movie is simply about the skirmishes between US soldiers and Somali militias on October 3, 1993.  On that day US Rangers and Delta Force were sent deep into the hostile city of Modgadishu to capture General Aidid's top aids.  What was suppose to be a half an hour mission but things went wrong and the ordeal lasted nearly one day.  The movie portrayed the battle very realistic and accurate.  Good pictures, and sound effects really put you in the heat battle.  It was almost as good as the begining and end battles from Saving Private Ryan. The only thing that wasn't real is that Modgadishu have smaller builings, more trees, and less sandy.  But that isn't important. The character development here are decent.  Sometimes they can be a little dry.  I didn't have a sense of conncection with them or felt sad when they die like I did in Saving Private Ryan.  I guessed that's what happen when Ridley Scott tried to focus on too many people at the same time. The only character that I understand and felt for was Hoot played by Eric Bana.  He was really good in this movie.  It was very emotional at the ending scene when he said: ""When I go home people ask me, 'Why do you do it man? What are you some kind of war junkie?' and I won't say a damn thing because they wouldn't understand...they wouldn't understand it's about the men next to them.""<br/><br/>Overall this is a very good war movie, to me it came in third after Saving Private Ryan and Glory.  What I like about it was not a cliche, flag-waving, glorifying war heros flick such as Pearl Harbor and We Were Soldiers. Black Hawk Down simply tell a true story about a group of guys who were in a deep sh*t situation that not in hell anyone else would want to be in.  The movie made it clear that the soldiers weren't fighting because they were heros or because they were patriotic.  But because they were fighting for survival and each other's lives.

There was rockets flying around and chunks of warm body parts spewing up, it made my stomach REALLY hurt. Just like everyone says it's a 90 minute version of the OMAHA BEACH scene from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br/><br/>It has REALLY good sound in it, so if you haven't seen this yet, go to someone's house who has huge speakers and a really big TV. There's just so much to this movie that you can't be satisfied with a dinky TV and little bitty speakers. You'll miss the spooky details if you do watch it the watered down way, and you won't fully appreciate it. It really does matter. It's really thrilling if you watch it like that. I just don't give a 10 to any movie. This one is really that good. I was a little dissapointed with the DVD cuz it didn't have that scary feeling I had that i was in a desperate situation, dodging bullets, rpgs, and my own team (friendly fire). What makes this movie so good is that it's a true story that people really don't know much about(like teenagers). It happened in 1993, so I was only 5. My mom didnt let me watch dead soldiers getting dragged through the streets(related to black hawk down), I wouldn't remember anyway. So when I walked into that theater, I didn't know what to expect, I didn't read the book anyway. There was a blue-ish scene in the beggining that had to do with the hummanitarian missions the UN went through that used really disturbing and upsetting imagery. It grabbed my attention lots. After that it went to October 2nd (the day before the big incident oct 3), to give an idea what Somalis were like. It was disturbing too. Never mind. I wont go any further but to say if you haven't read the book...please see this movie. You won't know what will happen. If you have read the book, see this movie anyway and don't gripe about mess ups since this a story of a battle that went on for 19 HOURS. You'll get to greet thousands of angry, heavily armed somalis with nothing to loose but their arms, legs, and heads. Check this movie out.

Excellent photography, but that's Scott for you, as hubby said 'every shot is art directed', on the other hand the sound wasn't great but we put on it the fact that they probably tried to make it more realistic that way, to show how hard it was for soldiers to hear what others were saying with all the noise going on during the battle. I guess this movie is for viewers who are passionate about combat techniques or are soldiers themselves as for the others it's just a bit too heavy, I felt far more comfortable with Saving Private Ryan.

During those 18 hours, these men stood fast against the most overwhelming military odds since Picket's Charge. At least 100 to 1 and some experts place it closer to 1000 to 1 at certain points during the battle; these US soldiers did exactly what we pay them to do. They fought and some died. Harsh, but that's the reality of the Infantryman's life. We don't pay them to ""project power"", we don't enlist them to, ""provide a centerpoint of US Foreign Policy."" We don't have them in our Service for any other reason than to kill people and blow those people's things up. Simple concept. Scott managed to do about as well as could be done with this struggle. We have a group of barely differentiated characters thrown into a situation that is as far from normal human experience as it can get. The killed Somalis, they blew up Somali's things. Some of them died in the midst of the most intense individual combat since WW-II. Even during the height of the Tet Offensive in the Vietnamese city of Hue our forces never met as large a number of enemy troops or an enemy soldiery that was as careless with their own lives as Task Force Ranger met in Mogadishu. Blackhawk Down is not a story of the politics of our presence in Somalia. It's not a documentary showing the failings of the UN's attempt to bring civilization to  war torn Africa. It has nothing to do with why we were there, should we have been there, what went wrong to put us there, should we have been hunting Aidid or anything else. It's a story of the grunts on the ground watching their friends die, getting p***ed of by that and killing the people who killed their friends. Don't try to put a lot of moralistic or ethical background into it. Sit down and watch the movie. Don't ask why these guys are killing and dying. Don't ask who they are and what they're thinking. Don't ask why they joined the Army, volunteered to become Airborne and then volunteered to become Rangers. These facts aren't particularly relevant to the story. Suffice it to say that they did volunteer, volunteer and volunteer. They looked themselves in the face and said, ""Yep, I want to be as good as I can be and when it comes time to kill people and destroy their stuff, I want to do it as a Ranger."" If you absolutely have to know what they're thinking, listen to the line spoken by Ewan McGregor as Specialist Grimes; ""Wow, this sucks.""

Because frankly, the premise is too thin. You can experience some emotion when the movie is building up to the military offensive but then when it actually comes, it is so long that you only the die-hard-military-movie-fan will not be eventually bored by the constant sound of bullets, gunshots, explosions and the occasional gruesome violence. In other hands, this would turn out an atrociously awful turkey. But Ridley Scott has surrounded himself with the experts, and thus it is explained all the oscar-hype around the movie. His talent manages to save the script and make this slightly above the standard war action fest. But don't be cheated about a movie that is way too long to sustain such a simple story. They should have been more modest. Anyway, the production values are top-notch, specially the cinematography. A well-decorated mess."

","This movie is an uncomfortable, agonizing film for all the gore and feelings of utter helplessness evoked.  The shock value of Saving Private Ryan's opening 25 minutes has now been expanded into a feature length film. Whether this is entertainment or not may be argued.  What is not at issue is that the death, desperation, thirst, and mayhem lasted considerably longer than the 2 hour investment the viewer is asked to make.  While it may elevate the Rangers (NOT Texas Rangers) and the Delta Force to hero status, their sacrifices were certainly worthy of it.  Reviewers who take the film to task as glorifying the American military are embarrassingly ignorant of the history of US/UN involvement in that country.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have taken the producers and writers to task for not providing a balanced and more charitable view of the Somalis.  Indeed, this is true.  Like most non-fiction books, the book is better than the translated film version.  I saw the movie before reading Mark Bowden's excellent book which I recommend to anyone seeking an intellectual recounting of the events in Mogadishu.  But it is after all a movie and only that.  A documentary has been done already - the PBS show ""Frontline"" recounted US involvement in Somalia and is also recommended to anyone seeking a dispassionate analysis.<br/><br/>In any final analysis, Aided is dead and Somalia still has no viable government.

The film vividly depicts the despairity of the mission and the bleakness of Mogadishu.<br/><br/>Although there's not much character development, the movie uses the entire squad as one character, displaying them as brave, resourceful, and human, questioning what the whole point of military intervention of Somalia. Also, the Somalians are shown as just being as equal to the Americans in the good vs. evil cause, they have their own reasons for running their nation as they do and why they must fight the outside nations trying to overrun them.<br/><br/>With good performances by an interesting cast and excellent direction by Ridley Scott (a huge upgrade over Bruckheimer's stock directors) the film shines as another example of why war is hell. I'm sure Stanley Kubrick would have approved of this film."

The US Army failed miserably - they had no influence on the long term plight of the Somali people.<br/><br/>
What the movie does is try to give value to the lives that were wasted. It proposes that there was some meaning to the death and destruction - the soldiers died for each other. It presents its case in a format so graphically expletive that it will etch a space in your mind for a long time to come. No pleasantries here.

Ridley Scott sets a pace and tone that is unmatched in the history of war movies.  It's like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but for 120 minutes.  Violent yes, intense, definitely. It compels you to watch.  Your senses are overloaded with sights and sounds, like you are in the middle of the battle yourself.<br/><br/>On first viewing, I had a minor quibble about the lack of distinction among the soldiers - the uniform and buzz cuts serve to make the actors hard to tell apart.  After watching it again, I realized this isn't really a problem because we aren't suppose to identify with individuals in the beginning, we are supposed to only see ""the army""  Not until later, when the team is split apart do we see them as people with personalities and lives beyond shooting the enemy.  Even then, keeping the well known actors fair unrecognizable helps to keep your focus on the events at hand instead of ""Hey that's the guy from Pearl Harbor"" or ""There's the young Obi-Wan.""<br/><br/>A comment on the film just isn't complete without mention of the sound, which won a well deserved Oscar.  Perhaps more than the visuals, the use of surround sound puts you in the middle of the action even more.  This is a movie to watch loud to get the effect the filmmakers were after."

The battles are beautifully shot and the special effects are jaw dropping. Josh Hartnett finally breaks free of his teen movie burden with a great performance alongside the likes of Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner. But be forwarned this thought prevoking, epic battle movie is by no means for the squeemish due to some extreme content, like a close up of a severed thumb, a man with his legs blown off and a very graphic scene in which soilders must do some medical work on a serious leg wound."

Ridley Scott did an outstanding job shooting this film and the cast did an excellent job showing the world the kind of camraderie that develops in ordinary men under desperate circumstances.  I cried when it showed the deaths of American Soldiers, particularly Cpl. Smith who died in the arms of his comrades and saving their lives.  This film shows the true meaning of war.  It's not some John Wayne flick where the main characters don't die and war is glorious.  This movie shows that people die in battle, nobody wins, and war is not glamorous.  Although Black Hawk Down is portrayed as a Military Victory, it also shows that no one in this film is jumping up and down and celebrating that they survived, but they are tired, exhausted, hurt emotionally and physically, injured and in some cases killed.  This movie shows what ordinary men do under extraordinary circumstances and shows what war really is.  Hell.  For that, I give Black Hawk Down a Ten. Outstanding!"

","I know it's never a great idea to compare a book with a movie, but this movie was throughly disappointing. Much of the visuals were stunning, and some of the street fighting looked and felt much as it must have to those guys that day. But too much of this movie felt slapped together too quickly, without much thought put into it. Granted, there were incredible events happening in about a half-dozen places, but, instead of trying to cram little bits of all of it into this movie, maybe they would have been better served by focusing on a few of the truly heroic events. The 2 Delta Force commandos (Shughart and Gordon), who insisted on being dropped into the 2nd crash site was, in reality, a breathtakingly courageous sequence that deserved more than it got in this film. It's touched on, but nothing more. These guys won Medals of Honor for their actions. What these guys did was the epitome of what we believe elite soldiers represent. They deserved to be portrayed in this movie much more prominently.<br/><br/>In reading the book, there were a few other acts of incredible bravery and drama that should have been played out more. However, nearly everything that happened that day is very briefly touched on, as if the point was to shoehorn all of it in somehow. The effect is confusing. You end up not knowing who is who, and who is where, and what the hell is going on...<br/><br/>This event, and these soldiers deserved something better. In reality, it's just about a miracle, and a testament to their bravery and training, that the entire contingent of Rangers, Seals, Air Force Parajumpers and Combat Controllers weren't totally slaughtered that day.<br/><br/>This movie should have been a little longer, and should have been planned and thought-out more.

The action sequences are a marvel and really take you through what happened in Somalia.

","OK, I have just watched this on DVD and it blew me away. I had to stop for a break after 45 minutes - it was that intense<br/><br/>I wouldn't dwell too much of the action and the gore, most people have commented on it. I would like to point out some of the interesting details in the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS! As a military buff, I was most interested in the portrayal of the secretive delta forces. The film did a good job to highlight that there was some tension between delta and the army rangers. You can see that Delta force operatives were 'cooler' and did not really respect authority. They left their hair long, and modified their weapons. They were also lean and small in stature which is more realistic than beefy Rambo stereotypes you see in most hollywood movies. The snipers who went down to save the pilot where really heroes, they could have held off the whole city if they had not run out of bullets- this actually happened in real life.<br/><br/>Rangers - the film showed that they were generally a younger lot. They carried the GPMG machine guns and fired at shoulder level - only Special forces use the weopon like this - try carrying one yourself, you would not last 1 minute. (the scene in Rambo where he fires it from the hip doesn't happen in real life).<br/><br/>This is the first time on film where I have seen the SOAR unit operate - I am surprised that they actually showed the delta force soldiers deployed outside the minibirds on modified seats . This was top secret operational capability at the time.<br/><br/>Excellent war movie although some may find that the ending may be too abrupt."

","Once again, Ridley Scott proves to me that he is an idiot savant, a total genius with a camera, nearly incapable of creating anything approaching human drama... except ocasionally, and only by accident.<br/><br/>While BHD is tense, non-stop action, it wanders aimlessly in search of characters and narrative drive. From Josh Hartnett's idealistic young soldier taking over his first command to Tom Sizemore's reprisal of every William Bendix and Stuart Whitmore ""WWII tough but funny and humane Sgt"" role, its got all of the surface cliches without any of the depth. So many others are just nameless, faceless soldiers with crewcuts, barely distinguishable except in death.<br/><br/>Storywise, you've got the kidnapping of the tough arms dealer. Which apparently has nothing to do with anything. Then you've got the ""copters silently flying over the water"" scene, right out of APOCALYPSE NOW, leading the characters on some vague assault mission on some place to get some people. Once it turns into the inevitable, all hell breaks loose. ""War is Hell""...<br/><br/>Even where your point is to show the chaos and hellish nature of real combat, you've still have to draw narrative lines to lead your audience through the story. Even the individual battle scenes should have clear objectives and a sense of what is being accomplished by each strategic manuever, and clarity about its success or failure... not for the characters, necessarily, but for the audience. Here, not only is the battle chaotic, but so is the storytelling. There are no clear objectives, no sense of who is where, or why, or where they're going to go from there. Its just endless conflicts, body parts flying, HumVees driving endlessly around getting shot at, and then night falls... a short respite to watch a fallen comrade die as they try to pull his artery out of his leg. Then, more shooting. Soldiers come back to save their brothers in arms. lots of bullets. stuff blows up. But, there is no DRAMA here, no storyline pulling you through. No characters of sufficient depth or originality to give it even a hint of honesty. Just a lot of stuff blowing up.<br/><br/>
When Sam Peckinpah made Westerns, a lot of guys got shot in very interesting and bloody ways. But, you'd spent 2 hours with them first, finding out who and what they were, for good or ill, and you CARED when they got shot. Even on a pure action level, it doesn't measure up to the first 20 minutes of PRIVATE RYAN. It doesn't measure up to the ""valkyrie"" scene in APOCALYPSE NOW, or the nightmarish, LSD vision of that film. As viceral kinetic action, its no ROAD WARRIOR.<br/><br/>BHD is basically a Bruckheimer film, where handsome young men perform heroic deeds at great speed and high volume.I didnt hate it, but it left me totally uninvolved, unmoved, and not particularly entertained. I was however, like the goofy-looking soldier in the film, left deafened by the din."

(maybe after seeing it a couple of more times, it will be my personal best...). Except 'Das Boot', none of the known  war movies deals better with the subject 'war'. The only movie which is able to stand in Black Hawk Down's shadow is Saving Private Ryan (only because of the beach part, after that, spr is to my opinion a little bit over the top).    <br/><br/>What makes Black Hawk Down such a great movie? Well, I think it is the intensity of this movie. In war, people die. Because of the fact that death and war are going hand in hand, it is not possible to make a good solid war movie without showing the horror caused by war. Due to the amount of realistic violence and gore, it will make you think about the terror war brings to people all over the world. Because of the fact that Black Hawk Down is based upon a real story, it makes you even more think. <br/><br/>
Some people complain about the lack of character development. well, I think that war does not need character development! War does not need deeply developed characters, only fighting skills count. Other people complain about the patriotism in this movie. This movie does a great job in showing the way in which the Americans tried to reach two downed Black Hawk hellicopters. And, offcourse, the Americans are portraied as the heros, but, in this case, they actually are the heros!

Black Hawk Down is about a true event that took place in Somalia. It takes place in Mogadishu where a warlord is starving his citizens. With 300,000 dead and counting, the US decides to go in and remove the Somalian warlord. The first injured is an 18 year old kid named Blackburn, who falls out of the helicopter. Thats where things start going wrong. The somalians manage to shoot down 2 Black Hawk helicopters and kill about 18 Americans. [ end spoiler alert ]<br/><br/>The good thing about Black Hawk Down, is that they don't put a love story in it. Many movies such as Titanic and Pearl Harbor really would've turned out to be great movies if they didn't center the movie around a love story.

It does not carve a new niche for war movies, but it adds well to the exisiting niche of high-violence war movies like ""Siege on Firebase Gloria"".<br/><br/>Focused largely on the gritty violence and frontline fear of combat soldiers, Black Hawk Down delivers 130 minutes of panicked gunfire and grotesque pain.

About comparing BHD and SPR, you're right: that's not possible because BHD is so much better than SPR. And more gory (SPR didn't have an artery operation, a severed finger and a half a torso lieing on the battlefield). SPR had TOO many patriotic stuff, and BHD only has US (I refuse to use the word 'American') flags, small ones, on the soldiers BDU's, that's a good thing.<br/><br/>BDH has, also, what most war movies should (but don't) have:<br/><br/><ul><li>Be based on a real war operation (Normandy or Guadalcanal are OK) - Have A LOT of characters: and you shouldn't know either their ranks or names. They all carry the same weapons and dress alike. I say it 'cos I can tell you all the names of the squad on Ryan's. - Focus only on the battle: when somebody's shootting at you with an   AK 47 or RPG I don't think they start telling each other why they love their wives or what happened when his father left home many years ago. And check it out, the only woman who appears on screen isn't on it for more than 5 seconds.</li></ul><br/><br/>Giving a deeper analysis on the Rangers or Deltas as normal peoplewould have just ruined the movie. It makes it better when you concentrate on the battle. The political side of the operation is thankfully only the kind of 'what a hell are we doing here' or 'you cannot change the world this way'. It gives some credit to the Somalis as people, though I've seen what they did with the 61 crew and it was pretty horrible. The acting was fair specially Sizemore, and the few funny stuff ok. The action scenes are really good although there seems to be nothing that looks like a shrapnel, mostly coming from the RPG's. But (yeah, I have a complaint) there is one thing that doesn'tmake sense: i've heard that the cassualties from the somali side where from 1000 to 10000. So where the hell are those 500 Somalis that didn't get killed?<br/><br/>OK, I've said enough. Basically I say Go BHD, Down with SPR, the most overestimated film ever.

","This is probably one of my faves when it comes to the ""we're Americans & we're going to kick ass""-type movies: because we don't. I was denied entry into the army (4-F) shortly before the whole Somalia incident began in 1993. After seeing this movie back in January of this year, I was glad that I couldn't/didn't go. I got this sinking feeling the more the soldiers's plans dwindled until finally escalating into chaos. Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced something more edgy, gritty and a little less polished than his previous films which made me find this believable. Ridley Scott (whose films I've admired except for ""Hannibal"") once again has proven himself a versatile director: a man who never makes the same movie twice. The film doesn't have to preach a political message, but instead the warlord in the beginning states to Sam Shepard, ""this is our war- not yours."" To me, that was enough. ""Black Hawk Down"" is more occupied with showcasing the true ugliness of war and doesn't try to prove itself over ""Platoon"" or other anti-war movies. I was also impressed to see that Josh Hartnett wasn't  an animatronic puppet and could actually carry his own instead of simply being the same dude with a wardrobe change. Ewan McGregor does a decent job without trying to upstage anyone else. My father (who is a retired army officer & a Vietnam vet) pointed out that he worked for generals who were as incompetent as Sam Shepard's character in his career. Being that I am the same age as a lot of the soldiers were at the time this movie took place, I was able to identify with the characters, and didn't feel as if they were cliches of guys from Hollywood Vietnam or WW II movies. I think a lot of the critics (who have never even seen danger in their lives) compare this film to Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" or anything from Oliver Stone, because they feel that that is the true formula to a war film. That is like trying to mold every sci-fi film into a ""Star Wars."" <br/><br/>I know that a lot of people didn't like this film for various reasons; (too violent, not enough character development,not enough sex, possibly racist, etc...)but in the same year of films such as ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""American Pie 2,"" ""A.I.,"" ""Rat Race,"" and many more forgettable flicks, this one sure stood out as one of the best films of 2001."

I bit because of Ridley Scott and I'm getting into wanting to see movies where war is portrayed as ""real"" instead of ""glorious"".  This movie didn't do much of anything for me.  Sure, it has the highest G.S.P.M. (gun shots per minute) of any movie I think I've ever seen, but this does not a movie make.  This whole movie rested its case on the fact that it was based on a true story and was simply describing events.  This wasn't real movie making, this was dramatized documenting.  Did anyone really care about anyone in particular in the movie?  How could you?  None of the characters were developed well enough to become interesting or to bring any empathy to them by the viewer. After watching about 6 billion rounds of ammo fired, hundreds killed, gratuitous and gory imagery (I'm sure this was to make it ""edgy""), this one leaves me flat.  I've seen a lot of reviews sort on knocking ""Saving Private Ryan"" and saying this was much better.  Hogwash.  Both ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" elicited true feelings from me as opposed to feeling like I was simply viewing a violent exposition for the sake of the violence itself.

The emphasis is not on drama--where in those movies it has to be the driving force--but rather on the grittiness and action.  I've spoken with many people from the Army that were there in Mogadishu and they said that the film captured the feel of the real events even if Scott had to B.S. somewhat.

","Like many things in life, one cannot very well complain about things that cannot be helped, things that you cannot change, and things that simply ""are."" So, I am not going to come in here and vent about the woes of American foreign policy; nevertheless, while Black Hawk Down might have been a well filmed movie, the false sense of patriotism  that it portrays (in a place much like vietnam: a place we had no business sticking our noses in), it was hard to watch the movie, and see our boys being killed for something that does not even belong to us. I love America, but I cannot condone any action that leads to the senseless slaughter of our youth, while as a nation we are unprovoked by outside forces. Since the year 1898, when our forces were sent into Cuba to fight a conflict that was not ours, there have been only two wars that America had a right to become involved in. In WWI and WWII we were essentially provoked in to the conflicts and thus had some sort of meaning to be there. George Washington, in his farewell address, all but begged and pleaded for us to stay out of foreign affairs and wars, but we have never listened. Ok, that is the way things go, and I will not cry over split milk. Nevertheless, if there is any measure of patriotism to be found, it is in the wars where AMERICA'S freedoms were maintained, and not the freedoms of those countries that have made poor choices along the way. America has made enough poor choices of our own: things that we must swallow and move on. Therefore, movies like Black Hawk Down, are simply plasticine portraits of what patriotism is suppose to be. If you want a ""feel good"" American movie, watch ""Ben and Me""(1953): the movie about that little rat that hung out in Ben Franklin's pocket. Sure, ""Ben & Me"" is a cartoon, but so is Black Hawk Down."

","Considering that I just saw the movie once in the theatre a week before it was taken out of the theatres, I would have to say that I really like this movie considering that I do not like to watch any movie that involves a war where MANY innocent people are killed.  It was recommended highly by some excellent film critics that I know personally.  Since I bought the DVD, I am impressed on how a good number of the actors in the movie are not even American and had to pass as an American especially as a southerner with the accents they had to get pat down.  Even though the guy who plays Todd Blackburn (AKA Orlando Bloom who is very handsome)had a hard time trying to get it to where he was speaking like an American and his British accent isn't even all that heavy.  Hugh Dancy definitely had the Amercan way of talking down pat (He's also another Brit.) Eric Bana (AKA ""Hoot"") did a good job getting the American accent down since on the extra footage on the DVD he has a heavy Australian accent. And YES, it's great to see Josh Hartnet be in a leading role in a movie!!!! Sam Shepherd definitely could pass as a military official. The poem reading at the end credits made me want to cry because I thought of how sweet it is. And another thing is, Orlando Bloom who's Todd Blackburn, I would just have to say that he is actually older than a good number of the other young men that are also in the movie even though his character is suppose to be the youngest Ranger.  Orlando did look like he was really twelve as Grimes (AKA Ewen M.) said when he was signing him in. Orlando is older than Josh by a year and a half, Hugh Dancy, Tom Guiry, Brenden, etc., just to name a few off the top of me head. This deserves a 9 out of 10."

","Blackhawk Down is accused of having a lack of characterization, confusing story lines, pro-American/anti-Somali bias. No care given to the thousands of Somali dead. It's an American movie about American forces. Less than 200 Americans going to war with an entire Somali clan. Yep, it's got an American bias. Want to know why? Because the soldiers of Taskforce Ranger were American.<br/><br/>It's got an anti-Somali bias as well. Want to know why? Here's a clue kids, none of the Somali's had to be there. They could have done what so many of their countrymen did and hid on the floor of their homes until the Americans were gone. No Somali mothers had to hide a pistol behind their infant child in order to play on American sympathies and get a closer shot at the US forces.<br/><br/>Yes, there were innocents who were killed and injured. That's the nature of warfare. It's not good, it's not right, it simply is.<br/><br/>For you who've never dived to the ground and prayed to everything you hold holy that the buttons on your shirt aren't just a bit too thick and because of it you're going to take a bullet in the head, get over yourselves. The opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan showed one kind of war, the war that gets front page coverage on the newspapers of the world, the kind of war that makes heros everyone knows by name.<br/><br/>Blackhawk Down shows the kind of war that we fight now. It's dirty, it's ugly, it's bloody. It involves crapping your pants in terror and sprinting through machinegun fire for someone you thoroughly despise simply because he's a fellow soldier. It's about young men being sent to places that some couldn't even locate on a map to fight other young men for reasons that aren't even clear to the government that sent them. It shows the kind of wars the world is going to see for a very long time.<br/><br/>Desert Storm was aberrant. It was unusual. It was atypical. It was a ""good"" war; fought for ""Righteousness"" and ""Truth"". It was a war against a defined evil perpetrated on national television and available from any satellite transponder on the planet. Sorry, that's not the norm any more.<br/><br/>Blackhawk Down is about the realities of modern war. It's about simple errors costing the lives of 18 young men who wanted little more than to get back home to drink a beer. It's about thousands upon thousands of people running to the scene of an ongoing battle and then wondering why they were shot.<br/><br/>For the few Somalis who were honestly innocent and were honestly caught by US fire before they could get away, for them I grieve. For the vast majority of the Somalis who charged into the Bakara Market neighborhood knowing full well that Habr Gidr was having its showdown with Taskforce Ranger, for them I have nothing but scorn. To the simpleton who claims that the ""world grieves for the thousand Somali dead"", I say, ""get over yourself."" They came, they shot, they were cut down in the streets.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott did a masterful job of showing an event that has shaped global military policy. More important than that, he  showed the faces of the anonymous kids who fought and died and couldn't have cared less about that policy.<br/><br/>War is chaos, Blackhawk Down is chaos.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't pretend to describe the political or social background of the events portrayed. The book itself doesn't give much coverage to it either. It's a description of the incredible valor and heroism of a very small group of men fighting to stay alive in the chaos resulting from thousands upon thousands of complete strangers deciding to kill them. Any time the KIA ratio is 18 to 1000, it's a story worthy of both print and film."

","Black Hawk Down is by far the best war movie ever made. The film moves along so well that even though it is two hours of gunfights it completely keeps your attention. And the movie is SO realistic! I felt tired and drained coming out of the theater when I saw it because you actually get the feeling you're in the middle of the battle. It's also realistic in the sense that not every shot an American soldier took killed a Somali, ya know? Also, everything that happens in the movie is true. Even the line Cliff Wolcott (Jeremy Piven) says as his Black Hawk is going down (""Hey Bull you gonna pull the PCLs off line or what?"") was what the real Cliff Wolcott said as the Black Hawk was going down. The real John Waddell was a bookworm and was always reading in the hanger, and in the movie we see Waddell (Ian Virgo) reading before they go out on the Mogadishu mission. The movie's just real accurate like that. And like every sentence or line that we know was said during the real battle (I know this from reading the true, fact book of Black Hawk Down) was in the movie. To me that's what makes the movie even better, the realism and the accuracy. You don't really get TOO attached to the characters, but that in no way ruins the movie. Also, the ending of the movie was done very well (Josh Hartnett talking to a fallen comrade).<br/><br/>So all in all, I consider this to be the BEST war movie ever made and this is definately my favorite movie. This movie doesn't make you happy, but it makes you proud. It's an excellent movie. 11/10"
"Hoshi Sato","Null","0","0","13 June 2002"," Great war movie of all time
","Black Hawk Down is hands down the most visually spectacular movie depicting war to come out to date.  Saving Private Ryan was an appettizer.  Black Hawk Down is the main course.  Ridley Scott proves he is one of Hollywood's most talented directors as he is able to make sense of an event so extensive and so difficult to canvass that an average director would just have fumbled. The story itself is simplictic.  Army Rangers and Delta force are sent in to arrest the warlord Aidid's lieutenants.  Slowly, the mission begins to unravel and American lives are lost, totally 19.  This movie is not a propaganda machine.  Although it sets up the backstory to why they are there with the intro, there is no in depth contemplation of American involvement in Somalia.  The soldiers are there because they are soldiers, thats all you need to know.  The entire story is focused on these 100 or so American men and their sole role as soldiers.  There is no character development, no single individual that stands out or to root for.  This is war and no one man makes a war.  So as you can see so far, this is not a conventional John Wayne movie.  If you want a true account of Oct 3, 1993, watch Dateline or the history channel.  Black Hawk Down is a condensed and fictional account of what happened and how these soldiers dealt with the cards given to them. We get a story about comraderie and heroism mixed with tragedy and sorrow. We feel bad that these soldiers are in there fighting for there lives but we also get a sense that this is their job and someone has to do it.  So if you want a conventional movie to root for a hero, this ain't it my friend. This is a film about war and the soldiers who fight them.  Is Ridley Scott glorifying these men or is he making an anti-war movie?  Pundits could argue both ways but this is something only the genius of Ridley Scott truly knows. Don't rent Black Hawk Down, save your cash and buy it on DVD.  You will thank me for this."

","If you can forgive it for not having the easy to follow rent-a-plot of other war movies, such as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Dirty Dozen', or 'The Great Escape', then you can quickly see just how exciting and different a movie 'Black Hawk Down' is.<br/><br/>Some chastise it for being too impersonal about its characters, and as a result we don't exactly know what to feel when they quickly become engulfed in a firefight in the blood-soaked streets of Somalia. What you should try to see is that this is the point: these were ""the lost men"", who most of us would not understand if they explained what they did and why, and most of us would not care anyway. While the movie does occasionally slip away and have its moments where the soldiers wax philosophical in the heat of battle, this moments are still poignant and part of the much larger picture.<br/><br/>The battle scenes (or scene, I should say, as the bulk of the film's 2 hrs. and 20 mins is spent in the constant exchange of bullets) are without question the most intense and well-designed in any war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The percieved ""lack"" of character depth and identity, I say again, is partly intentional because when faced with this kind of situation, like the character Hoot Gibson says, it isn't about politics or love or hate or having control over who lives and who dies. It's about the guy next to you, and getting out alive. THAT'S what mattered to these guys, and that's what the movie portrays.<br/><br/>The film is ripped to the bone, suspenseful yet tragic, with a gritty and uncompromising twist on the genre. It is a rare achievement for filmmaking of any type: we know who we're rooting for, yet it's tough to tell who's the good guy and who's not; the film is clear about it's objectivity yet has an eerie moral ambiguity. It is not a character study, it's a tone poem, about the nature of a war and the men who fight in it, and not about the politics or the deep subthemes or any of that crap which most people decide is most important because it holds the key to getting re-elected.<br/><br/>Mark Bowden, who wrote the book on which the film is based, gave a perfect opening quote to his manuscript, one which adequately sums up the message of all of it:<br/><br/>""It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting the ultimate practitioner."""

","Director Ridley Scott hits another home run with ""Black Hawk Down"". It is the story of a group of American Delta Force and Rangers sent into a hostile area of a Somalian city in October, 1993, to extract two senior officers of the dominant Somalian war lord. What seemed to be a cut and dried mission at first, goes horribly wrong when two of the Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The mission then becomes one of survival from the hordes of angry and armed Somalis that attack them. ""Let no man be left behind"" is the basis on which the Americans operate.<br/><br/> I had the opportunity to see an A&E documentary called ""Black Hawk Down: The True Story"" before watching this film. The documentary used actual footage from the real attack and interviewed many of the surviving participants of the ill-fated raid. The film was amazingly true to the actual events and was true to the heroic actions of the vastly out numbered American force.<br/><br/> The special effects in the film are so realistic that you would swear that you were seeing the actual conflict. Scott also added to the realism by using an ensemble cast with no one actor being the star. It gave the feel of actual units of buddies looking out for each other at their own peril.<br/><br/> Josh Hartnett, Eric Buna, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner and Tom Sizemore are among the soldiers under siege and Sam Shepard is the embattled American Commanding General. All performances give the feel of real soldiers in a real battle.<br/><br/> ""Black Hawk Down"" will surely go down as one of the most frighteningly realistic war movies ever made. A must see."

","This movie did exactly what it set out to do. The intention of this movie was to show the horrors of war, that's it. It wasn't a political commentary on the events surrounding October 3, 1993. It wasn't made to delve into the debate on whether America should have or shouldn't have been in Somalia in the first place.<br/><br/>There was very little character development in this movie. The main reason was that it didn't need it. The movie was a series of snapshots of people in terrible situations. If you need a complete background story to empathize with the soldiers in the movie, you are probably a very shallow person. The acting was excellent and while you may not have known a lot about the characters, you still fell for them as human beings. For those who feel they need more character development, read the book. I read it a few times before hand so I already knew a lot about the characters which may have helped me follow the story a little better.<br/><br/>The movie is very biased in its story, but what war movie isn't. Many reviews have faulted this movie and then said that movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan accurately showed both sides. Very rarely in any of these movies were the Vietnamese or German soldiers even seen up close. They were usually just a figure in the distance that was gunned down. The only german in Saving Private Ryan that gets some real screen time(Spoiler for those who haven't seen SPR) kills Adam Goldberg's character and then taunts Upham about it until Upham kills him. There was no Nazi point of view shown anywhere in the movie.<br/><br/>The only flaw I saw with the movie was the amount of events that it cut out. most of the battle took place at night and the movie skips over that very quickly(probably because it looks better to show battle scenes during the day). Black Hawk Down did accurately and effectively portray the movie from an American point of view. Excellent movie 10/10."

","Almost a documentary in certain aspects, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  As a depiction of war, it ranks with ""The Longest Day"" and is second only to ""Saving Private Ryan.""  It is timely, being relevant to the War on Terrorism. Even though bin Laden is not mentioned in the movie, we all know that some of the Somalis who downed the two choppers may have had some training in bin Laden's camps in the Sudan.<br/><br/>Here's one reflection: In war movies, things in industry have changed somewhat since WWII.  Sixty years ago, the movie industry was part of the propaganda machine, emphasizing the glory of war and inspiring young men to fight for their country.  Outright disasters, such as the graphic portrayal of the real-life disaster in Mogadishu, might have been avoided, unless there was some injunction to ""get back into the ring and fight for it."" Blackhawk Down is a depiction of an American military catastrophe, when the troops were pulled out shortly afterwards.

If you cannot stand the sight of blood then I would suggest that you don't see it or at least close your eyes when you see a part come.  I was surprised at how graphic Somalia really was during that time.  I especially didn't enjoy the leg part.  It showed it well but I nearly threw up my popcorn.<br/><br/>Overall this is probably the most realistic, graphic war movie I've seen yet but I still enjoy this movie and will immediately buy this on DVD.

","Black Hawk Down was one of the first to jump back into the know worn-out War Genre. Over the past year their has been a flurry of war movies and more to come. It's like John Wayne is back! Black Hawk Down did a good job conveying the sense of urgency and sadness of war, but what it did not do was tell us much about the enemy. All the watcher gets is that the Somalian's are evil and that they want to kill the good old G.I's. However, Black Hawk Down did a tremendous job putting that real-time crisis onto the silver screen. They filmed it as war is seen and got across the honor of war, not just the horror's. Overall this film was a nice break from the trend and a good patriotic boost after September 11th."

","i am appalled at the fact that this movie has made it into IMDB the top 250 films list. From Pilger, In 1993, in the last days of George Bush Senior's presidency, 18 American soldiers were killed in Somalia after the US Marines had invaded to ""restore hope"", as they put it. Black Hawk Down, glamorises and lies about this episode.  It leaves out the fact that the invading Americans left behind between 7,000 and 10,000 Somalis killed. Many of them innocent civilians.  I dont think its the right time for Hollywood to glorify the violence of the Marine Invasion of Somalia. I read alot of negative comments on the inaccuracy of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, both based on WW2, which is the last TRUE ""good vs. bad"" war to be faught.

","Ridley Scott has done what so few have.  He has made a realistic, true reenactment of war.  There is no beating around the bush with this movie.  I would breathe the cliched line from the pundit's guide to great movie reviews, and call it ""a roller coaster ride"", but underneath the thrills, there is nothing innocent and joyful about ""Black Hawk Down"".  In my mind, all other war movies of this caliber will forever be compared to Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"", the first successful attempt to get the audience down in the trenches with the director and the cast.  Scott's vision, which is based on Mark Bowden's novel, tries, for lack of better phrasing, to make as much sense of the confusion as possible.  The audience is fairly aware of what's going on at any given moment, but that is to his credit.  It's part of the effect, as well it should be.  Why should we, the audience, be more oriented with the geographic details then the soldiers have under heavy fire, pain, and stress.  Quick editing and cinematography drained of bright colors, gives this movie an ominous feeling of constant awareness.  Whenever the action has ceased, we still feel threatened, and the territory is as unfamiliar as ever.  This attack on the senses is what makes ""Black Hawk Down"" so powerful."

"theshape79","Null","0","0","22 January 2002"," Provides a great reason to read the book.
","Author Mark Bowden in a recent interview said his initial reason upon writing the first draft the script for Black Hawk Down was to at least make it good enough to sell another million copies of his book, which in my opinion is one of the greatest non-fiction books on war ever written. After seeing the movie I wouldn't be suprised if he did. Black Hawk Down is a gripping intense war movie that surpasses films like The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan. It takes its time showing the battle of Mogadishu from both sides of the conflict. One of its strengths is in showing the preparations of the Adid militia in readying for the oncoming battle to the foibles of the American soldiers who thought the operation to capture two of Adids top men would be a simple operation only lasting half an hour. Every action is plotted in minute detail making the battle seem more like a chess match. Its scenes like a soldier bleeding to death from a wound in his leg to the heroic actions of two delta team snipers that end up costing them they're lives that make the film so much more than a typical war movie. These were real people and these events really happened. Unlike films like Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates, which had largely ficional stories surrounded by true stories you can't help but be amazed at this film. If theres anything I can criticize, I think the film feels somewhat incomplete. A major concern voiced by critics is the lack of showing the motives of the Somalians which is why some have called it a racist movie. As the book took some time to give you a feel of why the Somalians would attack men sent to help them, little or no information is given in this respect. While that hurts the story, I will defend the film in the fact that not all Somalians are shown as vicious blood thirsty savages. You the viewer should make your own decisions on this subject. Another problem is that the film feels somewhat incomplete because of the addition of two scenes. It feels like it wants to show you the aftermath of the battle but instead ends it without providing any resolution to the scenes other than a post script at the end of the movie. Other than these few minor details everything else is spot on from the performances ( Australian Eric Bana is a standout as is Josh Hartnet who overcomes any stumbles he took with Pearl Harbor ) to the production itself. As I was leaving the movie, I heard a teenager ask his father what the moral of the story was. It seems he found the movie bloody and pointless. If I was the father I would have made the son read the book before asking that question. That way at least he would have had some understanding of what is one of the best films this year."

Black Hawk Down does an excellent job depicting what can happen when something goes wrong and is a wake up call (especially to the younger generation that have only lived through operations like the Gulf War) that war is not without casualties and that our soldiers are not invincible.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down also does an excellent job of not being biased. There is no judgment of whether US forces should have been there in the first place. There is no flag waving. Just the events of October 3, 1993.

One of the points that were mentioned, however, was that not enough information was given to the individual characters, making them hard to distinguish.  It was even compared to Band of Brothers and Thin Red Line.  To this I must say that in a movie such as this and also Thin Red Line, the story was based on a group of American soldiers.  Not as individuals, but as a group.  Otherwise the story could have been titled ""Lt. Colonel McKnight and His Men.""  But no, its not.  Also, there was another bad review that ended with a dramatic quote and then the audiences reaction...laughter.  This can be comparable to ""Lord of the Rings,"" as there were a few dramatic scenes where the audience laughed.  This only comes to show the immaturity of many Americans.  The only bad comment that can be given to the movie is that there were some repetetively overdramatic scenes and I'm sure that Ridley was not to blame. Mr. Bruckhemier probably would let Ridley sleep until his rawnchy scenes were added. But otherwise, the movie is one of the best war movies I've seen.

Any feelings of emptiness, shallowness or dissatisfaction with the movie are probably feelings generated from the actual historical incident. The movie itself is a testament to the bravery of our military's service members. Do memorials entertain you or do they provoke thoughts about the events and personalities involved? Where were you on 3 October 1993? I live in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the home of Ft Bragg and many of the soldiers sent to Somalia for Operation Just Cause. When I went to the theater to see this movie, an old lady sat next to me, by herself with no other friends or family accompanying her. I couldn't help but wonder if she was watching the movie to understand the experience of someone she knew that had gone and perhaps had not returned. Unfortunately, I did not ask, but her presence at a violent Hollywood movie demographically targeting young males speaks volumes about the underlying interest and respect America has for its soldiers who answer the call to defend our freedoms on foreign shores.

","World War II, Vietnam, The Gulf War. The great conflicts of the second half of the 20th Century, and for many years the constant focus of Hollywood War movies good and bad. The 1993 American incursion into war-torn Somalia however, does not fit into this list - more American soldiers were killed by friendly fire during the Gulf War than during the incident which is the focus of Black Hawk Down. This was basically a massacre, in which a botched US mission led to the deaths of over 1000 Somalis. That Ridley Scott can turn this into a story of the bravery and courage of the American armed forces is incredible. <br/><br/>Watching this outside the US and therefore immune to the post-9/11 patriotic onslaught lends a far more objective analysis to this film. Despite the obvious American bias in the movie's point of view, I was never convinced of the Americans' cause, either in the mission focused on or the Somalia conflict itself. No doubt the book explains it better, but the film does not even try, and we are given only the briefest of mission overviews at the beginning, leaving you wondering just what they were trying to achieve.<br/><br/>My initial criticism aside, as a war movie this often excels, and its breakneck pace leaves you no time to stop and think. The feel of it is classic Ridley Scott - an urban wasteland, with decay and ruin apleanty. Almost immediately it becomes futile to try and keep track of all the characters, so you simply sit back and immerse yourself in the action. Though it lacks the plot of the classic War movies, Black Hawk Down does offer action on an unprecedented scale, and hardly slows down over the entire two hours. <br/><br/>The fact that we so quickly lose track of the characters effectively makes the 45 minute introduction sequence entirely pointless, and you can't help but feel that a quick 15 minute introduction would have served better.<br/><br/>
Don't get me wrong, Black Hawk Down is not a bad film, but is is by no means the classic that many make it out to be. You cannot help but feel that if Ridley Scott had picked a more suitable subject for a heroic war film then this could have been very good, however when the post-9/11 effect finally lifts, and this is compared to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now, it will not stand up to them for a second."

This movie is as a case study of modern warfare.  <br/><br/>Unlike ""Pearl Harbor"", this movie is made in the tradition of ""Tora! Tora! Tora"" and ""The Longest Day"" in its straightforward and objective portrayal of the events.  It is based on the meticulously researched book by Mark Bowden. There are no Rambo-like cartoon heroics.  This makes the bare-bones bravery and dedication the movie portrays much more credible√Ç‚Ä¶ as well as incredible."

","I give this movie a 7 somewhat begrudgingly. The reason is because I didn't particularly enjoy it. In fact, after the first hour I was much more interested in the amount of time remaining than I was in the movie. It was constant action, but it was also sort of boring. The reason is because the action was so constant and so consistently the same thing, that it was tiring long before it was over. Minus 1 point.<br/><br/>I also deducted a point for the fact that not one single character was even remotely developed. You could EASILY have watched this movie without knowing a single name or a single personal characteristic about any character and you would have lost nothing. The reason is because there was virtually nothing to lose. Far too impersonal. It seems to me we should have been much more aware of at least what was at stake for several of the characters. Instead it was one constant blitz of bullets - the result of which, we really didn't care who got hit since we knew some would get killed and some wouldn't. Minus 1 point.<br/><br/>Lastly, I am sick and tired of movies that have the same ludicrously unrealistic scene. Well, in this case, scene after scene after scene. Close your eyes. Imagine 50 soldiers in the street. Now imagine another 50 of the enemy (all with automatic weapons) in the windows and roofs surrounding the soldiers. Now imagine all of them shooting at each other with little cover. Thousands of rounds per minute. OBVIOUSLY, the 50 in the street would be dead within 30 seconds. Well, there you have it. There are numerous 5 minute scenes just exactly as I described where instead of 50 soldiers in the street getting killed, perhaps 3 got hit and they were successfully carried off. Completely ridiculous. Minus 1 point.<br/><br/>If you just want to watch blood and guts, you got it - perhaps the best blood and guts movie ever made. But, I can think of at least a dozen war movies that were far superior!"

","I must admit, I went into Black Hawk Down with more than a bit of trepidation. After all here on the incredibly useful IMDB Josh Hartnett is listed first. That means one of the key roles. That means the same guy who helped ruin Pearl Harbor is carrying a movie again.<br/><br/>Don't be turned away. I wasn't and I'm glad.<br/><br/>Hartnett does his finest work yet and outdoes many actors twice his age. As a sarge in Somalia of an elite Ranger group he comes of age in a horrible situation. Hartnett does a fine role, Ewan ""Obi-Wan"" McGregor does a fine job. In fact I must say pretty much every actor in this film did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>But that doesn't leave us without complaints (groans from the audience). Pipe down, it won't take long or be vicious.<br/><br/>First the tag line. ""Leave no man behind."" It's stressed a tad too much and it shines like a fire in the dark at the end. One man IS left behind and the movie only says he was released later. That's not leaving no man behind, that's twiddling your thumbs until they say so. <br/><br/>Tom Sizemore's character. Yeah he's cool. Yeah he's a badass. BUT...he's typecast and not only typecast, he's an almost direct copy of Robert Duvall's excellent Kilgore character from Apocalypse now. He would have been more useful out of the film or toned down a little. You leave thinking he's an actor or insane. Cause only someone in a fake situation or crazy can do what he does in certain scenes. Fake.<br/><br/>Now for plus sides. Sam Shepard. My goodness. This actor, this famous famous actor, takes on the worst military role in history. This is a good thing folks. Only a great actor can make you feel bad or supportive of a horrible leader. This man lets helicopters go unguarded, lets his men stay in hostile territory without equipment, etc. He does just about every FUBAR scenario he is offered and I found myself wanting to punch him. And that's a great feeling with actors. <br/><br/>Back to Hartnett. I can't help it. He is so young and he makes you truly believe he feels responsible for every man under his command. He even does the craziest stunt I've ever seen in a realistic movie to help his men out. I've tried to avoid giving away plot but you'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>To wrap this review up don't trash McGregor and uh..that guy who plays Legolas in Lord of the Rings. I've momentarily forgotten his name. They have roles that couldn't possibly be long even though they are good actors. Keep in mind Black Hawk Down was filmed at the same time as Star Wars Ep 2 and Lord of the Rings (some of the post production stuff) so these guys couldn't hold a huge role. They knew Ridley Scott wouldn't disappoint and anything they could get they took. Good move fellas. Good move."

","""Black Hawk Down"" takes great pains to portray war as chaos, not some idealized situation in which heroic all-American people from a hand-picked assortment of ethnic and religious archetypes are first beaten up, then mysteriously rally and vanquish the insidious enemy.<br/><br/>Instead, it shows the visceral trauma inflicted upon what in hindsight appears to have been an incredibly poorly thought-out mission, and acknowledges that in war, plans can and do go horribly wrong.  That's quite a valid message, and it should provoke thought with respect to future peace-keeping operations, rules of engagement, and expectations with regards to urban operations.<br/><br/>The lesson to take from the movie is the same one learned by the US administration of the time:  sanitary, controlled small strike forces are not panaceas.  Rangers and Delta Force soldiers may be tough and trained, but they're human, and overconfidence in technological superiority may blind planners from the dangers posed by a numerous, determined foe.  Fighting in built-up areas is not clean, and nobody should have expected it to be a cakewalk -- nor should the plan have been so fragile, so contingent on everything going as planned.<br/><br/>It's a fairly decent movie, then.  I am more than a little suspicious of the way the American soldiers are portrayed -- e.g. walking (standing, not crouched...) in the center of the streets at times, a seemingly magical grenade toss into a fairly high (and as far as I recall, no Somali ever tosses a grenade in the movie...), small window across a street, and so forth... if they really moved so incautiously,<br/><br/>I would have expected a much higher body count, since in reality they weren't protected by a screenwriter.  And the ""comic relief"" segments strike me as forced, and they detract from the horror of it all."

"cold_pudi","8","0","0","4 May 2002"," A well-directed war film that tries real hard to overpass the usual..
","Black Hawk Down Leaves No Man Behind<br/><br/>On October 1993, African leader Mohamed Farah Aidid was taking over Somalia by controlling the food that was sent by the United Nations to the starving citizens of such a poor country. That is when numerous U.S. Delta Commandos and Army Rangers were sent to join the U.N. in Somalia on a peacekeeping mission. Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) directed this first-time representation of the `forgotten' Somalian conflict, Black Hawk Down; he gave it a lot of violence because, as he says, `Violence is the only way to show the real truth and intensity of war.' British director Scott didn't make a patriotic portrait of this movie at all; he made it more like an act of solidarity viewed from each of the soldiers' point of view.<br/><br/>The mission for a group of U.S. soldiers is to enter an Aidid controlled part of Mogadishu, Somalia, and capture some of the most important warlord's men. Their plan was to enter via helicopter, withdraw the men, and go back to base. The operation was supposed to last thirty minutes. Trouble starts to grow when one of the seven helicopters in mission, Black Hawk, gets shot down by armed civilians who are angry about America's intrusion into their national affairs. That is when every soldier is not anymore concerned about his mission, but about the group's dictum, `No Man Gets Left Behind.' At that point, their half-hour mission becomes a non-ending battle of struggle for life and rescue of comrades.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckeimer produced this nearly-over-the-top movie; as the first time working together, they certainly did a good job creating this non-stop battle with a very anguishing atmosphere. Director Scott creates more of his amazing lighting games and terrific shots. In this movie especially, he liked giving only the U.S. soldiers' point of view; their run towards the enemy or their view of the battlefield. There are very few scenes that represent the rebelling civilians' situation. Scott created the numerous action scenes in a way he never adopted before; he followed the subject of the scene with close shots until this reaches his destination. It was what Kubrick did in his Vietnam film, Full Metal Jacket, when the soldiers approach to the enemy-controlled town.<br/><br/>The acting surely wasn't the strong part of this film; Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, The Virgin Suicides) plays the Rangers' leader, he uses his usual strong, dark voice to command his men. Tom Sizemore (Red Planet, Heat) plays the tough lieutenant colonel who, on battlefield, gives adrenaline to the beginning soldiers. Other members of this `team of heroes' are Ewan Mc Gregor (Moulin Rouge, Trainspotting) and Jason Isaacs (The Patriot).<br/><br/>This conflict that should have lasted thirty minutes, ended up lasting eighteen hours; eighteen hours of uninterrupted battle between people who wanted to help, and people who didn't want any help. Nineteen U.S. soldiers and over one thousand Somalis lost their lives in the Mogadishu battle. Also in this movie, Mr. Scott was able to incise a picture in the spectator's mind; he is not ashamed to show the truth, and that is what makes him one of the best.

","I looked forward to `Black Hawk Down' with expectations that were almost impossible to meet.<br/><br/>I never read the book, and I didn't know the specifics, but I remember the incident that took place in Somalia in 1993.  What I remember most about it (and will never forget) were the photographs released from the aftermath of the operation; in particular a very sickening picture of a Somali, smiling wide, looking gleefully into the camera while a dead, shirtless American GI lay dead in the background, after being dragged through the streets.  Then I heard that a movie was being made about this incident.<br/><br/>The reviews and buzz that came out before the film's release seemed to claim that it was a modern movie classic, comparable to the ground breaking films about war and diplomatic failure of the past.  `It's at times very difficult to watch' is what I read in many different articles about `Black Hawk Down.' After seeing the trailer, which depicted a mob of blood-hungry Somali militia walking toward the camera (apparently approaching downed soldiers off-screen), I was very enthralled and nervous about seeing it.  A recreation of what I had seen in those photographs would be difficult to watch indeed. <br/><br/>But the events depicted on screen were of course, as is almost always the case when recreating real, tragic events, not as moving as they were in those photographs.  I understand that this is an extremely difficult task. What the reviewers were referring to in respect to the `difficulty' in watching it consisted of more graphic battle gore that is becoming commonplace, resembling scenes from `Band of Brothers' and other graphic war recreations.  `Black Hawk Down' is an exciting and involving story of soldiers under fire after a mission goes wrong, and it keeps us interested in the fate of those involved.  But it really doesn't offer anything particularly new to the genre, nor does it have any profound statements about war or diplomacy that haven't already been explored.<br/><br/>BHD is essentially a true story, but its production values keep it from feeling entirely real.  There is too much surface gloss.  It is shot mostly in the fluorescent-bluish shade that dominates all of Bruckheimer-produced films, and there is also an abundant use of slow motion.  I will be the first to defend war films that are criticized for not having enough `character development,' since stories about soldiers under fire don't necessarily need extremely different personalities to define their characters-combat will define their actions.  But BHD's characters usually only offer plot developing lines throughout the film.  Again, this is a true story, but it doesn't seem much different than fictional military thrillers, especially concerning the limited character classes-there are only three: the soldiers in combat, the enemy, and the men behind the blue blip screens trying to get things in order.  Ewan McGregor's reluctant soldier presented what felt like the most realistic personality in the film, but most of the other characters felt like they came out of a Tom Clancy novel.  The veterans of this mission deserve more.  I am one who feels that Ridley Scott's best days are behind him.  I didn't care much for `Gladiator' or `Hannibal,' both of which had too much surface gloss and not enough personal involvement with the characters.  `Alien' is still (and probably always will be) his best work, others may say `Blade Runner' is.  <br/><br/>Where Scott does succeed in this film is in his coherence of the battle, which was quite a difficult task.  The battle scenes, although somewhat standard for a combat film these days, are intense.  They are also quite exhilarating-I found myself cheering aloud at times.  It was satisfying to see our superior troops fighting hard against enemies that have a similar value system to the ones we are fighting today.  SPOILER WARNING:  Most of the soldiers survive, and our superior training and equipment inflicts tremendous casualties on our foes.  The end result is that, with all due respect to the veterans who died in this horrible conflict, I actually felt better about what happened in this incident than I did when all I knew of it was those horrifying pictures.  I don't know if that was the film makers' intention.  Grade: B."

","By todays standards for what makes a good war movie, then I guess Black Hawk down is one.  It seems like war movies have been reduced to battle scenes, explosions and gunshots.  War movies have lost their personality.  No more is the social context surrounding wars examined, like they were in older war movies such as Apocalypse now, All quiet on the western front, and the deer hunter.<br/><br/>   The ""saving private ryan"" age of war movies are judged by what movie can create the most realistic battle scenes so that the audience can fully experience a battle field in war. Black Hawk down does just that, with some of the most intense, and realistic scenes I have ever witnessed on film. However is that what people go to see war movies for?  I know thats not why I go to see war movies.  If I wanted battlefield experience, then I would go fight in a war. The movie seemed to lack a personality, like most modern day war movies do.  It did not examine the U.S involvment in the war, it just basically said ""Ok we are fighting in somalia, lets not examine why, lets just show the audience what its like to fight in somalia"".  The movie did a poor job of setting up a background as to why the conflict even occured.<br/><br/>   The success and critical acclaim of Saving private Ryan seems to have marked the end of an era in war film history.  The days of studying the social context of war have been replaced by which movie can produce the most excellent, realistic battle scene."

The scene where Pilla is shot in the turret was also very quiet for us, and drew gasps from the crowd.  That sort of thing could happen to any of us.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of people complained about character development.  A lot of Americans in fact.  This irritates me, because, even though the viewer never actually gets to know the characters in the depth that we did in SPR, these men are actual PEOPLE.

","I was fairly offended as an American Muslim to endure the spectacle that was Black Hawk Down in theaters this winter.  Certainly we all needed a movie that would restore our happiness and passion after the tragic events of September 11 but Amelie is the film that provides you with that on every level.  Black Hawk Down was a vision with the lovely scenes of Black Hawk helicopters in the wrong place at the wrong time and the sound editing is some of the best I have witnessed in the war films genre but everything else about this film proved that Ridley Scott and his crew lacked the insight and research to embark on this venture.<br/><br/>Were all Somalians who felt angry at the American military presence in their country in 1993 one-dimensional lunatics with guns and desires to kill Americans? Absolutely not but once again in the tradition of the ""Muslims are evil and that's just the breaks"" film genre (True Lies, The Siege, Not Without My Daughter, Executive Decision) we are given another film that fails to portray the religion and it's followers positively and does not allow us even for a minute to understand their perspective.  And why is that?  Could it be because in many ways they are American themselves with a love for SUV's, cell phones, football, and spaghetti with meatballs?  Ridley Scott could not possibly have the desire to show that side of the Somalians because America and certainly Black Hawk Down have to have enemies and not allied civilians whose lifestyles mirror our own.  And yet you cannot ask for much from a film that also refused to give personalities and character development to it's own American heroes of war.  I can accept the notion that Black Hawk Down is overly patriotic but for me it was not to honor these brave American soldiers who fought and died as most may assume Ridley Scott and his crew intended.  Instead the film is merely an exercise in depicting American imperialism and world domination in which America is happy to stick it's nose where it doesn't belong no matter what the consequences are for American soldiers and foreign civilians.  A tiring attempt to muddle an already estranged relationship between America and The Middle East hampers Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>
If you are interested in a more accurate and useful film on America's concerns in The Middle East pick up a copy of Three Kings at your local Blockbuster.  The film has covered the most ground yet in it's efforts to portray Muslims accurately and intelligently.  We are not there yet and Black Hawk Down is one step back when we desperately need to take two steps forward.  I often weep for the future.<br/><br/>7/10 for sound editing and visual effects alone"

","I just got home from seeing this film and I need to make one point before I put in my two cents:  I have read a few reviews on this site that claim some of the dialogue is cheesy or contrived, especially the scenes with Cpl Jamie Smith.  If any of these reviewers had actually read the book before seeing the film, they would know Jamie was a REAL person who ACTUALLY DIED on 10-4-93.  He was not a character conjured up by some writer.  I can't say for sure, but I think Cpl Smith requesting that Sgt Eversman tell his parents that he fought bravely was probably close to the truth.  Cpl Smith's father was a Ranger in Vietnam, and the book explains that Jamie had wanted nothing more than to join TFR his whole life.  I'm sure he would have wanted his father to know he died fighting.  As for the rest of the movie, it left me emotionally drained.  I thought just about every part was as close to the book as possible and Ridley Scott did a phenomenal job of portraying the horror and confusion of war.  Considering the number of Rangers and D-Boys that were a part of this battle, Scott had no choice but to give a blow by blow account of what happened.  If he had wanted to do a character study of these men, the movie would have lasted for days.  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the movie shows the 10th mountain division arriving at about 11:45 pm.  In reality the tanks and APC's did not arrive until morning.  I thought that took away from what the Rangers and D-Boys had to go through, being pinned down all night.  As a whole, the movie was technically and visually amazing.  It seems Mr. Bruckhiemer can produce a decent movie after all."

I never intended to, but for some reason i paid close attention to the music; this could be because I knew the outcome...who knows.<br/><br/>The music portrays the spirits and optimism of the American soldiers when they feel the situation is under control. House of Pain's ""Jump around playing as the soldiers are getting prepared for a fly-by with ease mission. Jmi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"" being covered, yet containing those edgy spine-tingling riffs that made the song famous as the blackhawk's and little bird's are flying out. The optimism of the music is almost an assurance that things are under control; then the score by Hans Zimmer turns confidence to fear. As the movie progresses and the viewer witnesses american soldiers die, the music gradually becomes more and more catastrophic in tone. Throughout the duration of this movie, the music threw me into an emotional downward spiral. I'll never forget the overbearing death dirge that closes out this movie as it fades to black.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it was not only the on-screen attachments to the characters that made this movie masochistic.

To steal from Gertrude Stein, there is no 'there' there.  It's nothing but two plus hours of stuff blowing up and bullets whizzing by.  There is nearly nothing going on at all from a storyline sense, just pure action scenes.  Granted, this was based upon an actual event; however, if you were going to pick a historical story one might like to choose one that has some substance to it.<br/><br/>All in all, you get what you might expect from it.  It's a Bruckheimer film, you don't need to say much more than that, although it's probably a little less entertaining than some of his stuff.  If your into movies that really don't require their audiences to think at all you might enjoy this.  If not, stay away from it, unless you just want to check out the high end production quality."

","This film tells the story of an American mission in Somalia in 1993. It starts with a too brief history of the situation, proceeds rapidly though introducing the characters (who for the most part you don't find yourself remembering or even caring that much about), and then dives into the action for the bulk of the running time.<br/><br/>At the moment (this was written right after I saw the film on 2/17/2002) I'm still shell-shocked. To my eyes, ""Black Hawk Down"" is as good an anti-war film as I've *ever* seen, yet I'm sure that for the right people it would be seen as a pro-military film. Similarly in this country we would likely root for the Americans in the film, while I have read that bootlegged copies of this film shown in Somalia drew cheers whenever an American was killed. Perhaps this is a sign of a balanced approach.<br/><br/>My opinion of ""Saving Private Ryan"" has grown over the years since I first saw it because the images have stuck with me, and I find myself wondering if this film will be similar. For the moment I will rate it assuming that is the case."

","Very few films are able to extract such a strong emotion from the audience such as tears of sadness, gasps of horror and sigh of disbelief. I'll name a few recent films that have succeeded. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and now Black Hawk Down. I cried during this film, I was horrified, I sat in absolute shock at what these soldiers must have gone through. Black Hawk Down is based on the true story in which 19 soldiers (Rangers and Delta Force) lost their lives on October 3, 1993 in what was supposed to be a quick and simple mission. A Mission that went wrong, very fast. The country of Somalia is suffering a terrible Civil War. The city is Mogadishu in which wanted Warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid's Lt.'s are meeting. The mission, extract these men and return to base. Casualties expected: None. The film does a great job of building suspense leading up to the mission and the minute the strike force enters hostile territory, its a heart-pounding, adrenaline pumping roller coaster ride to the end. This is a nail biter and not for the weak of heart. The hardest part to stomach about this film is the fact that its all True! This film should win an Oscar for Best Picture, it just makes too big of an impact to not win. Please observe a moment of silence for all those who lost their lives in this horrible tragedy.

","BLACK HAWK DOWN is a two hour long battle. The first fifteen minutes of this movie are talk and explaining what happened and we jump right into the battle. The cinematography was really something in this movie. I felt like I was in that damn war. The sound was so great, that the seats in the cinema were actually shaking (and that hasn't happened to me since JURASSIC PARK 3). But, this is one good movie. Depiction of graphic war violence in stunning detail, we get the privelege to watch bodies get blown apart. I haven't seen such graphic violence since....well, actually, I can't remember ever seeing such graphic violence. I do not recommend this movie to anyone with a weak stomach. You will be running out of the cinema and barfing your brains out every five minutes. But for those of you who like war or action movies- this one's for you. My only complaint is that everyone in this movie seemed to have guns. What's up with that? I wouldn't have been surprised if we had seen a little toddler concealing a revolver in his diaper or something. Once the battle starts, it doesn't stop (until the movie itself ends). Josh Hartnett (PEARL HARBOR)is the closest thing I can think of as a main character. There are just so many. The supporting cast includes Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, William Fictner and many others. So, if you like non-stop action from start to finish, BLACK HAWK DOWN is definetly your cup of tea (or should I say something that sounds more manly?) BLACK HAWK DOWN is definetly your can of beer (how 'bout that?) 5/5."

","Black Hawk Down is a wild ride, and satisfying as an action movie. The visual effects and pace are exhilarating and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>However, the film also tries to convey a story and have something to say. I think I missed it. War is confusing -- well, no surprise, I was confused as to what was happening where and who was doing what. There was no clear protagonist from whose viewpoint the movie occurs; several people share that role.<br/><br/>Any film based on a true story is going to lack flexibility in what happens when and by whom. In a typical action flick, when stuff blows up, I cheer -- nobody is hurt, they are all highly paid actors. But here, the story was horrifying and real also. So I didn't enjoy the violence. It just unnerved me. Maybe that is why I rated the film a 6 rather than an 8. I just can't find entertainment in war, and as a documentary -- no thanks, I don't want to experience the trauma of war so directly. I like documentaries to inform me, not scar me emotionally. I suggest ""The Siege"" or ""Thirteen Days"" if you want a great movie that educates you without immersing you so fully.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action / war movie buffs<br/><br/>-- anyone who's intrigued by the horror of war and wants more (and you stay away from my daughter)<br/><br/>-- Drama / arty types (because the film is really well put together) who aren't having a bad day and don't get nightmares easily<br/><br/>I gave this film a 6 out of 10."

","This movie illustrates why I was in the Army and why I got out. The men are the best and no finer group of individuals will you find in life. And... when someone makes a screwed up decision and your mission is doomed there is nothing worse you will experience in life... that is if you live.<br/><br/>The beginning is slow and there is a lot of story told via words so be aware that reading will be required. The acting is excellent and the way things are done reminded me of how Army life was. Very realistic! The fighting scenes seem a little light, yet don't get me wrong it's still intense and men are hit and wounded in a believable manner. The conduct of battle is accurate. <br/><br/>This appears to be a very precise story, I wish the leadership (in the actual event) had done a better job of backing up the Rangers and Delta Force than they did. It's gut wrenching what occurs to these men. I did not cry during the movie, but after it ended and I was in the car thinking about what had happened and how that mission evolved... I cried like I did the night of September 11th last year. This movie weighs heavy on my heart.<br/><br/>
Be prepared to see a lot of blood. If you are a young man wanting to be US Army Ranger, see this movie. If you can handle being in this situation, then good luck. If not, do something else and learn how to type. As I said earlier, the acting is excellent and yes characters are developed and each meet a different type of ending, some good and some dead. Some characters had bigger balls and heart than brains. Snipers should never try (or be allowed) to alone hold off massive group of hostiles... that's what machine guns are for. My heart goes out for those who lost their lives. This movie is worth seeing. If you wonder what bravery and heros are made of, see this movie. John Wayne could not have done a better job of paying homage to these great men."

","1st I will not compare this to Saving Private Ryan, because you are dealing with 2 REALLY important issues here. Different wars all together, and the fact that Saving Private Ryan never happened, this did.<br/><br/>
First I read the book and couldn't put it down. I was amazed and shocked by everything that these guys had been through and had to endure for 18 hours what was suppose to be a 1 or 2 hour mission. When I first heard that the movie was coming out my first reaction was to go to this web site and see who was directing it and see who was staring in it. I wasn't too thrilled to see that Jerry Bruckheimer was going to produce it. Most of his films have been nothing more than flash, no story line, good kick ass movies. but that is it. I didn't want to see this movie make light or glamorize what happened on Oct3-4th 1993, but rather keep the integrity of everything that happened, like the book had.<br/><br/>
When the film came out several weeks before the rest of the country did in New York and L.A.,  I started to read some of the comments made. You can actually tell who read the book and who didn't. Those who didn't expected to see more action, didn't think that the Somalies came out of the woodwork like vermin (""right 235SCOPE""). Had they read the book they may have understood that most of the stuff that happened in the movie, even some of the funny comments, were in the book.<br/><br/>
I have spent quite a few years in the military myself, so I have been there and done that, but my experiences don't EVEN pale in comparison to what hell the members of Task Force Ranger went through. <br/><br/>For people who have NOT read the book, or have not even been there don't judge this movie by the events of what happened or even how they happened. Judge it by the direction or the acting. I though the movie was awesome. I loved how it did keep the integrity of the book and didn't diminish the events of what happened. I will always remember the names of at least 2 of them. Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon were 2 members of Delta who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for going into almost certain death.<br/><br/>
See the movie, decide for yourself, but remember...this did happen."

","This movie is based 100% on the book Black Hawk Down, written by its survivors.  It is no tale.  Prepare yourself for a very accurate depiction of a battle fought by U.S. Marines.  There's no political background or charterization because that is not what a battle is.  This was a war we fought.  And by all rights it was the worst since Korea.  It was fought with little support or deciviness by President Clinton. Critics wanted something more than just a battle scene.  This is because no critic is knowledgeable on this war.  Every critic has been through years of American history classes from grade school to high school.  We all know exactly what happened in WWI and WWII.  That allows the public to be entertained by movies like Saving Private Ryan.  But this war is 99% unknown to the American public. I suggest reading the book first.  You will realize the events are very true and the Marines were very overwhelmed by the suicidal(and difficult to kill) Somalians. Please understand that embedded in Marines brotherhood is never leaving another Marine behind.  This battle started with the task of escorting SEALS's into a home to try to kill the Somalian warlord.  When that failed and hell broke loose the rest of the battle was to rescue the downed Marines and get the hell out of Dodge.  But that will not be so easy in the face of women and children shooting at them every step of the way. Enjoy and educate yourself, you owe it to these men. I am not a Marines, just a young man paying respect for those who sacrifice their lives for my freedom. Thanks, Doug"
"Rogue Leader","Null","0","0","23 March 2002"," Direction can always improve a movie
","Since it was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie released after September 11th, I was expecting his typical patriotic war movie. In short I was prepared to swallow Pearl Harbor all over again.<br/><br/>But when I saw the movie, I realized my expectations were less than accurate. Ridley Scott's stellar direction really improved the movie. He decided to take a Bruckheimer action blockbuster into an unusual war documentary.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott chose to focus on the most important aspect of war, in which that it is extremely futile. It also showed the Americans were a bit too bold in their mission. I don't recall the historical facts concerning the war on Somalia, back in 1993 very well, but it's well evident that the Pentagon interfered with the script, because the characters are way altered to look necessarily real. Only Ewan MacGregor does a decent job of portraying a soldier. It could be the Pentagon who altered the script, but this kind of character waste is typical of Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>Another Pentagon alteration is the final point of view concerning the war. Not only the Americans consider the situation on Somalia to be genocide (as if the bombing of Hiroshima never happened) but the movie shows the death of 19 Americans to be far more worrisome than the slaughter of 1.000 Somalis. That is a disservice when the movie attempts to show history, since it was rewritten on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The action sequences were nothing short of spectacular. While it doesn't deliver the special effects-oriented large scale war sequences typical from Pearl Harbor (it's good that didn't happen) the sequences recall some of the most bloody and ferocious moments from Saving Private Ryan, played throughout two hours without interruption. The whole mess is portrayed as realistic as possible. I was amazed by the scenes where the helicopters crash.<br/><br/>The movie, like any Jerry Bruckheimer production, could have been filled with unnecessary patriotic remarks and endless scenes of the American flag. Fortunately, Ridley Scott cuts down on Jerry's patriotic remarks, reducing them to just a few random comments amongst the soldiers and focuses on the more realistic aspects of war.<br/><br/>In short, despite some flaws, the movie holds up impressively well, and well above the disastrous Pearl Harbor. Ridley Scott proves once again how outstanding his work is. Now I should probably expect the next Jerry Bruckheimer movie to be about the September 11th attacks and the war on Afghanistan. I'll be waiting."

","The Gulf War was not a war in my mind; it was just something happened when I was young that they put on the news every night- I didn't think that the hundred (or more) men and women who died counted... people were/are shot and stabbed in my city every day- it's on the news, and that's what the Gulf War was too... news. Not until I was twenty did I realize that when people die, it's a shattering thing. Unfortunately this lesson came in the form of a movie (an excellent movie for what it's worth)- particularly a scene towards the end when one of the soldiers stranded at a downed helicopter is overtaken and killed by the Somali horde. He is dragged into the street, stripped and pulled along by his feet as the crowd chants *and laughs*. Sitting in the dark of the theatre I remembered seeing the actual footage on the Nightly News at age eleven... and I started to cry. Men died in a war fought over money! They died in horrible ways that I never imagined one human could do to another. Men died bleeding, crying, babbling because they forgot their own language... and they were American.<br/><br/>My neighbors are American, my mother and father are American, the kid sitting next to me in lecture is American- any of us could have been there- any of us could have been dismembered and tortured that day.

","This film is just about the closest Hollywood has ever done to creating a war documentary, which can make it a bit difficult to rate as one might a ""regular"" war movie. Unlike films like ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" which created a fictional tale set in a larger, factual context, this movie shows us the actual men and actions over a hellish 15 hours in Somalia, the well known debacle in which 19 men were killed after a raid designed to capture some of Somalia's worst warlords went awry.<br/><br/>First off, I want to address a few criticisms leveled here, most of them coming from left wingers and assorted Euro-trash who seem to have a knee-jerk negative reaction to pretty much anything the American military does. One, though made in co-operation with the Pentagon (like, Duh!, where else are they gonna get all those expensive helicopters?) it is hardly a propaganda piece, if anything, the incident was a major embarrassment to our military, so much so that then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin was fired because of it. The men were sent in unprepared (bad Intel) and without the proper equipment (which was more of a political decision). The men themselves comported themselves bravely (this being no more than historical fact) yet their leaders were often indecisive, vacillating over how to react as one, then a second, chopper got shot down. I myself was practically screaming for additional helicopter gunship support for the beleaguered men, yet for some reason it was used very sparingly even as the guys on the ground were being cut to ribbons.<br/><br/>Next is the ""race"" issue. True, far more Somalis were killed than Americans, but as the film shows, the vast majority of these were the warlord's armed thugs, not helpless civilians. Unlike the Viet Cong, the Serbs or even the Nazis, these men were not fighting for any sort of cause other than simply satisfying their own greed. The warlords and their armed mobs (they are not worthy of being dignified with the title of ""soldier"") got rich by plundering the relief supplies that were supposed to go to famine victims. The film accurately portrays these people as the vermin they are, and I must admit my favorite scene was when (finally!) American gunships popped in that night and hosed them down by the dozens with rockets and miniguns. Harsh as it may sound, it was morally satisfying to see these human scumbags exterminated like a bunch of roaches. And the people who can't see the difference between these parasites enriching themselves at the expense of their own people and the ordinary Somali civilians are simply not playing with a full deck.<br/><br/>Anyway, that aside, this film succeeds pretty much on every level. People may complain that the characters are not developed enough or that the larger geo-political issues are not explored further, but the movie was simply not intended to do either. Instead, its principal aim is to give a raw, visceral look at the actual events that took place on that fateful day. As others have noted, it takes the approach used in Pvt. Ryan and extends it over almost the entire film. If you want to experience modern close urban combat on a gut level, this delivers the goods in spades. At times I found it confusing, trying to figure out which guys were where, but that merely reflects the reality of the actual confusion. At one point, two soldiers are simply left behind, they'd been completely forgotten when their unit was ordered to move to the first crash site. Really, the only objection I can come up with is that, on a few occasions, Ridley Scott relies excessively of SFX and `artsy' shots, which I found to detract from the otherwise compelling gritty realism.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, I cannot really give this film the usual 1-10 scale rating, though it would rank at least a 7 if I did. Mr. Scott and his team of actors, cameramen, and effects guys do a fine job, but it's the story itself that makes this movie what it is. And, for that, we have a bunch of brave American soldiers to ultimately thank."

Blackhawk Down offers a brief segment of a thirty minute ""incursion/extraction"" operation gone awry as they sometimes do  due to the many unpredictable variables in hostile territory.<br/><br/>As a film study, it dissects a 36  hour of real life as a Ranger / Special Forces task force.

","I came out of the theater with a nauseous stomach. Being Lebanese, I had experienced war, and this movie just managed to bring back that sick feeling of fear mixed with morbid fascination.<br/><br/>And yet another ""based on real facts"" movie to honor American heroes. In 1993, 19 American soldiers perished in a raid that was ordered to bring about the defeat of the Somali militia and, consequently, the end of the hunger crisis in Somalia. Even though it was a civil war, the U.S. thought of it as ""a genocide"" and dispatched 123 elite soldiers there for a simple mission that turned out to be totally nightmarish for Americans AND SOMALIS ALIKE, mind you (1000 Somalis died that day). But, since Pentagon had to approve and stamp the script prior to production, I'm not surprised the movie turned to be such a (visually stunning!) propaganda. The American elite soldiers are courageous, attractive, humanitarian, compassionate, and so on. The Somalis on the other hand are portrayed as a mindless, ruthless, bloodthirsty, chaotic mob.<br/><br/>The movie was realistic, sometimes too realistic, i.e. too gory. In my opinion, Scott crossed the line between movie and documentary, and because of that the movie fails as a movie and the documentary fails as a documentary. This is as far as the overuse of gunpowder and bloodshed is concerned. And when I say bloodshed, I don't mean close-ups of severe wounds, but insert shots of decapitated soldiers, and of 'idle' fingers, hands, legs, and intestines all over the place.<br/><br/>Some of the characters were recognizable and easy to follow in the heat of the action (duh, as if Hartnett and McGregor were going to go unnoticed!). But to be honest, sometimes you just lose count of who got killed and in what circumstances and who managed to survive. And because of that, you just don't sympathize with them when they express pain and anger due to the loss of their comrades.<br/><br/>The clich√É¬©s were inevitable: ""tell my parents that I fought well"", ""kiss my little girls"", Rangers and Deltas leaving posthumous goodbye letters with the soldiers left at the base, a soldier calling his sweetheart home and leaving her a love message on her answering machine (yep, she missed him by one second cause she was, of course, shopping). One element of surprise: usually, in movies, when a soldier is seen gazing at the photo of his sweetheart and/or children, it's a sign that he will die very tragically very soon. Well, not this time: the only soldier who is shown doing the above is incredibly lucky; he survives a plane crash, the angry armed mob, and he is the only American soldier of the Raid who to be held captive by the Somalis; yet he is eventually released. I couldn't help notice that.<br/><br/>I'm done with the cons of the movie, now I'll move on to the pros.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the action was dazzling, sensational, suspenseful, etc, etc. There was never a dull moment, but it was a tad confusing at times.<br/><br/>
The strongest point of the movie was the superb editing. The insert shots of the Somali victims were poignant: heartfelt music, grainy photography, lonely ""skinnies"" (and how dare they call them that in the movie, by the way?) wandering in the ruins of their city, with their moving expressions of grief and confusion. I particularly liked the opening scene of the film, it managed to pull out the desolation, misery, and suffering of the Somalis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moral of this movie? It doesn't matter if the U.S. have every right to butt in other countries' civil wars, what matters is that every American soldier on foreign soil must be brought back home, dead or alive. Mostly dead, in this case."

","The history of film has given us some great war movies, e.g. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front and Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory chronicled WW1, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Oliver Stone's Platoon, and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket showed us the madness involved in the Vietnam War, and Steven Spielberg's recent Saving Private Ryan chronicled a chapter in WW2. Now, Ridley Scott, with Black Hawk Down, has given us one of the most realistic depictions of what it feels like to be in the heart of battle. It is about a group of US soldiers who in 1993 tried to capture two Somalian guerrilla warlords in a mission that went terribly wrong. Various critics have complained that there is not enough character development in Black Hawk Down. The complaint is basically that in a film that boasts a running time of roughly 2 1/2 hours, only the first half hour or so is devoted to giving us the background of the various characters, and why we should care about any of them. While I believe that this criticism is not completely off the mark, considered purely as a technical exercise designed to get the viewer to feel ""what it's like"" to be in a war, it is undeniable that Black Hawk Down is something of a masterpiece. Spielberg wowed audiences in 1998 with the technically brilliant and realistic battle sequences that frame Saving Private Ryan. But whereas Spielberg's film eventually ""slowed down"" to give us character development, etc., Scott's film, after the initial half hour of set up, never lets up. For the next two hours or so, Black Hawk Down assaults the viewer with a technically brilliant recreation of the brutality, craziness, and the horror of war. The event of war is presented without moralistic commentary; Scott wisely lets the action speak for itself. The brutality of war is presented as a simple fact. This is not a ""recruiting"" film; this is not necessarily an ""anti-war"" film; it is a film that realistically (and brilliantly) shows us what war is LIKE."

Americans don't understand 'abroad' - neither does the audience, thrown into a confused jumble of incomprehensible language, food, etc, and then a virtually plotless battle. Disorientation rules. But the Americans win in the end, so that's OK, even though it's not clear whether the objective was attained, or even what the objective was. (Compare this with the Gulf War and the 'War On Terrorism' - without a clear, coherent objective, it's impossible to say whether the conflict's been won or lost.) Also, a few Brit actors (McGregor, Bremner, Gruffud) are thrown into the mix, like the Allied forces who are just ballast to the US-driven war effort.<br/><br/>I still don't know whether it's a good or bad movie ('good' or 'bad' in both aesthetic and moral senses) but, if you look closely enough, it's a much cleverer movie than the multiplex droolers might have picked up."

","If you're going to see this movie for the first time, see it in the theater, because it is much more powerful with the surround sound (the good sound effects add to it also) just as with any war movie. Black Hawk Down ranks up with other movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon, however those wars would decades ago, when in fact this film takes place in recent 1993, when most of us were still alive. The film is based on a very closely related story with true characters and plot. Ridley Scott, one of my most favorite directors, again shows his great talent in Black Hawk Down by going to the limits to make the movie real, and it is very real. I've heard from many magazine articles praising this movie that it is the most realistic war movie out there. It goes deep into you and makes you think how bad war really is. The majority of the soldiers that were sent on the relief mission to Somalia were young and many had never gone into battle before. The film captures the true emotion of these young men when they realize within an hour how bad and unexpectedly bloody a war or special op can get. Hans Zimmer composes yet another great score (he worked with director Ridley Scott on Gladiator also). I am now reading the book, which is just as engrossing as the film, if not more. The thing about this war film was that it is a story of modern war, not WWII or Vietnam or any wars before that. It is also different in a way because these soldiers were sitting ducks and were attacked without warning, so it shows some of the realistic reactions of the soldiers when this occurs like in no other war movie. The film also is focused on one single overnight battle, not several battles as in other war films. Although this may seem to get boring after a while, the film is full of action. If you are looking for impressive special effects and gore and are turning away from this movie believing that the fact that only a little more than a dozen americans were killed decreases its gore, don't. You get plenty of effects and blood in this movie, just as much as all the other war dramas. The actors did a great job in adding to the film's realistic value by showing a variety of emotions during the surprise battle--anger, sadness, and fright. This is quite possibly the greatest war movie out there right now, and I highly recommend it. 9/10"

","Saving Private Ryan told us ""is it really worth it to save one man?""  Thin Red Line told us ""every man fights his own war"".  Black Hawk Down told us that ""everybody comes home"".  There have been many war movies on the dreaded World War II, but never any on real-life war.  Black Hawk Down presents a great presentation of the war in Somalia not a decade ago.  There seems to be a lack of drama in this movie, but it still shows how war is HELL. People in America take great pride in the countless big and small wars the United States have won, but most do not understand the detail of it.  They don't understand the chaos of war.  Saving Private Ryan had some great drama, but they didn't express enough on the death of soldiers, and the movie presents thousands of soldiers dieing in the beath scene as almost nothing.  Black Hawk Down expressed most (if not all) drama on the death of each and every soldier, that every single man is important to war.  Some people believe that there was too much action in this movie.  I feel it is ok.  In World War II, they had times where they can just enjoy the fields because they have a whole continent to go around.  In Black Hawk Down, they have a small city of 5000 armed Somalians, which means there has to be action in it throughout the movie, because in such a small area, there is not a single point in the day where you can relax.  Black Hawk Down only is about the #150 of the top 250 films.  I believe it should be higher.  Saving Private Ryan changed the views of people of how a war film should be, so they feel this wasn't such a good film.  However, Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan were in 2 long different time periods, and for the time period Black Hawk Down takes place in, this was truly a great presentation of real-life war, and it should be #50 and higher.<br/><br/>10/10 Best war movie replacing Saving Private Ryan. 3rd is The Thin Red Line.

"argv","Null","0","0","19 January 2002"," Great visuals, but remains too neutral in message
","In the opening scene of Black Hawk Down, the plain white text on black background says calmly that the movie is based on actual events. This is an understatement. In the midst of reality-based entertainment, this film pushes the envelope the furthest so far, totally immersing you in a war environment like no other experience before. Director Ridley Scott re-creates a fierce 15-hour battle between besieged U.S. troops and Somali fighters on the streets of Mogadishu in 1993, in which 18 Americans were killed and 73 injured, along with thousands of Somali militia. Scott's exceptional visual sense is expressed to perfection, putting you directly in the center of action, from beginning to end, as if you were one of the soldiers themselves. But, don't think it's just another testosterone-laden war film. It's not. It is an intelligent and ambitious effort to accurately portray the soldiers' experiences of that fateful day. <br/><br/>                                   The plot is actually rather simple. American servicemen were to capture the warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid, in a mission that was to take less than one hour. Things went awry from the beginning when a soldier falls to the ground from a helicopter. The dominoes start to fall as his comrades attempt to rescue him, and they start getting picked off by snipers. The movie is all about what these soldiers went through, and how they survived, or how they died. <br/><br/>                                   And herein lies the dilemma. The cost of portraying reality so intensely and dramatically in two hours means that anything that could soften this experience has to be left out. In this case, any sort of character development, plot, or historical context that may suggest political commentary one way or the other have all been swept aside. Also note that the film portrays experiences, not necessarily everything that happens. The political objectives of their mission are, as you might expect from a soldier's point of view, all besides the point. What's more, certain events, like the dragging of two American soldiers through the streets - an event that was televised on CNN that moved American public opinion so strongly - are also left out of the film. It isn't entirely clear what the Scott's intent was for the film, since what I saw seems to differ from what he said he wanted to do in interviews I've read with him. Regardless of intent, I thought the film was a fabulously intensive visual experience, and I felt I got a true sense of what things are like in a modern combat situation. <br/><br/>                                   Discussion of the problems with the film get complex and difficult, since it's not entirely clear what story or message the film wanted to tell. From a filmmaker's perspective, this is a risky approach, and in so doing, has already alienated many people who feel that the film leaves out too much context, or that the film should take a position on whether we were doing the right thing by being there. Then again, when you're in battle, it's easy to forget, let alone think about, the political or humanitarian reasons for your presence, and the movie makes that abundantly clear. <br/><br/>                                   But, taking the position of ""neutrality through non-statements on either side of the issue"" is not as ambitious as ""neutrality through explicit expression of both sides of the issue"", as was done so skillfully in the film, Dead Man Walking. In that context, I felt Black Hawk Down paled dramatically to its potential. Even less excusable is that the skills of these mature and well-seasoned filmmakers could have taken those bold steps.<br/><br/>
                                   While the film's realism is violent and bloody, it is not exploitive. Rather, it is tastefully done such that anyone-as uncomfortable as they may be seeing such things-can have a better appreciation for what real battle is all about. It is also timely, as the very same powder keg in Somalia is once again back in the news as this film is being released. In fact, the same warlords are still in power. What we do about it now, as opposed to 1993, will be interesting to witness. One of the effects of September 11 is that America had a rude awakening to the realities of a harsher world with terrorists and anarchistic warlords. Seeing and understanding Black Hawk Down is a sad, but necessary next step in our maturation process for world events. It's only too bad that it didn't really take the bolder and more difficult step in broaching the difficult and complex political and social issues."

","When I saw ""We Were Soldiers"" I immediately compared it to this film. The most obvious difference is that ""Black Hawk Down"" was more of a straight action film depicting the hell of war, while ""We Were Soldiers"" made more of an effort to depict the human element - of the Americans, their wives, and even of the Vietnamese. Ridley Scott's purpose in making ""Black Hawk Down"" was clearly to show the utter chaos of the combat in Mogadishu, and in that he succeeded.<br/><br/>Although we may not know the human beings quite as well as we'd like, the audience can grasp the turmoil into which they were thrown - and that is a vivid though unstated indictment of Americasn leadership, and especially the pusillanimous Clinton administration that left them hanging without adequate backup, armor, or air support, even though these were requested.<br/><br/>Although Bill Clinton, and his then Sec. of Defense, Les Aspin, deserve much of the blame, the commander on the scene, Gen. Garrison, must accept some culpability also. He was depicted as having not bothered to even tell other Allied troops on the scene of the planned incursion into Mogadishu: the U.S. 10th Mountain Division, the Pakistanis, and others. No excuse for that. Clinton later bugged out while scape-goating Les Aspin. It is now revealed Osama Bin Laden was much encouraged by Clinton's cutting and running out of Somalia. <br/><br/>A good, realistic war film. And I give it credit for not opening up the can of worms that would be the politics of it all.

A lot of people are complaining that it's not this or that type of movie, or it does not have this or we should not have to see whatever portrayed in such a manner.<br/><br/>This is not exactly a plot based movie,..as it relies on facts as they actually happened,..which can limit how a film can be portrayed.

If the director had wanted to portray the political side he could have,.but we would have lost a lot of what the film was made for because of time constraints.

That's it,..no more no less,..it did exactly what it set out to do, get the perspective from not the Somalis side, nor the directors viewpoint so much either but from those who fought against the Somalis. And in this it was a job very well done.<br/><br/>A lot of people have whined about the Somalis points of view and thoughts, well, let em make their own damned movie about,.that should quiet a lot of non-Americans and make them so happy they could hug themselves seeing the U.S. in a bad a light as possible. Whatever it takes man, dig? And the body count of the Somalis compared to the special forces? Well,..you have a buttload of mostly civvie/guerrilla p****d off semi-stone age natives in bunches and masses running around,.against highly trained military forces whom are dug and behind what cover they have, fighting for their lives, and the lives of their friends.

","I really really like Ridley Scott.  I wanted him to make a great movie.  I wanted to like the movie.  I wanted another war movie to add to my likes list (currently only 3 are on it - Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and Thin Red Line - and 2 maybe war: Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October). This movie did not add itself to the roster.  <br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD* It had a really good intro, that was probably manipulative, but for somebody who was 11-12 when the events occurred.  So, i was hoping for something substantial.  I got a story of how everything broke down, and that was interesting.  But, there were several problems with the movie.  One big beef I had was I never got to know the characters enough to care about them. Some have already said that it was the point, but for the surgery to really work as emotion instead of gory shock, we should know and care for the soldier like his partners.  <br/><br/>Also, there was almost a checklist of stereotypes used.  Tough and mean-spirited general, check.  Rebellious crew, check.  Humanitarian, check. There were more.  And while i am sure hat the stereotypes were at the heart of these characters, I am sure that they were more than these base characters.  Other complaints include that this is one big disjointed battle.  You never focus on any one group long enough to know them or what their situation is.<br/><br/>What was up with the final speech?  Did he really say that?  Was my stomach churning over heartfelt words really said over a dead body?  Or was this a reshoot in our new found nationalistic obsession for heroes, and finding them in the NYFD/PD?  It seemed like a forced new scene made just for this situation.  <br/><br/>And the whole movie was patriotic, but I guess people really are in the military.  How else could you survive if you didn't believe in your country enough to die for it?  But, it still seemed to have a bias that dying for your nation is a great thing even if it isn't for anything protective of the US.  And it even condemned us nay-sayers by putting negative words in the mouth of the ""bad guys."" *END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The movie could have been good, but I was just sighing and looking at my watch by the end of it.  It was boring because it was repetitive.  I guess people need war movies like old ones in this day of age, but I still would never add this movie to the top ten of my list, or even in the better half.

I didn't really know what to expect as I had not really seen much about it before going to see it, so I had no idea what I had in stock. It has some very good technical staff behind it, clear shots, good directing, but it simply is NOT appropriate to make a movie ment for entertainment about such a reallife tragedy!<br/><br/>A documentary about it would have been quite alright, and I do hope to see a good documentary about the scenario that took place in Somalia in 1993, but this movie presents the events as though they were ment to entertain us! I think that is disgraceful and demeaning to the memories of the american soldiers that died in Somalia. Worst of all, they have even put in scenes that made people laugh! Scenes that were actually quite tragic, but presented in a way that made people laugh.

","When I first heard that Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer were teaming up to make an American war movie together, I must confess, I cringed.  Sure, Bruckheimer's past efforts were laughable, unchallenging pieces of eye candy, so it would not be unheard of him making a war movie.  ""Pearl Harbour"" is evidence enough of that.  But Ridley Scott's films hold a special place in my heart.  ""Alien"" is a favourite, as is ""Blade Runner"" and I was even slightly stirred by ""G.I. Jane"", not for its Demi Moore showboating but its style.  Scott's movies have often been so exquisitely stylish they border on mouth-watering.  But a Bruckheimer / Scott produced, Scott directed WAR movie?<br/><br/>Still, given the visual treats Scott has offered audiences in his more recent films (""Gladiator"" and ""Hannibal""), ""Black Hawk Down"" was to be no exception.  And it isn't.  This is a film so visceral it begs the question of the audience: ""Am I actually in this war scene?!""  Only seeing famous faces like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore can bring the audience back down to reality.  That only happens when there is an all but brief delay in the chaos of combat.<br/><br/>The premise for this film is based on true events.  Taken from the non-fiction book of the same name, ""Black Hawk Down"" is the account of three platoons of US forces in Somalia during late 1993.  On one October day, US officials, in all their wisdom, decide to capture Somali warlord General Mohammed Farrah Aidid's two senior lieutenants.  Sending in elite Delta Force, Ranger and SOPR troops to capture the two men, the Americans run into stiff resistance as their helicopters are shot down.  What was to be an abduction turns into a desperate rescue mission.<br/><br/>The film opens with a brief history of the US involvement in Somalia accompanied by some colour de-saturated shots of the famine and horror of the situation.  While it may seem overblown initially, as the film moves on you really do realise that this is what it was like for the people of Somalia: pure hell.  The streets are littered with dead bodies, the buildings destroyed and the sheer hellishness of the place can turn even the most stout of all stomachs.  You have to pinch yourself and understand that this really did happen.<br/><br/>With the historical background behind us in the first twenty minutes, a number of key characters are introduced.  Many of the players in the book (which was taken from the 29-part serialised Philadelphia Enquirer story by Mark Bowden) are omitted.  Despite this there is a big character list, some of whom we forget or mistake for other characters.  Huge cast aside, Josh Harnett plays Staff Sergeant Matt Eversman, a Ranger who has just been promoted to group leader.  His crew consists of some familiar faces, including Ewan McGregor as desk-jockey turned combatant Specialist Danny Grimes.  William Fichtner, who audiences will recognise from ""Contact"", ""Go"" and ""The Perfect Storm"", plays Sergeant First Class Jeff Sanderson.  He is the group leader of the ultra-elite Delta Force, which includes Aussie ""Chopper"" star Eric Bana as the Rambo-like Sergeant First Class Norm Hooten. Tom Sizemore plays Colonel Danny McKnight and leads the Humvee-driving SOPR team.  Sam Shepard plays General William Garrison, who envisioned the mission.  It's a big roll call, and I haven't included many other names and faces that you will recognise.<br/><br/>Such is the pace of ""Black Hawk Down"" that you lose time.  The film is brilliantly edited, with quick cuts, slow-mo, fades, dissolves and colour filters used frequently. Scott delves deep into his bag of cinematic tricks to keep you pinned down or on the edge of your seat.  The quality of sound is spectacular with roaring gunfire dispersed with screams of pain.  Not an easy ride at all, but one you feel better for witnessing at the film's conclusion.  There are many similarities to other notable war movies including ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but ""Black Hawk Down"" is nowhere near as trippy as the former or gory as the latter.  Sure, it is violent and may not suit all tastes, but the violence is necessary as it simply reinforces the mental and physical torture of war.<br/><br/>There is little room for character development or introspection, and despite its display of American military muscle, this is definitely an anti-war film.  Kudos must go to Bruckheimer, who has broken the mould here from his other films.  He even managed to borrow real Black Hawk helicopters from the US Army and convinced the President of Morocco to allow the film to be shot in its city streets.  Perhaps we can expect more high-budget, high-quality films from him in the future?<br/><br/>As the opening titles of the film reads from Plato, 'Only the dead have seen the end of war', by films end we agree with that sentiment.  The final images of the film reinforce how desperate many of the world's hotspots are, and also, how easy and luxurious our own lives are.  Post September 11 ""Black Hawk Down"" may actually lose some of its impact regarding the use of American troops in foreign conflicts, but it is more so a timely reminder that war, no matter who is involved, is hell."

","Black Hawk Down avoids dealing with the political side of the story and basically restricts itself to combat situations between American soldiers and Somalian rebels. It must be said that most of these scenes are brilliantly executed, wonderfully shot with pale filters and edited with a very hectic and effective pace. But BHD suffers from an overkill of technically superior firefights, that eventually deadens the senses just as the action sequences in Pearl Harbor tended to make viewers numb after prolonged bombardments and such. Scott undoubtedly succeeds in depicting a realistic and impressive report of what happened in Mogadishu, but he also ignores content in favour of style and thereby fails to make any statement about the events whatsoever (apart from stating that these soldiers were tremendously brave maybe which is of course a statement that will not raise any eyebrows); our heroes remain anonymous to us, also there isn't any character development to speak of. At one point i expected the film to focus on the executive mismanagement that may have played an important role in this military tragedy, but unfortunately Scott never really adresses this aspect of the events (and i have a feeling the military gratiously providing the actual Blackhawk craft for the shooting had something to do with this). Also I found it surprising to see BHD was practically devoid of patriotic sentiment (in the sense of American flags in the wind, accompanied by trumpets and horns) unlike almost all of Bruckheimer's other productions. What we're left with in the end is a remarkably accurate but also remarkably hollow war-film, not a waste of time, but certainly not worth the hype it has caused."

","Imagine the Omaha Beach landing scene from Saving Private Ryan played over two whole hours. If that sounds like something you probably would not enjoy, than you belong to the sane majority, and deserve a cookie. It also means you might be put off watching this film, for that premise was one of its great marketing elements. The truth is, you'd be missing out.<br/><br/>In recreating the 24 hours or so around an operation to capture a Somali warlord's top advisers, the film is a hybrid of police procedural and war movie, giving you the limited but focused scope of the former with the intensity of the latter. It also acts a horribly prescient display of a modern Western army completely underestimating a ""primitive"" enemy, and making everyone pay a heavy price. On paper the mission meant minimal casualties and a deployment meant to last for less than an hour. In practice, the day-long carnage cost the lives of almost 20 elite troops and around a thousand locals. It also proved utterly futile in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Cushioned as its release was between 9/11 and the second Gulf War, BHD admirably manages to avoid the prevalent flag-waving tone and boils both sides down to nearly tribal elements, all the way to the strangely homogenous look of team America's cast: our heroes are often hard to tell from one-another, and the emphasis is on team solidarity when thrown into a living hell, not individual heroics. Josh Hartnett is wisely used as our conduit into this world, not our hero. More showy characters like Eric Bana's Delta veteran or Tom Sizemore's bullet- proof colonel manage to be both impressive for their courage and depressing for their inner hollowness and resignation.<br/><br/>Visually, this is astounding, and once the fireworks get going, they are relentless. This is an immersive experience, in terms of both image and sound, all the way to the music, with Hans Zimmer's genre-defining score perfectly complementing the action and giving the film's rare moments of calm a haunting quality.<br/><br/>In an age where modern warfare means ever-growing distance between a nation and the implications of its actions abroad, this comes a brutal reminder of the costs of such conflict: both to those who live in and around war-zones, but also to the young men sent to fight such battles. As a representation of modern warfare on the big screen, it has no contemporary equal."

"GIJane","Null","0","0","23 February 2002"," One must not miss the true meaning behind this incredible film.
","First, I would like to begin my saying that this is truly one of the best movies that I've ever seen, and I feel that it is the duty of every American to be aware of the events that transpired in Somalia in October 1993. After reading some of the other comments posted,  I felt obligated to make my opinion known. In no way does this movie glamorize the actions of the Rangers and Delta Force operatives in Somalia. And in no way does it trivialize the deaths of a thousand Somalis. As a society, we feel so compelled to be ""politically correct,"" but that simply cannot work in this movie. Black Hawk Down is shot from the perspective of American soldiers. The book it is based on was a compilation of interviews with American soldiers. How can anyone discredit this movie because it portrays our soldiers in a positive light? I'm sorry, but in this particular battle, the Somali militia were our enemy. And in battle, if the enemy doesn't die, you do. Some of the people who have posted comments bashing our military need to step back and examine their own lives, and where they would be without the military. If one does not agree with the actions of the American military in Somalia, you must direct your anger at the people in Washington who control the military. Contrary to popular belief, most members of the military are good people who are volunteering to protect YOUR country so you don't have to. And they do not decide where they go and what they do. They are given orders. Some say that we need to abolish the military all together. That is ignorant. Anyone who is anti-military has taken absolutely no time to sit down and contemplate what would happen to this country without one. We don't live in a perfect world, and we probably never will. But until we do, the military is vital not only to our prosperity, but to our very existence. It sickens me that, after seeing a movie of this magnitude, people talk about how the characters all looked the same, and the soldiers were portrayed as heroic while the Somalis were ""evil,"" and it was just a revolting display of patriotism. Well, the characters all looked the same because they were all supposed to be soldiers in the US Army. Had Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks, and Tom Cruise stolen all the parts, it may had made for a blockbuster, but it would not have had the same effect. These guys looked like soldiers, and they played their parts phenomeonally. No, the Somalis were not evil...they were the enemy. They were portrayed that way in the film because that's who they were in this particular battle. And the American soldiers were portrayed as heroes because THEY WERE. Most people have absolutely no clue of what these men do every day. Most of you probably were not even familiar with these events until you heard about the movie. But these events did take place. And if one pays attention to the movie instead of sitting there, desperately trying to think of things to be angry about, you will realize that the men who fought and died that day are as close to heroes as you can get. Take Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon, for example. These were the two Delta Force snipers who saw the downed second chopper from a helicopter circling overhead, and VOLUNTEERED to go down with limited ammunition and protect any survivors and the chopper as long as possible. For those of you who may not understand, these two men VOLUNTEERED TO DIE protecting a chopper that may or may not have survivors on it. Were they thinking about the Medals of Honor they would be awarded posthumously? No. They were doing their jobs. It's as simple as that. And, as a result, they were killed, mutilated, and dragged naked through the streets of Mogadishu. Who out there who scoffs at the heroics of the men who fought that day would have the courage to make that sacrifice? One reviewer laughed at comments made by a soldier in the movie about fighting for the men next to you. This reviewer has obviously never served in the military, and has no idea of the bonds that develop in war. And he did nothing but prove the soldiers point. ""They wouldn't understand...They wouldn't understand that it's about the men next to you. And that's it."" I believe some people in this country have a distorted and ignorant view of the military. These soldiers are not ruthless, blood-thirsty killers. They are patriotic heros that are protecting our country. I will forever be grateful for the sacrifices of all those who fought that day in Somalia. Perhaps we shouldn't have been there. Perhaps our actions that day were wrong. But this is not the fault of our soldiers. They were protecting our country...they were doing their jobs. And we all owe them a debt of gratitude. So, if you have not yet seen Black Hawk Down, I highly recommend it. Do not expect a cheesy love story. Do not expect glorified violence. Expect a realistic account of the events of October 3-4, 1993. Put yourselves in the shoes of these young soldiers. This movie will humble you. Would you have the courage to do what they did? Would you give your own life, to save a friend? As one soldier states in the movie, while standing over the lifeless body of his friend, ""Nobody asks to be a hero. Sometimes it just works out that way."""

","""Black Hawk Down"" can be considered as a successor of ""Saving Private Ryan"", the Steven Spielberg production that changed the war genre movies. Following the ""Saving Private Ryan"" path, ""Black Hawk Down"" shows the audience the crude, non-heroical and believable war, and not the ""Rambo""-type vengeance.<br/><br/>
Ridley Scott is the director of this incredible production. Some of his previous films have enchanted the audience (Alien, Gladiator, 1942), other productions from him have become not so brilliant (G.I. Jane, Hannibal). But ""Black Hawk Down"" is that kind of films that absorb the audience deep in the action, incredibly recreating the US incursion that occured in Mogadiscio, 1993.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice when watching the film is the hugeness of the action. I can't understand how they did it to create a city scale war zone: the helicopters flying above all the city, the landings of the aircrafts, the hundreds and hundreds of extras... It's like combining the majesty of ""Gladiator"" and the action and drama of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which creates a brilliant masterpiece.<br/><br/>You'll find such veterans and rookie actors in the crew: Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore (who seems to enjoy the war movies ^_^), Orlando Bloom (Legolas Greenleaf in the LOTR), Eric Bana and many more familiar faces. Plus also Ewan McGregor.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple. The Delta Force and Marines plan the attack and they completely fail. I like this movie because of that: it shows the bad strategy and the bad coordination that the american army had in that conflict, and everything because they understimated the somalian forces.<br/><br/>The weak point of the film should be that in some parts, the patriotic and heroic vision of the war emerges from the reality which makes interesting ""Black Hawk Down"", I mean, Ridley Scott's production is more ""holliwodish"" than ""Saving Private Ryan"", because you have your blond-hair blue-eye handsome good troops and the bad to the bone somalian army.

The cast, while featuring some good actors, is not exactly stellar. I was convinced I wouldn't see the film after seeing the trailer (the dialogue struck me as incredibly poor). But somehow I found myself seeing it, and boy was I surprised when I discovered the most riveting, unsettling war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>
The time is October 3, 1993; the place is Somalia. 120 American soldiers were on a mission to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a portrait of how what was supposed to be a half-hour mission turned into a grueling, 18 hour ordeal that led hundreds of Somalis and 18 Americans to their deaths. ""Black Hawk Down"" is amazing in how it puts you right in a soldiers shoes. It doesn't speechify or go heavy on irony. The event is depicted through actions, not words, and the result is stunning. We see each little decision that was made, each step that went wrong, and how it all lead to tragedy. Watching ""Black Hawk Down"", I felt like I was actually a soldier in combat, and it was terrifying.<br/><br/>
It is important to remember that this film isn't about the politics and the reasoning behind the mission, but about the experience. There is no trying to justify the reasons why things happened like they did. At times, it seems the screenplay (written by Ken Nolan and Steven Zaillian) wants to go that route, but Ridley Scott won't let it. We don't get to know the characters, but the idea of the film is that you are one of them. ""Black Hawk Down"" differs from films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it isn't so much about the soldiers lives and their legacies, but more the terror of being shoved into circumstances beyond your control. <br/><br/>Scott has regained his title of one of the most visually brilliant directors around, after losing it with films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Hannibal"". Anyone can make a film gory, few people are clear-headed enough to make it realistic. ""Enemy at the Gates"", for example, gives us a good look at Russian soldiers being mowed down by German machine guns, but the film is such a blur that it's impossible to care for them. In ""Black Hawk Down"", a sense of urgency is constantly pushing the film forward. Every time Scott cuts to a wide-angle shot to show the incoming enemy, it will get the entire audience tense. But as soon as he brings you back down into the action, the tenseness turns into horror. At times it feels almost impossible to watch, but it is just as hard to turn away. <br/><br/>There is the issue of the treatment of the Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"". It's a sticky subject. I won't pretend that most of the Somalis aren't being treated as the enemy. But I will say that the film is not overly unfair. This is a film about battle, told from one side's point of view. If this were a story about the Somalis, then the Americans would be just as much the ""bad guys"". But this is battle, plain and simple, and no matter which way one looks at it, its barbaric. What would be unfair is if the film assumed it knew the other side's every thought and tried to simplify their story. This was done to the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"" with disastrous results.<br/><br/>
""Black Hawk Down"" is a visceral film that shook me down to the core. It doesn't try to tell the political and moral complications behind all the chaos, which are far too vast and incomprehensible for any film to grasp. Film is a visual medium, and so Ridley Scott keeps the speechifying to a minimum and with his camera puts us in the middle of one of the biggest travesties since the Vietnam War."

","Gripping re-enactment of a US military operation in Somalia that grew from a skirmish into a war. No punches are pulled as we're given an almost documentary coverage of harrowing events in a way that leaves you in no doubt you're watching a true story, accurately told.<br/><br/>This isn't entertainment. It makes uncomfortable viewing, but we're in capable hands with Scott at the helm and there are no gung-ho heroics or glib one-liners amidst the carnage to cheapen the experience. Most importantly, the film doesn't proffer a moral standpoint. It simply shows US soldiers doing their job under conditions they were unprepared for, and the reactions of their superior officers who watch their satellite feeds helplessly.<br/><br/>This is no star vehicle, but every one of the familiar cast gives an earnest and compelling performance. Sizemore stands out, playing the kind of role that seems to be his bread and butter these days, but McGregor, Hartnett et al are all convincing.<br/><br/>My only complaints revolve around a ham-fisted metaphor at the tail end of the film, as a US general kneels to wipe up a soldier's spilled blood, and some trite dialogue. Other than that, this was one of those rare films, the kind that makes me feel glad to have a crappy office job."

This film blew me away.  it is easily one of the best films of 2001, along with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Ali.  You will never again watch a helicopter in a movie without thinking first of this.  You will never watch ER the same because this film makes it look like Sesame Street.  You will never hear a gunshot the same after you witness the amazing sound effects.  As soon as the Somalis begin firing, you flinch at every shot because they feel so close, it is amazing.<br/><br/>The actors are great, but it still cannot compare to the action and effects and the hard work that went into this.  The scenes in the helicopters, flying over the city are breathtaking.  They look amazing, with the smoke and scenery, it puts you right there.  Even teh music plays a role in teh film, by speeding up its tempo with the action, and focuses on the Americans, everytime one dies, the music stops, but it is done masterfully.  I give this film a very diserving 5 out of 5 stars.  Absolutely, one of the best, or the best war films ever.  I said that about Saving Private Ryan, but this surpasses it.  Just great, but one question bothers me.  Why the heck did teh Americans want to get mixed up in all of this.

To be sure, these things are abound in this film, but not to the point where you are exhausted after watching it. The film is well acted, but the dialogue fits with your standard war movie (i.e. ""Tell my wife/son/daughter/pet I love them""). The military paraphenelia is all very accurate and the sound effects dead on, but I was never pulled in.

","Here's the deal.  This movie is a recreation of a protracted firefight on the streets of Mogadishu Somalia.  It's not pro-war, it's not anti-war. It's not racist, it's not anti-muslim, it's not pro American (though it is from the U.S. GI's perspective).  It's not about big stars, like it could have been (Tom Crusie would have jumped at this).  It's a look at what happened on those two fateful days. That's it, no more no less.  If you want to see a drawn out battle scene, with much guts and gore, then see this.  If that's too much for you skip it.<br/><br/>Additionaly:<br/><br/>Re the maudlin ""tell so-and-so I love her, fought well"" criticism.  It is my understanding that these are based on the comments heard by survivors.  If that is what the dying men said, why exclude it just because it may sound sappy?  Think about it, what would you say if you were dying and there was someone there to pass along the message?  Whether we have been programmed by Hollywood to be sentimental when we die (as in all the old war movies) or it's just a natural thing to do, people do say things like that in extremis (remember the teacher from the Columbine shooting?  All the students who were with him said he wanted them to tell his family he loved them).  We hear accounts like this all the time from witnesses to dying individual's final words.  I was not there so I can't tell you what was said, but since all we have is the information from those who talked to these soldiers right before they died, let's give them the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>The racism charge:  Well first off, yes many black folks are killed because that's what really happened.  Let's all join together to keep the politically correct attack dogs away from that fact before they rewrite history once again. Now why more blacks weren't represented among the U.S. forces I'm not sure why.  I am in the Army and I can assure you that the proportion of blacks in the ranks is much higher than was shown.  I can only offer that it is my understanding that Scott wanted to be as factual as possible trying to represent the actual combatants, so maybe they were mainly white.  I can also offer the following antedotal items: Though there are many minorites in the U.S. Army I have noticed that amoung the Rangers and Special Forces, there are far fewer.  I don't know why (and by the way I am not a Ranger of Green Beret) this is, but it seems to be the case at least from my perspective; and I saw this film at a special showing in Korea at the Army post Theater and the audience was about 1/3 black and they didn't seem at all concerned with any racist overtones.  You could tell who they were supporting because you would hear a few muted cheers when a Somali was shot, and a groan or gasp when a white U.S. soldier was hit.  I guess some things transend race.<br/><br/>I feel sad that so many did not realize this happened or don't remember it. The image of those soldiers bodies being dragged through the streets has stuck with me since the first time I saw it on TV.  Shugart and Gordon are true heroes going into that crash site, and all famous actors/actresses, musicains, sports stars, etc aren't even close to qualifying to being the role models that those two should be to every one."

","Well, if you want action, this one has it. About two hours of action and that is the major strong point. However, what this movie is short on, is script and emotion. The scenes not involving the actual gun battles are just flat. It had the feel of a Bruckheimer film, create a series of detailed action scenes and then slap a story around it. Part of this might be the fault of the actual story as told in the book, but I don't think so. I am probably being too negative here, because it was a pretty good film. However, some of the action scenes were in desperate need of some other scenes in between. At some points in the film there is action for at least 30 minutes straight, although realistic in a combat situation, it grows tiring in a movie theater setting. Moreover, there were no real standout performances. I believe that the Academy really would have liked to have given a nomination to one of the actors, but nobody really was that strong or stood out.

Basically, I sat there just absorbing everything that was put in front of me without really getting pulled into the movie.  With that said, this is another movie that EVERY American should watch to understand what happens when we engage in OOTW (operations other then war...ridiculous concept isn't it?).  The American military is trained for one thing: war.  Not ""peace-keeping"" or policing or whatever other word you want to use for it.  If the American military is involved in any conflict it must be with OVERWHELMING force, with clear and achievable objectives, and with the full focus of the country and especially the country's leaders (Clinton appointed a committee to oversee the actions in Somalia).

","Ridley Scott does a superb job of bringing Mark Bowden's piece to life. Scott is the elite of the manipulators of sound and sight.  He not only takes you to the battle, he places you there.  Complimented by todays surround sound theaters, one becomes immersed in his angles and bytes, woven magnificently into a well-told tale.<br/><br/>Devoid of flag waving patriotism, Scott nonetheless evokes emotion from the complicated nature of modern war.  He holds true to the book, delving almost immediately into the battle after brief introductions of the principals. Though many, he does a nice job of rolling multiple folks into composite characters.  After all, this is a movie, not a documentary.<br/><br/>
Politics and patriotism are almost absent (despite the claims of many of this site's messengers); the focus is on the battle:  an operation that was supposed to take one half hour but became an twelve-hour-plus marathon.<br/><br/>Criticism of the one-sided nature of the fight is unwarranted.  The movie, like the book/articles are told from the American point of view for a reason:  it was nearly impossible to find the Somali viewpoint.  If anything, Scott is PC in his handling of the Somali tactics.  The movie leaves out (probably due to time constraints) several damning incidents from the book such as children being used as spotters; Somali gunmen, knowing the American aversion for civilian casualties, using women as shields, and Somali females brandishing weapons while holding infants.   Additionally, rumor has it that captions at the end of the flick suggesting that the results of the Battle of Mogadishu impacted American policy in Rwanda and the Balkans were pulled at the eleventh hour.<br/><br/>One feels the immediacy of the moment, the spinning-out-of control nature of the fight, and we are dragged along for the ride.  While it is easy to pick apart the decisions of the combatants afterward, Scott appropriately reminds us that life and death decisions tend to be made on the fly, without the benefit of omniscience.  Though we view the actions much like the Joint Operations Center (JOC) did, we are similarly helpless to avoid the tragedies that occur.  And this is the strength of the movie: it merely tells and does not judge.  There are no ""aww shucks"" or ""we shoulda"" moments only a retelling of the actions -and inactions, that influenced a small composite unit of America's fighting elite.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that Scott has done his homework in bringing this authenticity of ""today's"" military to light.  Minus some theatrical ""necessities"" such as using name tapes on the helmet and names on the radio, the lingo, technical and tactical proficiency, and actions of the characters are militarily very accurate. The sounds of (most) of the weapons, the uniforms, and even the jargon and lingo (such as the rank sergeant being pronounced ""sar'nt"" rather than WWII-era ""sarge"") give an authentic feel to the film.  Also, the macho nature of the forces involved is accurately depicted.  Keep in mind we are recounting the actions of America's elite warriors, the Rangers and Delta force, not the Girl Scouts.<br/><br/>This movie won't get best picture for a few reasons.  There are too many characters to get you too involved in any one of them and the pace of the book and movie preclude the typical highs and lows found in mainstream movie;  the flick is an adrenaline-filled roller coaster only  going down. If you are looking for melodrama, two-sided politics, or hokey action adventure, look elsewhere.  If you want to see a pure retelling, symbolic and painstakingly told account of modern war, than don't miss Black Hawk Down."

Elite Ranger and Delta Force troops drop into Somalia on what is supposed to be a short mission to capture the two lieutenants of a warlord. Based on the book by Mark Bowden from the actual event in 1993, the screenplay by Ken Nolan and Steve Zallian is very confusing in the beginning, and it gets it's bearing toward the end of the movie. There is a large and talented cast with standout performances from Josh Hartnet as Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann, Eric Bana as the warrior, Sgt. ""Hoot"", and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Col. Danny McKnight. Some of the confusion comes from having such a large ensemble cast-- some of the characters are indistinguishable, along with the intentional chaos on Director Scott's part as he depicts the initial mission going awry as Eversmann's men drop into Mogadeshu. The violence is realistic and uncompromising in the beginning, though it lacks the strong narrative style of ""Saving Private Ryan"". <br/><br/>What ""Black Hawk Down"" does well is make the viewer uncomfortable. In war the cost are the lives of young men. Bringing back everyone from battle is the highest tribute in the honor of the soldier. Eric Bana's ""Hoot"" says it all when he tells Harnet, ""It's all about the guy next to you..."" That is inspiring. ""Black Hawk Down"" gets it right in the end."

If the kill rate was as high as claimed, the film does a bad job of showing why special forces are so much more deadly than semi-trained militia.

The introduction scenes seemed out of place, as if they were intended only to make the audience sympathetic toward the ""heroes"" and not really explore the tragedy that was the Day of the Rangers (as the Somalis now call the battle).<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor - read the book.  It will give you a much greater appreciation for the complicated world we live in.  It doesn't preach or make points with a sledgehammer like this film tried."

","I've read the novel by Mark Bowden and I found it very engrossing.  It was a gripping story based on the accounts of the American soldiers who were involved in the Mogadishu conflict back in 1993.  It is important to recognise that this film is based upon a book which is considered to be one of the best collections of facts about the battle that any of us has access to.<br/><br/>I can't help but laugh at some of the reviews which complain about the lack of character development and the one-sidedness of this film.  There were over 100 American soldiers present and several thousand Somalians.  How much character development can you fit into a movie like this and still run within a reasonable time period?  Most accounts in the book were from the Americans since there were more of them available to give their observations.  I think Ridley Scott and the script writers did a phenomenal job in making the characters as memorable as they were.<br/><br/>As for the flag-waving, I can't see what people complain about.  There is next to no flag-waving in the film.  Of course there has to be some of that since there are 2 sides, each fighting for their country, but I think the story is told fairly based upon the facts available.  I don't think that the film makers have some kind of political agenda like so many people claim. I think that the point of this movie was to show the courage of the American soldiers thrown into a horrible situation.<br/><br/>This is not a propaganda film like some fools would claim.  It is not dangerous.  It doesn't glorify war (to show the horror of war, people need to see it).  It glorifies the brave souls who put themselves in hot water for the sake of their comrades regardless of their own well being.  So what if it is from an American point of view?  An American studio did produce it. This battle DID happen regardless of the political details that weren't in the film.  But I guess you can't please everyone.<br/><br/>The film is a technical masterpiece.  I couldn't find any flaws in the special effects and Ridley Scott did a terrific job of interpreting a very dynamic and convoluted situation.<br/><br/>I'd give the film a 9/10 even though it's not the sort of film that demands repeat viewings.  To fully appreciate it, I would strongly recommend reading the book first."
"Alex-506","5","0","0","18 January 2002"," Technically well-made but strangely lifeless.
","Black Hawk Down is a technically well-made film that left me feeling strangely unsatisfied and empty.  For all of the hype that I heard concerning the movie's battle scenes, I found them to be incoherent and for the most part, overrated.  Some have said that this film deserves comparison to Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan.  I feel that Apocalypse Now is in a far better category, and even though I had some problems with Saving Private Ryan, it still packed more of a wallop.<br/><br/>The problem with Black Hawk Down is that it seems to be a cinematic void. It doesn't really have much of a direction, other than almost two hours of gunfire spraying the streets of Somalia.  As an accurate representation of what happened in Somalia, I am sure it is superb.  However, I go to the movies to become involved in a story, although not necessarily through identification with the characters (Apocalypse Now and The Thin Red Line are good examples of war movies without lovable characters that involved me). However, Black Hawk Down was void of any real connection for me, so that by the end, I was just staring at the screen.<br/><br/>Part of this is due to the way that Scott chooses to present the horrors that happened on October 3, 1993.  By consistently barraging us with gunfire and RPGs exploding, we are actually desensitized.  There is none of the surprise or suspense of Saving Private Ryan.  I understand that this is a film based on a true story, and not an action film designed to deliver cheap thrills, but it comes across more as a nonstop shooting gallery.  Some of the best moments in the film are the quiet ones: the helicopters flying over the beaches before what is supposed to be a routine mission, the eerie sight of an empty city in prayer for only a few fleeting minutes, and the silent running of the American soldiers back to their base.  But these moments are few and far between, and they only offer glimpses of the truly chilling war picture this might have been.<br/><br/>Some have complained that this film is racist because it does not present the views of the Somalians or explain why some of the civilians acted the way they did.  This is a legitimate complaint, but it did not bother me, because the movie makes it clear early on that it is about the soldiers and what they went through.  I was really looking forward to a film which actually contemplated what it was like to be a soldier, not knowing what to do next or whether you had been abandoned.  Unfortunately, the film, while offering glimmers of my hope, also provided ample war movie cliches.  By the third time a dying soldier said ""Tell so-and-so so-and-so"", I almost rolled my eyes.<br/><br/>In a film with hundreds of different actors, only two really left me with any memory whatsoever.  Josh Hartnett (who I'm usually not a big fan of) was excellent in his role as the meditative sergeant who is actually afraid to be where he is.  The other actor is the always reliable character actor Tom Sizemore, who creates a strong character out of only a few lines. Unfortunately, other strong talents like Ewan MacGregor are largely wasted. I understand that this is not by nature an actor's movie, and I wasn't hoping for cliche caricatures, just some human connection to make me care when the bullets started hitting the soldiers.<br/><br/>To the film's credit, it does delve into some of the fears felt by the soldiers in a situation like this.  The film gets better as it goes along, as nighttime falls, we feel an eeriness.  Scott does an excellent job of actually taking us to this city with all of its chaos and fear.  But as with most of Scott's films, the technical brilliance is overshadowed by a curious lack of any connection to anything.  Even the impressive camerawork left me with only fleeting memories of memorable shots.  And I still can't think of one scene that I could call great in the movie (by contrast, Apocalypse Now is virtually one stringed after another).  Black Hawk Down, for all of its technical superiority, could have been so much more with just a shred of spine.  Instead, we have a film that is better than most of what Hollywood offers, but still very disappointing.<br/><br/>Rating: 58/100."

Through ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Armageddon"", and ""Black Hawk"" i sat and wondered, ""what the hell is happening?!"".<br/><br/>Now maybe crucial parts of the film have drifted over my head without me comprehending them, but it seems that in all these films the characters do something out of context and totally unmotivated (mini-gun crap from ""Armageddon"" or POW scene from ""Black Hawk""). And none of these films, not even ""Black Hawk"", were able to draw me in and make feel for the characters.<br/><br/>One thing that ""Black Hawk"" does have going for it, are the amazing action sequences. While they are bogged down by the meandering feel of the movie, the cinematography is excellent. You may be reminded of ""Gladiator""(also dir. by Ridley Scott) when the fighting starts to get intense.<br/><br/>So, if you can stomach the poisoness touch of Jerry Bruckheimer, your in for a real treat.

If you want a film that really challenges that idea of war, watch Thin Red Line. That brings in the intellectual aspect, considering philosophic questions of war.

They don't seem to understand, that this movie is not about American soldiers or even Rangers but rather 75th Ranger Regiment Rangers.  There is a big difference.  75th Rangers are the most Hoorah soldiers in the United States Army.  If anything, I think these movie Rangers are a little subdued compared to real 75th Rangers.<br/><br/>Second, people whine about the poor dead 1000 Somalis not being honored. Those fighters were basically gangsters supporting a warlord who used starvation, as a tool to control his people.  In any case, no American was recorded dragging a half-naked dead Somali thru the streets in ""celebration"", like the Somalis did to a dead American.  Yeah, they are real nice people - NOT !!!<br/><br/>Third, people complained about how confusing and surreal the movie was. That is one of the best parts of the movie.

","Pretty much in the `war is hell' category, Black Hawk Down seeks to outline what it was like for the American troops in Mogadishu Somalia in October 1993, a battle which saw the deaths of 18 Americans, the wounding of 70 Americans and the deaths of about 1000 Somalis. The Americans had been supporting a U.N. sponsored operation aimed at stopping the genocide occurring in Somalia.<br/><br/>                The Americans attacked a Somali warlord's stronghold attempting to capture two leaders of a group said to be withholding aid from the starving Somali population. They had been mounting such operations repeatedly over the preceeding months, activities which had left the Mogadishu population unhappy.<br/><br/>In the Americans go from their base at the Mogadishu airport into the Bakara Market area, a hornet's nest of militia fighters. The American troops were transported by four lightly armoured Black Hawk helicopters accompanied by an armoured car convoy and support copters. The idea was to nip in quickly late in the afternoon, grab the bad guys and be home for tea. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the Somalis were far better organised and armed than the Americans imagined. The Somalis were also overwhelmingly motivated against the Americans. The opposing clan militias amongst the lawless Mogadishu population had united against a common enemy.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down attempts to accurately recreate some aspects of the conflict, concentrating on the fraught situation in which the U.S.A. soldiers found themselves. It became a very bloody and dangerous fight for survival, a battle between a relatively few superiorly armed soldiers against an angry civilian population in a lawless country run by militias.<br/><br/>
The Americans got their noses very bruised and the experience has made them even more wary of street battles. Somalia is still a tragically lawless and impoverished area.<br/><br/>The film stumbles because of its attempt to be factual. The behind the series generals seem too calm in the context of the film and the story lines tend to blur particularly from a time elapsed point of view. The action seems repetitive but I suppose that getting 1000 people killed one or two at a time takes up some celluloid.<br/><br/>The events are bloodied but became distant rather than affecting, but then perhaps Black Hawk Down is less Hollywood than some in the genre. Black Hawk Down certainly suffers much less from the Stars And Stripes patriotism than some movies such as Behind Enemy Lines, but it does drag on a little as an entertainment.<br/><br/>                A riveting account of the battle can be found at http://inquirer.philly.com/packages/somalia/ .

","I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's, my favorite movie of all time is Gladiator so I suppose I was a bit spoiled when I went into this, expecting more personal drama than I ended up getting. On the kudos side, this is probably the most realistic war film I have ever seen in my life, even moreso than the opening of Saving Private Ryan. From the moment the first helicopter goes down it's pretty much a non-stop gun battle until the last ten minutes of the film. It easily sets a record for the most gunfire in any film I have ever seen in my life. <br/><br/>It's been said that this movie is more American propaganda, and to some extent I agree, but not entirely. The Americans in this film were by no means superhuman, and were shot up and killed and beaten and for the mojority of the film were running around with their tails between their legs just looking to get the hell out of there. Yes, at times this film was indeed pretty tightly wrapped in the American flag, but what movie isn't? I've personally come to expect that from most films now. They are, after all, paid for and made for Americans by and large. No, they didn't list the names of the Somali's killed, but then they probably didn't have the records available either. They knew the names of the Americans killed.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a pretty good film, but for me it was no Gladiator. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the film through the eyes of two or three main characters, because I found keeping track of all the characters in this a little too much. But if you like war films, this one is not to be missed."

","The presence of U.S. forces in Somalia was right and just. It's just that this particular operation was vastly flawed. Precautions that should have been taken were not, for the simple reason that is alluded to in the film: American arrogance. This mission was supposed to be easy. On paper, it all worked out. In and out in half an hour--wishful thinking, I'd say. Hindsight, though, is always 20/20 isn't it? Even as General Garrison (Sam Shephard) is telling his squad leaders not to underestimate this enemy, the sin has already been committed. By going in with no air cover, they've already got one hand tied behind their backs. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) tells his men, ¬ëthis is what we do, we're elite, remember that' to build confidence, but with no basis on which to make the statement.  The man had never seen combat before. Many of the hundred or so soldiers who drop into the middle of one of the most hostile, armed, dangerous spots on the planet at that time, Mogadishu, had likewise never seen combat. But this is what they are trained for. This kind of operation is what the elite armed forces live for. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction is what makes ""Black Hawk"" work as well as it does. The script, more often than not, gets in the way, making what could really have been a masterpiece, just a great film. The sometimes ridiculous dialogue you know no one would ever say, is the only evidence that they were in any hurry to finish. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, ¬ëhow in the world did he get THAT shot?' One of my favorites was what appeared to be done with a camera mounted on the front of one of the Black Hawks, pointed toward the back, filming as the copter flew through a dense cloud of smoke from tire fires in the streets below. Awesome.<br/><br/>I submit that Scott can't NOT make an intense film. Ask him for a women's film and he gives you ""Thelma and Louise"" or ""GI Jane."" Ask the man for an action movie and he gives you ""Gladiator."" I'm surprised it's taken him this long to make his first war film (GI Jane is a military movie, but by no means a war movie), but it's the kind of film we always knew he'd excel at once he finally got around to it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this mostly because it's a well-executed film in most every respect. If the Mogadishu operation hadn't been flubbed so badly, such a well-executed film wouldn't have been made about it. It's a war film the likes of which we've never seen. It's so well made that you never fear that the director is going to slip up. You're not just interested in what's going on--you're riveted.<br/><br/>The actual events are more horrifying than any script writer could come up with, or would even dare to write. In this case, though, something rare: you don't feel like you're being lied to here. You don't feel like anything is being glamorized. Scott presses on, compromising nothing. This is not an interpretation of what happened, but a dramatization. This happened too recently to do otherwise, keeping in mind the families of the dead. I will say, though, that much seems to be left up in the air at the end. Despite Garrison's revised initiative, the rangers killed in the second helicopter crash were left behind. We're left wondering exactly how those bodies are eventually recovered. Maybe this is the film's way of saying ¬ëthis is as much as I'm going to tell you. If you want to know more, look for yourself.' The details of the operation are well documented by news organizations and in Mark Bowden's book. Grade:A-"

This is a case where the truth is harrowing, but the film version simply isn't. And the reality behind the film just isn't enough to make it a good film, as one ought to know.<br/><br/>First of all: haven't we seen enough of this sort of American patriotism in films? Yes, these men might be heroes, but the way they're being depicted in BHD simply doesn't seem realistic. Add to that a soundtrack that is simply so inappropriate and pompous at times and you get the feeling that you are actually watching a movie and not something that really happened. Nothing wrong with that...if that's what you're trying to sell it for.<br/><br/>Second, the dialogue, which is simply stupid. Are these guys really the macho types they're being presented as? Do they utter the stupid phrases you get to hear in this film? For their sake: I hope not. This film has got nothing of the intelligence and philosophy that a film like Saving Private Ryan for example did have. The actors too aren't really top-class. No Tom Hanks in this movie. Even Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore (who was in SPR too!) don't offer the performances you'd expect them to deliver. And Sam Shepard hasn't been in too many good movies lately too. Another thing is the storyline, which seems to be missing. The film consists of one long shooting, and that's it. Why not make more out of the obvious despair and fear these soldiers must have experienced? Finally, in the closing scenes, mention is made of the fact that 19 U.S. soldiers were killed...together with over 1,000 Somalis. This is presented as nothing more than a footnote, but there's hardly a sign of a critical approach to the intervention of the U.S., nor do we get any motivations. And can't we say after all that, due to this intervention, which was supposed to be almost bloodless, the U.S. made things even worse? 19 soldiers, yes, but what about the 1,000 Somalis, who are being depicted as savages, who kill each other and anyone who tries to break them up? The facts are pretty actual nowadays, but the situation in Afghanistan (or the attitude of president Bush)clearly shows that nothing is changed after the events in New York. And this film, more macho behaviour than reality, doesn't help much either. I gave this film a ""6"", but when I think about it, that seems to be far too much for the actual result. As I said, the subject alone isn't nearly enough to make up for the shortcomings in the making of the film. They should've known better..."

","WOW!  I can't imagine what it took to make this film.  It was so realistic! It is definitely an impressive accomplishment director Ridley Scott. The fighting scenes were very believable.   I am guessing that they actually filmed it on location in Somalia, if not, then it is an amazing recreation. Nearly the whole movie is action from the failed 1993 mission.  `Black Hawk' is definitely one of the best-recreated battles of all time.  The action is well filmed. <br/><br/>`Black Hawk' is about a failed mission, so it is somewhat critical of our military.  The movie portrays Major General William Garrison, played by Sam Shepard, somewhat negatively.  Obviously, it was his plan that failed and cost our soldiers' lives.  The movie also implies that the United States would have been better prepared had they notified the Pakistani military of the raid, or had General Garrison had a contingency plan in place to rescue the troops if they came upon enemy fire.  The troops were trapped in the hostile zone, and they had to wait for hours before being rescued.  They underestimated the enemy and had poor communication while in battle, which spelled disaster for the U.S. military.  However, the men that fought are truly heroes.  The soldiers' `don't leave anyone behind' attitude is something to respect and admire. <br/><br/>I did have some minor problems with the movie.  While all of the actors gave great performances, the script was corny at times.  For example, Ewan McGregor's character, Specialist Danny Grimes, kept talking about making coffee throughout the whole movie, as sort of a running gag.  The script was straight forward, `in battle' dialogue.   For example, there was the usual dialogue about how a soldier should not question an order; he should just follow the orders. <br/><br/>Another thing that annoyed me about the movie was the use of many of the same actors from other war movies.  It was like watching all of the other movies all together, and made ""Black Hawk"" less distinct.  Josh Hartnet, as young Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, was in Pearl Harbor as well.  Hartnet was actually very good in Black Hawk.  And there are two other lesser-known actors that you will recognize from Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>Tom Sizemore, who plays Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight, was also in Pearl Harbor as well as Saving Private Ryan.  Sizemore plays the ultimate macho-man. Somehow he is never concerned about any of the thousands of Somalis that are shooting at him.  While the rest of the soldiers are taking cover and running, he never ducks or tries to get out of the way.  And, of course, they never manage to shoot him.  Well, he does get grazed on his neck. I was excited to see Australian actor Eric Bana.  Bana plays Sergeant 1st Class Norm ""Hoot"" Hooten. He is a tough guy, hero type that is a fearless, yet humble, soldier.  Bana is a rising star that is destined to be a star, like fellow countryman Russell Crowe.  Bana was in ""Chopper"" last year, which was a good movie about infamous serial killer, Mark 'Chopper' Read. Bana was great as 'Chopper', and I was pleasantly surprised with his performance in Black Hawk. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is a serious `guy' movie with some awesome fighting scenes, and it makes our guys look like heroes, despite failing to accomplish their objective.  It is well worth the 143 minutes. 8 of 10"

","'Black Hawk Down', as with 'Hannibal', is extremely well-made. But do Ridley Scott's camera techniques and the advantages of digital-editing etc. make up for this hollow piece of American propaganda?...<br/><br/>That Scott uses US-military advisors says it all. How can Scott go on record as saying he was ""without politics""? A similar comment is made by one of the faceless, characterless soldiers in the film- if you are without politics when it comes down to the actualities of confrontation- then why are you wearing a US-uniform and obeying US-directives? The film is terribly one-sided, the Somalians etc all go down in single bursts of fire- like a video game, CNN footage of smart-bombs and 'Total Recall'. The Americans die in lots of body horror gore, or medical pornography- such as the search for an arterial vein. One soldier has the bottom part of his body blown to smithereens, but still has time to say g'bye to his wife & kids, like a good American. Ditto the lingering death of the arterial bleeding guy (sorry, the characters aren't distinguished- apart from Euan McGregor's, who likes coffee)- who's final words are to his mother, to let her know he fougt as best as he could. This makes death into a banal, naive act- you may as well watch 40's WWII films or 'The Green Berets'.Not being American,I can't play the victim card and buy into the good-feeling offerred by jingoism. Why does the film want me to pretend to be naive & simplistic about the act of war? As with 'Behind Enemy Lines' & 'Collatoral Damage' we see the exploitation/meeting of mannichean demand post September 11th...That the 1000 or so Somalians are sidelined for the 18 dead Americans says it all- let's not forget the Americans were arming Sayid (the Yanks like to arm people like Noriega, Pol Pot, Bin Laden, those who committed the massacre in Srebeniza)at a point where he was losing power and that the Americans bombed peace talks between the warring factions, killing 54 people and uniting the Somalians against them in the process...This film is bizarre to watch in the light of recent anti-war films like 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Three Kings'. Moreso when you consider the anti-war sentiments of 'The Deer Hunter', 'Catch 22', 'MASH', 'Apocalypse Now!', 'Coming Home', 'Born on the 4th of July', 'Platoon', 'Salvador' etc. Or Kubrick's depiction of the machine-like Marine mentality in 'Full Metal Jacket'- which uses his blacker than any comedy. 'Black Hawk Down' expects us to take this tale of good-evil seriously; that the 1993 mission was in fact some sort of success? This film shares simplistic aspirations towards war, with the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List'. This may be positive towards getting an audience- but is dishonest to the actualities of war. This film is dangerous and insulting- do we really believe the versimiltude of on-screen carnage suggests anything relating to a truth? The film this most resembles, though without the ironic-subversive underscore, is 'Rambo: First Blood Part II'. John Rambo asks his mentor, ""Do we get to win this time?"". The answer with this film is a simple, forceful, with us or against us, ""Yes Son!""."

Your long-range fire-support options are limited severely by the terrain, the main guns on your tanks are all but useless, and your armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambush in the tight, narrow streets, where an enemy can rain fire down on their weakest points.  Cities are also full of people who don't want anything to do with the war, whom you have to be careful not to kill, even if your enemy displays no such compunction.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's visceral, intense movie ""Black Hawk Down"" gives us a ground and air view of the worst urban fighting encountered by American troops since Hue City.  As the movie begins, U.S. Army troops in Somalia are attempting to crash a party and grab Mohammed Farah Aidid, the warlord who ruled the port city of Mogadishu (called ""the Mog"" or ""the 'Dish"" by American grunts, who nickname everything as a matter of course, including each other).  What is supposed to be a quick mission turns into a desperate battle that lasts through the night, as two Blackhawk helicopters are shot down and the security elements are surrounded by Aidid's street-gang-cum-militia, laden with AKs, RPGs, and a supply of the narcotic leaf ""khat.""<br/><br/>The movie is first and foremost a battle picture, and Scott has pared down most other details.  Policy wonks are sure to be disappointed, as there is little discussion of the politics of the U.S. intervention in Somalia, or of the decisions affecting and affected by the outcome of the battle.  There is no pondering about whether the mission was right or wrong, or what could have been done about Somalia.  What info we get on the Somali civil war is relayed in a few short screen blurbs at the beginning.  There is only a brief reference to the decision by Clinton's then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin not to authorize the use of armored forces in support.  If that is the sort of thing you like, read Mark Bowden's book.  The movie is more concerned with covering fire, roadblocks, and hot brass sliding down the collar of your flak jacket.<br/><br/>And that is all to the better.  What Scott has done in foregoing big-picture issues is deliver a focused and relentless depiction of combat, complete and convincing in its details: rifle slings jury-rigged with tape and 550 cord, spray-painted sniper rigs, sweat, blood, and agony.  The picture is full of small memorable moments, too many to count, and what philosophical points it makes (mostly about the sometimes heartbreaking ingenuousness of American GIs) are subtle and easily missed.  There aren't a lot of director's tricks (not that you notice anyhow), including, oddly, less of the sped-up action sequences Scott loved so much in ""Gladiator"".<br/><br/>There are inherent difficulties associated with war movies; it can be difficult to tell the characters apart, or know exactly what each group is trying to accomplish, but Scott manages this aspect surprisingly well (for viewers, being ex-military or reading the book will help a great deal). The movie's look works to its advantage as well, making the city (Rabat, Morocco, in the role of Mogadishu) look dangerous in grim, spooky night and harsh, merciless daylight.  The movie also contains some of the most eerily beautiful shots of helicopters in formation since ""Apocalypse Now.""<br/><br/>Battle movies tend to focus on a great many small stories.  Josh Hartnett's Sgt. Eversmann is the nominal protagonist, but we do not follow him all the time, or even most of the time.  As a result, we do not get a lot of insight into the particular characters.  In early scenes, they are sketched rather than drawn: there's the untested kid, the office hack who wants to prove himself, tension between the straight-laced brass (Jason Isaacs, last seen as the sadistic British Dragoon in ""The Patriot"") and the free-wheeling special operators, etc.  The characters are given brief moments in which to establish themselves, and we're off.  Some of these work better than others; Hartnett's dialogue establishing him as an ""idealist"" is especially clumsy and unconvincing.  The actors are no slouches, and there are capable performances all around, but the event is the real story here.<br/><br/>You could knock this movie for its lack of larger context, for not examining bigger issues, for not having deeper dialogue, but these criticisms are not exactly fair.  ""Black Hawk Down"" is intended to give us a glimpse of something that happened, something horrible and heroic, and to give us some idea of what it was like to live through it (or not live through it).  All most people remember of the battle of Mogadishu was the dead stripped American pilot, dragged by a truck while the people we thought we were helping spit on him.  This movie shows us the insides of an event we thought we understood well enough, and shows us that there can be great valor even in defeat.  When I was in infantry school, I knew a guy who was former Army, a member of the same Ranger unit that got trapped in Mogadishu.  He was ribbed once about ""losing the fight"", and he exploded.  Nobody understood what happened, he said.  Nobody knew the real story.<br/><br/>Here's to you, Wickstrom.  They know now."

","After the serial killer panto shambles that was Hannibal Ridley Scott returns to form with Black Hawk Down, a visually spectacular if morally redundant 'account' of a botched mission into war torn Somalia. There is a small attempt to put the mission into some kind of political context with an extended prologue but this is really just an old-fashioned action war movie & should be treated as such. Indeed for all Ridleys protestations that he has made an anti-war film this is a movie about big guns, explosions & ""never leave a man behind!"" Not so much a series of set-pieces more one elongated action scene which doesn't quit. <br/><br/>Despite its avoidance of politics what this film does convey is the sheer intensity & relentlessness of battle much like the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Unlike Spielbergs movie however we don't really care for the individuals under fire here & this is the films major flaw. But this film was never going to be about character development. Scott brings all his talents as a visual director to the conflict the soldiers find themselves in here with helicopters crashing, bullets flying & buildings exploding all around you. Unfortunately the score is strictly  by the numbers.<br/><br/>
As for the acting? Well we have passable performances from the majority with only the two Ewans standing out, Bremner for the right reasons & McGregor for his awful performance. The rest of the cast suffer amongst all the action & you really can't tell who is who. <br/><br/>Overall this film is a bit of a guilty pleasure, turning a very recent & dubious military manouevre into an action movie. Then again its a bit naive to expect Hollywood blockbusters to explore the political background to any conflict."

","Black Hawk Down could easily have devolved into a flag-waving Rambo-type affair very easily. All the elements are there: Good-looking, young, white American soldiers, faceless black Muslim enemies, a Vietnam-like setting, hyper-violent film-making, a young idealist Sergeant, an experienced heroic Colonel, a stern General, etc. One can imagine the damage that would have been done to this story in the hands of the wrong production team (say, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay instead of Jerry Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott).<br/><br/>Like all *great* war movies, and most war movies in general, Black Hawk Down is an anti-war film. It does this by telling only one overall story: the true story of these soldiers in a fight against their ""assigned"" enemy. Whether the fight is just, or necessary, is basically irrelevant to the story. For what reasons things go awry is also generally unimportant. The fight is shown form the perspective of the American soldier, leading to a `good against bad' conflict. Within the American ranks, there are no `good' or `bad' players. Mistakes are made, to be sure, but there is no intent behind it. What matters is the ferocious fight the characters find themselves in and what it feels like to face that terror.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that Black Hawk Down is a great war film, but it can pack an emotional wallop on the order of All Quiet On the Western Front and Platoon, and its action sequences are as realistic and direct as those from Saving Private Ryan. If you saw it and didn't like it, reconsider why not, as you are depriving yourself of a powerful experience."

","This is a very good movie -- however it is not as great of a movie as professional film critics have been said.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book ahead of time, this film may appear very, very disjointed and chaotic.<br/><br/>There are very good reasons for this:<br/><br/>1. The film depicts battle - which is always chaotic.<br/><br/>I like the fact that it is not quite as gorey and graphic in its depiction of violence as either GLADIATOR or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN were. The filmmakers made it accurately depict the quick horror of combat -- but they did not have long, lingering shots intended to gross you out and make you throw up.<br/><br/>2. The film correctly attributes events and comments to the actual different people who did and said these things.<br/><br/>There are so many characters, that there is simply not enough time for the audience to get to know and bond with any single particular character.<br/><br/>These hundred-odd soldiers from Delta, US Navy Seals, US Army Airborne Rangers, and the other US service branches who were all involved were basically all equally brave, and equally heroic.<br/><br/>If they had generallized more so the audience could bond with a particular character, they would have done a gross disservice to the men who fought in this battle.<br/><br/>Points of Note:<br/><br/>1. Powerful, visual cinematographic imagery, very akin to what Ridley Scott did in music and picture for GLADIATOR.<br/><br/>2. Accurate depiction of the very unusual issues in Somalia.<br/><br/>The Somali civilians tended to RUN DIRECTLY TOWARDS gunfire and fire fights, rather than running away to escape.<br/><br/>
Even Civilian men, women and children were highly politically motivated and hostile to foreigners -- and just as apt to pick<br/><br/>up a weapon off a dead man and start firing as they were to be<br/><br/>used as a human shield by the Somali militia.<br/><br/>It was impossible for the American serviceman to know for sure what someone was going to do.  The American soldier was left<br/><br/>with the very deadly and rapid choice of having to shoot now,<br/><br/>or risk getting killed along with his fellow soldiers in moments.<br/><br/>Anyone who was ever in Vietnam would recognize the double horror here.  Shoot, and maybe screw something up on an international scale, or don't shoot and get killed with all of your unit.<br/><br/>The battle was indeed won, the mission was accomplished, and the cause  of kidnapping Clan Warlord terrorists who were murdering hundreds of thousands of Somalis by confiscating and withholding food from their fellow countrymen, was indeed a just and good cause.<br/><br/>The war, however, was lost by the State Department and the politicians -- but it was a loss for both the US and Somalia.  The battle made America and the international community realize that there was no economic justification for restoring peace and food in Somalia. It was cheaper and easier to let the Somalis kill each other.  By rebelling against all foreigners, the Somalis killed off their last hope of any international hope of foreign investment and foreign aid to rebuild a nation blasted back into a post-apocalyptic stone age."

"katz46725","Null","0","0","6 February 2002"," How the film highlights current situations
","I think this is a brilliant film, which brings the realities of war to people who haven't experienced it first hand.  Although it's a blockbuster, it manages to avoid appearing artificial or glamorous.  As it was based on an actual event, it makes people think about what has gone on, and is going on, in the world around us.  After the events of last September, many people were hoping for, and expecting, the quick capture or elimination of the person responsible.  However, it took four years before the man they were after in the film was killed, which makes me wonder how long the current situation is going to go on for, and how many soldiers and civilians will suffer like those in the film. The film depicts an event which happened almost ten years ago, yet similar events still go on today.  If you are looking for an escapist film, then this is not for you.  If, however, you want to see ordinary people showing extreme loyalty, courage and strength of character, when faced with almost certain pain, injury, and even death, then go and see this film. After seeing this film, I feel that the soldiers who faced and are facing these situations in real life should not be forgotten, as they are the real heroes. They are the ones who keep returning to the action, despite any injuries or risk to themselves, in order to get their job done, whether that job is to capture enemies, rescue hostages or stranded soldiers, to protect civilians, or to take out enemy bases (not all of this happens in the film, so don't think I'm telling you the whole plot).  They may not have strong political views, but their fierce loyalty and courage means that they will fight all the way for what they believe in.  This film emphasizes this point, but the message must not be lost just because it is actors we see on the screen, and not the real thing."

And last but not least it's not about to tell if U.S. aim at intervening there was truly humanitarian or moved by economical or political or strategical purposes. This movie is about war. War that could happen in any part of the world. As one of main characters says in the end (I cannot recall the exact words): if you are asked why you are in this war you may answer that you are here because of the guy by your side. Which means that this movie is also and above all about friendship, comradeship and solidarity during fighting. In fact the most moving moments of the movie are those when those guys tried to help wounded or dying comrades under heavy fire with total abnegation and at risk of their own lives. Technically it's an almost perfect movie, one of the 5 or 6 best war movies ever made. All the scenes are extremely realistic and true in every detail and you feel yourself moving around those streets of a Somali city and almost taking part in the fighting yourself since you are so close to those men that you can almost touch them and feel their breaths.

","Move over Speilberg! Watch out below Cameron! One of the best war movies ever made is easily Ridley Scott's best movie ever, topping even Gladiator. All hail Ridley Scott, the new king of the world. This movie is realistic, and intense. Some may find the film a little bit too violent, but hey, war is not a walk in the park. Basically, the whole 2 hours of this movie plays like the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. If you were easily disturbed by those scenes, then this film is definately not for you.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of a US Black Hawk that was shot down in Somalia during 1993. The rest of the film is basically a rescue operation to get those men out of the dangerous situation that they are in.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is great. The only thing that really bothered me was Tom Sizemore's character. We see him walking around while bullets fly around him, and he does not seem fazed at all. Also, there is the scene in the Hummer, where he gets shot in the neck, and is still able to steer the Hummer with one hand, and hold the wound in his neck with the other.<br/><br/>
One other beef that I had with this movie is the characters. Alot of the time was spent on the war scenes, and there was no character introduction. Therefore, you really can not connect with the charcters in the film. If you like to get in touch with the characters in the film, I suggest watching a film like Platoon rather than this. I do believe however, that Scott was trying to show us the horror of modern warfare, which he does very well.<br/><br/>Like I stated above, it is rather violent. However, that is war. You will not see anything that they do not show on the nightly news. However, this is Hollywood. If you are desensitized to violence, check it out. It is definately Ridley Scott's best film to date. Hopefully, the man will win an Oscar for this film. He definately deserves one."
"squee420","Null","0","0","4 February 2002"," BlackHawk Down: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (some spoilers)
","First of all, I would like to point out something to all those who have said that the only reason Black Hawk Down was made was to exploit the resurgence of patriotism in America, and that is this: Movies take a hell of a lot longer than four months to create. Black Hawk Down was already in development long before Sept. 11. If you want to rail against the exploitation of patriotism, get your facts straight first.<br/><br/>That said, I thought the movie was well-executed, walking the line between action and drama reasonably well. There were only a few moments that I felt really sacrificed the tragic reality of the events for Hollywood action: one was the ""play-deaf-jokes-for-laughs"" treatment of Ewen Bremner's character, the other was the killing of the Big Bad Somali Militiaman with the hijacked cannon. The first incident takes a character based on a real-life Army Ranger fighting for his life while his friends and squad-mates die and treating him as an excuse for a cheap laugh, something I think is in very questionable taste. The other instance was just too much of a Bruckheimer moment for such a serious film. You could almost hear Nicolas Cage yelling ""How do ya like how that s**t works?"" (Watch ""The Rock"" if you don't understand)<br/><br/>The movie's strong points, though, more than made up for these occasional slips into Hollywood cliche. The scene of the two Delta Force snipers trying in vain to hold off the militia was one of the most powerful scenes in the film, made all the more tragic by the knowledge of their eventual fate. For those who don't know, they were among the men whose bodies were dragged through the streets for everyone to watch on CNN.<br/><br/>Overall, though the film was powerful in its depiction of close-quarters urban warfare, I left the theater feeling strangely empty. These men were put into a poorly-planned mission with inadequate backup, and forced into a firefight against a far-larger army. The fact that any of them survived is truly amazing. But the movie just left me feeling unfulfilled. I think this is largely due to the film's ending. For a movie whose tagline is ""Leave No Man Behind,"" I question the decision to leave the story of the last pilot's release as two lines of text just before the credits. I wanted to see him coming home, not just read about it as the credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>As a final word, one of the most compelling things I have read or heard about the actual events is the reaction of those who survived. Most have no anger about the mission, or of being put into that situation. The anger comes over the final outcome: the withdrawal of troops from Somalia. The overwhelming question on the minds of the survivors is, ""Why was the U.S. involved, if we weren't willing to stay until our mission was achieved?"" By pulling out of Somalia, we made the deaths of those soldiers meaningless. They died for nothing, because we didn't stay until the goals of the military intervention were achieved. After we left, Somalis were still starving, Aidid was still in power, and the clan wars were still raging on. The only difference was that thousands more people were dead.<br/><br/>
You can debate about whether we should have been there in the first place, but once we committed to battle, we owed it to those soldiers to make their sacrifices achieve something. And that is an aspect of the story I wish had been stressed more in the film."
"RJBose","8","0","0","4 February 2002"," A Lot of Action, But Where's the Context?
","""Blackhawk Down"" has now been the top grossing film in the USA for the past three weeks.  Quite apparently there are themes, or visualizations which resonate with the American population, as our troops are in action at this moment in Afghanistan.  Absent the very real daily heroics in Southwest Asia reported in newspapers and on television to the US population, I do not think Blakhawk Down would have been so successful.  It is a well-made movie which strives for (and succeeds in) authenticity, but it is not, in my opinion a ""great movie"" or would stand as such on its own in different circumstances.<br/><br/>I think that for Americans, (including myself), and particularly in light of the military tactics employed with such success against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, the frustration of watching the dire situation of the Army Rangers and Special Operations soldiers stranded and surrounded after the ambush is exacerbated by the knowledge that what was done in Khandahar this Winter could just as easily been done in Mogadishu ten years ago .  This is a major part of the story which is essentially ignored by the movie.  Another is any real mention of the planning and motivation of the ""warlord"" forces who ambushed the US troops and were trying to kill them.  A lengthy synopsis of the history of African politics or essay on international affairs may not be not necessary, but some type of context is needed as we watch the firefights and carnage.<br/><br/>A perfunctory set-up of the situation in Somalia is given at the beginning of the film.  There is some attempt to explore the military culture of the US soldiers, but this too is far too abbreviated; some distinction is made between Rangers and the Delta force personnel, but no explanation is forthcoming.  (Why could a Delta Sergeant speak so dismissively to a Ranger Colonel in the mess line?).  The fact that the Army Rangers are themselves a very elite unit is not emphasized, and I do not think the general public (even one now following the news from Afghanistan) knows the real distinctions between regular soldiers, airborne soldiers, airborne Rangers and Special Forces.  The point is that these men represented the very best of the US Army in terms of training and motivation.  The Delta personnel, the absolute best of the best, consider themselves answerable to none but their own (also shown later in the film).<br/><br/>As I mentioned, no effort is made to illuminate the thinking of the Americans' antagonists or to explain their actions.  In fact, the Somalis in question had studied Rangers rappelling down from Blackhawk helicopters, and so knew when best to strike.  The US raiding party was ambushed, and then cut off, while efforts were made to extract them.  This is the heart of the movie, and it is done very well: pinned down, the US soldiers, vastly outnumbered and outgunned, try to cope with their situation and await rescue while surrounded by heavily armed ""militia"" indistinguishable from the general population.  Unlike many movies, the heroics shown were quite real: it really did happen that way (there is a Documentary on the ambush now on the History Channel).  Why, however, was this ambush undertaken by the Somalis?  What did they hope to gain?  Why was a prisoner taken and later released?  What was the reaction of the rest of the population?<br/><br/>
For an American viewer, other questions pose themselves more urgently: Where were the fighter-bombers?  Where were the Cobra gunships?  Where were the US reinforcements?  President Clinton had been quite specific in limiting the American military presence, completely ignoring the manpower and equipment requirements stipulated by the officers in charge of the Somalia expedition. There were no US forces, or adequate airpower or armor to face that contingency (which the Somalis knew).  This deserved some mention or explanation in the film (but then again, Hollywood loves Slick Willy and won't do him wrong).  The ignominious withdrawl of the US troops after the ambush ordered by Clinton was a major factor in the renewed interest in attacking Americans and American interests on the part of adversaries around the globe, strengthening the belief that American casualties will end any American international involvement- a belief quoted very enthusiastically recently by those espousing a ""holy war"" against the US.<br/><br/>We see what happened, but we don't know why. In the end, ""Blackhawk Down"" provides an interesting vignette of soldiers in action, and is horrifying realistic in its portrayal of the gore of combat, but raises far more questions then it answers, and these are answers that the movie's viewers deserve to be told."

","Black Hawk Down is the best war movie and one of the best overall movies I've ever seen. This movie was excellent. Afterwards it leaves you with a bitter-sweet feeling: you've just seen American soldiers get beat up, torn apart and killed (not to mention the hundreds of Somalians that get killed), but the stories of all the individual soldiers make you feel good. Also, the American soldiers going through this are all in their late teens and early twenties. You get the idea from the movie that these were all people who signed up for the army to get some adventure, then you have to see them all go through hell. The greatest parts of this movie, is seeing all the young Americans get through all that they just went through and how they all overcome everything. That's what I really enjoyed besides all the action in this movie (which was really good too), such as seeing Brad Thomas (Tac Fitzgerald) say that he's afraid to go back out into the fight and he just doesn't want to go, then seeing Jeff Struecker (Brian Van Holt) tell him not to be afraid and that they need him and so on, and Thomas then decides he'll go and catches up with the departing humvees. Parts like that really made the movie good.<br/><br/>The cast was also really good too. I thought Josh Hartnett was great in this movie. He plays Matt Eversmann, another young soldier who was just given command of his own chalk (squad of men) right before their raid in Mogadishu. I also thought Ewan McGregor was good as the company clerk who has an obsession with coffee. Ewen Bremner and Tom Hardy provide the comic relief (those two get separated from their chalk and then roam the city by themselves looking for people). Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard and William Fichtner all did good too. My favorite character was Norm ""Hoot"" Hooten (Eric Bana). I thought Eric Bana did an excellent job in this movie, playing the fearless and really cool Norm Hooten. He was really fun to watch.<br/><br/>So all in all, this movie was great. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, you'll love Black Hawk Down. I liked Saving Private Ryan because of the characters in that movie, and I liked Pearl Harbor because of the exciting ending, but I liked Black Hawk Down for the whole thing. It is very realistic and is a great story with a great ending. A 10 out of 10."

BHD was full of action and great acting for pretty much the entire length of film. Despite changing its pace at times it never became slow enough for you to take you eyes of the screen and look at the girls coming back from the toilets! The action scenes were not simply placed there to look good or to make characters look super hard e.g. Arnold type action! Instead they blended with the films gripping plot, this could not have been thought up by a film writer. Lets face it who would think of sending a convoy to a crash site, lose men on the way there, only to have to turn around and return to base whilst losing more men! Were this not based on true events they would have made it and been all been hero's.<br/><br/>Anyway back to my some people comment. When the film ends we are given details about facts and the names of the characters in the film , as well as some narration from one of the characters. Yet it appears that to some people as soon as the shooting has stopped its time to pick up their coat, stand in the way of others and leave?! What ?! How small are there minds? Why watch a film and not stay 1 more minute to see all of it!? I HATE THEM! They are happy to watch a story about these people die but don't care who they are. It shows no respect and no emotion. Therefore a great film wasted on such small minds.<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>Pete."

"nowonmai42","Null","0","0","3 February 2002"," A superb battle depiction that is too stupid or afraid to explore any context
","Black Hawk Down<br/><br/>Sergeant 1st Class Norm ""Hoot"" Hooten (Eric Bana) won't say anything to people who ask him why he's a soldier, why he continues to hurl himself into the chaos of battle after battle. `They won't understand,' he tells Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett). It's an interesting exchange that occurs toward the end of `Black Hawk Down,' one that best describes the progenitors of this empty exercise in violent imagery. Director Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's attempt to bring in the Oscar bling-bling that Scott missed out on with `Gladiator' (rightfully so), and of which Bruckheimer has never been within spitting distance is, while technically superb, a thoughtless and numbing account of the disastrous 1993 US incursion into Somalia that ignores all the difficult and pressing questions the incident exposed. It's easy to be sucked in by the film's simplified account of the situation that led to the US raid of a Mogadishu marketplace. Title cards during the opening credits inform us that warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid was intercepting food shipments to the starving population, and that the US was attempting to round up Aidid and other prominent members of his militia. With this stripped-down scenario in place, `Black Hawk Down' feels free to spend the next two hours inside the firefight that that ensued when the American Delta and Ranger commandos found themselves surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned by a hostile crowd. This lengthy second act is, to be fair, a stunning depiction of a supremely disorienting operation. Taking his cues from Steven Spielberg's re-enactment of D-day in `Saving Private Ryan,' Scott inserts his cameras directly into the battle, bombarding us with hostile action from all directions. He intercuts this with satellite and helicopter views of the battlefield, allowing us to maintain a sense of the broader conflict as we're consumed within it. It's an extraordinarily effective and controlled depiction of an operation that goes wrong almost as soon as it begins. When the Black Hawk helicopters that are supposed to be providing cover fire and monitoring the situation from above start getting hit by Somali rockets, the focus turns from grabbing Aidid and his men to covering the crash sites and evacuating casualties. Yet for all its brutal depictions of this mess, this battle is all that `Black Hawk Down' amounts to. All it needs us to know is that the black guys in ragged clothes are `hostiles.' But why would thousands of Somalis be willing to take up arms against American soldiers? Why would they fight on behalf of a warlord who is starving them? And given the absolute indifference by the US and the rest of the international community to so many other humanitarian crises, why did the US care about Aidid in particular? Did these American soldiers really think they were going into battle to relieve the suffering of the Somalis, as Eversmann opines near the beginning? How could the brass have so badly misjudged the likely resistance they would encounter? I have my ideas, but `Black Hawk Down' either doesn't, or doesn't care to share them. Scott is too preoccupied with reminding us how heroic these Americans are. They were certainly brave, and the fact that they escaped with as few deaths as they did (19) is remarkable. But are they really heroic? There is hardly a mention of Somali casualties - I was quite surprised that the film even deemed it fit to mention in its closing credits (1000 Somalis died in the battle). And there is nary a mention of the misery and destruction left behind by it all, undoubtedly exacerbated by the fact that Aidid lived to rule Mogadishu for another two years before he was killed. `Black Hawk Down' doesn't care about any of these more interesting tangents. It's like taking a trans-Atlantic flight on Virgin Airlines; you're wowed for an hour or so by all the bells and whistles before you realize that you're bored, and that your ass is more numb than a third-string quarterback's in January. It has nothing to say about this incident, other than that it happened, and that it was very bad. Is this really enough reason to have made it in the first place?"
"RangeR BoB","Null","0","0","2 February 2002"," excellent adaptation of the book, really packs a punch.
","I have read this book and was wondering how well Hollywood could translate it to the screen.  The book is VERY well written and is one of the better documented and researched books on modern warfare. Rather than just a historical summary, Mark Bowden went out and talked to many of the soldiers who took part in these raids in Mogadishu in '93.<br/><br/>I had some fears because this was a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and with films like Con Air and the remake of ""Gone in 60 seconds"" to his credit, he is a bit spotty at best.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, who occasionally misses (1492) he mostly hits with his many gritty portrayals of people in tough places.  He shot the film in Morocco, but one could easily believe that you were in ""The Mog"".  The utter depravity and destruction of years of civil war were shown out in the rusted hulks of cars and the debris from destroyed buildings throughout the streets.<br/><br/>Some fast facts:  Somalia had no government any longer, and 300,000 people died of hunger while rival warlords fought over the port of Mogadishu.  One leader, Mohammed Farrah Aidid took control of the port area and stole all of the UN food shipments.  In a starving nation, food is power and hunger is a weapon.  The US and the UN sent in forces in late 92 to try and restore order and the flow of food.  When the Marines drove onto the beach in their amphibious assault vehicles, CNN was there with bright floodlights to capture the action.  The Marines eventually left, and the gangs started preying on the UN troops, with the slaughter of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers being the final straw.  The US sent back in Delta Force and Ranger units, with the aim to capture as many Somali warlords and their lieutenants as they could.<br/><br/>The film opens up with scenes of the horror of the place, and how the deprivations of the people by the warlords gangs were being delegated to the UN to solve.  Our Rangers were ordered to stand by and watch as civilians are slaughtered by Aidid's henchmen.  The Rangers were only allowed to perform their operations.  Meanwhile our leadership there was planning a raid to capture many of Aidid's top men.<br/><br/>The raid begins, and things quickly go to hell.  It was believed that the helicopters were relatively safe because any weapon large enough to bring one down would be spotted, and the most common large weapon, the Soviet Rocket Propelled Grenade, or RPG, couldn't be fired up at the choppers, because the rocket blast from firing would severly burn the firer. The Somalis were able to adapt a sheet of tin to re-aim the back blast so that the firer would not immolate himself in his attempt to shoot the chopper, and the Somalis RPG teams hid the weapon, rockets, and blast chute under their clothes until ready to fire.  The result is choppers down, and a thirty minute raid becomes a very long affair.<br/><br/>The film is a very good adaptation of what that kind of combat was like, as seen through the interviews of Mark Bowden.  You see the confusion of the men trying to navigate through the narrow and confusing streets of Mogadishu.  You see the horror of close urban fighting (the very fighting we avoided by stopping when we did in Iraq).  There is heroism and loss.  Somehow, this film brings off the big budget stars and high value explosions without succumbing the the typical Hollywood tearjerking emotionalism.  There are a couple monologues, but they are expressed from both sides, Somali and American on why they were there and what they hoped to achieve.<br/><br/>Its my opinion, shared by many, that the US went too far in trying to be ""kinder and gentler"" in this affair.  President Clinton would not allow us to send any armor or heavy equipment over there, so the most we had to use against the Somalis were Kevlar reinforced hard top HMMWVs (Hum-vees) and 2 1/2 ton trucks, which were unarmored.  The consequences of those thin skinned vehicles going up against trucks equipped with heavy machine-guns and small cannon were disastrous.  Clinton also vetoed the use of powerful suppressive fire weapons such as the AC-130 Spectre gunship.  We had to rely on the UN for supporting armor or heavy vehicles, and with that came politicking and endless delays, which were only solved when we threatened to take the vehicles and put American crews in them.  The fact that the Italian peacekeeping soldiers were openly passing information to the Somalis before each American raid didn't help their success.<br/><br/>It is no small irony that the very president who fled our country rather than serve it in Vietnam repeated the very same mistakes by trying to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the Somali while hamstringing the military who's job it was to make this happen.<br/><br/>This was a brutal, awful place that the UN tried to restore a bit of order to so they could try and keep millions of people from starving.  I don't know what kind of real solution you can achieve when life is cheap, power comes from the barrel of a gun, and the leaders could care less how many of their own people starve.  In the end, those with the guns and food are still the ones running the country.  What a terrible waste.<br/><br/>RangeR ""I mourn the dead and wounded from that day"" BoB"

","That millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, tyranny, suppression, discrimination and worse is apparent to anyone who even only occasionally turns on the 6:00 news.  Heinous crimes and atrocities are committed daily in third world countries, and even in the most highly developed and civilized countries, as we all know only too well in the wake of September 11.  And the frustration, guilt and despair evoked by the accounts of such things can induce a sense of helplessness that is immeasurable.  Filmmakers here have chosen one especially significant incident from among the many on which to elaborate, and which puts the plight of those less fortunate into succinct perspective.  Probably because this was the largest land battle since Vietnam, the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993 was selected to bring the turmoil in Somalia to light, and in so doing bring attention to the ongoing distress of our global community, as well.  A dramatization of the events of that day are depicted in `Black Hawk Down,' directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Ken Nolan, adapted from the book by Mark Bowden.<br/><br/>	Civil War in raging in Somalia, and thousands upon thousands are starving to death under the relentless rule of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  U.N. food drops have been ineffective in relieving the situation, as Aidid's troops confiscate the food in his name.  Hunger and fear are Aidid's weapons of choice.  When information comes their way that two of Aidid's most influential advisors will be in conference in the city, the commanders of the American troops stationed nearby determine to launch a raid to capture them, which they feel will greatly undermine Aidid's hold on Mogadishu.  As planned, the operation will take less than an hour; but as with all sure things, the mission quickly goes bad, American troops become trapped in the city and are summarily engaged in hostilities by the enemy.  During the melee, one of the aircraft, an American Black Hawk, is shot down.  From his command post, General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) assesses the situation, and determines that no matter what, `No man will be left behind.' Afterward, the whole affair briefly became a blip on the evening news and a headline in the papers; but to those who lived it, it became a day they would never forget.  And this is their story.<br/><br/>	With his 1998 film, `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg set the bench mark for depicting combat on the screen in decidedly realistic terms.  That film gave the viewer a sense of being in combat that was unprecedented, and with it, Spielberg raised the bar for all who followed.  Now, it's expected that any major motion picture dealing with such subject matter will deliver that same kind of realism.  And this film certainly does.  But Spielberg did something else, too, that was very effective:  He presented all of his major players on a very personal level, which gave `Ryan' a significant impact emotionally as well as viscerally.  Ridley Scott did not do that with this film, and it makes all the difference in the world.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Hoot (Eric Bana), makes the comment that in battle, it's all about `The guy next to you.'  And that's very true; the problem here is, we don't really know who that guy is.  Beyond enabling the audience to feel the sting of combat, to be entirely effective and really make that necessary connection with the viewer, Scott should have made sure we knew enough about these men out there fighting for their lives to really feel something when one of them went down.  With few exceptions, it is difficult to put a name to a face during it all.  Quite frankly, for the most part you can't tell the players without a scorecard.  What he basically gives you is glimpses into a number of lives, and leaves it up to you to fill in the blanks.  And it's just not enough to make this the gut wrenching drama that it should have been.<br/><br/>	As far as performances, only a couple actually stand out:  Sam Shepard as General Garrison, and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight.  Shepard is outstanding, turning in a fairly understated portrayal that is entirely believable, while Sizemore shows much more reserve than usual, and gives one of the more affecting performances of the film.  Also worth noting is the work of Ron Eldard as Mike Durant, one of the pilots of the Black Hawks. But Josh Hartnett, as Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, while creating a character that is believable, and definitely endowed with a ¬ë90s sensitivity, is less than a commanding presence, and for the most part is nothing more than just another face in the crowd.  The same fate befalls Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, a company clerk/typist who finally gets his chance for duty in the field on this ill-fated mission.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes William Fichtner (Master Sergeant Howe), Ewen Bremner (Nelson), Jason Isaacs (Captain Steele), Jeremy Piven (Wolcott), Orlando Bloom (Blackburn) Danny Hoch (Pilla) and Gregory Sporleder (Galentine).  Without question, the highlight of this film is the patriotism it inspires; in that regard, it's through the roof.  But as a cinematic endeavor, `Black Hawk Down,' is average at best.  It could have-- and should have-- been a film as emotionally gripping as they come, but Scott and Nolan dropped the ball by concentrating too much on the technical aspects of the project and apparently assuming that the human element would emerge of it's own accord.  The result is an intensely patriotic action film-- albeit a darn good one-- which accurately (by all accounts) depicts an incident that, while extremely disconcerting, is presented in a less than satisfying manner.  Scott and his team put together a good package with this film, but they just didn't fill it up-- or deliver the goods as well as they could have.  I rate this one 7/10."
"rastaban3","9","0","0","6 February 2002"," Gritty account of a messed up Somali mission.
","Black Hawk Down presents the problems of the mission to Somalia and graphically portrays its consequences.  Our mission to Somalia was to bring order and feed the hungry.  That sounds great but we attempted to do that in the middle of a civil war.  That was the same mistake we made in Vietnam. Black Hawk Down showed the consequences of that mistake. <br/><br/>
I have to admit, I was expecting a long period of character building in this one as Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott are in the habit of doing. Pearl Harbor is an example of this folly.  It was so bad in Pearl Harbor it was a real distraction from the film.  This was not the case in Black Hawk Down.  There is about 30 minutes of character building so you know who they are, which is done along with some of the events that lead up to raid on the Olympic Hotel in Mogadishu.  After that time, the remaining part of film was about the raid itself.  How the raid started, how it went wrong and how our men got out.  <br/><br/>The combat scenes were first rate.  Realistic and graphic.  I could find nothing wrong with the affects or the stunts. Everything seem realistic. The chaos the film projected is accurate and shows just how messed up and unorganized these raids can become when they go wrong.  I have to admit, even though I did not agree that our soldiers were over there in Somalia, I was proud of them.  I have also seen the commentaries from the soldiers that were actually there and found that the film stayed very close to their accounts.  I could only find a few small variances.  The film showed that our soldiers preformed very well and professionally in this battle.  They showed they knew what they were doing.  If you think about, our soldiers were out numbered nearly 100 to one.  We only had about 150 men and a few choppers and the Somalis had more than 2000.  The fact that only 19 of our were killed speaks well our the training our soldiers receive. <br/><br/>
One the best parts of the film occurred after the first team returned to base with the prisoners they captured.  One of soldiers said he did not want to go back in there.  This scene shows the difference between bravery/courage, cowardice and out right foolishness.  I have family members how have been in combat before, some in WWII and Vietnam.  They all have said that ""Bravery/courage, cowardice and foolishness all deal with fear. Fools have none and end up dead or getting others dead in the process.   A coward is one who is afraid and runs away.  A brave man/woman is one who is afraid, but goes anyway."" This scene shows that clearly and I feel it is a point that needs to made.  <br/><br/>Back Hawk Down is graphic and some of the scenes are not for the squeamish. Some people have made it comparable to Saving Private Ryan.  In some aspects yes, but for the most part, no way!  The presentation of Black Hawk Down is powerful and has a great deal of impact.  However, it does not have impact that Saving Private Ryan did.  I did not leave the theater shaken as I did with Saving Private Ryan. I left with a sense of pride of our soldiers that fought there.  This one is not children as some of the scenes are very graphic.<br/><br/>Overall, nearly perfect and definitely worth your while (9 out of 10)."

","This movie only suffers when critics try to put it into a familiar category and then complain when it doesn't meet their criteria.<br/><br/>This is not historical fiction, people. Scott's only mistake was stating in the beginning: ""BASED on a true story"". As soon as audiences read that, they expect creative license, added romance, and every other signature hollywood device. I wish he had stated ""this IS the true story"". This isn't supposed to be Enemy at the Gates, Pearl Harbor, or Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>
The most frequent criticism I'm reading is that there isn't sufficient story structure or character development. It's a pointless gripe. Plots and characters are developed to service the story and make a film compelling. The situation as it happened in 1993 is compelling enough. When I see a young pilot in a hostile alien world trapped in a wreck of a helicopter with an armed mob closing in on him, I don't need to know what suburb he came from to feel the horror. As for story structure, If the men who endured this ordeal say the movie captures the event (and many of them have) I, for one, don't want to argue. Fudging facts for a prettier plot outline seems like a bad trade-off to me.<br/><br/>spoilers:<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's point doesn't seem to be in providing the ultimate entertainment (although the movie certainly is gripping); he is not giving us a moral lesson on the realities of war (although audiences are bound to draw their own conclusions). He is giving us gritty, factual, ""first-person"" perspective of a recent news story in a way that only the cinema can.<br/><br/>
I, at first thought it was strange that nothing was included about the Somalians dragging the dead captives through the streets. The director knew we had all seen that, and his purpose is to show us what television news cannot. Sure, the movie could have told us more in the way of historical background, but hey, this is the information age. We should be able to look that up.  Ridley Scott told the story the way he wanted to, and it's a compelling story. One that every American (17 or older) should see.<br/><br/>

","As a history major in college and pure film guru I long for historically accurate films of real events that do not insert cornball Hollywood dialogue and or change real events to ""make a better story"".  Films about historical combat events have traditionally fallen victim to this scenario. Only a handful of films about war/combat have been made that break away from this mold. Tora Tora Tora!, Hamburger Hill, Paths of Glory, and Das Boot are some of the best war/combat films that get it right when it comes to accurately depicting real combat experiences and events.  Black Hawk Down also belongs in this group. I have read the non-fiction book of the same name that the film is based on. Yes there are some composite characters but the film is still 98 percent accurate to the events of 10-3-93. The Ewen Mcgregor character is based on a real Ranger who was a desk jockey and had missed combat in both Panama and the Gulf War and was a last minute replacement on the Somali Mission.  It is not a clich√É¬©, as some reviews have said, to depict a soldier dying from a leg wound because they do and it did happen true to fact as it is depicted in BHD. The movie is apolitical. Facts are facts. The Clinton DOD did nix the request by General Garrison for Armor and C-130 Gunships because they did not want the public to think we were fighting a war. Sound familiar? I am a registered Independent that leans toward a libertarian approach to domestic and foreign policy. Personally I think we never should have been in Somalia or Viet Nam or Korea or WWI. But as the son of a Viet Nam Combat Veteran (173 AirBorne Division, who was incountry during the Tet Offensive)I have great respect for our armed forces.  That is what BHD is all about. It pays respect to the Delta Commandos, Army Rangers, and Black Hawk Pilots who fought and died on 10-3-1993 by accurately depicting their actions for what they truly were, heroic men fighting for each other. This is what the Eric Bana Character says at the end of the film in such a succinct yet eloquent way.  His observation that ""some people just don't get it"" obviously still rings true as some of the reviews of BHD have illustrated."

During the incident, 113 MalBatt members, serving under the United Nations were instructed to rescue 75 members of the American forces after two US helicopters were shot down in 1993.<br/><br/> During the incident a MalBatt member Corporal Mat Aznan Awang was killed.

","There seems to be an overwhelming number of complaints from viewers regarding a lack of historic background provided with this film. To those who feel this way, I have a question: do you need a brief history lesson at the onset of every war film? This movie has been compared for whatever reason to Saving Private Ryan. In that film, Steven Spielberg did not find it necessary to explain the motivations of Hitler after the opening credits, nor did he feel it necessary to explain why the soldiers involved with the story were there in the first place. Most every human being that may have seen that film knows enough about history to understand what was going on there. Yet this film is looked down upon by people too caught up with getting their history lessons from Hollywood because it lacks some sort of long-winded overview of the events leading up to 3 October, 93. In my personal opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. It's too bad it's based on a point so low in American history that most Americans did not even know that it took place."

","I was fortunate enough to get a copy of ""Black Hawk Down"" from my neighbor who is a voting member of the Academy.  I wa glad because I was unsure whether I would go to the theatre to watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production. In addition, although I liked Gladiator, I thought Ridley Scott truly over-aggrandized that movie, with the first half quite moving, and the second sappy and melodramatic.  Wow was I surprised.  The sepia, gold-gray tones Scott and his DP chose were quite gripping.  This confused, muddled event was further accentuated by this choice in film.  I do agree with one reviewer who said it became confusing to see the same white faced soldiers with helmets.<br/><br/>I read the book and have to say that the movie was extremely true to the book, following it almost event for event.  A few dramatic pieces were inserted to enhance characters, but it did not detract from the seam of the story.  I believe the constant barage of chaos additionally drove home the clusterf*** that this event was.  This film exonerates the soldiers, lifting them to tragic hero status, without over-dramatizing and without waving a flag in your face.  The subtleness of Scott's hand makes it quite clear, as did the book, that the bureaucracy of the leadership of the entire events in Somalia and this one day excursion is the cause of such horrible loss.  I was surprised at the number os British and Australian actors in the film who suppressed their native accents.  Only Ewen McGregor slipped a bit when he was buried in the dirt, and William Fichtner pulled him out and ask if he was o.k.  McGregor said, ""I hear bells.""  with a bit of his Scottish brough emanating.<br/><br/>I would put Black Hawk Down in league with such war movies as ""A Thin Red Line"" because of his subtle criticism of war, and its down played drama. It evokes surreal memories of ""Full Metal Jacket"" without inserting the detachment that Kubrick used.  For one who immediately turns his nose up at any Jerry Bruckheimer film, this was solid.  The only other Bruckheimer produced film that I enjoyed in the past few years was ""Enemy of the State"". Probably because of Tony Scott.  But two big zeros for ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armaggedon""."

It really tries to be an anti-war movie, showing the misery of modern war and in many scenes you're well reminded of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>BUT!!!<br/><br/>A movie just can't be a good fun action movie AND a good anti-war movie. These two kinds of genres bite each other and BHD kind of gets ridiculous with that.

But, of course, the bad-black skinnies (that's really what they are called in the movie) fall down like rabbits. Really cool to watch! About after the half of the movie you see a lot of American blood, which is a plus for the realism, and the crappy, scary feeling of war comes over you. But then there are two major things missing to be a real anti-war movie like Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan: A story and some characters. They just didn't have time to be set up in the other half of the movie. So when you leave the theatre don't really know anymore what you've seen.<br/><br/>Hey! You there!

"sychonic","Null","0","0","28 January 2002"," A quite remarkable movie
","Generally speaking, a movie should be self-contained--meaning it starts, evolves, and ends, tells a story, without need of any contextual information. You don't really need to know that much about the space program before seeing ""Apollo 13"" or the Civil War before seeing ""Gone With The Wind."" I would say that Black Hawk Down is an exception to that rule--audiences really owe it to themselves to learn a bit more about why the U.S. was in Somalia, the evolution of the mission, if only to more fully appreciate what these guys were asked to do, and what they really did; to say amazing is pitifully insufficient.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this movie are almost flawless--though I'd expect some hardcore military buffs might find some missteps. The closest most Americans will ever get to battle is being cut off in traffic. But if there's a way to insert a viewer into the combat, Ridley Scott seems to have found it. The bullets flying seem to come dangerously close to you while you're sitting comfortably in a nice soft reclining movie chair.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to know what Scott was really after, whether it was simply an attempt to make an ""antiwar"" movie, a pretty low-bar to jump over. Or whether he really intended to craft what I think appears here: A wonderful mix of hard grimy and bloody reality, with an almost surreal depiction of civilization and savagery. It's not an easy mix, and one that really needs a deft hand, one which Scott pulls off rather neatly. These soldiers, America's best, actually the best of the best, are dropped into this absolutely alien world, filled with shadows and smoke, populated by strange beings with a fierce hatred and a determination to kill them. The city is full of alien aura, like the strange sight of an open air arms market on the side of the street, as if there were no difference between selling a hot dog or an AK-47 assault rifle, along with bandoliers full of ammo.<br/><br/>Once the bullets start flying, that's when the context is the most important, something one ought to know a little about--and it seems the writers and director expect you to, since the explanation through titles on the screen are cursory at best. As these guys are forced to claw their way out of hell, when a soldier lays dying because they're stranded in a place that makes it too dangerous to fly in a medical evacuation helicopter, one is faced with the basic question: Where was everyone? We have a $500 billion plus military with every conceivable sort of weapon, tank, airplane etc. <br/><br/>We could have pulverized the entire city of Mogadishu had that been the intent--something a mere several hundred American Rangers, Delta Force and the Tenth Mountain Division came darn close to doing anyway. The answer is that political considerations intruded on military necessity--one can only be outraged that the U.S. Army had to borrow armored vehicles from Pakistan to go in an get our men trapped by thousands of hostiles with guns. Typical Clinton Administration fecklessness--though there is a tiny bit of justice that the then Defense Secretary, Les Aspin, it is said, lost his job over this.<br/><br/>The real story here is the way these guys acted, reacted, and used their intense training to overcome the obstacles--thousands of obstacles. It is also quite striking at how much damage this relatively small force of American soldiers managed to inflict on the enemy--better than a thousand Somalis dead. They were evidently hauling away the dead for days in carts. For those who think this movie didn't have enough character development, I can only shake my head--did they think this was a sequel to ""My Dinner With Andre""? This was about an intense firefight in a distant alien world, where American soldiers proved why they're the best in the world.<br/><br/>If there are any flaws, I can only detect two: That General Garrison is wearing sunglasses in a dimly lit room seems somewhat absurd and only done so he can dramatically rip them off--an extremely minor point, but when one is talking about a movie this good, tiny points become a bit bigger. The only other problem with the movie, is that it was too short, not easy when it clocks in at about two and a half hours. But they did leave out a number of things that would have made the movie more complete--but hey, that's what director's cuts are for and I fully expect to see one for this work, or will be most disappointed.<br/><br/>Though the reasons for Somalia maybe ambiguous and complex, this movie is not--it's about the good guys and the bad guys. And in this case, perhaps the movie didn't even show how bad these guys really were, as in reality, they purposely hid in crowds of women and children, and other civilians. For those who want moral ambiguity, go see tripe like ""American Beauty"" again, for those who want to know about the real world where soldiers kill and are killed, the ones who protect us from the savages of the world, go see this."

Folks, shaky cams and quick cuts are NOT reality. It may convey a sense of chaos and immediacy, but it has nothing to do with being ""real.""<br/><br/>It's a popular film/video style right now; Ridley Scott didn't invent it, and I'm so tired of gullible moviegoers who are claiming to have been ""In The Movie"" thanks to this style. Bottom line: the movie's a technical wonder of a shaky cam film, lots of dough was spent on special effects and you don't get to know one character well enough to empathize with them. That's fairly ironic, when the central statement of the film has to do with the fact that when it all comes down to it, it's no politics, it's just you and the guy next to you. Yeah? Well, it would have been nice to KNOW the guy next to you, then. The real soldiers in the actual conflict did. We never do. And as far as this hype about the movie not pushing a political agenda, you'd have to be deaf and dumb not to catch the American as Mighty World Warrior bull. The Americans fire. Somalians fall by the dozens. They fire? We dash around and occasionally get hit. The Americans react to the death around them. Except for an old man and a little boy, the Somalis are not depicted as humans, only marauding gun fodder. No time to react, only time to get mowed down. These may be 18 year-old soldiers, but they have the impossible resiliance of Ahhh-nold S. I'll tell you, according to this flick, most of the 1000 Somalis that died in this conflict were picked off by 123 Americans on the ground with rat-at-tat guns. I suspect our ""Death From Above"" was far more responsible for razing the Somalis. To me, this movie stinks of Hollywood, not realism. Vicariously-experienced stylized mayhem, not the reality of war."

","I have read many comments about how great and how bad this movie is. People say that the cinematography is great, that it makes you feel like you were there.  Others say that there is no character development and that it is racist because it doesn't give the somalian side of the story.  This is where I think a good movie has become great.<br/><br/>The story behind the movie Black Hawk Down, which is based relatively accurately off of the book by Mark Bowden, deals with the trials and ordeals that the men of Task Force Ranger went through on that tragic day back in '93.  From reading the book and talking with several of the men there, I can tell you from my perspective the movie is very accurate in the portrayal of events.  Having that background knowledge probably helped me understand it better.  However, this is where people seem to complain about character development and other issues that are left out.<br/><br/>Some people say a movie should leave you caring for the people in it and make you have interest in the story told.  Well, this is where Black Hawk Down shines.  Not only does it make you care about some of the characters (if the scene where MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart went into help out didn't leave you caring for those guys, then you have no heart), it makes you think about the actual events that took place.  The big controversy about the movie over racism, lack of truth, current events, etc., leaves the viewers more self-aware of enormous events that have happened during their lives. I think that is a great sign of a movie if it can make you start to think about and research related topics.  It doesn't leave you thinking about some fantasy world, it leaves you with the haunting thought that our world is not a nice place, and that the potential for the spread of regional conflicts are increasing greatly.  This movie makes you think.<br/><br/>So, to sum up my thoughts about the movie, it is a non-stop action docu-drama that leaves audiences fearful of the violence of war, but also makes them think about recent and current events that are shaping the modern times."

","As someone who read the book upon which this movie is based, I was intrigued by the pre-release criticism of so many reviewers. Everyone seemed to be dwelling on the fact that there wasn't enough character development. Watching the film, I began to understand what they meant because we really don't get enough time to know all of these characters they way we might like - such is life. As the movie progresses we do begin to see what kind of characters each one is. Some are jokers and some are fools. Some are pragmatic or stoic or romantic. The characters in this movie represent all soldiers. What we do see clearly in this movie is a small memorial to each of the men that died during the Battle of Mogadishu. The scene in which Sergeant First Class Randy Shugart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon come the aid of downed pilot Mike Durant is reason enough to see this movie! Overdevelopment of any of the surviving characters might have overshadowed the most important lesson of the movie, that no man be left behind."

The film captures the point of the book well, and the imagery, especially the rangers running on their own, trying to get to safety, is haunting. Anyone, whether they have worn the uniform or not, will have a visceral reaction -  understanding that mixed feeling of abandonment, desperation, exhaustion, and the comraderie/brotherhood that fends off the panic that might come if these rangers were alone.  Mr. Scott captures that without any words in the scene. It's a statement that war is an ugly, horrible undertaking that should be a last resort.

The main story of American soldiers trying to take over a city in Africa to stop the starvation of its people, gets broken down into separate stories of the groups of men who have different missions. It starts out well but slowly gets confusing as large amounts of soot start covering the mens faces, and soon you can't tell who's who. Then, as the stories jump back and forth from group to group the viewer becomes utterly confused on who the people are and what they're trying to do. The plot starts out following the stories behind 3 men, Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Grimes (Ewan McGregor), and Blackburn (Orlando Bloom). The story sticks with Eversmann the entire time but slowly loses all contact with Blackburn, (after a nasty fall), and Grimes. This leaves the viewer thinking ""Where did those guys go?

Mercifully, Ken Nolan keeps the story focused on the action at hand. Ridley Scott has always known make his money show up on the screen, and this movie is no exception. The action is hellish and nonstop. Nolan's script and Scott's direction do an excellent job of conveying the chaos and horror of war, without having the film dissolve into incomprehesibilty. <br/><br/>My biggest criticism would be the lack of information about the U.S. effort in Somalia. This mission seems to exists in a vacuum. While it was a pivot in the U.S. involvement, it begs the question: If the Blackhawk had not gone down, would it have changed our involvement?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a tight and focused movie, not for the faint of heart. Those looking for a film that lets you experience the chaos, horror and camraderie of combat need go no further. Those who are looking for an answer as to why that combat took place should look elsewhere."

","A fantastic movie that avoids all the cliches of the 'highly organised elite fighting force' story and instead in unashamed to show the audience why every soldier in the world is terrified of having the Americans on their side in a war. Scott shows in a shockingly real manner the consequences of decades of retarded jingoistic foreign policy and of a military with no idea of how to fight (and often of who they are fighting). The only thing I would question is the competence of the squaddies in the film seems far too high and totally at odds with all evidence and experience of the US Army.<br/><br/>It's also highly appropriate that it was rushed forward to a release date during America's latest unjustified war of oppression. More so considering that their excuse this time was an act of desperation by the dispossessed survivors of so many of their earlier indiscretions and criminal activities."
"eddie_heredia","10","0","0","26 January 2002"," Great movie! NOT RACIST OR PATRIOTIC!
","A great movie that is consistently being put down by idiotic accusations, BLACK HAWK DOWN is outstanding. One thing I hate to see are people accusing this movie as of being racist, and patriotic. To touch the subject of it `being' racist, for those who say this, I think, may not be sure, but I think it is because of the way the Somalian militia are portrayed in this movie. Now people have said it shows them being barbaric savages. People say it's a misinterpretation, but if we remember, the Somalian militia did grab those two pilot bodies and drag them through the streets, they stepped andkicked the bodies, spit on the bodies, and basically tore the body apart. Now if that is not a barbaric savage act, then I have no idea what it is then. But if your saying that you take the side of that militia that did that to those pilots, then you are being racist towards the American soldiers. I remember, I was about 7 to 8 years old, it was 1993 and I remember watching CNN the day after the events. I walked into the room while my parents were looking at this savage act. I glanced at the television and saw the bodies of those pilots being torn and kicked. It was the first time I had ever seen a dead body. It was the first time I learned how much hatred there was in the world. Even at that early age I though of that soldiers family, and how they must feel at seeing this. Now if you say that the way that militia was shown in the movie is a racist act, then you have just proven to everyone you're an idiot. Wars are about killing people, and the way a side wins is by killing people. It doesn't matter what skin color they are.<br/><br/> Now to get to those who say this is just a patriotic movie. The movie is not about America being better. The movie is not about the politics. The movie is not even about the battle, but what happened to the people in that battle. Meaning that it was what would you do if you were in that event? What would you do if your friend is in trouble? The movie is about the fellowship of your fellow soldiers. The movie shows what extraordinary things sticking together can do. The tag line of the movie is `Leave No Man Behind'. The movie does not go into politics whether America should have gone in there, or showing the flag of hope. The movie is about the friends you make. And if you do not agree, then you either did not watch movie, or you have no idea what was going on in that movie.<br/><br/> Black Hawk Down is an outstanding movie about soldiers in a war. It is second to Saving Private Ryan. The movie truly shows the chaos in war. And on a plus, the actors, even Josh Hartnett did an extremely perfect job in the movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. A PERFECT SCORE!"

","This film is a four star knockout!  This film must receive a best picture Oscar nomination as it is one of the greatest combat films ever made. Brilliant combat scenes that are in some ways, better than the scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan'.  The cinematography, while admirable in SPR, is not as headache inducing here.  Ridley Scott does not have long stretches between the combat and non combat sequences and the film shoots by like an hour.  There is an equal mix of both.  Scott gets into a scene just when its interesting and gets out before it wears out its welcome.  There is great male bonding between the soldiers as the motto in Somalia was that no U.S. soldier gets left behind.  The graphic sequences are difficult to watch but are well edited and the shock value, visually, only last a few seconds for each but resonates so well in the mind.  As an eighteen hour combat scenario that was only supposed to last thirty minutes, 'Black Hawk Down' shows that the cynics around the world who believe that the U.S. only fights when money is involved, are thankfully proven wrong by this film which shows a blend of forgotten heroes, devastating famine and a series of interacting peace keeping forces that did what they could to help a situation that could have been worse without at least some effort."

I don't mean to exterminate it altogether, rather to minimize it to give it an existing portion in each individual character.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down, on the other hand, exemplified the sort of determined love that each soldier feels when they go on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Looking at the movie as a whole, it was brilliantly conveyed as an American struggle in Somalia. All the necessary emotions were illustrated, and carried out in an all-round exceptional attempt to re-create the war image from soldier to soldier.<br/><br/>If there were more war stories created like this, we, as 'civilians' would receive a much clearer image of loved ones as they fight someone else's battle."
"tkfor2one","10","0","0","26 January 2002"," Black Hawk Down gets it right
","As a history major in college and pure film guru I long for historically accurate films of real events that do not insert cornball Hollywood dialogue and or change real events to ""make a better story"".  Films about historical combat events have traditionally fallen victim to this scenario. Only a handful of films about war/combat have been made that break away from this mold. Tora Tora Tora!, Hamburger Hill, Paths of Glory, and Das Boot are some of the best war/combat films that get it right when it comes to accurately depicting real combat experiences and events.  Black Hawk Down also belongs in this group.<br/><br/>I have read the non-fiction book of the same name that the film is based on. Yes there are some composite characters but the film is still 98 percent accurate to the events of 10-3-93. The Ewen Mcgregor character is based on a real Ranger who was a desk jockey and had missed combat in both Panama and the Gulf War and was a last minute replacement on the Somali Mission.  It is not a clich√©, as some reviews have said, to depict a soldier dying from a leg wound because they do and it did happen true to fact as it is depicted in BHD.<br/><br/>The movie is apolitical. Facts are facts. The Clinton DOD did nix the request by General Garrison for Armor and C-130 Gunships because they did not want the public to think we were fighting a war. Sound familiar? I am a registered Independent that leans toward a libertarian approach to domestic and foreign policy. Personally I think we never should have been in Somalia or Viet Nam or Korea or WWI. But as the son of a Viet Nam Combat Veteran (173 AirBorne Division, who was incountry during the Tet Offensive)I have great respect for our armed forces.  That is what BHD is all about. It pays respect to the Delta Commandos, Army Rangers, and Black Hawk Pilots who fought and died on 10-3-1993 by accurately depicting their actions for what they truly were, heroic men fighting for each other. This is what the Eric Bana Character says at the end of the film in such a succinct yet eloquent way.  His observation that ""some people just don't get it"" obviously still rings true as some of the reviews of BHD have illustrated."
"ebertjr","Null","0","0","26 January 2002"," Arguably Scott's best...
","...but that's not saying a lot.  This is the first movie he's ever made that's gotten any emotional response out of me.  That was in the middle of the movie, when real-life tragedies (both Somali and American) were depicted.  It's hard not to get a response out of that.  The end was typical _cinematic_ tragedy brought upon us by the Scott brothers.  Scott had to get in his slow motion overdramatic stuff, with kids running through the smoke of the battle and whatnot.  Whatever.<br/><br/>But I will say that the Scott Bros. discovery and subsequent overuse of the long lens beginning sometime around 1985 was truly a benefit to this movie. War movies shot with a wide lens just don't work very well.  Most of Ridley's new additions to his bag of tricks are direct lifts from other recent war efforts such as ""Saving Private Ryan.""  There's one awkward editing moment that plays like something out of a bad music video -- when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The beginning focused on introducing us to the characters, who then promptly disappeared into a cloud of smoke.  Josh and Ewan are among the few that are recognizable, but only since they're such big stars.  I find it impossible to believe I'm saying this, but even MICHAEL BAY developed characters better in ""Pearl Harbor.""<br/><br/>On a casting note, I was very impressed with Eric Bana in this movie.

","I have read over 100 of the comments concerning BHD and can't help but come to two conclusions, first many from countries other than the USA, consider the film, another example of ""Yankee Bravado,""and second, they could not be more wrong! What we have in Black Hawk Down, in the midst of highly skilled cinematography and brilliant thespian performances, is the TRUE story of war in all its hellish proportions and the indominable spirit of survival, for both the individual soldier and his comrades in arms. This is not a ""flag waving hurrah"" type of story, yet in the core theme of ""Don't Leave Anyone Behind,"" the viewer experiences in a vicarious way, the true GREATNESS of America's fighting men, and thus, leaves the theatre, proud to be an American. Director Ridley Scott skillfully weaves an emotionally draining series of combat scenarios, with startling reality and human pathos, which makes Black Hawk Down, the BEST war-themed film I have EVER seen!"
"captbruce","Null","0","0","30 January 2002"," Ridley does it again...
","Since a previous reviewer did a little recap on the background of the true events of the movie, I'll comment more about the movie itself... I just saw this movie tonight and I'd have to give this movie 3 and a half stars.  The reason it doesn't get a full four is because while it is excellent, something just felt...missing.  Was it too grand or not epic enough for me?  I'm not sure.  I know that, in my opinion, it isn't worth any Best Picture nominations.  It's not even worth any actor nominations, although they are all very, very good.  If anything, I think it should get a nod for direction and sound... The best thing I liked about the movie is that I forgot I was watching a movie.  It sucked me right in (once the obligatory exposition in the beginning was done) and never let me go.   Now don't get me wrong, it's not one pulse pounding minute after another--but it is action packed-- but it's simply engrossing. I agree with another reviewer that it is similar in its graphic-ness to ""Private Ryan"" in that you feel like you are in the trenches with these guys.  Also, here's a kicker: half the cast is English or Australian, so it's funny to hear McGregor, Bloom, Isaacs, etc. talking like Bob from Arkansas. To sum up:  Well worth your 8, 9, 10 bucks.  It made me want to research more about the Somalian conflict and I don't doubt that was a goal of the filmmakers.  And you will walk out of the movie respecting the heck out of our military men and women.  The movie couldn't have been timed better if they tried.  Don't listen to the hype, just see this excellent movie."

","Who would of thought that hack producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, would be associated with one of the greatest motion pictures ever made?  Anyone remember ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Armageddon"", or ""Con Air"".  True, he does have a talent for bringing fast paced, wonderfully shot action to the screen, but never for a film worth remembering, except for maybe ""Enemy of the State"".<br/><br/>In ""Black Hawk Down"", Bruckheimer is at the top of his game with all of the action you can dream of, with choppers mowing down dozens of Somalis with miniguns and rockets, explosions from RPGs left and right, and blood and gore aplenty.  But the action, as good as it is, isn't made out to be glorified as it is with his other films.  It's almost hard to watch half of the time.  If this had been directed by Michael Bay, one of the worst directors ever, this movie would have been nothing more than propaganda, and it would probably would have had a love story, and all of the action would have been glorified, like it was in ""Pearl Harbor"".  But since this was directed by Ridley Scott, you'll find none of that cheesy crap that made ""Pearl Harbor"" such a bad movie.  What you have is a gritty, hardcore war film that presents war in its true state, with all of the horror, chaos, and destruction that is associated with it.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" tells the true story of a failed '93 mission in which 18 Americans were lost, and a 1,000 Somalis were killed during a raid to capture a warlord's top 2 lieutenants in the city of Mogadishu.  The mission was supposed to have lasted only 30 minutes, but when 2 of the 4 black hawks were shot down, the raid turned into a rescue mission that lasted 15 hours.<br/><br/>
The cast, most of whom have been in previous Bruckheimer films, is top rate.  The cast includes Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan Bremner, Eric Bana, Jason Issaccs, Sam Shepard, and William Fichtner.  All are excellent, but the biggest standouts are Bana as Sgt. 1st Class Norm Hooten, and Sam Shepard as the distraut General, William Garrison, who watches in disbelief and horror as the mission unfolds from his command center.<br/><br/>
Every technical aspect of the film is brilliant.  From the sound, to the fast paced editing, it's as though the audience not only sees the battle as it rages on, but are actually thrust into the heart of it with sheer verocity and intensity.  Think of the first and last 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and try to imagine all of the terror and chaos from those 40 minutes for over 2 hours.  ""Black Hawk Down"" rarely lets up.<br/><br/>
What the film does lack, however, is character development.  We're given the soldiers names, and we pick up on their personalities, but that's about it.  But, for this film, it isn't a problem.  Even without the development of characters, the emotional connection is still there, and you can't help but to care deeply for these men and what they have to go through.<br/><br/>
All in all, Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a film that not only shows us what war is all about, but also the bond that war creates in the men that are swept up in it.  It's an honest, accurate portrayal of an event that will never be forgotten.  A+."

","I had mixed feelings going into this one.  On one hand, it's directed by Ridley Scott; who has done his fair share of great movies.  On the other hand, Jerry Bruckheimer's name is attached to it; who seems to be involved in big, pretty movies, with very little substance in them, *cough* Pearl Harbor *cough*.  I hoped Ridley's artistry would overcome Bruckheimer's `presence'.  So, did it?  For the most part yes.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot.  After the initial set-up, which I believe makes up the first 30 minutes or so, the troops get sent in and that's when the film takes off......and doesn't stop for 2 hours.  Man, this movie is intense.  Think: the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, only six times longer.  You get a real sense of being caught in the cross fire.  My only major complaint are some obvious CG effects, such as the dust being kicked up by helicopter propellers, but overall they don't distract too much from the experience and most people might not even notice.<br/><br/>Some might not enjoy the graphic nature of the movie.  It doesn't turn away from the violence, in fact, it zooms in on it and keeps it there, forcing you to watch.  It's a very powerful picture which I don't hesitate recommending.  Try catching it in theaters to get the full effect."

","This past Friday I was given the opportunity to link up with a few of my best friends in the whole world and watch a movie about the most life changing thing that has ever happened to us.<br/><br/>I will try to let you know what I think. This is me talking, and not my fellow Ranger buddies, they all have their own opinions.<br/><br/>
I think that the movie does a good job of telling the story. There are some things that are in my head that happened different, but this is Hollywood, and that is to be expected. The actors involved in this movie did an excellent job of doing the right thing and trying ""play their parts"" to give honor to those who lost their lives. If I ever get to meet some of these guys again, I would shake their hand, and tell them thank you.<br/><br/>
It's hard to show what was going on in a situation like the MOG, but I think they did well. They had to smush some things together and make some characters into 3 or 4 different people to make the stroy flow. They also had to make some things happen out of time sequence and in the wrong areas. I have no problem with this, because they needed to make the story flow. I think they did just that.<br/><br/>It was a very emotional experience for me, and I'm glad that I was able to see and talk to my Ranger buddies right after I saw it. THANK YOU CARMIKE.<br/><br/>There are some things in the movie that are not tactically correct, but th en again, it's Hollywood, and they are into this to make money.... So I will not get too much into what I think was wrong. You have to make your own opinions on this one.<br/><br/>There was not enough volume of fire going on throughout the movie. We saw a lot more fire, and sent a lot more bullets down range than the movie shows. Also, it has to be hard for someone to grasp that in this fire fight, targets were on our left, right, front, rear, in the windows, and on rooftops. If they showed the amount of fire that was really happening, the general public would think that it was fake, so I understand.<br/><br/>
The actors did a great job of ""being"" the characters they were playing. I just wish that I could have seen it with all of TFR. That way I would really know what each person thought.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are good, and the sound effects are spot on (in my opinion). The Camera work was really good. Trying to show how confusing it really was while we were trying to do our mission.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the Rangers looked and acted like Rangers, as well as the Operators. Bad thing was that they made the Rangers look a little indecisive, which was not the case. But that's a whole different rant."

","This movie left me pretty uneasy.  It is, of course, a ""horrors of war"" movie, with really strong direction and photography of the action sequences, which are, truly, most of the film.  And, I'll admit, right off the bat, that was a neat thing to see on the screen.  Look at that!  Look at that! Fine.<br/><br/> But while I'm watching this and thinking ""look at that!"" I'm also thinking, ""but, wait, why is watching people get blown up a good thing for me to be doing?""  Or, more specifically, when I was presented with a surgery-channel-style extreme-close-up deep into a gruesome, gaping wound, I had to wonder, ""What am I supposed to be getting out of all this?""<br/><br/> And I just don't have any answers to that question that make me feel comfortable with this movie - there's just something irresponsible, for want of a better word, of making a gory action movie out of recent, still relevant events; of turning a real soldier who died less than ten years ago into ""the guy who got blown in half!""  Yea, even in the name of glorifying U.S. military heroism.<br/><br/> You say the point of the movie is to sober us up, to expose us to this event as it REALLY HAPPENED?  Maybe there's something defensible there, in principle - but to actually pull that off, you've got to live up to a lot more responsibilities - you can't load the first half hour with cliched war-movie dialogue and cheap characterization, because then we're not in the world of ""history"" at all - we're in the world of action movies, where the explosions aren't just intense, they're really cool - and my stomach turned a bit every time it occurred to me that somewhere in the theater, surely, were people who were thinking, ""duuude.""  The guy in front of me actually clapped in admiration at the goriest surprises.  Really.<br/><br/> And please - you don't put Hans Zimmer's driving beat over sober history. You put it over a cool flick.<br/><br/> Not to mention the comic relief guys.<br/><br/> Plus, if this is indeed somehow supposed to be (as the 'somber' captions at the beginning and end suggest) a bit of historical perspective, it really IS obliged to be more intelligent about the politics involved.  And don't tell me that it's an apolitical movie because the soldiers are just soldiers following orders - it's an apolitical movie because the filmmakers chose what to put in the movie and what not to.  And so again I say: please tell me it was for some good reason and not to make a cooler  movie.<br/><br/> I know, it was about HEROISM - but if that's all they cared about then why couldn't they make up their own story about heroism instead of making that the 'spin' on a disturbing episode of recent history?  We were well beyond the ""inspired by real events"" realm here - this was supposed to BE real events.  That's a lot to bite off, sure, but the moviemakers are the ones who bit it off, and so they've got to deal with it on those terms.<br/><br/> At least ""Saving Private Ryan,"" another war movie with impressively realistic action scenes but corny writing, was off this particular hook somewhat, because the tradition of making cinematic nonsense out of World War II was well established, so any touches of grim reality in that movie were genuinely sobering and valuable.  ""Black Hawk Down,"" on the other hand, is looking back less than a decade to events which have not yet been trodden on by the Jerry Bruckheimers of the world, and in my opinion this means he is accountable for any dirt he gets on its pristine historicity, so to speak.  Should he be congratulated for only getting SOME dirt on it when he would usually bury it in manure?  Isn't this still a misguided endeavor?"

It gave us a great perspective on what the ordeal was like for the Americans, with just the right amount of moments to draw the audience's emotion out for the characters. It was pretty much the best war movie I have ever seen in terms of making the viewer really feel like he/she was there to experience it. It started out, after giving sufficient background on the conflict in Somalia, feeling like ""The Thin Red Line,"" where we get to meet all the characters - in this case U.S. soldiers - and see what they are like before thrusting them into battle. This goes on just long enough for us to like and appreciate them and feel for them later in the movie. Once the action starts, it goes nonstop to the end of the film and all important events are shown in such good detail and so efficiently that the audience knows everything that is happening, without being confused for the most part. There are great performances by all the actors, making their characters seem very genuine, and the technical work is just flawless, making the location seem so real and, as I said before, almost as if you were there.

Blade Runner and Alien are just too of my favorite films of all time. I also like Thelma and Louise. The duellist is a good movie with stunning images, but his other films are not that good. Legend is so-so (but I want to see the director's cut with Jerry Goldsmith's music on DVD, what the hell is going on with this release ???), Someone To Watch Over Me has great acting, Black Rain is beautiffly stylised (but what a bad and cliche scenario), 1492 A Conquest of Paradise has great music and images (but how can the story of Christophe Colomb be boring like that ??? And sorry Ridley, your only miscast of all your directing career : Gerard Depardieu, you could have choose worst, but surely better). Whitesqual is too long and G.I. Jane is just too confusing. Hannibal represend well the book (but the book is not very good... so the film too, but at least I like it !). Gladiator was good, but could have been better.<br/><br/>Now Black Hawk Down. I wasn't expected mush when I heard that the producer was Jerry Bruckeimer who is the king at producing brainless action movie featuring bad actors (or at least baddly directed actors)! In fact I am please with the result. It is possibly the best movie produced by Bruckeimer of all his career, but that does not mean that BHD is a great movie ! It is a very well crafted action movie with little deep (very very little).<br/><br/>I find it a bit pretentious. It wants to be The Thin Red Line but it is far from it, exepted maybe for the cinematography, they are tie.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is good. The editing well done (Pietro Scallia does his best job in a Ridley Scott movie here). And the team Scott/Zimmer works marvellously again. Scott and Zimmer never use big loud music to underscore the visuals (like so much movies produced by Bruckeimer). It really a thing to avoid in a war movie (at least in modern war film).<br/><br/>The weak thing of the movie is that it miss the moral found in such films like Appocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Bridge on the River Kwai, etc... A bit too much patriotic, but the worst thing is that the Somalians are represented as the bad guy and nothing more ( but hey ! it is a Bruckeimer movie).<br/><br/>It is sad for Scott because he deserves recognition for his work behind the camera, but the problem is that a great director must also add dept in a film. Give a very good script to Scott and you have 95% of chance that you have a pretty good movie (Thelma and Louise) !"

","I heard this movie was on some people's top ten list. Is that the ten worst list? I thought this was supposed to be a departure for Brucheimer? It had a lot of the same nonsense that you would find in ""Armaggedon"" or ""Pearl Harbor"". Just when I would start to get into it, they would throw in something really corny. Some ridiculous speech. Or some sentimental nonsense. It wasn't gritty and real. There were all these stupid ""movie moments"". And come on, every guy that gets injured begs to get back in the action.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't that great. Tom Sizemore chews more scenery than Godzilla ever did. And like a lot of people said, character development is so weak, you don't really care about these guys. The musical score was pretty bad. Usually I don't notice the score of a film, but there were times where the music would stick out like a sore thumb. This movie wants to be Saving Private Ryan & Three Kings, but it fails."

","My comments will probably have been made by others such is the impact this film has. This is not war lite as usually portrayed with lots of scene setting, character establishment and a romantic interlude, indeed one hardly gets to know most of the cast before being plunged into the operation itself, which despite huge resources goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>No punch is pulled as we see helicopters downed, men shot dead and the wounded die horribly. Quick cutting, frequent aerial shots and a greyish feel to the colour stock make this almost documentary in style now and again. This is Ridley Scott at the height of his powers, bringing an exciting story alive and keeping you on the edge of your seat as to who will get out or not.<br/><br/>The young cast do immensely well, including many boyish Brits usually only seen on television before - I was surprised to see Matthew Marsden, previously just a minor bit of male totty in Coronation Street (the UK's biggest soap for our foreign readers) as the guy with the cast on his arm.<br/><br/>I must say for a newshound like myself I don't remember this episode from the news at the time, but the closing titles telling how 1,000 Somalis died makes a pertinent message. Were we cheering for the right guys on the day.............<br/><br/>Morocco's run down cities, and they would not have had to much set dressing from my visits there, stand in for Mogadishu.<br/><br/>Superb film, dubious morality, but probably fitting the times excellently in the West after 11th September."

","When I went to the movie theater on Saturday, I knew that I was in for the most incredible experience of my life again. Like my past time serving in the military, Black Hawk Down is a chilling reminder of war and the spirit of the American soldier. The 140 minutes of unrelenting carnage is all true, and should never be passed off by moviegoers as a pointless blood and guts war film. The gore and hard action that is depicted by this film was real in 1993, plain and simple. The film tells the true tale of the botched U.S. special forces raid in Mogadishu Somolia in 1993. The mission that was supposed to take about thirty minutes, became an 18 hour ""hell on earth"" firefight. Outnumbered, injured, low on ammo, and surrounded by a fanatical enemy, the stories of the american fighters of the Rangers and Delt teams came to true light through the direction of Ridley Scott, and the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I absolutely praise Scott for his work. His films that included Gladiator, Legend, Alien, and Blade Runner, all have another film to join them as some of the best films ever made. Black Hawk Down is an in your face minute by minute story of war. It dose not try to reach to your heart with soft notions of dramatized charcters like in Saving Private Ryan. It stays true to the true story of the american's fight for survival, and dose not fictionalize its charcters for softy points. It shows courage, determination, teamwork, faithfulness, friendship, and devotional brotherhood that flows through the blood of our armed forces. Scott's incredible film talents captured all of those things. The film should be a reminder to pacifists, hippies, anti-war protestors, and those who try to find the way out of fighting. Those who still do not understand the military and this world need to read the book, or go and serve in the military. This film and its book have my own heart thanks. I served for 4 years in the military, and I saw things I would never want people to see. I was ashamed that a few people giggled at some of the death scenes in this movie. I h=gave them the look and the words to SHUT UP. This is not a happy Pearl Harbor romance, this was the truth. I'll be ashamed if one day I see another american citizen ever pass off the these soldier's, or any soldier's sacrifice as needless."

This movie is not a made-up plot with romantic twists and one-line jokes..this is a real life account of an event that actually happened, and for that reason i think that alot of people who didnt like the movie were expecting a more Saving Private Ryan type flick..everyone remembers the first 15 mins of SPR, totally shocking, but then the movie calms down, lets the audience relax, adjust and digest what they've just seen.  Black Hawk Down isnt like that and doesnt try to be..it takes a real life situation that happened in 1993 and tells it like it is.. For people who make comments on this movie like 'what does showing us blood and guts tell us about war, do we really need this to show us that war is violent and brutal, what sort of insight is that into war', i'd say they totally missed the point...this movie isnt here to 'shock' you with blood and guts into realizing war sucks..everyone already knows war sucks..this movie just shows it the way it is, and if you dont believe it then ask those rangers and delta's who were lucky enough to make it back alive.. This movie takes a real life account and tells the story just as it happened. Period.  You either like that kind of thing or you dont.

","My favorite war movie of all time was Full Metal Jacket by Stanley Kubrick, no other movie explains the psychological aspect of war like this movie did. Saving private Ryan was second, it was very realistic and was also backed by fantastic acting. However, after i left the theatre last night i realized that no other movie depicts the realism of battle like Black Hawk Down. Financed by Big time producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ridley Scott is the perfect director for a war movie. His trademark Gloomy look you see in his movies really make the movie stunning and visually marvelous. Ridley's intention was to put the audience right int he middle of the battle which is in fact the entire movie except for the first half hour which is mostly character introductions. Many people are knocking this movie for its shallow characters. Thats not what this movie is all about. It's a movie that shows the reality of war, and how brutal it is. War is a terrible thing and to all the people who say let's bomb this country and let's bomb them and them....Go see this movie. If you happen to be sensitive to disturbing grotesque images, go see this movie. War is War and people die in terrible ways, and Ridley Scott shows that. He definatly created a masterpeice and the movie almost has a documentary type feel to it. Despite its shallow characters, you do get to care about them, and at times i found myself pumping my fist rooting for them at the end even though it was viewed as a trajedy as 19 soldiers perished in a battle no one even knows about. It's not a patriotic, Go kick their butt America! film. No happy endings in this flick. Just the Truth. The Truth about human war. An Great Movie Overall..it is definatly in my top 10 list of the greatest movies of all time."

There was no character-building no drama outside of what takes place amid all the bullets.  Think of the movie Rocky but without any of the stuff that takes place outside of the ring. Good stuff but no real substance. That's the difference between watching a boxing match and watching a boxing film. Imagine Private Ryan if it all took place on Omaha Beach.<br/><br/>

","A definite must-see. Anyone who complains about the plot has a screw loose. This film's plot was written 8 years ago by 200 US servicemen and about 5,000 Somalis. Having read the book, this is an faithful recounting of what happened during those 18 hours. The battle scenes are intense, and the dialog, while someone called it ""cliche"", is poignant and dramatic when it needs to be. These men were in an intense battle, there was no time for deep conversations. The only complaint is that it was tough to figure out which character was which, and why we needed to know who they were. That, and a little more background into why the soldiers were so seemingly unprepared for this mission (that they had done this type of operation several times before, always without great incident, and that the US had recently carried out a rocket attack on Adid's clan leadership that killed 50 or so political figures, moderates included, and enraged the residents of that part of the city.). Other than that, this is a visceral view of what those soldiers went through that day, and what other US soldiers will have to go through if we ever get into this type of conflict again. 8.5/10."

","Ridley Scott proves he still has the right stuff in this faithful account of the tragic events that occurred in Somalia in 1993.

The pacing is perfect, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Scott's use of special camera effects--a brief freeze on a severed hand, blurring during chaotic moments, handheld shots--effectively convey the mayhem of war. You feel as if you are down there on the ground with these people.<br/><br/>The intensity of the violence in this film has been criticized by some, but battle IS intense. War is ugly--and this film conveys that. Through the characters, you feel the agony of lives needlessly lost--on both sides.<br/><br/>Watching this film, I was aware how easily one of those young men could be someone I know, someone who might now be gone forever from my life.

","The United States Army should use `Black Hawk Down' as a training film. After 20 minutes' viewing, a recruit would have a very good idea that being caught in a warlord-controlled Somalia town is indeed a life-threatening, bloody business. <br/><br/>Besides the first 20 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan,' there may be no better film to show the reality of modern combat (read ducking rocket-propelled grenades-forget the old hand-to-hand stuff). Director Ridley Scott, who made his name in `Blade Runner' and `Gladiator' among other action films, should get an Oscar nomination. So should Hans Zimmer for his battle-complementary score and Slawomir Idziak, once Krzysztof Kieslowski's cinematographer, for his graceful aerial shots and broken-city images.<br/><br/>If you know going in to `Black Hawk Down' that the US elite Delta Force lost the battle in Mogadishu that day in 1993, then watching the 2 √Ç¬Ω hours is worthless after that first 20 minutes because it is all bullets and gore, no doubt realistic, but who needs it except military buffs? <br/><br/>
Characterization?  Forget it! Josh Hartnett as a heroic staff sergeant here had much more to do in another Jerry Bruckheimer production, the disappointing `Pearl Harbor.' He peers around broken buildings, encourages his buddies, and holds an artery for most of the film. He does, however, speak one of the only important lines when he says of the `skinnies'(the name for the starving enemy), ""Look, there are two things we can do. We can help these people or we can watch them die on CNN."" That is as close as the film comes to explaining the US presence.<br/><br/>Sam Shepard as the beleaguered general is weathered and laconic, always watchable, but going into no new territory for the Hollywood war room officer watching on monitors as his men die in a puzzle he can't solve. Gene Hackman has been training regularly for this role.<br/><br/>The most famous image of that fateful Mogadishu failure doesn't appear in the film: a half-naked master sergeant being dragged through the streets. Ridley Scott seems to avoid tough ironies like that, which might just help explain the US fighting to save a people who seem to hate it anyway.  Hmmm, Vietnam and Afghanistan come to my mind.  No need to worry about tackling that thorny question.  Let's get back to the Humvee-there are more rockets coming our way."

","Covering a little known event in October of 1993, Black Hawk Down follows the failed Army Ranger attempt at overall executing a Warlord contributing to a genocide in Somalia.  The overall goal of the movie seems to be to be as accurate and realistically horrid as the actual event.  Somewhat in line with scenes featured in  HBO's Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down accomplishes everything it sets out to do.<br/><br/>Personally, the movie for some reason reminded me somewhat of Rules of Engagement, only taking one scene of the film and extending it as well as making it much more serious.<br/><br/>With the team of Ridley Scott and Bruckheimer, this alone tells what the movie will be like.  The epic and saga of a Gladiator combined with the smooth visuals of movies like The Rock combines to be phenomenal.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is surprisingly well suited for the ""leadership in the face of adversity"" role he takes on, as well as gives a very emotional performance. The rest of the acting is also top notch, with no one character proving annoying or poorly cast.<br/><br/>The visuals are what makes this movie though.  Visceral scenes or RPG's flying and guns firing.  Endless Somali's, men women and kids, armed to the teeth trying to kill the horridly outnumbered Americans in any way possible. A sense of urgency and desperation surrounds the action as it unfolds fast and never ending.  The only movie it can really compare to would be Three Kings, that somewhat overlooked gem from a few years back.  Black Hawk Down is lacking a small amount in the uniqueness of the effects presented in Three Kings, yet makes up for it in every other aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie with not a dull moment, and the icy and eerie echo presented at the beginning and end that indeed the events shown are real events.  Not for the weak hearted or those seeking a cheer-me-up movie, Black Hawk Down gives a grim portrayal of fighting a war that isn't ours to begin with..."

That also includes Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Yes, both are fantastic films, but this movie is on a totally different level. Ridley Scott's intention is to give the audience a feeling of being in middle of the battle which is in fact the entire movie except for the first 30 minutes which is mostly character introductions. However, the movie does not focus on its characters as much as other great war films, and although you do care about them, especially Tom Sizemore who by far steals the show as a brave, and fearless captain. Ridley's intention was to simply make you realize that war is very serious, and he does a good job of making you understand this in a human perspective, not an American one. He makes you feel bad for the many innocent somali's who died as the result of this 15 hr battle. Somalia was a hopeless country and maybe we shouldnt have gotten ivolved but at the end you realize that thats what some people are put on this earth for, to make a difference. 9 out of 10 people most likely never knew about this situation which took place in 93, these are the small battles we never even hear about, and yet so important. This movie really has you thinking that dying for a cause is worth living for, Even though most people beleive we shouldnt fight other people's wars.

True, this movie is not for the faint of heart, and true, the action sequences will leave you gasping and gut wrenched over the duration of the film.

We all dipped either Cope or Skoal), gathering around a VCR, killing time in a hanger with nothing better to do than imitate the quirky perks of the brass.  Even the dialect and language.  `Hoo-ahh'.  We were so ate up that age and time, and Scott captures this perfectly.  Was this borrowed from the book of the same name?

I mean, I knew it was a war movie about the battle of Mogadishu and all, but what I saw was not what I expected. And I mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was the movie to be one long war sequence. I thought that there might be some character development or a backstory of some kind or another, but there wasn't. Normally, this really angers me when that doesn't happen in a movie, but Black Hawk Down makes a special exception. Here, the only character that you need to know is the war that rages around the U.S. Rangers. Yes, Josh Hartnett and crew give excellent performances, but you didn't need to know who they were or what they did to enjoy them.<br/><br/>Cinematography in this movie = excellent. I swear, I felt like I was in the middle of the battle my self, with bullets flying by and rockets whizzing past. And it shows you what war is really like, unlike what Pearl Harbor or Behind Enemy Lines did. True, Pearl Harbor had a spectacular war scene, but it felt fake. And Behind Enemy Lines, well, I wasn't too impressed with it. But Black Hawk Down, just like Saving Private Ryan, puts you right smack down in the middle of the action and makes you see what war is really like. Yes, there are some graphic war wounds and disturbing images, but war ain't pretty.<br/><br/>Listen, for all you people who haven't seen BHD, get off the internet, turn off the computer, get in the car, go to the movie theater, and see it. Great visuals, powerful acting, and another excellent score by Hans Zimmer make this one of the best movies of 2001.<br/><br/>10/10"

No white, no black...just green.  The action was excellent and realistic.  I will say that some things may not make sence to some..example (How could 1000 nutjobs with guns only kill 19 americans.  Well, the nutjobs had NO training and were just animals with guns.  Anyhow, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!  It's a good, no great, no AWSOME movie.  I am done!"

","Upon seeing the previews for this movie, I could not wait to see it.  Not for it's gore, not for the action, but to gain another level of respect for the men and woman who have fallen for this country and the people of other countries.  People talk of the lack of character development and cliched stories and lines and to them I say, go see Vanilla Sky.  These are probably the same people who enjoyed Pearl Harbor for it's love story!  War movies have no place for love.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is a movie that defines why I have nothing but the utmost respect for any man or woman that has served in the Armed Forces and has seen action.  I have trouble moving from a fox hole while playing paintball! To get up and move and carry out orders while being inches from death amazes me.  And to their credit, I think the actors in this movie did a wonderful job of portraying these men.  I'd love to see the people complaining of the canned death bed lines, on their death beds and see what they would say.  I don't think that many of us would be nearly as calm. And, who said, the line of Leave No Man Behind was overdone!  Another review said it best, if you have never served you will never understand.  To see this movie, there should be a pre-requisite, you should be serving or have served or have nothing but respect for those in the military.  Watch Band of Brothers and maybe you'll understand.  Or maybe pick up a book on war and get a feel for the brotherhood developed.<br/><br/>I won't go on, as this is becoming more of a political diatribe instead of a review, but I will end with, See this movie.  At the end, I was left in awe of the men who were there and I was ready to sign up myself.<br/><br/>Since Sept. 11th America has found new heroes to admire.  I think this film reminds us all that there have always been heroes and they are the men and women of the Armed Services who have lived and died to give us our freedom! Freedom to express our views and say what we will.  Remember these people while watching this movie and suddenly story lines and character development mean nothing.  It doesn't matter that you didn't know Johnny GI from Randy Ranger, they were Americans and you morn their deaths because of that.  If I ever get the chance to meet one of the men that served in Somali, I will be in simple awe and in the presence of a hero."

","With accurate depictions of today's professional soldiers, nonstop suspense, and excellent combat scenes, Black Hawk Down is one of the best war movies ever.  Without any glamour and moralistic preaching, it portrays the desperation of soldiers surrounded by superior numbers and the courage of soldiers attempting save them and to save each other.  Black Hawk Down has scenes of graphic violence, but those scenes are there not for shock value, but because they actually happened. This movie does not dwell on ""why"" the battle of Mogadishu happened, but ""how"" it happened, recreating the emotional draining effect of intense combat.  Superb acting performances and Ridley Scott's direction provide a very, very good movie about a failed military operation."
"ekmtwcn","10","0","0","4 January 2002"," One of the best war movies, ever!
","This is one of the best movies of the year!  I have read the book and was pleasantly surprised that the movie portrayed many of the stories from the book.  In fact, the movie plays more like a documentary of what happened than just a ""Hollywood-ized"" version of the events.  And that is what makes this movie so good.  Instead of trying to push characters on us or give us a sappy romantic subplot, it simply lets the events speak for themselves, since the events were horrifying enough to elicit a reaction.  The direction was great, and the cast did an excellent job with what they had.  I thought the movie did a good job of letting people who had no knowledge of the event know what the situation was.  Also, I have heard that there is not enough characterization, or that the movie takes no stand on why we were there, or the political climate surrounding the events.  This is a movie about the mission, not a ""JFK"" type movie trying to explain why or why not we should be there.  This movie's main point is to show combat as hell on earth. And it accomplishes that better than any movie before it."

","Black Hawk Down is based (and as far as I can tell, very faithfully) on Mark Bowden's retelling of the real events that happened in Somalia in 1993.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down isn't fictionalized Hollywood hero-worship, like we've had forced on us in Saving Private Ryan, or Pearl Harbor.  Black Hawk Down is a 144 minute reminder of why real war isn't entertaining, but frightening, bloody, and terrible.  This movie hopes to remind us that when we send our troops off to foreign lands to do the work diplomacy can't do, that some of those troops are going to die.  Most of the guys who died in Somalia where just 19 year old kids.  Hopefully, Black Hawk Down reminds us of the seriousness of making the decision to send our troops into harms way, and the possible, if lately forgotten, consequences of that decision.<br/><br/>When I read Mark Bowden's book, I literally had to put it down several times because I was just emotionally overwhelmed by it.  It should be required reading for high school seniors, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you hoped to find Black Hawk Down 'entertaining', I feel sorry for you. From reading the book, I had no such expectation.  I actually had to sit in the theater after the film ended, until the clean up crew came through, thinking about what I had just seen.<br/><br/>The whole point of not getting the back story to the characters in Black Hawk Down is that you don't need to have them.  The characters could have been anyone, your next door neighbor, the kid down the street.  The fact that they were scared, overwhelmed, very real human beings stuck in a place where a whole city was trying to kill them is what makes the slice of the characters lives we are shown during the movie so compelling.<br/><br/>If you didn't get the power of the film, I'll tell you how to truly experience it.  If you unfortunately don't feel like reading Bowden's book, watch the movie again, but pay close attention to the names written on the front of the characters' helmets.  I was told that this was one of the few technical departures from real life, as real Rangers don't write their names on their helmets like that.<br/><br/>To really get this film, watch, and remember, the names on the helmets of the characters that die.  Because, unlike the fictionalized characters in Saving Private Ryan, for example, all the characters in Black Hawk Down are, or sadly were, very real Americans.  They are not merely 'representations' of real characters, written with fictional license.  What the characters do in the movie is what the real guys did in real life.  Real Americans, who died in a dirty nowhere part of Africa, married guys who died worrying about what was going to happen to their kids and wives back home, young guys who died whose biggest worry was that their parents were proud of them.  That stuff isn't Hollywood cliche, but taken from interviews with the survivors of what really happened.<br/><br/>This is, in my opinion, one of the most amazing uses of film I've ever seen. Ridley Scott has easily solidified his spot as one of the world's premier motion picture directors.  I hesitate to even call Black Hawk Down a 'war movie', because that trivializes what it is really about.  It isn't about heroes.  It doesn't try to remind you that 'war is hell', and is something glorious that an older generation did once.  And it is not 'anti-war' either.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down hopefully will remind some of us who have forgotten about the terrible seriousness of sending our soldiers to fight and possibly die in foreign lands.  It doesn't distract us with comment on the politics behind the fighting, or confuse us with back story, or try to soften things with a pointless love story.  We don't have to listen to Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks telling us what a glorious bunch of people our grandfathers were for fighting a terrible war that is, sadly, inaccessible ancient history for most of today's youth.<br/><br/>Because in war, real people die in terrible, real ways, and the sanitized image of war we get from the popular media lately tends to make us forget the real human costs of combat, on both sides...."

The utter chaos confusion and despair of war time was presented perfectly to the audience through out the movie as reminder of the human sacrifices involved in a civil war.

"brickt0p","Null","0","0","21 January 2002"," Reading the book helps
","One of the flaws I've seen with many of the critiques of this film is that people are trying to dissect it as though they were sitting in film school. That framework doesn't apply well here. Character development? Character development would have been germain if it was a study of the effects of a modern war on those who fight it or in the greater context of how this affected foreign policy. However that was not the intent here. It was to as honestly as possible depict the events of 3 Oct 93. You can liken this more to documentary film-making than to standard Hollywood fair. If you read the book you would see that their are a mileiu of characters to keep up with. Apologies for silencing their story because it is beyond the publics ability to keep track of more than a couple characters. As to the cliches, sometimes real people speak like that. Your best friend is lying on a table about to die. What do you say to him? I doubt Shakespearean prose could easily fall from most of our lips in such a situation. Yes it was confusing and hard to keep track of. It is war. It is confusing and horrible and strangely exhilerating. The most absurd things sometimes happen in war just as they do in real life sometimes. Hell, you and your buddies are in a bad situation sometimes the only thing you can do is make a smart remark. It is almost a defense mechanism. Another point as to the absurdities of war, this isn't the first movie to point that out, suggest you look at Apocolypse Now and Full Metal Jacket again. In my humble opinion which may not be worth much, this movie rightfully deserves to stand in the pantheon of great war films. It did what it intended to do, tell a story and tell it accurately and that it did in spades."
"Schu5522","10","0","0","21 January 2002"," Incredible film, incredible anti-war message.
","Before even leaving the theater after seeing Black Hawk down, I found myself nearly crying at what I had seen.   Never before, not Saving Private Ryan, not any other film, had I seen such a powerful anti-war message.   The constant fighting, the confusion, and the sense of hopelessness helped create an atmosphere in the movie than plainly spelled out not only how horrible war is, but it also raised questions about the American use of military power on the international stage.<br/><br/>War movies in the past have been about distant times, ones we are far detached from.   Black Hawk Down was about an event that occurred eight years ago, but it just as well could have been today, in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>This film was not a shoot-em-up, nor did it depict any glory in war.   It was not a patriotic, go America film.   It was about a government, placing its boys in danger's way for the sake of politics.   The only good thing happening in the film is how these 18-22 year old boys respond to the chaotic world around them.   They fight with all they can muster, they follow the orders given to them, and they die for the guy next to them. Their bravery, courage and dedication show what normal people can do when placed in extraordinary situations, not what a great country America is. I'm honestly surprised they released this so close to Sept. 11 because it raises a lot of questions about America's role on the world political stage.<br/><br/>
The emotional impact on me of this film is difficult to describe. As a 19 year old college student, all I could think about was myself in the shoes of the actors in this movie.   I could not see myself handle something like this, but if America did go to war, I would be faced with this reality. It is scary, each man getting shot could very well have been me, or even worse, my close friends.<br/><br/>Most of the audience in the theater were college students as well, and I have a feeling that they were all significantly impacted by this film as well because the theater was dead silent upon the completion of the film. One of my good friends was utterly speechless and could only mutter, ""Why do we have war?""    Parents of young adults, imagine your sons being shipped across the world to face the hell of war depicted here.<br/><br/>
I can not think of any way to make a stronger anti-war message.  We are living this, these people could be us or the ones we love.   What is the good of war?<br/><br/>Other users on this site have commented that the movie is less of a film because the characters aren't developed.   I'm willing to offer that it does not matter what the names of the characters are or where they're from. These soldiers could well have been anyone who has served in the military, or who could be drafted into the military.   Each of them could have been me, my best friend, or your son.   Imagine your 22 year old son in the place of Josh Hartnet's character, would he have felt that way about each man under his command, would he have made the right decisions to save his men?<br/><br/>Others have also mentioned that the film is not entertaining enough because it is constant shooting.   One, this film is not meant to be entertaining, it is to hit each viewer with a square punch of what is going on in the world, and two, that's what war is, there is no bathroom break, no timeouts. These soldiers faced 18 straight hours of pure hell, knowing that each second they could die.   The purpose of the constant combat is to help ram the message home of just how horrible war is.<br/><br/>The comedic relief is also a big plus in this film because it helps show that the men fighting are still human when facing the most inhuman of conditions.   It would be all to easy to forget that the men fighting are real people, but by cracking a few jokes, we are able to continue immersing ourselves in the horrors that they are facing.<br/><br/>This film was an absolutely incredible experience.   I am willing to offer that anyone who did not go home and hug their parents, spouses, friends, or grandparents after seeing this film really needs to get in tune with the realities of the modern world.   The soldiers in Black Hawk Down showed what has made America the great collection of people it is, normal guys fighting for and giving their lives for the good of their nation and for their comrades fighting alongside them.      If only it didn't take a war to get people to exhibit these qualities in day to day life.   Take the message of this film to heart and go out and live every day to the fullest, because the men of the American armed forces have died to give you that ability."

He has captured the chaos, the horror, the courage, the stupidity of war in a way no other movie I have seen ever has. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, something I dont think I have ever done before. The visceral impact of the battle scene is unbelievable, more intense than any movie in my recent memory. This is not a pleasant movie, its not a fun experience, but I think I come out of it with an incredible respect for the people who do fight on my behalf. I cannot imagine what motivates them to make the sacrifices they do."
"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","19 January 2002"," A film that delights, disgusts and delivers on many levels...
","Ridley Scott delivers a gritty, realistic, raw, graphic and mesmerizing tale in the Bruckheimer produced 'Black Hawk Down'. This modern war epic is an effective and thoroughly surreal take on an actual Military operation that unsuccessfully took place in 1993. Scott assembles an ensemble cast with both unknown and familiar faces as he traces back the events that occurred in Mogadishu. In what was supposed to be a routine operation estimated at no longer than 60 minutes, it turned out to last more than 15 hours and is gruesomely immortalized in what is the next step in the art of War on Film. Comparisons will certainly be made to that 'other' war film directed by America's most accomplished filmmaker, 'Saving Private Ryan'. It is imperative to note that despite the films' similarities in themes, their style, aggressiveness and content is completely different. It is known that Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' contained some emotional moments and some tense battle scenes, but in what is one of the most noticeable traits in 'BHD' is its' surrealism. This film transposes the viewer directly into the mindset of a soldier fearing for the end of his life, and thus fighting for it.   Scott's film analyzes an unseen extremity of the war spectrum and casts a whole new take on what could have been a tired tale. It brings us right into a dangerous, fearful and intense world where nothing is predictable and lives can and will be lost in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Due to the success both critically and commercially of Scott's recent films, he has recently resurfaced into the Hollywood scene as a major Power player for the first time.  With 'Gladiator' he showed the world he hadn't forgotten how to make a great film, and with 'Hannibal' he showed us he still could frighten. Anyone remember 'Alien'? With 'BHD', he displays a convocational attitude under the watchful eye of Producer Bruckheimer and conveys a raw and sometimes stomach turning look at the events that transpired in 1993. Within a half hour, our characters are introduced, our sets are laid out and the mission is a reality that is ready to seep through the screens and onto the discerning viewer's watchful eye as all the elements of a great film are assembled to create a truly powerful and unforgettable film. Bearing in slight tone to Bruckheimer's past 'heavy' films such as 'The Rock' and 'Armageddon', the film departs from a 'popcorn-existentialist' viewpoint and transposes the viewer directly into this battlefield that dazzles, disgusts and delivers on many levels. It is easy to see that Scott steered the ship cleanly on this project. Where as in previous Bruckheimer films, there was always a similarity in style despite a change in director - note: 'Con Air'. Here, we see Scott's delightful style protrude the screen as he reunites with Film Editor Pietro Scalia for some seamless 'cutting' and uses his musical composer Hans Zimmer for some ambient music to convey and capture the immorality and horror of the events in the film. From severed thumbs, to severed heads, to severed bodies, Scott makes no attempt at masking the brutality and bloodiness of that ground battle with his shaky Handheld Shots and grainy filters that is unequivocally brought to the screen. The film is fierce, and furthermore it is hyper-realistic. This can be experienced as we actually feel for these characters and their misery, as they lie on the ground alone, getting beaten to death in front of hundreds of Somali militia. We see their dreams and aspirations crumble as many never made it out alive. Besides these qualities, there were two outstanding qualities that must be underlined that serve as catalysts into another stratum of filmmaking.<br/><br/>The first of which is Scott's pervasive shooting style where he captures the majestic fierceness of the epic battle scenes with an unglamorzied eye. The film does not glorify war violence, nor condone it. It stays neutral and captures simply what was in an appropriate and respectful manner in all its' sheer rawness. Furthermore, what struck me to a further extent were the scenes that held the film together. When helicopters were not hovering above and when live ammunition was not being fired on a consistent basis that is when the film's true center shone through. The film's nucleus was the human contact between these soldiers. The intimate and indescribable bond developed between these men who were so bravely fighting for their lives and each other can be seen and felt many times in the film. Despite all the tension, despite all the severed body parts, Scott brought us for a close view of the war through a soldier's eyes, and made us understand what the war was really about, to quote 'Hoots' character in the film, `War is about the man next to you.it isn't about being a hero'.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)"
"pmm1221","10","0","0","19 January 2002"," A Riveting, violent, yet poetic modern war movie
","Black Hawk Down is a brilliant movie.  It is breathtaking, smart, a bit funny a times, and very violent.  But amidst all the violence is a certain beauty and poetry that Ridley Scott brings to the screen in telling the story.  His use of color, light, sound, and falling debris adds to the artistic value.  He makes the act of war almost ritualistic and shows the brotherhood of all the soldiers.  It is a tribute to all the men and women who serve our country and it makes us all aware of what goes on during battle--the harsh reality of war.  It makes you think about why should we be fighting another country's civil war.  What does it mean to be a hero? This is especially relevant in our world post 9/11.  As Josh Hartnett says in the movie, ""No one ever asks to be a hero.  Sometimes it just turns out that way.""  What a tribute this movie is to all our heros.  Those that died on 9/11 and those that are fighting the war against terrorism."

","Back in the summer, I saw the ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" teaser and IMMEDIATELY raced home to try to find it online. I didn't find it, but I did find Mark Bowden's Philadephia Inquirer articles on it, and I was hooked. I ordered the book.<br/><br/>I don't know if I suffered from reading the book three times in the last six months had anything to do with it, or whether all the great reviews I've read had built up my expectations...I honestly TRIED to go into the theater with an open mind. I'm trying to see how great this movie was...I'm trying to look at it as if I'd never read the book. I'm actually thinking of seeing it again to see if I like it better.<br/><br/>The truth is, I kept waiting to feel MASSIVE anxiety watching this movie, and I never did. Maybe I have too vivid an imagination. Maybe I've played way too much Counter-Strike. Maybe my home theater and my DTS copy of Saving Private Ryan is just too good, and I've become de-sensitized to movie depictions of war.<br/><br/>God, I really wanted this movie to be special. I didn't think it was.<br/><br/>
--Not to take anything away from our men and women in uniform...those people have my utmost respect and appreciation for defending us.<br/><br/>--and not to take anything away from Ridley Scott.  I STILL think Alien is the scariest movie ever made, and I was one of the seven people that LOVED Legend. This is the guy who gave birth to Blade Runner.<br/><br/>But man, I have to admit I was let down by Black Hawk Down on a number of levels.<br/><br/>The setup was nice. Great music, great shots...and when the guys take off initially to Stevie Ray Vaughn's rendition of ""Voodoo Chile (slight return)"", I was GEKED.<br/><br/>But these guys that say it's like a two hour version of the first twenty minutes of SPR are exaggerating, imho. In SPR, I FELT the Americans being HAMMERED on that beach. I've read a couple of things some of the rangers who've seen the movie (and gave positive reviews to)have written about it, and they claim that the movie only has about 1/10th of the bullets flying that the actual battle had. The book made it seem like it was just withering walls of lead and rpgs--just a horizontal HAILSTORM of bullets so thick you could actually SEE them. It depicted it as ABSOLUTELY merciless and relentless.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the way the Somalis were ""stylized"". Not that I know any better because I wasn't there, but these guys all dressed in black, with aviator shades and bandoliers--seemed to me like a half-assed way of putting a face on the enemy. All the pictures I've seen of these guys show them as just skinny dudes in second-hand clothes with guns. No bandoliers, no swagger, just bony khat junkies with weapons that looked way too big for them. Hey, maybe I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Speaking of aviator shades, wtf was up with Sam Shepard and his? On again, off again. Was this the Bruckheimer influence? That seemed a little more Hollywood than Fort Benning.  I have a world of respect and admiration for Shepard as both an actor and playwright, but General Garrison didn't sound like the kind of guy who wore shades INDOORS.<br/><br/>I have to admit, this was the first time I've heard a Vulcan cannon spool up in a film--truly a powerful sound. --but every time they showed the effects of it, it was just squibs under some extras' shirts. I was under the impression that this thing literally SHREDS people. My point is, it seemed unrealistic and anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--I'm not disappointed because I didn't get to see people get shredded. It's just that if you're going to portray war accurately, I think you should portray war accurately.<br/><br/>And I have to mention the rpgs.  In the film, a Somali militiaman fires the rpg that takes out Cliff Wolcott's helo ON THE RUN WITH A GUY BEHIND HIM. From what I've read, the Somalis had to rig special deflectors on the back of their launch tubes to fire upwards because the backblast could seriously injure, if not kill you. They also had to build pits to divert the backblast, so they fired upward from stationary, pre-determined positions. Does having the Somali fire the rpg on the run justify poetic license just enough to ignore reality?<br/><br/>When the troops received the go-codeword for the mission, ""Irene,"" in reality, they were already aboard the helos. They got on them nearly every day, and were usually ordered to stand down.  What a great opportunity to show the heat and boredom of the same old daily grind, only to have the rangers shocked out of their false sense of security by an authentic go-code. What a perfect way to start their disorientation--with the mission. Instead, we got a hundred guys running out to the helicopters, guns in the ready position. Sounds like Bruckheimer. If Michael Bay had been directing, they would have swaggered toward the camera in slow motion, shoulder to shoulder, in a glorious telephoto shot, waves of heat rising from the asphalt ala Armageddon or Bad Boys.<br/><br/>Then there was Private Blackburn's fall from the helicopter. Why switch from Sgt. Eversmann's point of view to the objective when it would be much more shocking and disorienting stay with his point of view, have him rope in and just FIND Blackburn lying there in the cloud of dust, as he did in the book? Why take poetic license to JUSTIFY Blackburn falling off the rope with the Blackhawk dodging (DODGING?) an rpg fired from forty feet away? Does it make it more dramatic? Does it make it more dramatic enough to change the facts?<br/><br/>
No one can stylize things the way Ridley Scott does. But I've never seen a war movie that was LIT so well, or suffering soldiers look so cool. I actually was distracted from the story by it...""wow, cool green glow on Eric Bana."" It looked good, but I never got the feeling that the form, the IMAGES were used to express the relentless anxiety these soldiers must have felt, alone, surrounded, teetering on the edge of despair and desperation. It seems to me that it was usually expressed through dialogue and/or by scene.<br/><br/>I guess all in all, I expected the thing just to HAMMER me from the git-go, to ratchet up in intensity, and to stay there for a while. I only got bits and spurts of fear here and there, interspersed with exposition.  It was start/stop all the way. ENOUGH WITH THE EXPOSITION! I think they took too many moments to explain EVERYTHING that was going on to the audience (I'm guessing this is another fine example of Bruckheimer's continuing contempt for the intellect of the masses), and didn't just make something seamlessly horrific and unrelenting, the way it was for the soldiers. The film did not need the Atta kidnapping sequence; it was a redundant attempt to justify to the audience the American presence in Somalia--as if we needed one after the opening scene of starving and dead Somalis. We could have spent less time in the command center--less exposition, shorter, tighter bits of dialogue with General Garrison outwardly stoic and inwardly on edge. Why have any exposition at all other than saying at the top of the film, ""This Story is True,"" and then depicting the facts in all of their undeniable horror?<br/><br/>The story could easily have been told, and told more honestly imho, without losing any truth in the portrayal of the events of 10/3/93, if it had focused constantly on the men under SAVAGELY intense fire.<br/><br/>
Where were the women and children used as human shields? Why didn't they spend more time on the truck driver with the unexploded rpg lodged in his torso--he was STILL ALIVE when that happened--what a great opportunity to express the DIRE PERIL and unique absurdity of their situation. Instead, it was treated as a just another brief novelty of war.  Where was the wounded soldier who was blown out of his Humvee by an rpg and then RUN OVER by the following truck? Where was the ox that was shredded by gunfire? Where was the guy riding the cow with the AK? Where was the soldier hiding behind the tiny piece of pipe protruding from the road while his buddies burst out laughing? Where were the two Somalis with the machine gun in the middle of the road who WOULD NOT DIE? Where were the flashbang grenades? Where was the indestructible old Somali man with the big white afro? Nearly all of the Humvees and trucks had flat tires and were nearly in pieces when they returned to the airbase, not just a few bullet holes.  Dominic Pila, god rest his soul, the sergeant who did the impression of Captain Steele and got a bullet in the neck while operating the .50 cal in the lead Humvee, in reality, was shot in the face, and the entire back of his head was blown off. All of these events serve to demonstrate the horror AND the absurdity of war on their own merit, AND THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  The point isn't that all of these events should have been in the film; the point is that there were a lot of neglected and missed opportunities to take the audience deeper into the living hell in which these men were stranded.<br/><br/>And what was with the huge, poetic, sum-it-all up but momentarily throw realism to the wind, cast of a thousand Somalis standing atop a burning hill doing nothing while the American soldiers run away shot? This is a story that doesn't NEED editorializing, that doesn't NEED poetry.<br/><br/>
I truly, honestly wish I could have seen it the way most of the people who are raving about it did. I really wanted to see it that way. I was looking forward to seeing it that way. I'm not disappointed because I have some twisted bloodlust--I just believe that if you're going to express the horror of war--as Bowden did in his book--that you don't hold back. These guys fought and died for all of us. I just think they are due having their story told as graphically and as gut-wrenchingly and as honestly as possible. Despite the fact that 19 US soldiers died and over 70 were wounded in action, the mission was completed successfully; it was in fact, a victory. Mentioning that might have been a better cap to this film than the thin irony that Aidid died the day before Garrison retired.<br/><br/>The soldiers had it bad in the movie. They had it A LOT WORSE in the book.<br/><br/>
I've just read this review, and I think I may sound a bit like those guys who quibbled over details about the adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. I hope I'm wrong. None of the above changes were made to condense time. And Black Hawk Down was about REAL people, who suffered unimaginably REAL events.<br/><br/>Just my two cents."

","I have read many of the comments and reviews of this film, many view this as a war film. I have also seen many films that say based on a true event...this film is as close as I have ever seen in a film. To really understand the film you really should read the the book its based on ""Black hawk Down"" by Mark Bowden. These are based on real people who died. Some have pointed out that it left out a lot of the political background....if you wanted that, the film would have been at least a week long. However there were some very telling points hinted at in the film...the lack of proper back-up from Washington, the role of the UN in taking sides in the Civil War,the constant pressure from the White House for results etc I was very impressed with the effort to be as realistic as possible.  The comments by some that the jokes were lame....these are recollections of comments by guys in the middle of the firefight. Unless you are in the middle of somewhere where men women and children are trying to Kill you its impossible to make judgements. The antagonism between Delta and the Rangers CO was very well protrayed. Unfortunately our political leaders will continue not to think things true. Over the last 10 years I have seen a growing willingness to look at solutions of sending the troops in as this will solve the problems that arise. In Bosnia the troops were only supposed to go in for a year. They are still there. Could something like this happen there? Although not an American I am amazed to find that so few people even knew about this whole battle as alot of people I have met thought this film was just a work of fiction. Unfortuantely it seems too many people no longer follow anything but movie stars and TV sitcoms."

","""Black Hawk Down"" looks and sounds superb as it tells of the incident by US forces to try and take out members of the Somalian warlord Aidid's cabinet. It's dark and gritty and, with the help of cinematography by Slavomir Idziak, the viewer is launched very effectively into the chaos of the battle. Ridley Scott chose to use tight, sharp sound production values which helps add to the intensity - there's a welcome sparseness of pointless noise and music in the movie.<br/><br/>And so the movie looks and sounds great... but that's not quite enough.<br/><br/>Complaints have been made about the lack of characterisation - and they're entirely justified. None of the personnel are given any depth - at most they become one line summaries such as ""the joker one"", ""the idealist one"" (Josh Harnett), ""the excited rookie"" (Orlando Bloom) and the ""never-seen-combat-before-because-I-am-deskbound"" (Ewan McGregor). Now Scott may be banking that this is enough because we should care for the characters seeing as how they were real people - but that's not a good enough excuse. The script should have decided to either ignore characterisation entirely or deal with it far more adeptly (as other war movies have) - instead it makes such weak attempts that the characters seem one-dimension and hardly a credit to the real men. Anyone who writes this off as saying how men don't stand out in combat may have a point - but for a cinema audience this is not an acceptable response because if we don't care for the people on-screen then the impact of the pretty-explosions matter less and it becomes a giant video-game on screen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Black Hawk Down"" because of the pretty-eye-candy and directorial work of Ridley Scott (who may actually deserve an Oscar nomination for making the movie look as good as it does). However it is disturbingly akin to a computer game in that we never face the true pain of the characters involved. It's left to superior war movies such as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" to deal with the emotional spectrum of war as well as the violent. In the end we have a nice very and very hollow movie - 6.5/10"

"jhaggardjr","10","0","0","27 January 2002"," The best movie of 2001!
","Here's the movie that I'll be rooting for at Oscar time (that's only if it gets a Best Picture nomination which it should). ""Black Hawk Down"" is my choice for the #1 film of 2001. This may be the best war movie that I've ever seen. There have been great war movies made in the past like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Platoon"", but ""Black Hawk Down"" got to me like no other war movie ever made. Maybe the fact that our country is at war right now made me think about our U.S. soldiers and the fight that were in because of the horrible September 11 tragedy. So you can see that this is an important film to see right now. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a powerful motion picture about the true story of a U.S. military raid that went disastrously wrong in Somalia in 1993. Director Ridley Scott shows us the horrors of being in a war and how bloody it can get. It's heartbreaking. ""Black Hawk Down"" has an impressive cast of actors playing the soldiers. Josh Hartnett comes off much better here than he did in ""Pearl Harbor"" as the leader of a squad which includes Ewan McGregor (""Moulin Rouge""), Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""), and William Fichtner (""The Perfect Storm""). Sam Shepard also stars as the major who gives order to the soldiers. ""Black Hawk Down"" has plenty of action but this movie is not about action. It's about war and the soldiers who fight in it. This is Ridley Scott's best film to date. It's better than his Oscar winner from 2000, ""Gladiator"". Though he didn't win the Best Director Oscar for that film (which went to Steven Soderbergh for ""Traffic""), if nominated for Best Director this year, Scott would be my personal choice for the Best Director Oscar for ""Black Hawk Down"", because he did an outstanding job on this film. However, that will be tough to come by (Ron Howard of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and Robert Altman of ""Gosford Park"" are currently the front-runners for the Best Director Oscar). Scott produced the film with Jerry Bruckheimer, and what an amazing turnaround for the long-time producer after the disappointing ""Pearl Harbor"". Remember in my review of that film, I complained that the film was ruined by the directing job of Michael Bay. I had said that Steven Spielberg or James Cameron would have done a better job if one of those guys had directed that movie. Ridley Scott is another one. He could have made that film better too, and his direction on ""Black Hawk Down"" is proof of that. Bruckheimer redeemed himself by choosing Scott to direct this film and he did himself some good in that department. Good job by all. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a great movie that's powerful and emotional. It's my favorite movie of 2001.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

"Sam_Focak","7","0","0","26 January 2002"," A great *war* movie
","I recently took in Black Hawk Down, a film chronicling a US special forces mission in Somalia in 1993.   Originally scheduled for release in March of this year, the studio decided to try and capitalize on the recent peak of patriotism in the States and moved it to January.<br/><br/>They also did something else unusual for a war movie, and opened it in LA and New York for Oscar consideration.   Having seen the movie now, I believe it truly raises the question ""What makes a great movie, rather than just a great genre movie?""<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Black Hawk Down is a great war movie.    Hell, with Ridley Scott directing (Blade Runner, Gladiator) and Jerry Bruckheimer producing (Top Gun, The Rock, Pearl Harbor), you were almost guaranteed a great war movie.    After a brief 20-minute introduction to the situation in Somalia and the mission assigned to the soldiers, you are thrown right into the middle of war.   Not as a spectator, but as a participant.<br/><br/>For the next two hours, your senses are assaulted by a barrage of automatic weapon fire, explosions, helicopters crashing and people dying, and you are right there along with them.   This is no small feat of directing.   Even Saving Private Ryan, which opens with one of the most incredible battle scenes ever put to film, never managed to draw you right into the fight -- there was always that feeling of being a horrified observer.<br/><br/>Nor do you feel overwhelmed by flag-waving patriotism.  The film certainly chronicles some moments of true bravery and heroism, but the entire mission was a disaster, and the movie pulls no punches there either.  The efforts to retrieve two top henchmen of a Somali warlord quickly turns ugly when one of their Black Hawk helicopters gets shot down.  This small group of soldiers was grossly outnumbered and seriously got their asses kicked all over the screen.<br/><br/>Filmed in Morocco, in and around a US military base, the movie maintains its' gritty third-world feel, and I'm certain Bruckheimer used *every* last ounce of pull he had to get the US government to lend four real Black Hawk helicopters to the production, and I'm certain that much of the cool technology we see on display was also straight from Uncle Sam's storehouses.<br/><br/>Yet despite all the attention to detail, despite creating an incredibly intense movie-going experience, I still can't bring myself to call it a great movie.  A truly great movie would have done everything above, and still managed to teach me about the conflict in Somalia.   A truly great movie would have made me care about at least a few of the men who risked, and lost, their lives, rather than assuming I would empathize with them just because they are soldiers.  Quite simply, the movie lacked the heart it needed to be elevated to the next level of greatness.<br/><br/>Then again, with the level of mediocrity in Hollywood these days, just being a great type of movie is still an impressive accomplishment."

","This is certainly the most intense movie in quite awhile. It is pure and simply a war movie without any frills whatsoever. We don't get to know much about anyone, which I think forces the viewer to look at the total picture's view of war and not get stuck on rooting for individuals.<br/><br/>The action scenes are realistic and so gritty that they frankly terrified me. I know I do not have the courage it takes to be a soldier. Added to that is the senselessness of the cause, and the stupidity born of arrogance to assume that Americans are super heroes and Africans are just another incapable enemy.<br/><br/>It chooses to look one sidedly at the conflict, which again forces the viewer to experience the hell these poor guys went through rather than be conflicted by objectivity (in a telling footnote we find out that 1,000 Somali's lost their lives to 19 Americans, and we're kept clear of the hell they went through).<br/><br/>This kind of an approach reminds me of the old Cowboy and Indian movies, where we root for the outnumbered white guys and the Indians are portrayed as layer after layer of killing robots. We never learn about the enemies rationale for hating us; we never see their heroism; we never see their humanity. We are now finding out what that kind of subjective view of the World can lead to."

","I went into the theater with high expectations, and they were more than fulfilled. I definitely did not expect the intense, graphic, realistic violence lasting the entire film, but it definitely works to convey the emotion and mood of the time. Superb acting by Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, and Ewan McGregor. Josh Hartnett gave a pretty standard performance, which is to say that it was good. Not great, not superb, but not horrible. I've never really been a fan of his, and even thought his Pearl Harbor job was somewhat lackluster. Anyways, back to the movie itself. First things first, if you didn't like the first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, the gory part on the beach on D-Day, then definitely DO NOT go see this movie. The first ten minutes in Private Ryan encompass the entire length of Black Hawk Down. It is extremely violent, and not for the weak at heart. Those who can stand it will be struck by the realism and brotherhood between the special forces troops. As is said in the movie, those who haven't experienced it will not be able to fully understand the dedication to each other, and the unit as a whole, that exists in US special forces troops, and all US military troops in general. Overall, great portrayal of war and the hopelessness that can occur, and above all, the hope that those troops can maintain as long as necessary to get everyone home. Great film, and great action.

Can't believe Ridley Scott was behind this mess...I cared for these characters about as much as I care for a piece of lint. The dialog was laughably predictable and unrealistic (as echoed by my younger brother -- a Navy Seal) and character development didn't seem to be on the to-do list for the film-makers. Please, Mr. Bruckheimer, do not attempt to have anything to do with war movies EVER again, OK? Your only talent is obviously with ultra Hollywood shtick, with which you don't do very well either. Blood and guts and neat-o 5th grade computerized bullets do not a good war movie make. You walk out with no real idea of what happened in Somalia, and worst of all, you could really care less.

"backseat-2","Null","0","0","26 January 2002"," Important and yes, entertaining
","This was a very well done technical film, where just about every visual looked appropriately real and the plot development was clear. I do not consider such a tragedy to be a good subject for a traditionally 'entertaining' movie, because it hits too close to home. However, most people have no idea of the reality of pivotal events in history, and films such as Blackhawk Down serve at least to educate. In the same way that Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan educated on WWII events and Titanic brought home the horror of what would otherwise be just another sinking ship in the minds of school children, Blackhawk gives as a vantagepoint from which the folly of misguided military operations since WWII is apparent. Not since WWII has the US military had clear and competent goals and direction, with 'police actions' like Korea, fiascos like Vietnam, aborted efforts like Desert Storm, and the more recent operations being major examples, and Blackhawk shows how and why this is the case.<br/><br/>I understand that many details such as the RPG in the chest, the retrieved hand, and so on are accurate. I wondered about the amazing stream of 'enemy' fighters, coming on in the same mindless swarm as the aliens in the movie of the same name (indeed, on a superficial level, Blackhawk has lots of features in common with that movie; replace the aliens with Somalian militia members, the space station with the city, and you have 90% of the film), yet this detail may also be factual.<br/><br/>A very good movie, but don't expect to enjoy it."
"Brogan","Null","0","0","26 January 2002"," A different kind of war.
","Ridley Scott's BLACK HAWK DOWN is a very unique war film that has appeared on the cinema screen.  First of all it's based on a true incident in which U.S. troops were attacked in the country of Somalia.  But it wasn't a deceleration of war, it was a operation where troops were to aid the citizens of Somalia by giving them food, food that isn't taken by cruel dictator Aidid who is starving hundreds of thousands of Somlaians to death in order to gain power.  It was an operation, a operation that didn't get as much news publicity back when it did in 1993.      The story of BLACK HAWK DOWN is about the operation in Somalia when U.S. troops were to aid the United Nations by feeding and aiding the crippling citizens of Somalia from the hands of the warlord Aidid.  However, when the U.S. troops were to apprehend Aidid, Aidid's troops began attacking on the U.S. soldiers, causing two black hawk helicopter's to crash and to have U.S. troops get involved in the longest ground battle since the Vietnam War.  What makes the story more sad about the mission is that after the helicopters crashed, the mission changed from a arrest of criminal, to a rescue and escape mission.  The troops were all young men, some as young as 18 years old, others were very military experienced, but none were as experienced at the conflict on what they were about to go through. Before watching BLACK HAWK DOWN, I didn't want to raise my expectations.  It's been getting high critical praise and reviews from around the globe on how much of a excellent of a film it is.  I instead watched BLACK HAWK DOWN with an open mind.  I wanted to wait and see for myself and see if it is really a great movie.  And I was also wondering on how can anybody achieve a fantastic war film, when we were given perhaps the best war film of all time only three years ago with Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Well, I am pleased to say that the film does deserve all the praise and business that it's been getting because it is indeed a brilliant piece of work. Ridley Scott makes BLACK HAWK DOWN with it's own unique style for a war film.  First of all it was a mission, not a war, and it didn't take place forty to sixty years ago, it was only nine years.  And thousands of U.S. troops didn't die only nineteen died.  Yet Scott manages to still deliver a solid war film that makes us think differently then next time U.S. troops go on another mission.  Scott makes every bullet a U.S. soldier gets hit with very effective.  Similar to THREE KINGS, every bullet pretty much counts in this film. Scott makes the viewer go through the experience of October 1993 with the soldiers on the screen, from the before the mission begins, to the battles on the soldiers trying to stay alive.  At times it looks and feels like a documentary, that this is all real.  And what Scott also does great is that he doesn't shy away from the violence of the film.  This is a very bloody and violent film.  And what makes it even more disturbing is that you see some of the soldiers get hit and blood is pouring out all over them, yet they are still alive and screaming in pain.  It's disturbing images like that, which will hopefully give the public second thoughts when it comes to the U.S. taking on operations like Somalia. The acting in the film is also very well done.  Sam Shepard as Major General William Garrison, gives the best performance in the film.  You can see that General Garrison is worried and upset on what this mission has become, you also see the change on his face from brave to fear since the mission took disastrous u-turn.  Sam Shepard always gives a great performance in every film that he appears in, but this is Shepard's best role since Chuck Yeager in RIGHT STUFF.  Other good performances go to Josh Harnett (as the young Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann), Ewan McGregor (as the combat rookie Company Clerk John Grimes), Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, and Jason Issacs.  But I was also glad to see a lot of familiar faces of character actors like Jeremy Piven, Ron Eldard, and Richard Tyson (a very underrated actor who should get more big roles like his role in THREE O' CLOCK HIGH).     But what makes BLACK HAWK DOWN different is that you don't get much of a character study on these people.  There are no cliche scenes like a soldier holding up a photo of his pregnant young wife, or another soldier waiting to go home and take over the family farm, etc.  No, that's another unique thing about this film is that Scott gives the viewer little information or details about these men's backgrounds.  Yet, he still manages to have us care and be concern when these men are surrounded by hundreds of armed Somalian citizens.  Is it because they are Americans?  Or humanitarians trying to do something right?  Or would we do the same thing if we were in their situation? BLACK HAWK DOWN is without a doubt one of the best films of 2001, and along side with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as one of the best war films of all time.  Where some directors take a side on the viewpoint of a war or mission (an example would be any John Wayne pro-war film), Scott like Spielberg, instead tells the viewer with his film, that he's not going to take a side on the Somalia issue on whether it was a success or not.  He's going to tell you the facts, and you decide on whether it was necessary, or not for the U.S. troops to be in Somalia.  It's a war movie that makes you think, and also live the experience.  And one more note on this film for Ridley Scott: I personally think it's his best work since the original ALIEN, if I was him, I would be very proud of this film.  I know it's a bold statement to make since Scott has also made other great movies like BLADE RUNNER and GLADIATOR, but when you watch this movie, you too would hopefully understand on why this is a fantastic film.  And it will hopefully forever change your viewpoint, like it did for me, the next time our U.S. soldiers go out on a operation. ***** (out of five)"

","As I said above, Black Hawk Down is a good war film. One of the best, in fact. The action scenes (or basically the entire movie) were great, and really gave me a sense of realism. Watching it in the cinema, it is very exciting, and you might actually end up trying to dodge some of the RPGs that come flying towards you (at least, on screen). The best part is probably when the first Black Hawk goes down. However, the film's one flaw is that you never get to know any of the characters. Now, as others have said, it's realistic in that you don't get to know the soldiers in all of the chaos of war, and I stick by that. However, I want know only a tiny bit more about them, so at least I get to know who just got killed, or who just got narrowly missed by a stream of bullets. Also, I know it's based on real life, but how did the UN troops only loose 18 men when surrounded by thousands? Other than those two things, this movie is one of the best war films ever - about equal with Saving Private Ryan, I think."

It was both super-accurate and incredibly well directed, definitely on the same level as such movies as Saving Pvt. Ryan and The Thin Red Line, if not higher. It very effectively demonstrates the heroism of many of the US army delta and ranger soldiers during the Somalia conflict in 1993, and though it makes you question American foreign policy during that period and in that conflict, it also has a very pro-american patriotic feel to it.

","I give this film 10 out of 10, something I never do.  This film is simply an incredible experience.  Ridley Scott has truly captured the art of depicting modern war on film.  The performers were superb, standing out on occasion, but never becoming individuals.  They remained part of the team.  And that is what a group of soldiers in battle is, not a collection of individuals, but a team where selfless courage produces heroism.<br/><br/> I've read several reviews stating that the characters need more development and don't stand out.  Let me say that if the characters stood out more, then you wouldn't be looking at the real army.  If you want characters that really stand out, then watch a fictional depiction of war.  Men don't stand out on the battlefield.  It is only after, in retrospect, that heroes can be identified.  And to those claiming that they don't get to know the men well enough to care about them:  These are real United States Army Rangers, Delta Force, and Night Stalkers out there.  You should care about them simply because their our men who fight and die for the freedom we enjoy.<br/><br/> If there is a flaw to this film, I think that it is perhaps shorter than it should be.  The reason I say that is because the night in the city seems to go incredibly fast.  Having read the book twice, I think this is perhaps the more critical part of the story.  However, the film does a very good job of showing how desperate the 15 hours in Mog were, so perhaps the length is just right.<br/><br/> I have to commend all involved in making this incredible film.  But even more deserving of commendation are the men of the Rangers, Delta Force, and 160th SOAR."

","SPOILERS Ridley Scott's noisy, pointless war epic Black Hawk Down is an interminable mural of killing, famine, bleeding and devastation that tries to outdo Saving Private Ryan without the creative genius or historic magnitude that made that film an instant classic. Based on a massacre during the war in Somalia in which a troop of U.S. soldiers and two crashed helicopter crews fought for survival while trapped behind enemy lines for 15 hours and surrounded by armies of hostile savages, the film examines the grit and heroism of boys waiting to be rescued after an idiotic military blunder. Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard are some of the actors lost in the carnage and gore. They are fine, but so what? Limbs explode, guts spill and blood splatters in an endurance test that is numbing, but nothing new. In war, there are a thousand ways to die. Ridley Scott deserves no medals for forcing us to suffer through EVERY single one."

The Americans stayed to try and help by getting rid of the warlord behind the hi-jackings.<br/><br/>What follows is the sort of thing that Custer would have been proud off, 10,000 p***ed off somalians vs 81 US troops, any one need a quick math lesson here.<br/><br/>Some excellent direction leads to some excellent acting from the lead Josh Hartnet (Pearl Harbour, The Faculty) and a few notable actors (mostly Brits but with accents as shocking as Tom Cruise in Far and Away) put up sterling performances Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting, Pearl Harbour) Ewan McGregor, Jason Issacs (The Patriot, Armageddon), Tom Sizemore (Heat, Pearl Harbour, Red Planet), Ron Eldard (ER, Sleepers) and William Fichtner (Armageddon, Pearl Harbour). They are believable (for the most part) and for reasonably unknown actors with the exception of McGregor you wonder where they have been hiding.<br/><br/>As I tried to show most of them have worked with Jerry Bruckheimer and this probably helps their portrayal of a unit of troops and as you will see the one who hasn't (McGregor again) is one who has never been in the field with them.<br/><br/>Its worth seeing, not too long for the subject matter but i suggest not taking in a big drink, oh and concentrate, the first 5 minutes are narrative, but in subtitles, and it sets the whole scene.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Seeing as this film is based on real events,  and real people, please remember these comments are made from a cinematography point of view by a person who's never seen combat, and god willing never will.<br/><br/>
In the same way as monster movies hit a new level with Jurassic Park, War films did the same with Saving Private Ryan. I would put this film on a par with SPR, in other words both great films. Imagine the battle scene from SPR and make it about 2hrs long, add another 20 mins at the start to set the scene and you end up with Black Hawk Down. I don't know if it was just living in England at the time or what, but I don't really remember seeing much about the action it's based on, on the TV or in the papers, and if I hadn't heard it mentioned that it was based on a true story I don't think I would have known. Anyway to the film, it's the story of a group of Delta Force soldiers and US Rangers who are dropped by chopper into Mogadishu, (the capital of Somalia), with the aim of capturing the warlord's, Farrah Aidid's closest advisors, with the intention of shortening the civil war.<br/><br/>The plan is they go in with the cover of helicopter gunships and the larger Black Hawk choppers, which are to give cover while the troops are lowered to the ground.<br/><br/>In theory the aim is to get in and get out in about 30 mins, the building where the targets are located is highlighted by the driver of a car, so it seems a straightforward plan. However with the local melitia groups intent on shooting anything non indigenous, the plan starts to go wrong when a Black Hawk is shot down. The tropps are then put in the situation of trying to establish a perimeter around the downed aircraft whilst trying to remove the captives from the town. Futher complications are added when another Black Hawk, trying to give cover to the rapidly spreading soldiers, is also shot down.<br/><br/>The camera work is great, some hand held stuff, some Point of view with the soldiers and with the choppers, gives a feeling of the enormity of the task ahead of them.  ie shots of crowds of locals heading for the fallen choppers with about 6 Rangers and Delta Force troops, trying to get there first and hold them off.<br/><br/>Although the character development is overlooked a bit, it's the sort of film where you don't really want 45 mins of the life story of each soldier, it's an action film, where the action kicks off about 20 mins into the film and doesn't stop. Still there are some good performances, from Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Sam Shepard and Ewan McGregor especially.<br/><br/>
The film does a good job of showing what war is to most people, bloody, dangerous, noisy, quite often pointless and mostly done for no good reason other than some guy who's not in the action says it's a good idea. It makes you wonder what the soldiers who were there, think of it, given the hollywood penchant for artistic licence. It must have been a very hard film to actually bring to life, without re-writng history too much. Yes I know some cynics might say that's never stopped Hollywood before, given films like U-571, but to me Black Hawk Down is a great film, with great perfomances, with a story line made even more dramatic due the fact it actually happened. Being more contemporary than SPR it will no doubt have more of an impact on todays audiences, but young or old, whether you've seen combat or not, this film cannot fail to have an effect on you one way or the other.<br/><br/>
Definatley worth a view, no matter what you think to war films."

","The wonder of Scott's storytelling is overpowering.  We see the Somali mission quickly bog down in the politics and befuddlement of a civil war, played in the photographic beauty, golden light and mid-eastern music that frames this marvelous film.  This is one of the few films I can recall that is better than the book, more clearly illustrating the confusion, dirt and bloody fright that the young soldiers experienced.<br/><br/>Many films have been made about modern war, but few have had the solid ring of truth that Black Hawk Down emits.  In ""Saving Private Ryan"", Spielberg brilliantly played the awful chaos of combat against the fact that there was a truly noble cause, a clear goal, and a path to true victory.  For the US Army troops in Somalia, there was no solace in such hope for great outcomes, only the need to survive and bring your buddies with you.  Scott shows us what all combat veterans know - gallantry in combat is fueled by camaraderie, even when the initial nobility of just cause becomes a fetid wish to simply escape unharmed.<br/><br/>`Black Hawk Down' is raw, violent and brutal.  Through this art, we armchair strategists are forced to pay some fraction of the price that we so easily ask our youth to cough up.  This movie is a thrilling, fearsome lesson for us, as entertaining as that sudden few seconds when your out of control car takes you backwards across the highway and onto the grass, and as likely to make you sit quietly afterward and thank your stars that you escaped unharmed."
"tara1023","8","0","0","30 December 2001"," Actions speak louder than words
","Warning: One comment below may be considered a ""spoiler.""<br/><br/>
The war film genre used to be men acting and talking like real men through Act I; stoically facing battle until some buck private gets killed at the end of Act II; the young man's death gives them the impetus they need to take that hill in Act III. The dead are glorious heroes sadly remembered and the living are sad heroes going home to their girl and mom's apple pie.<br/><br/>
Then came Stallone and Norris and endless slow-mo machine gunning and blood splattering. The good guys are the ones that hit their targets, the bad guys don't. Rah-rah.<br/><br/>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a noble attempt to infuse some of the humanity back into the genre. That first twenty minutes or so left me shaking so badly I could barely see the next two hours or so of manly men doing their duty. But, while we knew the name of that buck private leading our men to heroism, he didn't have a face until the last half of Act II so caring about him was harder. Why should these heroic men we've been following since they landed on that bloody beach die for this faceless Ryan guy?<br/><br/>That's a question nags many, many times during the long course of BLACK HAWK DOWN. Why are soldiers willing to risk death to protect and ultimately retrieve the corpse of a comrade? Well, I now have a slightly better, if still slippery, grasp on the answer. Why? Because. Yeah. That's it... Okay, there's a little more to it than that, but I think it's a personal answer, better discovered on your own, and BLACK HAWK DOWN may be the film to let you do just that.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes or so of the film sets up a few of the characters. No, there is no deep character development, the brush strokes are light, impressionistic, but it works here. We know that most of them are painfully young, full of bravado and BS, most are in their first tour of duty, and most haven't fired a gun off the practice range. More importantly, we know they've got family and loved ones, they've made friendships within their groups, and they play Scrabble and laugh at stupid jokes. They're very, very human and they are our brothers, sons, husbands and fathers; do we really need to know what personally motivates each and everyone of them? Their actions speak louder than any words they might offer, and that's where Scott gets it right. As with most films in this genre, the dialogue is often too heavy and shop-worn, but the strength of BLACK HAWK DOWN is in the actions and reactions of young men as they are caught up in a situation that goes from... Well, ""bad to worse"" doesn't begin to describe it. A General tells us that we've just ""lost the initiative"" and in short order we've arrived at the seventh level of Hell. We don't need to be handed some trite definition of bravery and courage when we can see it and feel it for ourselves on the screen. Thankfully, with the exception of one groaner at the end for the slower audience members, Scott keeps his film sermon free.<br/><br/>
The most important thing to remember during the course of this film is that we are watching events that, for the most part, happened. When two ""Deltas"" insist on being allowed secure and protect a crash site with no known survivors, alone, with no promise of back-up, against an advancing, armed, local mob, remember that they don't do this because some screenwriter thought it sounded good, or some director or producer thought it would amp the scene, we see it because **that's what they did.** Their actions alone are why this film should have been made. That these sweet faced, all too human and all too young men are not only somehow capable, but *willing* to face whatever is thrown at them is what BLACK HAWK DOWN is about, and no matter my personal feelings on war and warriors, I left the theatre with nothing but awe, sorrow and gratitude for them all, wherever they may be tonight.<br/><br/>For those of you who are considering seeing this movie only for a certain actor -- as I did -- I encourage you to go, but you might be disappointed. This is an ensemble film and the action is fairly evenly spread out. Josh Hartnett has a few more lines than anyone else, but I find it patently ridiculous that the PR machine is trying to push any particular actor in the Best and/or Supporting actor for this film. Both Hartnett and Ewan McGregor do well, but are no better than any of the other fine actors in this film. It's obvious that those two are being pushed forward only because they have names the public now recognizes. If they're really looking to hand out a statue for acting here, Tom Sizemore is long overdue for such recognition and he gives a standout performance."
"dbdumonteil","5","5","16","12 March 2005"," Ridley Scott + Jerry Bruckheimer: a so-so war movie
","The third movie made by Ridley Scott in less than two years after ""Gladiator"" (2000) and ""Hannibal"" (2001), ""Black Hawk Down"" is a movie too much for him just like it's a movie too much in the genre of the war movie. Yes, I know it enjoys a very good mark on this site (7.6 out of 10) but I don't think it is fully justified and by writing a very mixed review about this movie, I will surely provoke an angry response from its admirers.<br/><br/>I think I know why the director was interested by the presented topic which is besides a true story: the critical situation of an American army who after a failed military operation finds herself besieged in a town full of Somalians armed to the teeth. Scott attempted to make this tragic episode authentic and for this he doesn't pull his punches. It's true that visually and technically his making is breath-taking. The dramatic evolution of the conflict, the shooting and fight sequences are carefully shot with style. The thread of the story is perceived by several bunches of soldiers but we are never out of one's depth. Moreover, the film-maker depicts with a very straightforward and gritty way √† la ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), atrocities of war. The film includes quite a lot of shots with bloody faces or ripped bodies which are difficult to forget.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" showed similar horrors during its first half an hour. ""Black Hawk Down"" stretches them during about an hour and a half (only the beginning is devoted to the introduction of the most important characters and to the careful preparations of the operation) and this is where things go wrong. Scott wants to impress and insist on the tragic nature of the war. But by constantly climbing in violence and opting for (very) realism, ""Black Hawk Down"" gradually becomes monotonous to watch. Sometimes, one can feel that the machine turns without gripping and the whole is lackluster. Ultimately, you are never really touched by the hardness of the fights and the soldiers' distress causes more indifference than sympathy.<br/><br/>If Scott's making is awesome (in spite of the reserves we can have about it), one can't say the same thing for a repetitive screenplay which tends to fray throughout the movie. It tries hard not to keep turning over the eternal clich√©s about war (and for once, they aren't too overwhelming). But it is overall weak for other reasons. For example, the dramatic extent of the conflict is always perceived from the Americans' point of view. In front of them, the Somalians always seem to be distant. We virtually don't know what they think or feel. They just keep on fighting against their adversaries. In another extent, some characteristics of the script testify the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's signature like dominating patriotic feelings but also a salutary image from the USA eager to put an end to Aidid's dictatorship in Somalia and for this don't think twice before directly intervening in the country.<br/><br/>There aren't big surprises at the level of the cast. It's just an adequate and tailor-made casting with actors accustomed to act in action or war movies like Tom Sizemore or William Fichtner. For them, it's business as usual and they act military characters like the ones we can imagine. However, one can't say that there's a sole main character but several which brings a little of credibility and neutrality in the story.<br/><br/>Overrall, if we could compare ""Black Hawk Down"" to a present, this is how it could be presented: the wrapping is alluring but what the box contains is hollow. We just retain Scott's spectacular making and the bloody effects. And for Bruckheimer, it's just potboiler for him."

","I've never seen a movie like this before. It's a movie without dialogs. Chaplin's movies had more dialogs than this. I love histories of movie that always put ""yankees"" as the heroes and savers of the world. But is that true? Did that episode happen? Anyway, this is a very deep movie if you think that the actors had to achieve a very complicated script: ""Aghhh"", ""uhhhh"", ""Roger, roger"". Really, very very difficult. I really don't know why Scott make an imperial movie like this, because he's really capable of doing better stuff, although we're becoming more and more super production lovers, movies without messages. This is a typical northamerican (I hate when you call yourselves ""Americans"" because you're actually northamericans) movie with the message of: ""we had to suffer but we killed everyone with 3 persons because we're the savers of the world"". I think this is a documentary that must be in the ""History Channel"" because as stated above. That channel is always cleaning the NORTHamerican history."

I want my money and my two hours and twenty four minutes of my life back.<br/><br/>What tries to come over as an anti-war movie delivers a patronising effort with a strong good guy/bad guy element, which anti-war movies should leave out altogether, it's not about whos right and wrong it's about everyone suffering. The comparisons were all too obvious. There were the soldiers fun loving, chidrens book illustrating, old show watching, family men. On the other side you had the grouchy, savage, militia. I am not denying the militia used hunger as a weapon, but the foreign forces there weren't the angels they were made out to be. They probably caused more damage and killed more people than the militia. The assistance by the army in this film is all to obvious. The movie was so slanted. <br/><br/>Another problem was the excessive violence, sure thats what war is, but the movie was so quick to quick to violence, and when it got there  we were immersed in it save for a few quick breathers, that we had no time to learn about the characters. What we did learn was little and scattered. Characters in movies should have more depth than what happened here. You can leave out excessive violence, and give time for the characters to develop while still conveying and anti-war message. Enemy at the Gates is pure testimony to that.<br/><br/>All that was good about the movie was the quote at the beginning by Plato, as I ma a lover of antiquity, the music which was reminiscent of Gladiator the better of the two by Scott. I was pretty ticked off at Eric Bana for doing this, if he hadn't made up for this with the mildly amusing Nugget, and the intellectual Hulk, I would have disliked him intensely. McGregor continued his run of bad movies such as Star Wars Episode I and this, making up for it with Episode II. And how could Orlando Bloom do the original (and worthy nearl three hours Lord of the Rings) and then do this churned out propaganda, thankfully he more than made up for it with the other two in the Rings triology.

"filipemanuelneto","3","3","9","18 December 2016"," Boring and confusing American propaganda
","This film is based on an actual US military operation that went wrong and left several US military personnel surrounded by hostile forces in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. The film tries to portray the facts, but I do not know how faithful it was to them. Its likely that much of it has been subverted to emphasize the dramatic effect. It's a war movie, so it's full of intense fighting and fighting scenes. They are the strongest part of the movie, and were truly well made. Through these scenes, its very easy for the public to move to the scene and fight alongside the gi's.<br/><br/>The major problem with this film is its inability to convey the lesson learned by the Americans in Somalia. The lesson is that America can not be the police of the world, and that it should not interfere in the internal problems of other countries lightly, as it did in Somalia (and other countries, usually with the worst consequences). The film never reflects on this either on the bad consequences of war, or from ill-thought military operations. It's just an excuse for a war movie with Americans dying and killing enemies like sparrows, which removes the film from any depth or meaning. If you had chosen to think about it, it could easily be compared to an ""Apocalypse Now"", for example. This iconic film speaks not only of the Vietnam War but also of how war affects all, winners and losers, for the worse. There is a profound message behind this film. There is no such thing here. It is a war movie that justifies itself, and loses quality with it. The film does not even dare to show the failure that was truly the American intervention in Somalia. At this point, it is simply advertisement. It is a propaganda piece to the heroism and blind patriotism of the Americans.<br/><br/>The cast plays a fairly reasonable role, but with a script condemned at the start and highly partial, we can not expect miracles. The characters are very poorly developed, to the point that the public quickly loses the notion of who is who in the ray of the film. Losing that feeling is halfway to losing interest in what is happening. But as I said, the movie's strong point is action, and everything else was kind of relegated to the background by the production team. It's a good looking action movie or a movie that attempts to show real military combat. But compared to other war films, it's pretty primary, it gets boring and confusing, it does not appeal to everyone and it's easily forgettable."

Because in reality this was just an excuse for Scott to create what boils down to a two-hour gunfight. What story there is is paper thin and the plot is set out on a plate for the audience in the first 5 minutes, probably because if it wasn't nobody would understand what the feck was going on for the next two hours.<br/><br/>Character development is virtually non existent, plot development is so clich√©d and hackneyed so as to be almost irrelevant to the movie, because what this is really about is CGI pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>This a boys film for white boys(I think there is one female character in the whole film who is on screen for about 5 seconds, and one black character on the US side), and you would be hard pressed to tell any of the characters apart as they shout, shoot and blast their way through this insidious pile of crap.<br/><br/>Why insidious? Well, the Americans / The Goodies, are fighting the Somalies / The Baddies. The Americans are 99.9% good, white wholesome American boys, with one black face we see a couple of times. The Somalies are evil, violent and nasty black men. Can you spot the sub text? Its not hard to read into the movie a feeling that the great white American, whatever the pressure will fight and beat the black menace, wherever they are in the world - in Africa searching out evil warlords, or back in the US battling evil African America gangsters.<br/><br/>Utter rubbish - the worst film I have seen for many years."

"wrathofvengeance","10","2","5","11 February 2018"," The greatest depiction of modern warfare ever filmed
","Ridley Scott has achieved what very few Hollywood directors could do; the ability to bring to life the visceral intensity and chaos of urban street combat, and to do it in such a way that tinkers exquisite cinematography and imagery that is both visually pleasing and mind blowing. Everything in this movie from the aerial shots to the close ups of soldiers wailing against a wall as they press their faces into the sandy cinder block surface whilst carefully peeking around a corner is expertly accomplished and brilliantly choreographed in such a way that the entire style of filming resembles a thematic dance to the retina. That's the thing about Scott....his capacity to absorb visual composition with image translation and process it in such a way that its blissful to watch. <br/><br/>I won't get into the details of the raid or the mission as that's left for the viewer to find out, but I will elaborate on what type of movie this is. It's not your ordinary war movie where there's a sweet lovable young handsome male with a loving family and a pet dog and a caring girlfriend who wishes him the best and sends love letters. That's called sentimentalism, and that's out the window. Black Hawk Down is sharp and straight to the point, there is no time for back stories or emotional connections to the characters, because real war movies with a focus on blood and battle disregard that silly trivia as nothing more than what it is...trivia. This is by far the greatest testament to the modern American soldier ever filmed, mark my words on that. Until something as impressive, visually encapsulating and combat orientated comes to pass, nothing is topping Ridley Scott's raison d'etre of war movies. Black Hawk Down is one for the ages."

","That film is revealing about the vanity that leads to military defeat. The vanity of going out for three weeks and launching an offensive at the end of the sixth week to prove things are progressing and improving. Indeed. But vanity it is when one forgets Somalia is not a baseball court, or is it field we should say? And it was in 1992-1993 a civil war and nothing else and Americans were not welcome in that mess. Vanity to the point of instructing the soldiers going out in that Sunday afternoon offensive that it was going to last about thirty minutes, so that they did not even take their night equipment. And of course the targeted people knew the Americans were arriving and they were ready to welcome them in the bullfight arena of Mogadishu's streets. And one helicopter came down and a second one after that. And dozens of American GIs found themselves trapped in the streets and some buildings with hundreds if not thousands of snipers on the roofs everywhere with rocket launchers and that level of weapons. And then instead of retreating as fast as possible, and the defeat was clear within twenty minutes, or let's say an hour, they insisted on going on and attacking on and on and getting deeper and deeper into the trap. More stubborn than I you die. And nineteen GIs died, but of course what was it when compared with one thousand, at least one thousand, dead Somalis, including children and women. And two weeks later finally Bill Clinton got his feet back on earth and got the GIs out. We can always say those nineteen GIs died in vain and are or were heroes, but frankly what about the one thousand Somalis who were killed on their own soil, and what good did these deaths bring to Somalia or to the world? Nothing, absolutely nothing, except the absolute conviction in the heads of these Somalis fighting for power that they were right since troops were coming from so far away to fight against them and be defeated. As one of them could say, there can't be peace without victory, and I would add there can't be peace as long as foreign soldiers are getting mixed in such problems that are none of our concerns, even if we must condemn these autocratic, feudal war lords and governments in the name of universal human and civil rights, but once again peace and democracy cannot be exported like a bag of rice with weapons and grenades to wrap them in. The film is sadly realistic, though it did not prevent the USA from starting again in Afghanistan and in Iraq. When will simple sanity come back to the minds of American leaders?

","The exciting Ridley Scott combat actioneer ""Black Hawk Down"" ranks as one of the best military movies to come out of Hollywood. Not only does this gritty, engrossing reenactment of real-life gallantry surpass the patriotic, blood-drenched June 6th, 1944 Normandy landing that director Steven Spielberg depicted in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), but ""Black Hawk Down"" also shuns any of those hollow, sentimental, gung-ho John Wayne-style heroics from World War II era movies. From its anti-heroic opening quote by Plato that observes: ""Only the dead have seen the end of war,"" ""Black Hawk Down unfolds as a stark, searing tribute to the valor of elite American troops caught up in deadliest firefight since Vietnam. Not since director Cy Endfield make the memorable 1964 Michael Caine epic ""Zulu"" about a brave handful of out-numbered British soldiers holding off hordes of savage, bloodthirsty Zulu warriors in 1879 has a movie plunged its protagonists in such a suicidal situation. Rarely has a film shown its heroes trapped as tragically between a rock and a hard place as ""Black Hawk Down."" Lensed on location in Morocco by ""Proof of Life"" cinematographer Slawomir Idziak with Pentagon cooperation, this unforgettable, non-fiction narrative about an ill-fated 1993 raid by 123 elite U.S. soldiers into Mogadishu, Somalia, captured the blood, sweat, and fear that Philadelphia Inquirer staff reporter Mark Bowden immortalized in his riveting 1998 bestseller. War qualifies as nothing but Hell in the adaptation of the Bowden narrative by freshman scenarist Ken Nolan who sticks closely to the truth in this blow-by-blow chronicle of a good mission gone bad. In 1992, famine swept Somalia, and several sadistic, heavily-armed warlords clashed over control of their East African country while they deprived without mercy their own starving citizens of United Nations food shipments. No sooner had a U.N. peacekeeping force, including 20-thousand U.S. Marines, restored law and order than factional fighting erupted again. General Muhammad Farah Aidid emerged as the notorious culprit-at-large. U.S. Army Rangers and Team Delta Force flew in to arrest both Aidid and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>Although the American forces never nabbed Aidid, they located two of his subordinates. In October 1993, U.S. General William Garrison (Sam Sheppard of ""Swordfish"") dispatched the Delta Force to snatch the Aidid underlings in an urban ghetto right under the noses of thousands of trigger-happy, pugnacious Somalia militia doped-up and itching for action. U.S. Army Rangers ropes in from four Black Hawk helicopters to provide cover for the Delta Force troops as they piled their prisoners into a convoy of Humvees. Practically everything went off like clockwork until waves of Somalias surprised our guys and wielded RPGs, deadly grenade-launching weapons, to blast two choppers out of the sky. A perfect mission which should have lasted a mere 30 minutes bogged down into a 15-hour fiasco as undermanned American troops fought tooth-and-nail to recover their fallen comrades and clear out.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott, whose credits include ""Alien,"" ""G.I. Jane,"" and ""Gladiator,"" pulls few punches in this harrowing, high-octane, bullet-riddle, adrenalin-laced opus. If the sight of guts, gore, and mutilated flesh makes you feel queasy, avoid this nerve-racking exercise in the horror of combat. Scott endows ""Black Hawk Down"" with a raw-edged, documentary flavor that his gifted cast of little-known actors and up-and-coming stars, such as ""Pearl Harbor"" heartthrob Josh Hartnell and Ewan McGregor of ""Star Wars: Episode One,"" enhance with their believable, low-key performances."

","**WARNING**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Riddley Scott again baffles me with his new film Black Hawk Down. Scott has shown time and again that he is an extremely talented filmmaker and director. Alien and Bladerunner are masterpieces of the science fiction genre, and in each of his other films (including Thelma & Louise, Hannibal and Gladiator) his expertise as a director shine through. But, and this is a very big but, his choice of subject matter is rather baffling and disappointing. For example, Hannibal although very interesting in that it is an attempt to bring a form of opera-style story to the big-screen, fails to do justice to the original. Gladiator effectively revived the epic genre. However, Hannibal and Gladiator fail in that they have thin plots and, dare I say, seem very corny at times. This isn't necessarily Scott's fault (no it is the writers fault), but a defining characteristic of a brilliant director is their choice of films (such as Lynch or Kubrick).<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is another example of Scott's poor judgement. It is a very simple story made very complicated by a large number of characters that look alike. In essence, the story is so: it is 1992 in Somalia where the U.N. (lead by the U.S military) try to `help' the starving Somalian civilian population by preventing local warlords from controlling the food supply. Hence, the U.S decide that the best method to achieve such an objective is by using their military might to arrest the leaders of the local militia. A plan is conceived but the practical outcomes are disastrous. Some, or should I say a lot of the Somalians didn't like the American's actions and they fight back.  A Black Hawk helicopter crashes, the ground forces get stranded and separated, and rescue missions become difficult as resistance continues.<br/><br/>
Scott probably chose this movie to show off his skill behind the camera, and admittedly it is impressive. The urban battle sequences are first-rate (if you like that sort of thing); this was helped by the fact he had a whopping eight camera's to use for each scene. The result is we, the audience, are placed in the middle of the horror of urban warfare. This is an admirable achievement.<br/><br/>However, Black Hawk Down has many traits that are less than admirable and even offensive. Principally, the sickening American patriotism was distracting, which completely ruined the movie. A laughable and ludicrous example is when the last of the soldier's get back to safety and the locals applaud them. Additionally offensive is the final listing of the 19 killed U.S soldiers while only mentioning on the side that over 1000 Somalians were killed while not even attempting to name any of the Somalian victims. The movie ventures close to the borderline of racism: I almost left the cinema when the Somalian implied that the gun is their way of life; and why is there only one token African American in this movie? All of these factors utterly destroy this film as an intelligent remaking of an historical event.<br/><br/>
So why does Riddley Scott, who I have to assume is an intelligent person since he can be talented as a director, choose such stupid movies? Is it money? A probable answer, you can't help but wonder about the timing of this film so soon after the tragic incident of September 11 and the distressing actions by the U.S government (and its military) consequently following. Or is he so stupid that he believes in what he makes? I hope not.<br/><br/>3/10, 3 marks for Scott's skill as a director."

The movie simply shows Black Africans as bloodthirsty born savages who needlessly attacked American SOLDIERS involved in a COMBAT operation. For the producers to do justice they could have at least showed why the Somalis attacked the US soldiers. This is where the facts come in: about a month or so before the incident, American helicopters, while hunting for a SINGLE warlord, had come to the town looking for him. The Somali residents did not trouble the Americans then, for after all the Americans were there to help them all out. But in hunting for that SINGLE guy, the Americans, in their classic military tradition, blew up the ENTIRE building that this guy was thought to be in, killing at least 75 PEOPLE, all of whom had LOVED ONES too (and the guy was not even there). So what do you think Mogadishu residents did the next time they saw American helicopters in their neighborhoods? They had to at least try to defend themselves from another mass killing of course. And the vast majority of the Somalis killed by the Rangers were unarmed women and children, a fact the filmmakers carefully disguised. And by the way, for those of you who think the Rangers in Somalia were sweet little angels, I believe that the ranger one who was portrayed by Josh Hartnett is currently serving a thirty-year sentence for CHILD RAPE!!!"

","Black Hawk Down is definitely the worst Ridley Scott film and for many reasons. Some being on the acting side, some on the technical aspect, others on direction and so on. Black Hawk Down though is only colourful in its rich choreography, which to me is what doesn't completely destroy the film, but only supports it on it's last legs. The acting isn't so good and clearly shows especially when the film is watched numerous times. And the funny thing is, that it has a heck of a lot of strong actors for each role but they don't shine. On direction terms i think that it isn't Scotts best and shows us that he isn't capable of directing a well balanced war film. The main issue though was the excessive amount of action that, to me isn't that bad but when it takes over the basis and substance of the story it becomes quite hard to continue watching.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is a big disappointment and reveals Scott's weaker side to direct a memorable war film."
"zhuatenejo","7","2","6","9 November 2009"," A Great War Film but one not based on facts
","The battle depicted in the film is a superbly done heroic depiction. However, as stated somewhere here on the film's web page, Scott nearly did not get the Black Hawks he wanted from the Defense Dept. because they feared the story would not be favorable to them -- and the truth is they had a lot to be worried about. Our incursion into Somalia was not based on helping the hungry people get the food they deserved. Once again, we were trying to interfere with the internal politics of a foreign country, were seen as unwanted interlopers, and thus were treated with contempt by the locals. This is not to take away from the incredibly brave men who gave their lives. Eric Bana's character ""Hoot"" sums it up when he tells the Josh Hartnett character that he is simply fighting for the man next to him and not any political idealism.<br/><br/>The fact is we (the U.S.) was very interested in Somalia's oil reserves and its strategic location in proximity to the Middle East. You have to ask yourself if we were being so heroic why was the entire city against us? Hmmmm.<br/><br/>The film is a great example of how Hollywood promotes propaganda by offering undeniably touching screen heroics as a distraction from failed foreign policies. That was why the Pentagon almost withheld the Black Hawk choppers, equipment that is ironically named after a race our military committed genocide against to the point of wiping them off the map.<br/><br/>For additional context read an on line article by Allison Kilkenny, <br/><br/>""Al-Barakaat: The Little Charity That Could Have Saved Somalia""<br/><br/>at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ allison-kilkenny/ al-barakaat-the-little-ch_b_204270.html."

The dialog of Mogadishu being a ""civil war"" is an idea the rebel forces use in defense of their killings. The American side speaks for the thousands of lives lost calling the rebel's action ""genocide."" The war takes place in the busy urban streets heavily populated with civilians. The American soilders are grossly outnumbered but utilizes tactical warfare governed by the ""rules of engagement."" By this rule, the only way to tell apart civilians and rebels is to see who's shooting at them first. There is no glorious victory for winning the war in this film.

The non-stop battlefield action, complete with relentless gunshots, explosions and bloodshed, makes for a very tense two and a half hours of viewing. Rather than focusing on a particular character or event, 'Black Hawk Down' gives a wider perspective of war - a realistic and hard hitting account of the horrors that take place on the battlefield.<br/><br/>It's far from the perfect war film, however, and it's relentless pace means that not everything that takes place is totally clear. As it jumps from one frantic situation to the next with virtually no respite, it can be difficult to keep up with what's happening and to which characters, especially since the film is largely shot from the ground. That said, the film as a whole functions well as a war account and makes for a tense and absorbing viewing experience."
"zkonedog","5","1","2","11 March 2017"," Very Intense, But Not Altogether Engaging
","While watching ""Black Hawk Down"", I began comparing it to other war movies/series I have previously watched, such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers"", and ""Flags of Our Fathers"". Though the film impressed me with its gritty realism and intensity, there was just something missing that never really [...] me into the plot...a lack of the overly dramatic.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie takes place during the United States Army's attempt to liberate the country of Somolia from dictator Mohamed Farrah Aidid. When the mission begins to stray from its objectives and a Black Hawk military chopper crashes en route, a group of soldiers on the ground are put in extreme harms way in order to rescue their fellow brothers and fully complete the mission objectives.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in its ability to portray the type of warfare not uncommon to the Middle Eastern region. Instead of the beach assaults or air raids common of World War II fighting, the ""modern"" warfare method (at least in the Middle East) includes much more house-to-house, intense personal combat. The intensity of that fighting is aptly portrayed by director Ridley Scott and shows that all fighting in war is brutal...no matter where it takes place.<br/><br/>Yet, despite that realistic take on war violence, I actually thought that the movie suffered a bit from the fact that it didn't really try to embellish the story at all with any added drama. Usually this objective approach in a film would be a good thing, but in the case of ""Black Hawk"" it only adds to make things a bit long and tedious. Scott sticks to the basic details of the military assault, and really never delves into the personal lives of any of the characters or adds any auxiliary drama.<br/><br/>Thus, although ""Black Hawk Down"" is a very gritty, realistic portrayal of modern-day war efforts, to me at least it fell a bit flat dramatically. A little bit of character development or 24-esque drama would have gone a long way towards making it a memorable film experience."
"skepticskeptical","7","1","2","20 September 2015"," Propaganda, Yes. Nonetheless Revealing
","I have watched Black Hawk Down a few times, and despite agreeing with some of the negative reviews that the production is a typical pro-U.S. war film, I do believe that it makes some effort not only to honor the troops who died in Somalia in 1993, but also to suggest how wrongheaded it is for the US military to become embroiled in other nations' civil wars. <br/><br/>It is true that the soldiers depicted all have a swagger to them, and they call Somalis ""skinnies"", and they act as though the death of one of their own is worth many times more than those of the enemy, but I believe that this is how U.S. soldiers view matters, so there is value in being offered some insight into that perspective, as distasteful as it may be. The truth is the truth, and it helps to explain what happened later, in Iraq, as well.<br/><br/>I also find that Black Hawk Down does a good job of capturing the raw emotions of the soldiers as they confront seemingly insurmountable problem after problem. That glimpse into how they process the horror of watching their buddies blown away is bound to be cross-cultural, not unique to this particular group of Americans.<br/><br/>The film does not glorify the mission but instead reveals how pointless it was. The cinematography and pacing was quite good. Even if it did not attempt to reenact a chapter of military history, this production would be worthwhile as an action-adventure movie."
"msvalkyrie","9","1","2","30 July 2015"," Brings back our faith in humanity
","Okay, I was blobbing like a big baby all the way through this film. It's just so emotional and really does bring a tear to your eye. To be honest, what war films AREN'T emotional? Even Jarhead is emotional! But honestly, this one really is sad. <br/><br/>So basically the whole plan to stop the Somalia civil war does sound simple enough...turns out it wasn't a simple as they were expecting. I was constantly on the edge of my seat throughout this film. Because most war films are completely unpredictable. You don't know who will live and who will die. They're that one genre when you don't actually have a clue whether the main character will die or not. <br/><br/>The action is amazing. And it had a few slow motion shots, which you guys know I have a soft spot for. I've only just gotten into war movies. I don't know what drew me away before. It was probably the idea that they're just all guns blazing and no real plot. Which is not true of course, because they are really something special. But that's all I would think, if someone offered to watch a war movie with me. The sort of image that comes into my head when someone mentions ""war movie"" is probably the film version of Call Of Duty. It just seemed like the sort of boring film you would only watch if you were completely blood thirsty on the whole guns blazing kind of thing and you also liked history. It just sounded boring to me. But obviously, not all war movies are actually like that. Most of them actually have depth and are very emotional. This is one of them very emotional war movies. Which is what I like because it has an equal balance between extreme thriller action and the dramatic bits where you are crying your eyes out.<br/><br/>Now, getting me to cry at all is a real mission. But this movie just knew where to pull on all the right heart strings. You're crying one minute over someone who dies, and then someone else dies, and then you're crying again because there is no way they can get out of this, and they're ALL going to die! The most horrible thing about this film is that it's actually based on a true story. This all happened. That guy actually did die and that other person actually does have a loving family back at home. <br/><br/>And like I said about the action. You only have 30 minutes of boring planning and then they're straight into the action for the next two hours! But most of these two hours are filled with so much gunfire and blood shed, you're actually clueless on where it's all coming from. But I guess that's just all realistic. It also adds more to the chaotic effect, it actually makes you feel like you're in the war zone. Especially when you're up at 11 o' clock at night watching this film on your laptop and with your headphones in. With the volume up so loud and the screen so close to your face, you actually find yourself ducking when someone yells ""RPG!"" .... Or is that just me? <br/><br/>It's quite an amazing story actually. Only just under 20 Americans were killed that day while over 1000 Somali men, women and children were killed. This handful of American troops were practically going up against the whole city. It's hard to imagine how panicked the soldiers must have felt when they were up against that many Somalians. And half the time you're wondering, how can they even think when there's that much gunfire going on? I think if that was me, I'd find a quiet corner to go and sit in and quietly cry to myself. But not once did the soldiers loose hope which really amazed me. It was really starting to look like there was no hope and neither of them would get out alive, but not once did they throw down their weapon and say ""never mind this."" Which is exactly what I do with my Xbox controller when I can't get past a certain level on Call Of Duty.<br/><br/>And they never gave up on their friends either. Which really brought a tear to my eye. Especially the tag line ""Leave no man behind."" Because even though they were going through impossible missions and had bullets being fired at their heads while they were having to go up against an entire city, they were still willing to get into even deeper trouble to save their friends who were in the fallen Black Hawk. Now that's what you call a true hero and great friendship. <br/><br/>The acting was incredible. Obviously, if you want emotion, you need a spectacular actor to present that and each actor did it brilliantly. Most war films tend to bring out the best in actors and also surprised by some actors because they don't usually play in action films. It's the chance you get to play a very emotional role while also being able to throw in a little action in there too. This is important because you really need to feel what it is like to be in the middle of a war zone and also actually realize what soldiers go through every day to make sure our lives are better. <br/><br/>So overall, this is a great film. One of my favourite war films actually."
"Christopher_Reid","9","1","2","10 April 2015"," Brutal, powerful, very engaging
","I was perhaps first struck by how modern this movie felt. It doesn't seem like something from 2001. It could have come out in 2015 and I wouldn't have noticed anything odd about it. It's set in 1993 of course so everything is meant to be appropriate for that time. I was also amazed at how many famous actors are in it, many of them before they became big stars.<br/><br/>It's funny to see complaints that the movie is shallow because it supposedly doesn't give enough back-story to the characters. In fact, I find that quite ironic because I often find family scenes in war movies to be the most melodramatic, shallow and unnecessary parts. We know they have families. We don't need to be shown. And that can actually be more powerful. The soldiers themselves might not know much about each other. Maybe they'd like to talk about it and maybe they wouldn't. Black Hawk Down starts and ends where it should. It's a brutal experience that puts us right in there with the soldiers. We are one of them and all of them. There needn't be a main character.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is an epic action film. It is relentless and never compromises its tone and style. It doesn't tell you what to think or feel. There is no preaching or tragedy or politics. It just presents what it feels is an important or interesting story. The acting, special effects, editing, sound are all top-notch. You have to sit back and wonder at how they did a lot of it. It just seems completely real. From what I've read, they did a lot of training and preparation for the film. The real people were consulted with. It makes such a difference and shows that the film-makers cared about doing it right.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were quite scary and painful to watch. I was strongly emotionally affected by parts of it. And it gave a lot of context to see how much emotion the soldiers hold back. At most they might shed a tear. Not because they don't care but because they have no choice but to push on and be tough. I think that's an important sort of thing though. To share some of the inner details of a world most of us will never see but probably fear or dread. I think many people like to avoid it. So to bring it to attention is really positive. We have to have some understanding of what war is actually like. What can go wrong. Some glimpse of how it might affect the people involved. I personally find all of it terrifying and I'm glad I've never had to go through any of it myself.<br/><br/>This movie had me getting furious at all the Somalian people with guns. Where did they get so many weapons? Why are they shooting at soldiers who are just doing their job? They forced the soldiers to kill them. Even women and children. Why are they anywhere near such a violent area? It made me curious about the true story and I'm keen to read more about it.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, Black Hawk Down is a very violent but impressively made film. Not exactly light-hearted fun but important as an intense experience that gives you a better feel for some of the things that are going on in the world. Plus it does have some nice messages about camaraderie and plenty of food for thought about war in general."
"JaydoDre","8","1","2","26 December 2014"," Good action and not much else.
","There is a certain infamous stereotype about American action movies in general and war movies in particular, in which a white main character guns down a legion of faceless incompetent enemies, usually of non-white ethnicity. An additional part to this stereotype is the propagation of some message to give our heroes some great cause as an excuse to kill a bunch of people. Black Hawk Down has good action and presentation but it is also a text book example of such a stereotypical movie. I am not complaining, but it seems the movie claims to being something more than it is and hence a deliberation is in order.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a message about some local Somali warlord using hunger as a terror tool (Somali Civil War from 1990s), but the struggle of the local people and the mission at hand is just an excuse for our gun toting heroes to shoot some stuff. Once introduced, the plot has little to no significance. The rest of the film comprises of situations in which the US soldiers find themselves and the related firefights.<br/><br/>There is a scene in this film where the US folks are surrounded by a group of Africans and these folks are jumping backward and forward, angry and loud. They are made to look like a bunch of incoherent gorillas or pack of hungry rabid dogs.<br/><br/>The movie looks very cool. Helicopters land almost on your head with various cool angles and viewpoints, like the overhead satellite view. Smoke and dirty texture come at you through the screen. There are enough cool firefights and rocket launches.<br/><br/>The presentation is very effective in large part due to the music. Behind it is the Hollywood's top man Hans Zimmer. The action music has Arabic influence but also has some Western distorted guitar mixed in. It is good and could be subsequently recognized in other people's video projects. However it is the involvement of other artists that makes the music special. The sorrowful singing of Baaba Maal, Denez Prigent and Lisa Gerard cuts into your soul.<br/><br/>There is a load of high grade actors in this film, which seems to be in line with other big war movie productions like the Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan, which shows this movie's aim despite it not having the same epic setting. The value of this choice can be put into questions when these guys spend so much of the movie's time covered in helmets, goggles and dust that makes them difficult to recognize.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is pretty good action movie. As long as you do not expect it to be more than a good male-dominated gun fight, it should not hurt to see."

","Ridley Scott directs a muscular retelling of the ill fated mission in the Somalian civil war in 1993. Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining UN personnel and US forces were deployed to capture Aidid.<br/><br/>As always Scott assembles a multi-national cast and future rising stars to tell his story without resorting to war movie clich√É¬©s. This is a full on assault with bullets flying as the crew of the downed helicopter stave off the Somali militia as their comrades try to extract them whilst other US soldiers try to reach the safety of the UN safe zone.<br/><br/>It very much tells the story from the soldiers view and gives a more realistic impression of conflict. It dwells little on the politics but focuses on action but also mixes this with humour even if it might be of the bleak kind. Eric Bana, Josh Harnett give the best performances and good support provided by Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner and Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>This is a strong film, not for the faint-hearted."

I know that the technology of movies with special effects etc are so far advanced and I think many of us get so used to it and take it for granted. In all in ever heard a lot of that war until the movie came out, and I learnt many things from it. It should be shown in schools and make the younger generation appreciate not just the other wars but this awful one also. No doubt there will be some that disagree,which is fine , we all have different opinions. Since that movie came out its intriguing to see how Somalia is doing ,sadly they still aren't at peace.

I paid attention to this conflict until I watched the movie and then it seems I could not get enough information about it.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","1","2","10 July 2013"," ""Black Hawk Down"" dodges all the potential schmaltz with a grit the historical event truly deserved.
","It always surprises me how little Ridley Scott films I've seen. I guess with Alien and Blade Runner as firm favourites, I feel a little more knowledgeable on him than I should be. Black Hawk Down feels more like an exercise in technical skill than storytelling. With an assortment of celebrities and an abundance of characters, it never gets a chance nor tries to whittle them down and study them. But it's not concerned with these people beyond fleeting personality traits as the characters feel as if they come and go and you don't see them again. Perhaps they're simply used an excuse to show as much of the battle as they possibly can with three dozen perspectives. The film doesn't prepare you for what it's about to show. They say specifically, ""we'll be home before dinnertime."" What I didn't expect was the entire film thereafter devoted to the telling (or experience) of a nearly 24 hour battle. It's a deliberate assault on the senses, building on from what Saving Private Ryan's opening started with a constant clatter of bullets and blood gushing to the point where it feels like the movie within a movie ""Nation's Pride"" in Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>Although I can't really be one to judge, no film has truly displayed the chaos of war like this one. It highlights the vulnerability of man in a profoundly moving way as American soldiers are stripped and paraded around a crowd of Somalians. While the editing, sound, cinematography and production design are very impressive, it can get tiresome just watching combat and bloodshed without any clear development or feeling for specific characters. There's empathy, but there's no overwhelming emotional urges. While the first half hour focusing on the soldiers pre-battle feels like trivial conversation in place of set-up, it's clear these scenes were designed to be just as generalised as the Somalian civilians, with subtle parallels drawn to their treatment of order, food and the land. It has interesting pieces of symbolism, such as near the end where a Sergeant attempts to mop up blood from under an operating table and just smears it further, showing how intervention in war can't help. It's a directors film. And although lots of trimming in the middle, a greater resolution and payoff and actual character development could have made it greater, it dodges all the potential schmaltz with a grit the historical event truly deserved.<br/><br/>7/10"
"MildInconvenienceMan","8","1","2","29 October 2012"," Good acting, nice cinematography, great film!
","This film was good, but the story line itself I found not to be that interesting all the time, what it instead had was lots of fighting with some gems among all of the rubble that this film brought. There were just small moments that made it interesting to watch. The other real highlights in this film I though was in the acting, to see such a diverse cast from some real film classic actors right down to some brand new actors, acting side by side with no real significant emphasis put on any one character, which was nice to see the range of characters.<br/><br/>Some of my favourite parts of this film were Ewan McGregor always going on about coffee, and Eric Bana's amazing performance as the kind of lone soldier who is driven by the fight and wont rest until all of the soldiers are safe, however I really did think that all the acting was superb, those were just some of my favourite moments. As stated before emphasis was well and truly diversified right down to characters like Blackburn played by Orlando Bloom being given majority of screen time before the fight to be killed almost instantly, it really did show that in war all are equal, even famous actors supposedly, which really ties into the Plato quote used at the beginning.<br/><br/>The imagery used was another defining feature of this film, such as the switch between military surveillance and just general shots of the troops, it helped to give the whole film a sense of realism. <br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed this film and it really did give a good representation of modern warfare, and this tragic event, every loss of a character in the film was shown and sufficient acknowledgement was given to the dead which was also welcome to see in this film."

The only thing that completely got to me was the blown up bodies and they still fought for life, it really tugged at my heart strings.

","Right as you read this, the Somali civil war is still going on. Since 1991. Twenty one years, with casualties reaching up to 500,000 deaths. There, the REAL hunger games are being played. The rest of the world's interference came up with nothing. Even humanitarian missions are being attacked.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is based on a book written in 1999 by Mark Bowden that chronicles the United States Army Rangers, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, Delta Force, Navy SEALs, and UN forces attempt to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid in Mogadishu and the intense battle that resulted between U.S. forces and local militia and citizens in 1993.<br/><br/>Even though it's a war film, with a lot of continuous action, the cinematography is beautiful and points you to pay attention to the detail. There were a few fast scenes greatly covered and co-ordinated. The whole movie was accompanied with strong ethnic and instrumental music, songs from the 90s and earlier.<br/><br/>What can i say about the cast! It had variety , and talent. With names such as Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Ewen Bremner, Jeremy Piven, Tom Hardy, Orlando Bloom, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and the list goes on. A lot of them have made more than one appearance in various war films or TV series before.<br/><br/>It's a good war film to watch with a lot of information on what's happened and happening in Somalia.

"KnightsofNi11","8","1","2","17 April 2011"," Brutal but incredible
","Ridley Scott seems to make really incredible films, then go through a brief dry spell where he just puts out complete crap. Thankfully, Black Hawk Down is not part of one of those dry spells. It is a visceral experience, especially from a visual standpoint. It tells the story of 123 US soldiers in Somalia attempting to capture two top lieutenants of the warlord who has ravaged the country. It is a mission which should only take a few hours with limited shooting and little to no bloodshed. But things begin to go horribly wrong when one of the US helicopters is shot down, hence the film's title, and crash lands in the middle of the city. So begins a brutal rescue mission that results in a staggering amount of casualties on both sides of the battle. And to make matters more harrowing, it is all based on a true story.<br/><br/>This is a very genre driven film, as are most of Scott's films, and Black Hawk Down is drawn out to a very detailed and specific account of a harrowing and bloody conflict in Somalia. There are a lot of characters and a lot happens in the two and a half hours the film spans. The beginning of the film is all a detailed setup of the situation in Somalia and what the US's current involvement in the conflict entails. We then move on to planning the mission, at the same time getting to know each of the many characters, some better than others. Then the troops set out and the last hour and a half of the film is the actual battle, which is practically a nonstop onslaught of violence and action. But it is all very gripping, very real, and very shocking.<br/><br/>Visually this film is just stunning. The majority of the film all occurs on the streets of a poor Somalian town, but the scenery never seems to get boring or repetitive. Everything moves so fast that it will constantly keep your attention. The film has a powerful demeanor and a driving force that never lets up. I was truly worn out by the end of the film as there is hardly any time to catch your breathe. You just have to keep taking in all the brutal action unfolding before your eyes. This really seems to draw you in even further and you really begin to feel as the soldiers do, just wishing the action would let up for a second so you could cool down. But it never does, wearing down the soldiers, as well as the viewer. I don't know how Scott was able to do this, but he really did create a brutally engaging atmosphere with this film.<br/><br/>Perhaps what really draws you into the action is just how detailed and brutal it all is. Scott shoots this film incredibly well, making sure we get to see every gory detail of the fighting, and while he keeps his cinematography fast paced you can still keep up with what is going on during a firefight. It is sort of difficult to keep up with who is wear and who is fighting who at all times, just because there are so many characters. It is always difficult to develop all of your characters fully when there are so many of them. It is especially difficult when your film isn't exactly a character driven film. Black Hawk Down is not. It is a genre and action driven film that also happens to have a lot of characters. Thus you don't get to know all of the characters as well as one would hope, and yet it is still difficult to watch some of the characters die, because even though we, the audience, don't know them well, you get a very moving sense that the other characters know each other very well, still making the incessant death in this film very impacting.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is, in one word, intense. It is just a nonstop action experience that lets us see every graphic little detail. There are times when you have to look away because it is just so brutal, but you don't want to stop watching the film just because it is that engaging and that gripping. The only thing that would have made this film better would be a little more time and effort spent on the development of the characters, but other than that this is a fantastic film."

But one thought may cross your mind: ""I'm glad I wasn't there"". That ""there"" is Somalia in 1993. A violent, starving city run by a corrupt government. Militia flood the streets. And I'll tell you this right now: few things are more terrifying than the devotion of these militants. They want the American troops out of their city, and they'll stop at nothing to get that message across.<br/><br/>All the actors are excellent.

","Ridley Scotts ""Black Hawk Down"" sets the bar for action/war movies with its intense action scene's, great dialogue, and effects to really show it off.

Hans Zimmer has done the music for this film and it could not be more perfect, capturing the inspired music themes from Africa and turning it into a deep soundtrack, and adding it with audio effects to make it in a way creepy and sad at the same time.

"Rico45-1","8","1","2","21 September 2009"," Keeping it real
","Having served, I appreciated the reality with which Black Hawk Down was presented. For example, the Ranger falling to his death because he missed the repelling rope as the Black Hawk maneuvers to avoids enemy fire, showcases an unavoidable mishap. For me this movie revealed some of the subtle and rarely talked about realities soldiers face daily. It also showcased some of the overlooked political realties. Conflict is conflict; but real combat is a major advantage for real life guerilla fighters. Yes, our soldiers are well trained, but nothing prepares a soldier for combat like combat. Our soldiers do not have the opportunity to fight as much as militia fighters; yet we are always fighting battles in our enemy's backyard creating a distinct disadvantage for our soldiers; and if they loose, for our militaries' reputation. And we always underestimate their (third world guerilla fighters) level of experience. We usually fail to take them serious until they kill one of our soldiers. This arrogant American mentality puts our soldiers at another distinct disadvantage. In one of the scenes the Ranger commander disagrees with the Delta Forces Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) and subsequently reprimands him by telling him, ""you are combat ineffective soldier!,"" for disobeying his directive in front of his subordinates. This may have been the most realistic depiction in the entire movie. Anyone who's been in the Army knows that Delta Forces soldiers are on an elite level rarely seen in any military setting and should be respected as such. It's not that I recommend or condone disobeying orders, I think experience trumps ego's and should be set aside during stressful situations. The egotistical infighting of arrogant leadership may be the military's most lethal killer....of American troops! Ironically, one of the most pronounced differences between the experienced and not so experienced combat soldier, is the level of compassion with which they approach life. Those soldiers that have experienced combat shy away from bravado, while those that haven't actually seen war seek the glory of the stereotypical brave man. This overlooked aspect of military life is rarely exposed, but still puts lives at risk. ""It's amazing what can be accomplish, if it weren't for ego's,"" Ronald Reagan. The method of international target selection also needs to be improved. The U.S. will always be called upon to help other nations with their political mishaps. (And don't discount the difficulties NATO Forces have communicating with each other.) But at some point we're going have to learn to be painfully selective. Don't we owe it to the parents of the young men and women who are, were and will be killed or maimed, to produce tangible results from these skeptical overseas missions? I'm sure they would think so. It's condescending of us (the US) to downplay the patriotism of the families of our nation's fallen soldiers, by nonchalantly selecting insignificant international political targets. Black Hawk Down not only successfully salutes the soldiers involved in the Somalia experience with it's authenticity, it succeeds in showing the audience the always miserable and chaotic circumstances our soldiers face while in the exercise of heated international conflict."

","this movie is great. its sad how so many lives were lost that day. 19 Americans died and 1000's of Somalians died as well. in my opinion, the 2 helicopters that went down and killed many people in them, could have been avoided if they weren't so close to the ground. i think the only choppers that should be that close to the gun fire are the small birds, because its less of a target to hit. this movie had great graphics and sound, and wonderful acting. it has a great cast. Josh Hartnett plays as eversmann and i think that was the best actor to choose for that role. he's great at acting in his movies. he plays a very good leader of his chalk, and the men respect him. Sam Shepard plays as general Garrison and does great."

","Black Hawk Down (2001) Director: Ridley Scott Producer: Jerry Bruckheimer <br/><br/>Watching Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers risk their lives to save their own brothers is enough to make the toughest person in the crowd to shed a tear. In Black Hawk Down (2001), U.S. soldiers were sent on a seemingly easy mission to round up two Somalian lieutenants but next thing they knew they were fighting to stay alive. <br/><br/>The main characters are not hard to find. All of them are shown within 20 minutes of the movie. The story follows Staff Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), PFC Grimes (Ewan McGregor), Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), Sgt. First Class Norm ""Hoot"" Gibson (Eric Bana), and Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner). Throughout the movie the whole story is divided up by following each of these characters and all the conflicts they encounter. But the way the movie is set up you even get concerned about the other characters. For example, the two snipers that sacrificed themselves to save a downed black hawk pilot got me teary eyed because they knew they were not going to make it.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is Mogadishu, Somalia, but the movie could not be filmed on the site because it was considered unsafe. Instead the movie was shot in Morocco where they had everything they need to recreate Mogadishu. They even found a town that looked like the real place and served as a perfect substitute. I was impressed with how much accuracy the film had in it including the actual gear that the actors used. All the little details were covered down to the calendars, music, and TV shows of 1993. They production team was able to get black hawks for the film that was piloted and ran by actual U.S. soldiers. The helicopter squadron that did the flying in the movie was the 160th SOAR division and is the actual flight group that participated in the real event in 1993. <br/><br/>The camera angles are mostly flat angle shots to give you the feeling of actually being there. But there are occasional close up shots to show the soldiers reactions and feelings which really help you feel that yourself. In one scene there is a night time shoot out and part of it is in slow motion with the close up of some of the soldiers. You could see the desperation in their eyes as they fire at the enemy. <br/><br/>The music is one of the aspects of the movie that really helped me feel the sadness and sorrow that the soldiers were feeling. Hans Zimmer composed the music for Black Hawk Down (2001), the same composer for the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) and Gladiator (2000). The beginning clip starts off with an elderly African man walking along the starving and the music is an eerie solo African chant. Even though it is in a different language, anyone can tell you that whatever he is chanting about there is a lot of sorrow behind his voice. It really set the mood and helped the audience feel bad about the starving people in the opening scene. Hans Zimmer also adds a lot of percussion and sometimes a little electric guitar to give the shootout scenes a little more excitement. The part we keep on hearing over and over was the main title song, Leave No Man Behind. It is mostly consisted of stings and a single piano. It sounds very solemn and gives it a feeling of remembrance, struggle, and hope. The song that really got me was the last one that is playing before the credits, Gortoz a Ran. Staff Sgt. Eversmann says goodbye to his best friend who died in the mission. He is in a big hanger with the coffins all lined ready to be put on a cargo plane to be sent back to the United States for burial. He talks to his best friend's coffin while trying to hold back the tears. A man and a woman sing in a foreign language that gives me the chills every time I hear it. It has a mournful tone to it and fits the ending perfectly. The closing clip shows all the coffins of the dead soldiers in the airplane as the door slowly closes. Then screen goes black and you see the names of all the soldiers that died during the fighting but you also hear their voices as they say goodbye to their loved ones. It is enough to make anyone shed a tear. Overall the film was very effective on explaining what happened that day. The emotional point was very well expressed and made you actually feel for the soldiers trying to survive. The main theme during the whole movie was the strength of the brotherhood between the soldiers with each of them looking out for one another. True courage and duty was displayed under fire by these soldiers who did not know they possessed these characteristics and they did it with the man beside them in mind. General Garrison (Sam Shepard) went to one of the black hawks before the mission took place and told his men ""leave no man behind"". This quote was said throughout the whole movie by multiple soldiers and was carried out to the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see true valor displayed and selfless acts carried out by soldiers under fire and with seemingly no way out. Relying on each other to get through and survive. I give this movie 9.7 out of 10 and is by far the best movie I ever watched."

","This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time! I remember seeing it in the theater when I was 13 and counting down to it! This is probably the most accurate and realistic portrayal of war and military life available. I say this as a former ROTC cadet and as someone who has wanted to join the Army for years. A very realistic and accurate depiction of the battle of Mogadishu. No other film that I've seen has shown the horrors of war and honored American soldiers like this one. It also holds true to the book which is also a very accurate depiction of the battle. A must see for all us service members and for military families as well! Thumbs up!"
"try_reason","10","1","2","10 April 2008"," clarifications regarding the film's accuracy and brief review
","While Scott has put a lot of work into creating an aesthetically very 'realistic' film (although this particular style of special effects realism is worth more time)- tight camera work, incredibly fast cutting, and a meticulously crafted audiotrack - it would be misleading to view this film as historically accurate because of the blaring inaccuracies I list below. Number 4 is probably most important for a lot of people: departing from the book on which the film was based, in which Bowden wrote that large numbers of civilians were massacred by the American forces, the film goes out of its way to show troops only killing civilians when they pick up weapons. It does make a legitimate effort though - and Scott worked closely with top military brass to authenticate his film. But there is a range of inaccuracies that, while nice to know about, may not be essential to the film, which is far more enjoyable if we abandon the presumption that this is what it was really like (if we expect this going in then the film plays like a commercial for the Special Forces). <br/><br/>Here are the range of inaccuracies I mentioned, from most benign to the more troubling:<br/><br/>1) There are details that are put in to help orient viewers and tell who is who - eg. Rangers don't actually have their names written on their helmets - and these adjustments are harmless. 2) There are more involved changes designed to orient us in the genre - for instance, 'Hoot' (Bana's character) is an entirely fictional character modeled after various cowboy heroes in Westerns. This is interesting because he is the character I at least identified with most strongly as the 'most bad ass;' he is also the mouthpiece for the most explicitly propaganda-like messages in the film. 3) Also, more generally, the historical context is elided so that the mythological tone of the film can be amplified: the history of Somalia we get is purely designed to further put us in the world the first two quotes set up for us: -Based on Real Events, and -Plato: Only the dead have seen the end of war. From here the issue of (in)accuracy becomes clearest: Scott is more concerned with mythologizing the Mogadishu disaster, that is presenting Mogadishu as a philosophical problem and not merely a political one. He thus presents Mogadishu as a place where war is simply a way of life with no ultimate explanation.<br/><br/>4) as mark bowden's book black hawk down details, the American forces were not successful at distinguishing somali militants from non-combatants and ended up killing large numbers of unarmed people. <br/><br/>This is not to say that the film is merely a piece of propaganda. Thinking this way is usually an excuse to either dismiss the enjoyment one legitimately gets watching the film (and this is a deeply satisfying film for action-movie fans) or to avoid thinking about it altogether. The film is important in many respects, Mike Davis, an urban theorist, argues that it is the Blade Runner of the 21st century, and if you think about how powerful the image of militarized slums has gotten in our public imagination, it is not hard to see what he's getting at."

","This a gripping tale of a group of U.S soldier's who go in to capture two of Mahamoud Farrah Aidid hugest ranking men.The operation was meant to take an hour but the US got stuck in a fight for their lives overnight making it the biggest conflict since the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>I was a bit bored at the start but as they set out on this mission I got drawn in. Intense fire fight's got me into the action and the fact that 18 US men lost their lives in this operation made for a good cry too.The fact they used real black hawk's and little bird's made it about as close to the real thing as I'am likely to get. I thought it was a great movie and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys action/war movies."
"andy_roberts","8","1","2","5 October 2006"," Well worth buying, listen to the message of the film
","I 1st watched this movie when it came out on DVD and thought that it was a good movie. I recently watched it again with 8 minutes of footage left in that was previously removed in the 1st release..... I think the movie was inspired by the deaths of two snipers that volunteered to help out at a downed Black Hawk crash site knowing that the chances of survival were at best, slim. The courage of those two men should be an inspiration to us all.<br/><br/>As a rule i am not a fan of American ""fact based"" war movies as they often glorify the US army etc etc etc... One thing I am a firm believer in is that if you are going to produce a movie that is from an actual event you have a responsibility to make it as accurate as possible regardless of who wins and who loses....<br/><br/>I felt that this movie was more ""open "" in the way that it showed the suffering of US troops, however I felt that there was no real effort made to take the viewer over to the other side and see it from their point of view. This does not detract from the story in any way though.<br/><br/>If it's got Ridley Scott on the box then you KNOW that it will be a fine piece of film work........ How accurate it is, is not for me to judge as I was not there.. I have seen many WW2 movies (yes I know this is not a WW2 movie) and have found them so far from the truth it's laughable... Pearl Harbour and U571 to name just two.<br/><br/>To sum up, I think this is a film worth buying........It's great music score, cinematography and sound quality are top notch... Try to take note of what the film is really trying to tell you though, to which you have to draw your own conclusions."
"ReelCheese","8","1","2","9 September 2006"," Essence of War
","Numbingly graphic depiction of an infamous 1993 Somalia mission that claimed the lives of 18 U.S. soldiers. It all starts with a mission that seems easy enough -- capturing a warlord's two top lieutenants. But when one (and later two) army copters spiral to the ground, the mission becomes a daring rescue attempt through unbelievably hostile streets full of armed men.<br/><br/>Say what you will about BLACK HAWK DOWN, it captured the essence of war about as accurately as a staged portrayal can. We're with the bloody and battered men as they take cover and fire, desperately trying to survive hellish urban warfare. Scenes where soldiers are lost are not overly emotional, but a passing moment that neither the men nor the viewer have any time to reflect on until we return to safety. This serves the film well, making it an active experience rather than a passive one.<br/><br/>The acting is also a strong asset, with the soldiers ably led by the likes of Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana and Tom Sizemore. They wonderfully portray the enthusiasm, fear and courage of men not just in this battle, but all battles. Director Ridley Scott keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, though a slightly shorter running time (it's 144 minutes) would have been welcome.<br/><br/>BLACK HAWK DOWN is recommended for anyone interested in a realistic portrayal of war or who wants to learn more about this sometimes-overlooked incident in military history."

","Black Hawk Down should be considered as one of the all time greats of action war films. Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" which begins with an incredibly realistic reenactment of the landings on Omaha beach in 1944 but becomes rather ""theatrical"" later, BHD depicts actual events throughout and sticks close to a historical facts. The action begins almost immediately and builds to a heart stopping moment when the trapped soldiers are under attack from what appears to be thousands of Militia men. For me the main point of the film was not to depict a ""botched"" mission but the bond between soldiers on the ground. In my mind the film has a similar feel to ""Das Boot"" which could have been a story about any nation's submarine. A more recent addition was ""Band of Brothers"" the amazing HBO series. Black Hawk Down is a soldiers story and goes some way to explaining the question ""Why do you do it, do y'all think your some sort of heroes?"""

Just the camera shots, and the sounds, and pretty much everything in it gave me a feel of what it was like.

","Black Hawk Down is filmed eight years after the event of the Battle of Mogadishu, the capitol of Somalia in North East Africa. Based on the book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden and directed by Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>The true story of American soldiers, during October 3rd and 4th, 1993, who, having been sent to the heart of the City, an enemy stronghold, and to capture and return the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. In the exercise of their duty, two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are shot down in the middle of the City, an extremely close combat battle then commences.<br/><br/>Being one of the rarer and finer American war movies, that does not play on the clich√É¬©d ego trip, that we have come to see during the last twenty years or so of this genre. Could this also be because the cast here consists of a mixed bag of internationals, such as American, British and Scottish actors, even with their poor American accents to boot? <br/><br/>The cinematography on Black Hawk Down is aesthetically clear and concise; with fine detail to colour, temperament and texture, that really does set the mood of the environment. The pacing of this movie is neither too fast nor does it leave you looking at your watch. With the right ingredient for character build up and development, we can feel an empathic understanding of these unfortunate souls.<br/><br/>This is a very well shot movie too, of tight battle scenes that draws us into and unquestionably involves the viewer at ground level. We are left with a guided tour of duty in the comfort of our Cinema and living rooms, the atmosphere is well articulated and we are left with camaraderie that has over spilled into our hearts and mind.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is a movie not of ego but of comradeship and the partnership of one man equals all men; this is a very good movie indeed, with very little bad language, it really is not needed. This movie relies on the sometimes graphic and the sentimentality's that war can bring, to deliver home that one can watch a good movie as well as make them.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is a unique and refreshing war film, knowing that is it is a real event and seeing what the Soldiers had to endure is captivating. With the help of Ridley Scott at the helm, it will make any war movie genre fan want to pin it down and watch with an understanding that the ego does not make the Soldier, but the Soldier makes the Man.<br/><br/>A different way to make a War movie.<br/><br/>."
"Sorbatol_Petrol","9","1","2","8 March 2006"," Modern warfare in an eye-candy way.
","Black Hawk Dawn is a movie based on Mark Bowdens book ""Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War"". The movie is based on the true events that took place on the 3rd of October in 1993 in the city of Mogadishu, Somalia. On that day nearly 100 U.S. Army Rangers and Delta operatives were dropped via helicopter deep into the capital city of Mogadishu to capture two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord Farrah Aidid which lead to a large and drawn-out firefight between the US soldiers and hundreds of Somali gunmen. The battle led to the destruction of two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters and to the death of 18 US soldiers and an estimated 1000 Somali guerrillas, men, women and children.<br/><br/>Director of the film, Ridley Scott, has scored big time and created one of the most memorable war movies with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that add slow character-building sequences, you have to wait only about thirty minutes for the mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, yells and explosions. It's intensive in a way very much like the first 20 minutes of Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan"". At times the fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening and it becomes almost too easy to become accustomed to the violence. There are a few errors along the the way such as few obvious mistakes and stupid scenes (such as a Delta throwing a grenade for 400 feet) that catch the eye in a negative way and kill the immersion for a bit.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as to anyone that likes watching visual movies in general. This movie will deliver fantastic eye-candy and extremely intensive and yet rather realistic action to everyone interested."

","BLACK HAWK DOWN affected me profoundly on my first viewing, and now, with four more to reflect on, the genius of this piece is obvious.<br/><br/>As another reviewer stated spot-on, this is as though one were watching documentary footage. And you better believe it is. This is hands-down the most realistic war footage ever filmed and offered to the public's eyes next to archival video of an actual battle. The action is intense, unrelenting and accomplishes the rarely achieved feat of having the viewer's emotional attachment draw in, sustained and juggled in perfect balance between varying characters at a consistent enough rate to let your heartbeat rest alas at only the final few minutes-- if even then.<br/><br/>The cast and crew's unquestionably tremendous efforts are visible through every moment here. The performances, editing, cinematography, lighting, effects, pacing-- it's almost a dream for a film-goer. I am a film lover and yet I only have about twenty DVDs, an intentionally small collection as I only buy the rare movie I am engrossed in and can be sure to enjoy no matter the ninth or ninetieth viewing, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of them.<br/><br/>I just watched it again today for the fifth time, and when the mission begins, I felt the same acceleration in my heartbeat, the same chill down my spine as the first.

","I'm curious...how does IMDb choose which review is to be the one displayed with the movie details as the ""default"" review. The review I read politicized the movie, which from what I could see was as near a factual telling of the Black Hawk Down incident as Hollywood could deliver, without it becoming a documentary. Black Hawk Down is neither ""pro"" nor ""con"" about war - it simply recounts what happened. For those that would like to paint the US forces as ""cruel aggressors"" and the Somalis as ""freedom fighters,"" you would have to ignore the first ten minutes of the movie. The original intent of the Black Hawk Down mission was to try and capture two of the warlord's lieutenants, in order to stop the civil conflict. Remember, the Somalis were being systematically starved, raped, and murdered. The U.S. was there to try to feed the starving people and end the conflict - hardly a situation where the U.S. was acting as an aggressor. The Somalis warlords were busy killing anyone that stood in their way. Our soldiers were in the wrong place at the wrong time and were ambushed. Black Hawk Down the movie does a masterful job showing just what that ambush was like. The real question raised by the movie comes years later. Osama Bin Laden has stated publicly that the U.S. pullout of Somalia after the Black Hawk Down incident convinced him that the U.S. did not have the stomach for war, and would run from a conflict. Thanks to the Clinton administration's response, in 2001 we discovered just what a policy of ""turn tail and run"" would bring. Black Hawk Down is a riveting look at one military battle that had effects on U.S. policy - and terrorists plans that reached far beyond Somalia."

","This movie is simply one of the best movies, let alone war movies, of all time! But when I watched it, I felt anger. Not anger toward the soldiers, or even toward the Somali Militia, but it was directed at those in Washington who set ridiculous ROEs (Rules of Engagement). At the beginning of the movie the militia seizes a Red Cross food shipment and actually guns down dozens of starving refugees trying to get a handful of rice. An American Blackhawk is hovering right overhead and their request for intervention is denied due to a lack of jurisdiction!!! Were we there to help them or not? Then in the planning of the raid, Gen. Garrison's request for AC-130 gunship support is denied, ""in Washington's infinite wisdom."" As it turns out, they really could have used it.<br/><br/>To those critics who say the Somali point of view isn't brought forth, are we talking about the point of view of men who use food and starvation of thousands of people to make a point? That point of view is brought out in an interrogation scene between a prominent Somali fund-raiser and Gen. Garrison and also another interrogation scene between the leader of the militia and WO Mike Durant. Or are you talking about the point of view of the Somalis cheering on the American soldiers as they finally make it to Pakistani Stadium and security.<br/><br/>This movie shows exactly the kinds of efforts that our troops are making right now in the cities and towns of Iraq. This movie could have just as easily been set in Fallujah last November. The war is chaotic, scary, and intense, with danger lurking around every street corner. Only now we're fighting it as an actual war, not just trying to arrest certain figures. We also have the necessary support and ROEs from the commanders in theater and back home.<br/><br/>I want everyone to pay attention to Hoot's last lines. Notice how a soldier reacts when he sees a family in a house huddling from the violence outside. See what it takes for another soldier, who till then had been portrayed as bloodthirsty, to shoot a woman. These were quick scenes but conveyed the utmost professionalism of our soldiers."

","Black Hawk Down opens with a quote by Plato: ""Only the dead have seen the end of war"". Then, over a color-desaturated series of images, we are presented with a brief history of why the United States was in Somalia in the early '90s. The story begins on October 2, 1993. Characters are introduced - Major General William Garrison (Sam Shepard), who is in command of the U.S. military presence in the region; Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), recently promoted to commanding a team; Company Clerk John Grimes (Ewan McGregor), who is about to exchange paperwork for a gun; Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), in charge of a segment of the ground troops; and Master Sergeant Paul Howe (William Fichtner), who will challenge orders if he thinks they are ill-advised. Together, these men, and many others, are about to become involved in a seemingly routine mission that will go disastrously wrong. ........The objective is to capture several key advisers to Mohamed Farrah Aidid, the warlord who controls Mogadishu. The United States wants Aidid out of the way, and this seems to be the best opportunity to advance that goal. But the troops, both on the ground and in the air, encounter stiffer resistance than expected, and this results in the downing of two black hawk helicopters. The ground troops then become divided as the raid turns into a rescue mission, and, in part because of poor planning and in part because of bad luck, the fire fight turns into a debacle. <br/><br/>....It is informative, a history lesson on Somalia that many of us needed. The film is visually brilliant, a spectacular dose of reality that made me repeatedly say, ""How did they do that? No wait, how did they do that?"" I cannot stress this point enough. ""Black Hawk Down"" makes you believe you are watching a documentary or live CNN war footage by one of those crazy reporters. It has that much gritty authenticity. ....the film is more about the incident than it is about the people fighting the battles. It relies too much on action and battles, in my opinion, instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the humans involved in this slaughter. There are so many U.S. military personnel involved in this failed mission that we never really know who any of them are..."

","I happen to be a big war movie buff and this film is high up there with Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.

Him and his fellow soldiers are sent in to expose of two top Somalian generals when the mission goes haywire and every soldier is on the run shooting everything they see. The amazing thing about this movie has got to be the death count. After the drop in you could probably count a soldier or Somalian dying every 5 seconds. Some of the deaths can be graphic so those with the faint of heart please step away. After a whole day has gone by the battle still rages on and Josh Hartnett is left with about 15 men after 123 dropped in.<br/><br/>The only downside in this movie is that you don't really get to know these characters. I mean here are some of the top names in Hollywood and some of them die in the first 40 minutes.<br/><br/>This earns a solid A. Definitely recommended for those war buffs out there."

","'Black Hawk Down' plays a little fast and loose with the facts, but it's presentation of the events of the Mogadishu Battle in '94 and depiction of the sensation of being in the middle of a tense urban battle are as close to the real thing as any major movie has thus far come.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's rendering of the political events leading up to the battle is a bit bothersome in its brevity, but it becomes clear enough once the action gets going that this movie exists primarily for the purpose of reenacting the battle. We are offered the standard Hollywood tropes, especially in the form of Josh Hartnett's character, Eversmann, who is saddled with the role of resident idealist, and the character of Norm 'Hoot' Gibson (Eric Bana) as the king-daddy bad-ass, but the action is very faithful to the accounts of the battle described in Mark Bowden's superb book, and the development of the various characters (some real, some--like Hoot--composite) lends a strong sense of the stakes for these young men. The film is memorable for being one of the first authorized and realistic depictions of the work of Delta Force, the secretive elite branch of the Special Forces, and for reconstructing in a palpable manner the challenges of urban warfare with modern weaponry.<br/><br/>This film probably doesn't deserve to be ranked alongside the great war films such as 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Full Metal Jacket,' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' largely because the events it describes are not part of a larger, more coherent war narrative. Task Force Ranger was a relatively isolated peace-keeping operation that would likely have failed to gain the attention of the international media were it not for the footage of the corpses of dead US Army personnel being dragged through the streets by angry Somalis (later that same year, the US Army invaded Haiti after a military coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and hardly anyone noticed).

"matus10","Null","1","2","3 March 2005"," Movie Review
","Black Hawk Down is an excellent depiction of the 1993 Somalian Civil War where US soldiers were sent to help quell the battles taking place. The movie is seen from the US soldier's point of view and provides a very realistic touch to relate to the audience. The director, Ridley Scott, was great in capturing the intense battle scenes as well as making them extremely graphic. The characteristics made the movie much more realistic and shocked the audience as it created suspense. The actors did a wonderful job (Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana etc.) showing the anxiety and leadership roles some soldiers undertook as they went into war. The only flaw that I noticed in the movie was it's lack of an in depth look at a certain character. The movie did a good job showing their qualities in war but the personal background to a certain person could have created a better effect in making the movie more suspenseful. However the movie is an excellent film and shows the special bonds soldiers develop with one another, a bond that no one else would ever understand."
"Ferret_with_a_G","8","1","2","3 March 2005"," Cinematography
","Black Hawk Down was wonderfully filmed and it pulls my attention from the beginning of the movie. The event is centered around the Civil War in Somalia and it captures the strife between Adid and the UN, but, sparing the first scene where Adid was holding food from the Somalians, the movie lacked to explain the Civil War situation in Somalia. After watching this video, I still do not understand how Adid got into power, how he managed this, and what he planned to do by starving the rest of the nation. Other than this, the movie was extremely entrancing, grabbing me by the nape and dragging me through a disaster of broken down houses, bullets, and RPG's. The cinematography is something to be commended. From the first scene in the movie, the pictures are very evocative. The movie opens with a brief description and a striking scene of the starvation in Somalia. Several other striking scenes focus on the condition of the Somalia people. The combat zones were filled with seemingly and vividly realistic gunfights. Deaths were also very realistic. The video was largely taken from the standpoint of the US Rangers. As the nature of being with this group the entire time one tends to side with the US Rangers."
"ABrauning","Null","1","2","2 March 2005"," Sincere war film
","Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is a gruesome and gritty yet sincere and a ""no-bs"" depiction of the events that took place in Somalia in 1993. When American Rangers and Delta Force, 123 men in total, were sent into the Somali capital of Mogadishu to take two of warlord Mohammed F. Aidid's top lieutenants as prisoners. The mission was expected to take no longer than half an hour; American intelligence was once again very wrong. Things began to go terribly wrong when the first Black Hawk helicopter was shot down by Somali militia. Like General Garrison, very well played by Sam Shepard, said they ""lost the incentive"". Men began to get killed, everything that happened was the opposite of what was planned. They didn't expect that much opposition from the Somalis. The Humvee convoy had no route to take to take out the wounded and to take the prisoners in. All the men were trapped in a kill-box. The expected half an hour turned into a whole day. The men had to spend the night in the deadly streets of Mogadishu. The cinematography in the film gives the audience a true sense of what war looks like. Ridley Scott directed the actors of the movie realistically and created a very accurate portrayal of the hell that war turns into. Scott creates a world were everyone is in the same mess, no matter what rank the soldier is. Scott shows this when General Garrison wipes the blood on the floor in the operating room in the end of the movie. Another thing the director does to create a sense of uniformity in the soldiers is that he doesn't show much character of any the soldiers. Everyone seems the same, with the exception of Sgt. Eversmann, Sgt. Hoot and and Colonel McKnight. Everyone was scared, everyone was in the same place, every soldier was on the verge of death. Deltas and Rangers, who before the fight were always competing in one way or another, fought side-by-side in order to survive those deadly 24 hours on hostile ground. This is a great film, good enough to be compared to Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now. It is very realistic picture of what war really is."

","This movie is one of the best I have ever watched.Not only it is exciting and well played,but also it has a moral side to the story.Good prevails over evil.It is a true story which in real life is happening in Africa.Somalia has a law if the jungle.It is the poor ordinary people who suffer.THe United States is always seen as ""The Big Brother"",who wants to get rid of corrupt government.The ordinary citizens suffer a lot,especially the women and children.They have no basic human rights like the right to lead a normal life.IT is very sad to see this is happening in the 21st century.For the United States to do it alone,it is an impossible task.What the United Nations can do is to put in more troops to such countries.<br/><br/>I would like to see more of such films to be made in the future."
"Mr_Vai","10","1","2","9 February 2005"," An Objective Look at a Heroic Disaster
","It is hard not to get emotional after watching this film. The heroism and courage displayed by the Rangers and Delta team members is the stuff of legends. They were men that risked their lives, not for their President or their country, but for each other. In the end, I guess that is why soldiers do give up their lives in wars and battles, so their comrades won't lose theirs.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s the world was outraged by the human rights abuses going on in Somalia. War Lords were stealing UN food supplies while their own people, women and children, starved. The US and other nations believed that military action was the right thing to do. It is hard to fault them for it. However, what Somalia showed us, was that best intentions can go wrong. So often, we intervene in the hopes of doing good. However, many times the people we are there to help, do not perceive it that way. An interesting thing to ponder now, as many in the world chastise the US for not having involved itself in the genocide of Rwanda.<br/><br/>Although I had doubts when I saw Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott's name on this project, it is a real drama. Yes, there is plenty of action (tons), but the action is not Hollywood thrills, but rather in keeping with the story. I also feel that the movie makers did present the side of the Mogadishu militia. We understand why they were shooting at Americans and can respect that they were coming from a different perspective, not necessarily the wrong perspective.<br/><br/>In summary, this film shows that no soldiers have ever died for a mistake, be it Vietnam, Somalia or Iraq. They die for each other and there is an honor attached to that which few will ever understand."
"borednow23","9","1","2","7 February 2005"," Near Perfect!
","This is a movie that had the ability to have an epic, but fell short in one department, the soundtrack. There was no need for any of the rock music in the first 40 minutes of the movie, especially the ever so clich√©d Jimi Hendrix while getting into the helicopter.<br/><br/>The action was intense and non-stop, the emotion was there, the cinematography was spot on, and the sound (outside of the soundtrack) was very realistic. It is also always nice when at the end of a ""based on a true story"" film, it gives you updates on how things finished. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job with this film. All things told an excellent retelling of a sad and rough day."
"Macadamian-Nut","10","1","2","18 October 2004"," Great film for those who love action movies
","This movie is one of the best I've seen. I doubt it will ever go down as a classic, but I think that everything about it is great, especially if you love action movies. It's at a good length, and you miss it a lot when it's over.<br/><br/>Most people know that the basis of this story is that of an event which happened in the early 90's, when US peacekeeping troops were sent on a mission in Somalia. No one really cared until so many people wound up dead on account of this tragedy. This is a retelling of the story, and it's very realistic. Throughout the telling of the story you get to know all of the major characters. Perhaps not as much as in other movies, but you know them enough to care about them.<br/><br/>Take Hoot Gibson, for instance. Eric Bana did a wonderful job in this role. He really puts the whole entire scenario into perspective throughout the entire film. He did things that I couldn't even imagine having the guts to do, while he did them without flinching. <br/><br/>Of course, there are some times where the audience is left annoyed to death when characters do insanely stupid things that would probably cause even more deaths. I know that I couldn't believe it when women and tiny children would pick up guns and shoot at the men. I nearly died when the helicopters went down, and there were hundreds of Somalians going after the few survivors. <br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are great and some of the best I've seen. It might be a little gory for some viewers, but that's what it's really like. <br/><br/>I was really surprised to see that this film is not completely one-sided. I hate going into a film which is completely pro-American. In this one, however, Ridley Scott, although the main characters are all American, does try to show you things from Somalian perspectives.<br/><br/>The film is rated R for language and gore, but don't mind it. There's some language but a lot of the time it's covered up well by bombs going off and if you don't listen closely, you'll miss it. As for gore, it's in almost every good action movie and there's no way to avoid it.<br/><br/>This is a great film, and I recommend that anyone who really likes action films watch it. It's worth it.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down, Directed by Ridley Scott. 10/10"
"plu4085","8","1","2","18 October 2004"," pure war movie excels
","I just saw this for the first time and found it engaging and impressive, although with little of depth or originality. It is an old-school war movie of the type that have gotten in vogue again, where comradeship and battle action are the main things. The movie is essentially one long battle sequence, and as such it's pretty outstanding. The editing and the sets are extraordinary, reminiscent of the last 1/3rd of ""Full Metal Jacket"" or the first 10 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Big cities and structures shot to pieces make for excellent cinema, although the direction does border on a computer game-like showpiece at times. There were some strong scenes involving dying soldiers, not terribly original but effective in the context.<br/><br/>The first thing I had to check out was who played ""Hoot"", and it turned out to be Eric Bana who I didn't recognize. His character and performance is the best thing in the movie, apart from the superb action scenes. Great screen presence, and also a thankful role as the cool uber-soldier. I can't say I think Ewen McGregor's part worked, except as comic relief. Josh Hartnett was OK, but seemed a bit underdeveloped. Tom Sizemore, Jason Isaacs and William Fichtner are *always* a delight to see, and I admire the casting department that brought in these charismatic supporting actors into the same movie.<br/><br/>Racist? Well, if I was Somalian I wouldn't have appreciated this movie. But, it's an old-school war movie, so it goes with the territory.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 / 10, for a couple of very specific reasons only, detailed above."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","2","16 July 2004"," ""Saving Private Ryan"" in Somalia.
","This movie uses the exact same gritty style as used in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I don't mind it, I welcome it! For me it's wonderful to see that ""Saving Private Ryan"" set a whole new trend for war movies.<br/><br/>Just like in ""Saving Private Ryan"" this movie tries to shock the audience, sometimes it succeeds but sometimes it also simply fails because the movie tries to hard to shock with as a result that some scene's feel forced. The characters and the event fail to get me emotionally involved, so for me this movie is more successful as an action than it is as a war movie.<br/><br/>Like many more people my major complaint is the use of characters. They really stay just uniforms with persons in it for me. I have a hard time to remember all of the names mainly because of that they all look the same to me. The only one's I can tell apart are the one's that are played by famous actors (Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Jason Isaacs, Ewan McGregor etc.) I really couldn't feel for any of the characters, also thanks to it that there are some over-dramatized scene's involving some of them that just don't work for me.<br/><br/>I was also told by a Somalian friend of mine that the presentation of Mogadishu is not completely fair. The real Mogadishu is much more modern. He also of course complaint that none of the Somali's in the movie spoke actual Somalian. But this are of course simply things that wouldn't bother any of the ""normal"" viewers.<br/><br/>I admit that I expected very little from Josh Hartnett after seeing ""Pearl Harbor"" but I was wrong to do so, he actually can act! It's too bad that some of the other actors are miscast such as Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom but biggest miscast was Ewan McGregor. He and his character really felt out of place.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to sound extremely negative about this movie, while in fact it is far from bad!<br/><br/>The action really is top class!

"jpg-8","Null","1","2","25 June 2004"," Major war movie, with few Hollywood flaws
","An interesting thing : there are all kinds of viewpoints about this film. It means that everyone sees it with his own eyes, and every one has his own reasons to like or dislike ""Black Hawk Down"". Well, I most certainly liked it. To me, it's a major war movie, a worthy cousin of ""Saving Private Ryan"". To me, both changed the genre forever.<br/><br/>As many people pointed out, the most impressive aspect of ""Black Hawk Down"" is its realism. The war we see in that film is a bloody mess. We see scared men doing their duty, fighting for their lives. Of course, it's gory, noisy, but that's war, isn't it ? War isn't a pleasure cruise, it's not a picnic. It's about men being ripped apart, that you have to patch up the best you can (see the death scene of Cpl Jamie Smith). SPR was the first film to give us a taste of the kind of hell war is. BHD does it also. It has a visceral power. There are differences between the two movies. SPR had faded colors, and a documentary-style. BHD is very stylized, with a magnificent photography. Yet, both are equally effective. Once you've seen BHD, you don't forget it. Ridley Scott and his crew did a superb job in throwing us into the heart of the action. WWII movies like ""A Bridge too far"", ""The longest day"" are great (because they're interesting and very well directed and I still love them), but they give a Hollywood-like vision of war. They cut out the pain, the blood and the mess. The street-fighting scenes of BHD are the best I've ever seen. They give of good idea of the merciless ordeal contemporary soldiers have to face.<br/><br/>To me, BHD is also quite a clearsighted movie. The soldiers who were in Somalia fought because they were professionals, because they wanted to fulfill their mission, because they wanted to save their comrades. That's it. Eric Bana's character says it pretty well : ""You want to know what I think ? It don't matter what I think. Once the first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that s... go right out of the window"". Or : ""It's all about the man next to you, that's it"". There's a believable speech. It's a million years away from the silly propaganda of ""We were soldiers"", where the private dies on the field saying how proud he is to die for his country. Films like ""We were soldiers"" or ""Pearl Harbor"" give a glorious image of war : to me, a big lie. I also felt watching BHD that the United States were not depicted as the saviors of the world (a nice change from ""Independence day"", one of the worst Hollywood blockbusters). As I felt it, BHD tells about the naive aspects of the US foreign policy. The two scenes with the Somalis (Osman Atto talking with Maj-Gal Garrison and the man who talks with captured CWO Michael Durant) are well written. (""Do you think that removing Gal Aidid will have us put down our weapons ? That we will adopt American democracy ?"") Soldiers on the field are paying the price (in blood) for the mistakes of their political leaders. In Somalia, they fought bravely to get themselves out of the mess. BHD also shows that immense military power isn't always a good solution. An armed militia entrenched in a city, warned by observers with cell phones (a powerful image, when the helicopters are flying over a kid with his phone) : there's enough to put heavily-armed US soldiers in jeopardy. In the light of the US problems today in Iraq, BHD had a lot of insight.<br/><br/>Of course, everything isn't perfect. I don't know if the reasons for US presence in Somalia are as simple as the opening captions. In the end credits, it's a bit annoying to see the names of the 19 KIA opposing a simple statement ""More than 1000 Somalis were killed"". The US soldiers have their names, but the Somalis can die anonymously by the hundreds. Those are Hollywood-like flaws.<br/><br/>Regarding the historical accuracy, I tracked down the articles by Mark Bowden. I was surprised to see how close to the facts the movie is. There are changes, of course (the main one is that Sgt Eversmann didn't spend the night in the city in the real fight), but those are only details. The spirit of the facts remains : we do understand what happened in Mogadishu.<br/><br/>The more I watch BHD, the better I think of it. It's excellent film making (great music by Hans Zimmer, by the way). It's a gripping war movie. It's quite gut-wrenching (you need a strong stomach to watch it), but it's believable."
"djtrev09","10","1","2","1 June 2004"," A great, realistic and gritty movie.
","""We got a Blackhawk down!"" This is a great film of modern combat and it shows just how tough urban combat is for the modern day soldier. The individual scenes are gritty and coarse, showing the deadly violence of the modern-day combat environment in a city where there are friends and far too many foes to shake the proverbial stick at. Individual soldiers come off as individuals with their own personalities. The movie fully shows the problems of civilians in Washington trying to dictate how the front-line soldiers fight and what they fight with. The commander wanted to take tanks and APCs (M-1s and M-2s), but the politicians back in Washington limited the troops to nothing more than up-armored Hummers, and that was a major mistake indeed."

","Ridley Scott's next big directorial project after the renowned epic Gladiator, Black Hawk Down is an adaptation of a book that details the events of one of recent history's most bloody conflicts involving the American military. What should have lasted only a half hour ended up taking days. With other great war movies that surfaced within just a few years of each other (Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, etc.) it's easy to overlook one that doesn't involve World War II. Nearly everything about Black Hawk Down is about as close to perfect as could be imagined. If you've only seen it once, you haven't experienced it all the way. Black Hawk Down is one of those rare movies that gets more and more powerful the more times you see it. It is an astounding achievement for everyone involved. An intense story that is brilliantly presented, Black Hawk Down is one film that just should not be missed."

This is an excellent, very well made authentic looking war film that will pull you right into the intensity of a firefight. Unfortunately this film is pure propaganda and got lots of ""co-operation"" from the US government. It is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts surrounding this event, the motivations of the Mogs, and the real background of our presence in that part of the world. It is once again showing the USA as altruistic defenders of ""freedom"" and coming to the aid of these poor starving oppressed people. This is pretty nasty propaganda designed to keep us Americans ignorant of our governments' military ""adventures"". If too many people start asking questions about the real reasons why we were in Somalia (or Afghanistan, or Iraq, or the upcoming Iran and Saudi Arabia) it could prove uncomfortable for the powers that be. Ridley knows better than this and I'm disappointed that he would go along with this misleading flag waver to bolster enlistments and garner support for this militaristic government.<br/><br/>As a Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot I was impressed with the technical accuracy of this film, it's as good as I have seen in a major commercial film.

","When I first heard about this film I was dubious about how Hollywood would approach it. I was a little more assured seeing as it was Ridley Scott at the helm; however Hollywood portrayal of historical events has often left a lot to be desired. It was only after seeing the film on several occasions that I realised that the film itself was much more about what was happening to the characters themselves, and therefore I would argue deserves to be seen in a different light to ""historical"" films. The visual filming is incredibly realistic and intense and Ridley Scott really gets the most out of his ensemble cast (notably Josh Harnett, Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs and Ewan Mcgregor) however that should not take away from the superb acting from the rest of the cast as well, who with the film makers have created a very absorbing and entertaining film.<br/><br/>Once again Hans Zimmer's score is spot on and up there with my other favourites (True Romance and Gladiator) and it really is nice to see the music actually really adding to the film itself. While this film is only shows the view of what happened in Mogadishu from one side, it really does not loose anything for that. In fact I think that the focus of the film, if anything, is much better for not focusing on the political problems of the time. As a final word I would like to state that on my first viewing of this film I thought it was okay. Since I brought the DVD I have come to realise exactly what a brilliant piece of film making this is, and now watch it at least once a month. It is well worth watching a 2nd (or even 50th, as I must be on now) time. Once again another masterpiece from Ridley Scott."

They must   fight their way out of the hostile city, under constant assault from thousands of  Aideeds warriors and Somali civilians.<br/><br/>I remember reading about this incident  and thinking that this would make an interesting topic for a modern warmovie but frankly, I'd never expected something like this.<br/><br/>
Based on the book by Mark Bowden, it's a painstaking accurate retelling of the actual raid.  Prepare yourself  for a breathtaking, blistering brilliant  account of non-stop mayhem and carnage,  limbs getting blown off, hundreds of casualties and more ammunition  spent then on a dozen recent action movies combined.   BHD makes `The Wild Bunch' seem like The `Sound of Music'.<br/><br/>BHD is near too perfection : direction, acting,  production values, editing, photography and script are  almost flawless. It is so rich in detail and moves along at such speed  you 'll need at least 2-3 viewings to get a full grasp of the full chain of events.    It may be  confusing  sometimes but so is a real war. The battlescenes are exceptionally well handled by  Ridley Scott ,on the top of his craft here, turning out one of the best movies of his long career (Alien, Hannibal, Gladiator, 1492,  Thelma and Louise, etc...) It almost looks like  a bunch of vets did the whole raid all over again.<br/><br/>The DVD offers off-screen commentary by Bowden himself and some of the actual vets who that went through the ordeal, so movie must be pretty accurate.<br/><br/>
A good thing producer Bruckheimer decided on shooting (sic) the whole thing in Morocco instead of some Hollywood back lot  (and that he didn't choose Ridley's brother Tony to direct or we'd stuck with a  Club Med commercial with some blood 'n guts thrown in).<br/><br/>
Movie has some big stars like Ewan Mcgregor and Josh Harnett,  but they are hardly recognisable between all the shootings and explosions. But Shepard is distinguishable as General Harrison, the CO who took full responsibility for the mess.  Also Tom Sizemore as the convoy commander and William Richter as some kind of super Delta warrior stand out.<br/><br/>BHD is almost an updated version of  the old-style colonial war movies where a small number of white soldiers pitched against  thousands of hostile natives.  One of the best  in this 'genre' is ""Zulu"" (1964) and  also based on the true life event of the Battle of O'Rourke Drift  in 1879 South-Africa, where a handful  of British soldiers must fight off a few thousands Zulu warriors.  Michael Caine's breakthrough movie !<br/><br/>One minor  remark though on the reality bit : these high-tech soldiers are sure a far cry for the thugs and ragtag grunts  seen in `Platoon' or `Casualties of War' and whose main concern was  getting laid  or scoring some dope.  These model Rangers and  Delta Force (cool outfit !) troops are all such clean-cut and wholesome guys,   spending their free  time playing chess and scrabble, reading John Grisham novels and getting high, haha, on coffee.  Yeah, right.<br/><br/>
Is BHD the best  war movie ever made ?  Perhaps not,  but it sure comes close.<br/><br/>Ah yes, all this lamenting from fellow IMDb reviewers on the lack of characterization  :  you want characterization  ?  Go see `The Hours' instead."

"dee.reid","6","1","2","7 February 2003"," A 6/10, but that doesn't mean I hate it
","Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" is a rather brutal and unrelenting war film.  It certainly does paint a realistic view of soldiers in battle.  I don't know how much the film remains faithful to the book, so I won't bother with a grievous comparison.  This is not Ridley Scott's best film; that credit really goes to ""Gladiator"".  It has some really good isolated moments, but none that really are spectacular.  But I want to point out some things, both good and bad.  <br/><br/>1) I personally do not think that this film glorifies war since as one previous viewer already mentioned, it shows horrible things happening to both American soldiers and Somalis.  A soldier is blown in half, a Somali person is shot dead in the street while a child frantically tries to figure out what happened, another Somali is blown apart by a stray rocket, and an American soldier is killed when he's impaled by a rocket.  So you see, it's horrific, unrelenting war.<br/><br/>2) I do not consider this to be by no means an excellent war film, but an endlessly watchable one; Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is clearly the greatest war film ever made.<br/><br/>3) The British actors who are trying to speak American.  I'm sorry, but I just cannot buy Jason Isaacs speaking with a southern accent.  Ewan McGregor seems to be the only one that sounds reasonably convincing.<br/><br/>4) I'm African-American and I do think that this film is sort of racist, since I've heard that a substantial portion of Mark Bowden's book had been omitted from the film, which detailed the Somali cause.  From what I've heard, it had been omitted for apparently no reason, other than to really give a sense of soldiers fighting bravely against impossible odds.  All the soldiers are white (there is a black soldier amongst them who only speaks a few lines) and are shooting at hundreds of Somalis.  <br/><br/>5) I think that this film presents an unfair portrait of the Somalis. With the exception of a cab driver who has been coerced into helping the Americans and another Somali man who was arrested, there are no other signs of the Somali view.  Thus, this gives ""Black Hawk Down"" a one-sided view of a battle that should never have happened.    <br/><br/>6) I did feel sorry for the American soldiers at certain points during the film.  Such as when the three soldiers are in the helicopter and are defending it from oncoming Somalis.  Another instance would be the one soldier who gets separated from the rest and has to eventually find his way back to the group.  <br/><br/>So as you can clearly see, I have many mixed feelings about ""Black Hawk Down"", but I did thoroughly enjoy myself while watching this film."
"erose001","Null","1","2","29 January 2003"," A Cautionary Tale of Paternalism at its Worst
","If the leaders of the United States have a particular failing, it is that they assume they know what is best for every other country and every other culture.  In *Black Hawk Down*, the story of the failure of U.S. Forces to bring down the ruthless dictatorial warlord Aidid in famine-stricken Somalia in 1993, this is portrayed with relentless fury and unvarnished ugliness, by portraying the failed raid in Mogudishu in October of 1993 that took the lives of 19 ""elite"" U.S. troops.<br/><br/>This is not Ridley Scott's best movie as entertainment (although the war buffs may enjoy the gore), nor is it entirely faithful to the book about the raid, but, even so, it may go down in movie history as one of our finest film morality tales of our failure to appreciate the lessons of history.  We didn't get it after Vietnam, we didn't get it after Nicaragua and El Salvador, and we didn't get it in Somalia, either.  The movie demonstrates how we indoctrinate the rank and file to never leave a brother (or sister) behind, which in the case of this raid, set up a trap that left these well-trained, and certainly very brave troops, who were supposed to apprehend some specific prisoners within one hour, at the mercy of Aidid's militia for almost 20 hours, trapped in a hostile portion of Mogudishu.  All of their training and bravery still left them ill-prepared to handle a situation like this one.  <br/><br/>And in these times when the talk of this kind of war is all around us again, when our leaders refuse to appreciate the diplomatic options available and see war as the only option to bring down another ruthless dictator, all I can think is this what our troops will face in the streets of Baghdad?  I, for one, am not interested in seeing brave men and women facing that kind of environment only to come home in a body bag for a cause that may or may not actually prevail.<br/><br/>It is noted in the credits at the end of the movie what most of us know now as history.  Clinton removed the troops two weeks after the failed raid. And Aidid was assassinated by his own people in 1996.   Sometimes, as much as we might want to, we simply cannot solve all the world's problems, and Ridley Scott certainly makes the case here that using war in particular to solve these problems is most especially NOT the answer."
"CindyH","10","1","2","20 January 2003"," Best depiction of American Soldiers ever made!
","**** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film. A lot of realness lends to it as well. My husband is an Army Gulf War vet. Not long after his return, there was talk of mobilizing to Somalia. I remember quite clearly my husband coming home saying to me, `I can't believe they might send us over there! When I took my oath I said, ¬ëI do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies' and I did *not* say for peace keeping missions or for the United Nations.' My husband was not alone, many of the GIs felt that way. As I watched the film, I never expected for this to be addressed. Hollywood, being what it is, took me by surprise this time. The hooahs had a very familiar, as well as welcome, ring to my ears. The military, and their families, have their own culture. Separate from the civilian world. Civilians are a ¬ëme' world, where the military is a ¬ëwe' world. A good example is the camaraderie, which was portrayed very well. No one should ever be left behind. You are not only dying for your country, but dying for your fellow men. I'm glad to see a film that shows how selfless they really are, how hard it really is, and how divided they really feel. There was a point, in the movie, where a woman had to be shot. It was either her or them. Today's liberal society tries, in vain, to make it look as though war should be avoided simply because of the deaths of innocent civilians. Yet, this film is the real truth. There are times where there is simply no choice.<br/><br/>Yes, I'd say this is probably the most realistic film on American military forces ever made. I'll forgive the director for the actors who played American soldiers, that are clearly not American (Ewan McGregor, Orlando Bloom, etc.). We all know there are other films out today that discriminate against Americans and won't allow them to portray foreign characters. Well, that's the difference between America and those nations, isn't it?<br/><br/>
The only thing wrong with the film, if you can say its wrong, is the ongoing gore throughout. I'm divided on the issue. The 9/11 tower jumpers taught us that some things are better left unseen. However, if you don't see it, will you ever really understand how bad it really was? If we don't really know, then it stands to reason we'll forget, and soon. The memory of the horribleness of it all will be forever etched on the mind. That's art imitating life.<br/><br/>I would've liked to have seen more on the rescues, to include that of Mike Durant. However, time constraints would perhaps have forced a lot of cutting and the scenes that made it to print were absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>I give it a 10/10. I can find no valid fault with the movie. The political correctness was, thankfully, left out. Had it been there, I'd drop my vote down. <br/><br/>To all who contributed to the film: Great job!"

","One of the strongest experience I had by seeing a war film. I have to adore the direction of photography by Slawomir Idziak (also photographed Gattaca - this movie has my best recommendation).

","BLACK HAWK DOWN is visually spectacular with good performances from some fine actors, but the superficial script lets it down badly.  By athletically avoiding the politics of the conflict, it treats the Somalis as motiveless monsters, so the movie feels more like ALIENS or a video game than a serious film.  The implicit racism is highlighted by the depiction of the Pakistanis, who are depicted as comedy relief rather than rescuers.  Much of the dialogue seems to have been cut-and-pasted from old war movies and recruiting ads, and characterisation almost disappears amid the explosions, helicopter shots, and showers of spent cartridges.  All that's left in the end is yet another siege movie with new hardware - a rather routine depiction of courage under fire, without the courage to examine other issues."

","I saw this film at the cinema, I really enjoyed it. Recently I got it on DVD, and have watched it a great many times since.<br/><br/>What really made me love this film, was it's gritty realism of war. And based on just what was shown in the action sequences, was easily comparable to Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now (among others).<br/><br/>The characters aren't really that important (except for maybe Eversman and Hoot), what is, is the way that work together and the bonds that they have in the field. <br/><br/>The half hour build-up to the action, is used simply show what they (the US) was doing there, and what the Rangers, Delta and 160th SOAR were going to do.<br/><br/>What follows, never once, not even after seeing it so many times, makes my attention wonder from the screen. From the codeword ""Irene"" until the last bullet is heard snapping past your ears, you are on the edge of your seat, dodging RPGs around your living room and shooting imaginary enemies.<br/><br/>Because of the realism of this film, it's not one for the squeamish. There are (as you would expect) some grizzly injuries.<br/><br/>The performances are good (although as the extras on the DVD show, a lot of it isn't acting), but Ewan McGregor should really learn to hold down an accent. A special mention for Eric Bana as the films ""voice"", Sgt. Hooten. Who really shows why they were there.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent war film, which really pushes the genre to a new extreme of action, with a little bit of depth.<br/><br/>8/10"

This movie so realistically captures the two different styles of war (USA and Somalia); one being incredibly organized and technically superior, and the other being disorganized but fighting with reckless abandon. The gunfire-scenes are amazing as are the injuries and the treatment of them.  This movie ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far.

I sat in dumbstruck awe as the theater staff swept up the popcorn and paper cups around me.  The acting, script, directing, editing and SPFX were superb.  It's outrageous that it didn't win Best Film at the Academy Awards.  (I think a lot of weak-stomached Academy members must not have viewed it or they would have voted for it.)<br/><br/>Ladies, forget about all your preconceived notions of what a war film is like.  Even if you think you don't like war films, this film is a must see!  It's about far more than a military skirmish in a place most Americans couldn't find on a map.  It touches to the very core of humanity, and has left an indelible impression upon me like no other film ever has."
"Ethers_Tragic","10","1","2","20 September 2002"," Gripping
","Black Hawk Down is simply the best depiction of war I've ever seen (and I've seen lots!). It's so realistic, it's like you're there in the battle field with the soldiers fighting for your life and your buddies. Obvious comparison is Saving Private Ryan, but BHD is even better because it remains focused on the action the whole time and never stops to develop cardboard characters like the former. Ridley Scott clearly knew what he was doing and knew his movie didn't need anything other than intense action and coherence to be a truly great, classic war movie. Not for the weak at heart, though."
"carlabrams","10","1","2","13 September 2002"," Combat with no apologies
","No matter what country you are from, whether Austria or Australia, if you have never volunteered to stand in harms way - then you shouldn't be allowed to criticize this film.<br/><br/>There is no hype, no majesty, no glory - there is blood, there is pain, there is anguish, and there is death.  That is combat - and that is accurately and graphically depicted here.  This is not a telling of the trials of the country of Somalia, it is the depiction of less than 72 hours in the lives of some American soldiers.<br/><br/>The comments that the movie drags, that the combat is so long and you don't get into the characters, that it's all American Hollywood - those writers have missed the point completely.  This is a movie that sums up the reason that men have fought and died since time immemorial - it is said best with the statement not from the movie - ""We few, we band of brothers"". <br/><br/>
These men have no deep motivation that we need to find.  Two things that some of the movie watchers may have missed - first, the US Army is all volunteer.  So to be a soldier you have to volunteer.  Second, to be in Delta Force or the Rangers, you have to volunteer again.  These soldiers are fighting - and dying - because they swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to obey the lawful orders of those officers over them.<br/><br/>Combat as depicted in BHD is what the face of combat really is - Tom Sizemore as the Colonel looking back into his Humvee where all of his men are either dead or wounded - and then going back in.  That is an American soldier being depicted.  From the perspective of this one time ground pounder, this is as real as it gets.  No bloodless wounds where the soldier who gets shot falls to the side and off camera - a squirting femoral artery right into the eyes is what real combat is.  For those of you who thought this movie dragged on - that's combat, and that's reality.  There is no moral to this story, no Private Ryan inner motivation - this is just pure combat - as it really is."
"robitaly","5","1","2","21 June 2002"," A Much Overrated Average War Film
","Black Hawk Down is well made, but in the end it's just another war film. There is nothing new here.  It is the same story, characters, and action that you find in almost all Hollywood war films. Frankly, I found it a little bit boring. In comparison, there is a documentary film about the Black Hawk story (USA PBS TV I believe) which was much more interesting and intense than this film. I also don't feel that ""Black Hawk Down"" is in the same class as ""Saving Private Ryan"" as some have said. I can only give it an average rating."
"UDLoLO","10","1","2","13 June 2002"," This is a war movie worth seeing and remembering!!
","Black Hawk Down is a masterfully done film on a conflict that occurred in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993.  The Army's elite Rangers and Delta Force were sent on a basically US political public relations mission to show that the huminatarian Americans would do all they could to thwart the genocide occuring in Somalia and more discreetly to save face.  These units were not sent to Somalia until the politicians recieved negative press when Time Magazine ran an issue with a starving Somalian boy on the cover.  This film however only deals with the political issues of the conflict in the opening moments of the film to give the viewers a brief synopsis of how the efforts in Somalia had reached the point they had.  After that the story is shown from the perspective of the men who were there, no politicians, no humanitarians, simply elite soldiers trained for combat, to protect freedom and humanity. The film opens the day before the conflict giving a brief view of life in Somalia for these soldiers.  The film offers no deep analysis of individual, independent characters just simple overviews of a few.  This film shows war as a whole effecting every soldier and person with no man being more important than the next, each death being a terrible loss.  I praise Ridley Scott for leaving out all the meaningless banter and frivolous political hooplah and getting down to the gritty, simple fact that in the midst of war only the people within it matter. I haven't seen this as masterfully done since Platoon was made.  After seeing Pearl Harbor I worried filmmakers had lost the concept of what truly mattered in a war film and what the truly important effects of war are.  The only good part of Pearl Harbor was the actual attack.  Thus this film was a breath of fresh air leaving you with the impact of what occured on October 3rd and nothing else.  Allowing you to understand how these men were forever joined together in one day without needing the characters to tell you how they were changed. But understanding it because the film viewer is too changed forever. Understand that this film is an American perspective on what occurred and the impact on American soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for people they didn't even know.  The absolute powerful and moving display of heroism at its very core."
"Doak22","9","1","2","1 June 2002"," Cut the preconceived biases
","Every review of this movie that has given it any less than an 8 has been filled with one of two things--a) exaggerating the sometimes poor quality, or b) talking about how great this could have been if it had instead given more thought to the politics involved. To both I must say a grain of salt and a pattern of objectivism is needed to appreciate just how good this movie is.  I saw it expecting a decent action film, because Ridley is a great action director, but came out feeling utterly overwhelmed because this movie is the epitome of recounting a battle in its horrifying, realistic sense.<br/><br/>The dialogue is somewhat poor.  At the end of the film in Hartnett (I think it was him)'s last monologue, especially, people have complained of the lame simplicity and gung-ho-ishness.  But, I must say, having read the book for English (and everyone shoud both see this and read the book, for historical/appreciatory purposes involving the soldiers who make such valiant sacrifices)   that the dialogue, while admittedly simplistic in intent and uncomfortably gung-ho; is true to the dialogue and feelings expressed by the soldiers who Bowden interviewed.   Therefore, cut the bias, and recognize the realism present throughout the movie, even in dialogue.<br/><br/>On the matter of the lack of political motivation the most obvious argument, of course, is that there is no time in the movie, and that is a good reason. Even better, and far more obvious, is that this movie is not at all about those events, as made clear in the sweet dialogue in which a Delta forcer tells Hartnett he'll be able to think about that plenty when he gets back from the battle.  Even still, some symbolic stuff has been woven, things that did not happen in the battle, that works in the movie to express some of these motivations fairly well.  Also, even further, the book did not occupy itself with these motivations much, either, and fittingly so.  For, this movie is about the battle, and does a damn good job of presenting it, but that is so obvious I need not talk of it.<br/><br/>On the biggest qualm people have had with this movie--lack of character development--I, too, felt a certain amount of lack in this.  While I have yet to see Saving Private Ryan, I understand how getting to know the characters even further in this film might have served to its advantage. To that problem, the answer lies in a couple of sources.  On the matter of editing, this film does a great job, I think, of focusing on the battle at just a long enought time for the events in it (this is after reading the book, mind you, so mock me if you want for that bias).  They are especially hard to express because of the totally chaotic nature of the battle, but the movie did as well as the book (which was perfect) within its own timeframe. Which comes to the answer, which is, that having more character development would either a) make the movie too long or b) have to take away some of the events from the battle.  A few of the important parts of the battle are not included in the movie, even, so removing any more would take away from the battle even farther.  Also, the other thing, is that by not including as much the soldiers become more of a unit helping eachother, sometimes as individuals, creating even further the feeling of responsibility to this unit.  IMHO.<br/><br/>Now that I am done rambling about people having biases, all I have left is to say that this movie is perfectly directed and cinemated (not a word) and acted for what it is--a recounting of modern warfare.  It is as intense and realistic as movies can go for that objective.  The biggest problem is in the sometimes weak dialogue, and it is not only easily forgiven, but somewhat fitting for the people who speak the words.  Everyone should see it for that reason (unless you have a weak stomach) and also for the historical fact of the matter.<br/><br/>10/10"

And Ridley Scott, the master of kinetic<br/><br/>direction, in league with the King of Kinetic movies Jerry<br/><br/>Bruckheimer, do deliver a big rock-em sock-em battle that had me<br/><br/>physically shell-shocked by the end of the movie.  So why am I<br/><br/>pulling my endorsement punch a little?  The problem, which many<br/><br/>others have identified, is that you really don't care about this battle<br/><br/>or the people that fought it because nothing is exposed very much. <br/><br/>If a bit more of the political background and the moral ambiguities<br/><br/>of the Somalia situation were laid out to us, and the bitter epilogue<br/><br/>played out more, I think we would have been more involved. <br/><br/>Another problem is the multi-person cast, none of whom are given<br/><br/>enough screen time to bond with the audience.  I would have loved<br/><br/>to know a little more about that Delta Force spook who gets picked<br/><br/>up on his bicycle to start the movie; he epitomizes cool.  And the<br/><br/>Somali warlord/power player was a total mystery to me as to why<br/><br/>he was even in the movie, although he sure was a character. <br/><br/>Once the battle scenes start, it's tough to tell the players without a<br/><br/>program, the only faces I even recognized in the middle of all the<br/><br/>banging and explosions was Tom Sizemore (since I loved him in<br/><br/>SPR) and Josh Hartnett, because he is supposed to be the<br/><br/>Sensitive Soldier.  And the Somalis were like the Germans in the<br/><br/>old WWII movies, just cannon fodder for the M-16s.

","This movie was amazing. My blood pressure went sky high during the entire movie, with every gun shot, I would get tense. Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Banna, and Ewan McGregor were terrific, and haha Ewen Bremmer brought comedy into it,...though it was shortlived. I really loved this m ovie. I really loved how this story was portrayed. I was so angry though, so angry at what was going on, and to know it really happened, and to know its still happening today in Somalia and other countries. And that it takes the loss of life to really bring that to people's attention. There was one point where it was said that it took killing people to negotiate. Thats the saddest thing of all, people dying...<br/><br/>A+ definatly for this movie!"
"kennez","10","1","2","18 January 2002"," One of the Best War Movies of All Time!
","Black Hawk Down is one of the best war movies of all time, but the remarkable thing is that it is a TRUE story!<br/><br/>People complain that the visuals are wrong, or the lines that the actors say during the battle is laughable, but how do they know? Were they there? Granted, artistic licence has a part, but, by all accounts, this is a very real account of what happened in October 1993.<br/><br/>Those people that say they couldn't care less which characters died have not taken into account that it was real people that were killed, and the actors are just showing the audience what happened.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the film. This is about a mission that I would class as a successful failure (the objective was completed, but too many good men lost their lives for no reason at all). The whole movie was really tense, and, even though I had read the book before seeing this movie, I was really shocked at the way some of the Rangers were killed, and amazed at the courage of the two Delta snipers (Shughart and Gordon) who dropped in on their own to protect Durant's crash site against crowds of Somalies. No wonder these two men were awarded the Medal of Honor! The film, for its length of 144 minutes, was basically a 120 minute running battle, with 20 minutes of build up at the beginning.<br/><br/>The battle was well filmed, and, even though the characters were hard to tell at points, the script was good.<br/><br/>Sure, there were things missed out of the film that were in the book, such as the airdrop of ammo and IV bags, and Mike Durant being forced to make a video, but ultimately, these wouldn't have really made a difference to the film.<br/><br/>Don't believe these so-called 'professional' reviewers in newspapers. I read a review this morning where the reviewer kept talking about a film that was 10 minutes shorter than the real movie, and he mentioned things that were not in either the book or the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend that you make up your own mind about this movie, but don't go to see it is you don't like too much blood and gore. I give this film 10/10, and a place in my DVD collection when it comes out!"

","Was dying to see this movie, immediately upon release, but was uncertain I could handle it.  Finally went.  I recommend that all American adults see this movie.  It was exceptional.  I have never left a movie where everyone leaving was silenced, even the mouthy teenagers.  It made you THINK!!!! Made you grateful for your life and grateful to all those who have fought and continue to fight for our lives and our freedom.  I'm not a fan of war movies for the sake of a war movie, I prefer those based on true stories. I think this movie is OSCAR material.  I enjoyed the performances of Tom Sizemore and Josh Hartnett; both are wonderful actors and should also be considered for OSCARS.  This is a must see."

","This is one of the best movies of all time.  There are good movies and then there are movies that change your whole view.  Black hawk down is one of those movies.  Everything about it was great, the way Ridley Scott showed both sides of the conflict.  I felt like I was a ranger, a part of the mission and everything that happened to them happened to me. Some say that the viewer could not connect with the characters, but I did.  I felt for my fellow rangers and delta force, and in war thats how it is, sometimes you just meet people beforing going into war.  It was touching without being sappy like Saving Private Ryan, I recommend everyone see this movie!!!!!!!!"

Thank god this wasnt another crap  war flik like hmmmm, PEARL HARBOR!. Also (possible spoiler) the two greatest CHARACTERS in this movie are the 2 Snipers that are sent to Durant's crash site to help secure. If you didnt read the book at mentions in the book that those two were awarded the Medal of Honor. Some might speak of no characters to ""root for"" or whatever but the heroes in this movie are those Two Snipers. God Bless All those men who died and god bless RIDLEY SCOTT!!"
"mercurygoddess","10","1","2","21 January 2002"," If you Love war movies, you'll Love Black Hawk Down!!!
","Well, like I said, if you're a 'war movie' fan, you're going to want to watch Black Hawk Down! When I heard of the title,I thought, ""hmm...what is this movie about?"" But it's a good thing that it left me at that point because the title made me and my friends curious. It made us want to go and check it out! That's a very good thing because it's not until after you watch the movie do you realize what a mistake you would've made if you had never come down to see it. Well, the trailer made it look awesome too! From that point, I was already pumped up to go and see it, but of course I had to wait a month to see it because it was still December. To tell you the truth, I have already seen the movie twice and am willing to go for the third round. Movies like this one (Black Hawk Down) Heaven and Earth, Saving Private Ryan, and Pearl Harbor, are the movies that I'd rate at the top of all war movies.<br/><br/>I loved the way the director made the movie seem like it was so real! I mean, it was a true story but you can just feel that adrenaline rushing through your veins and it made you want to just get off your seat and fight with the American troops! I'd also like to add how the movie just went straight to the point, leaving no guesses! I remember thinking, ""I feel as if I'm watching the news!"" because I saw parts of the movie just as I saw on CNN.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was so dramatic and parts were gruesome, and some other ones were funny. That is such a winning combination. I've never cried, braced myself, and laughed so hard in less than two minutes just watching a movie. I mean, from the time when someone died, to someone almost getting shot or almost dying, to someone who can't hear was totally funny...(well, that's if you've seen the movie). It's great how the movie keeps you up the whole time! A couple of friends, family and I saw the movie at 11:40 p.m. and we stayed up throughout the whole movie. I mean, at that time, you're probably already tired from either work, shopping, staying at home, but this movie would keep you watching! There's just non-stop action and that's definitely what the audience wants. We don't want the movie to drag at all.<br/><br/>
I noticed that the majority of the actors chosen for this movie are also from the movie Pearl Harbor (my second best war movie aside Black Hawk Down). It's unbelievable! They did a good job representing who they were. I mean, there you have Josh Hartnett, the ever-so-gorgeous looking man (alive) in the movie. I loved his character! He was so soft spoken, yet he was a good leader for his troops, and he knew his stuff. Then you also have Tom Sizmore, the Mr. know-it-all, yet funny guy, also a good leader, then there's Ewan McGregor, the dude behind the desk, the funny coffee maker who is totally surprised once he finds out he's going out to fight but feels totally freaked about it. But it was funny how he portrayed his character. And then there's Orlando Bloom, from Lord of the Rings, who is really serious about fighting, so motivated, and ready to fight, but later is injured went the Somalians targeted their chopper. Ewen is just too funny! Just like he was in Pearl Harbor. These are just some of the roles that you'll find interesting.<br/><br/>I thought about how these little things in the movies that we don't normally pay attention to really mean a lot if you catch it. I mean,  the characters in this movie obviously play different roles and that is something that you'll notice in the movie. The actors obviously knew how to portray their characters and that's what made it seem so real. They all looked like real military boys! It's just so awesome! I really am dying to watch it again and again. Hey even when I needed to use the restroom, I told myself ""no way I'm getting off my seat because I am not going to miss a thing!"" I just can't explain (on computer) how excited I am for this movie but I do hope that they take this movie to the AWARDS! It deserves the biggest award. I hope the audience LOVED this movie. Wow! I wish I was a part of it! Hard work and fun is my philosophy and that's what this movie was about!"
"padiyark","8","1","2","20 January 2002"," Best movie about guerrila warfare ever
","I had heard about this movie since about October of 2001.  The fact that Ridley Scott was directing was exciting enough, but the fact that this was about the 1993 battle in Moghadishu, Somalia was all the more reason to see this.  I vividly remember Somalis dragging our dead shirtless soldiers through the street like they were a piece of meat and was thoroughly p***ed off by that.  Many in the press at the time called that a failure of our special forces, which I did not buy; I thought that our special forces did well, but it's the men in Washington (especially Clinton) who messed up.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I saw Lord of the Rings and thought that that was one of the only movies of 2001 worth seeing.  I now have to place ""Black Hawk Down"" in this category as well.  This movie captures everything about the hell of war as well as US intervention in other countries.  Yes, we can make similarities to ""Private Ryan"", but this movie hits closer to home because a. it speaks about the type of war we are now used to (guerrila warfare), which really doesn't have a winner and b. the fact that we are facing a current war now.<br/><br/>Most films on war so far have dealt with the conventional war that we are used to seeing.  A possible exception may be ""Platoon"", about the Vietnam war, but I really count that as a conventional war because we had a defined enemy.  This movie, on the other hand, deals with an unexpected confrontation with an enemy that really had no face--a true guerrila war. The movie spares nothing to the imagination.  I myself felt lost in parts of Moghadishu with the soldiers; the film makes you relate with what it was like to try to find your way to a downed helicopter while having to fight an enemy that you couldn't really see or identify.  What is was like to be forgotten and find your way to your company in a mindfield of people who were after you.  What it was like to see people you worked with blown apart by rockets while having to fight the faceless enemy.  I could go on, but I'll let you see the film instead.  I was also surprised by the fact that they did show the dead american soldiers being dragged through the streets, and quite frankly, as disturbing and sickening as it was, I'm glad they did to show how chaotic it was.<br/><br/>And the best part of the film is that none of this is glorified.  We are not seeing Rambo blowing the Somalis to smithereens while he never sustains a scratch and able to escape a situation with his brute strength.  We instead see and feel what it is like to fight a real war and be pinned down, even when you are the best of the best.  I give a lot of credit to Ken Nolan (screenwriter) and Ridley Scott for not venturing into Hollywood territory. Ridley himself wanted to make this film a documentary, and has done a beautiful job at doing that.  I was almost scared that it would when I saw that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing the film.<br/><br/>As for the cast, excellent job by all.  Yes, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, and Josh Harnett are in it, but as far as I'm concerned, they did their job; they made me believe that they were the soldiers fighting this war.<br/><br/>Now let me deal with some of the criticism I have read about the film. Some have said that it doesn't allow for characterization.  I think that is thorough B.S.  Watching this film, you ARE with the Special Forces/Delta Force, and though you won't remember the names of all the characters in the film, that works to the film's advantage because to us, they are any Tom, Dick, and Harry that we know on the street, not some superhuman commando portrayed by a faux hero like Arnold.  We empathize more with them. Second, some will say that this movie is racist because it shows black guys fighting against white guys.  Hey, this isn't the US; it is Somalia, and everyone there is black.  And most of the special Forces were indeed white (from what I understand, only 2 of the commandos were African Americans, and one is portrayed in this film).<br/><br/>I say that this should get at least a nomination for best picture and best director, if not win in these two categories.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie should be recommended viewing for the entire public and especially to the beauracrats in Washington; the beauracrats should know what it's like to send our forces into an area that they barely know and into a war that is not ours.  I never blamed the troops for what happened; they were just doing what they were ordered to do, and they did it superiorly in the situation they were in.  Instead, I blame draft-dodgers like Clinton for putting them in such a hot situation without thinking things out.<br/><br/>I've always had respect for our men in armor, and this movie is a testamen t to those who put their lives on the line for their country.  God bless the 18 soldiers who left us and the United States Armed forces."

","When I saw the trailer for this movie it didn't look very well done or interessting, It looked like just another war movie that had already been done. Yet when I went to see it I was amazed at how well done this movie was. It grips you from the moment it starts till the momment it ends with action and an excellent insite into how cruel war can be.  The cast was also very well selected and fit very well into the roles they played of real men who live and died in that war.<br/><br/>The thing that shocked me the most was how they had all that action and I couldn't pick out what was computerized and what was real. Jerry Bruckheimer did an excellent job of producing this movie, it's definatly the best film I've seen in a while. I give it a 9.2"
"kubrick09mp","9","1","2","20 January 2002"," a wonderful film
","Black Hawk Down is like Saving Private Ryan without all the trite garbage in the middle.  It is a harrowing, gritty look at the realities of combat that doesn't let up until the credits role.  The performances are all very strong, with no one big name trying to steal the show.  Ridley Scott does a good job in capturing the youth, vigor and determination of our soldiers overseas.  He also does a good job portraying the way our government cripples our military before it can act, which leads to debacles like the one depicted in this film.  Though perhaps not a film for everybody, it is a must see for those that are interested in the misguided American foreign policy since WWII.  It is also a must see for those who want to understand the spectacular young men that are risking their lives as we speak in order to defend our freedom."
"davidguay","10","1","2","20 January 2002"," A film about friendship, bravery, and honor.
","""Black Hawk Down"" is one of the few movie screenings I've ever attended where no one talked during the 2-√Ç¬Ω hour running time. No one left their seats until the movie ended. Not one. One of the most powerful and realistic films I've ever seen. It tells us and shows us exactly how it is. This is a film about real people in the real world who were placed in harm's way solely because of political expediency. Many of who really died.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott masterfully directs in such a way that he takes the most chaotic and confusing of situations and makes it clear to the movie viewer what exactly is happening and does so on a multi-dimensional level.<br/><br/>The screenplay allows the characters to explain what war on the battlefield is about. Before the raid one battle tested veteran says to a soldier who is untested: ""When that first bullet goes by your head, politics goes out the window.""  Later, when it is all over he explains that when he goes back home and people ask him what happen, he won't even try to explain, because they would never understand. In battle it is always about the same thing he says, ""just you and the guy next to you.""<br/><br/>Every politician should be made to watch this film to see the human toll from the decisions they make. ""Black Hawk Down"" brilliantly demonstrates that war is not a military act but a political one, and that there really is a difference between dying for something and dying for nothing. Every one of the soldiers who were killed died for their friends. None of them died for nothing."
"snafu801","Null","1","2","20 January 2002"," The Greatest War Movie of All Time
","In my opinion this is the definite greatest war movie ever made. I know that most people will still say that Apocalypse Now or other classics are still the greatest but I beg to disagree. Movies like Apocalypse Now have since been very outdone by movies such as Saving Private Ryan and recently Black Hawk Down. Black Hawk is a thrilling adventure of many America soldiers sent to a place in Africa to kill the leader of a terrorist group. This movie is so great I can't believe it. From the first fight scene it had me on the edge of seat and it kept me there until the ending speech. Anyone that has the slightest interest in war movies should see this movie. In fact everyone should see this movie! It is such a great film and deserves to be an all time classic."
"alasdairwclark","6","1","2","20 January 2002"," Big budget, small script.
","A good war movie can be one of the most moving and involving experiences of a movie lovers life. Nothing can quite encapsulate a male's need for violence, patriotism and comradery as a good 2 hours of explosions and war induced brotherhood.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down unfortunately is NOT one of these movies. What, in the the first 20 minutes, starts as a promising illustration of western might and morality overcoming an evil third world dictatorship, turns into two and a half hours of unengaging battle and bland characters.<br/><br/>None of the large and talented cast are given enough screen time to truly shine (and even though I am a huge Ewen McGregor fan, his accent was laughable). It is this lack of individual screen time that leaves the audience feeling detached from the actors and ultimately not caring what happens to them.<br/><br/>The film is not without its touching scenes however, and the direction is so fast paced that you are left no time to be bored. Overall an alright movie that could have been SO much more. Do yourself a favor, read the book instead."

"Daniel Ocean","10","1","2","20 January 2002"," BHD, Greatest war film ever made??
","After seeing Black Hawk Down only one word came to mind ""WOW""! That's all I could say, it is just brilliant and surpasses every war film ever made. It features the best and most realistic battle scenes ever put on film. If everyone remembers how well Saving Private Ryan did with the message of ""War is hell"" you will certainly realize how good and how straight forward Ridley Scott is with the same message. As I was watching this film about a failed mission that was supposed to last only an hour but at the end it was near the 16 hour mark, I really got to care and respect each and every character despite the lack of character development. I got to know each character as the movie went one therefore character development would have been pointless because as I watched these guys get killed I felt a tremendous amount of emotion for each character.Why? because I got to know them as soldiers before the battle began. I didn't need the whole life story in order to appreciate these guys. Moving on, I do want to point out that this film is very violent and features probably the realest and most graphic scenes ever. You see open wounds and you see men with there legs blown off. If you have a weak stomach I advise you to turn away during these scenes because they are like I said very graphic. Another thing to remember if your a parent is this: If you must see this movie make sure you find a sitter because it is NOT for kids... I recommend this film to any adult that enjoys war films and film making at an all time best. It's very emotional and very touching. An unforgettable experience. Not even the very good Lord of the Rings is better then this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down: 10/10"
"LaymansTerms","Null","1","2","20 January 2002"," Neat Film, Lazy Audience
","When I read the book this film was based on I sometimes had to take a day or two off before continuing... the imagery, atmosphere, and details were that disturbing to my ""civilian"" mind. With that experience behind me, the movie was not as harsh/shocking.  This allowed me to focus on aspects other than just the ""shock"" of seeing blood, guts, and body parts in a story.<br/><br/>This is unlike Saving Private Ryan (SVP) where the initial ""shocking-brutal-harshness"" of the first few minutes hit me like a ton of bricks.<br/><br/>I like this move.<br/><br/>What I can't understand is why so many people whine about the lack of ""character development"" or ""not getting to know enough about this-or-that character"" to feel their pain!<br/><br/>When I drive by a serious car accident, I don't know anything about the peoples' lives or characters yet, I ""feel"" for them and their pain/hassle. Why would this change when I watch a movie about how brave/desperate men fought for their lives?  Ever think of using your imagination to fill in the family, friends, etc being left behind by a dying movie character? Humans are generally all the same... how much hand holding do you need to imagine what the soldier on the screen is feeling as he dies?<br/><br/>Oh, and to the ""boooh-hooo-hooo... I was a little confused with the ""chaos"" during various fighting scenes"" crowd... Are you kidding?! Perhaps they all should have run around with numbered football jerseys so you could keep track play-by-play (complete with slow-mo and arrows).<br/><br/>When I watch gymnastics or figure skating I watch for the skill with which the contestants move. This is an appreciation of the dynamic nature of controlled action. No story, no character development really needed for my enjoyment and wonder. BHD is an account of a desperate fight between a small but well trained group of people against a large but poorly trained group. Throughout the film you are given an opportunity to get a ""SMALL taste"" of various moments that occurred during the mission. The actual people, what they say or decide to do is not really all that important.<br/><br/>OK, one last point: If you're going to a movie you know is about intense combat why in the he*l would you complain about being de-sensitized to the RPG's and explosions? What do you think happens during combat?<br/><br/>
I think I will buy this one when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Black Hawk Down: 8/10"

","Besides being a huge war movie fan, after hearing ""the best war movie ever made"" and other critical acclaim of that nature, I was SO excited to see BHD.  The cinematography was amazing, of course--Ridley Scott is an incredible talent.  The sights and sounds were all there.  However, I felt little or no emotional connection to any of the characters--the only characters I even wondered about were Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, and Ewan McGreggor because I could recognize them.  I didn't even know Josh Hartnett's character's name by the end of the movie.  I didn't care about any of them because there was absolutely no character development.  What's worse is the last five minutes when Josh Hartnett and some other guy I didn't recognize gave their ""Why we're doing this"" speeches--like Scott wanted to spell out a moral for us at the last possible minute.  The film lacked focus--it was like an adaptation of a book that was so true to the original text that it didn't coherently transfer to the media of film. However, like I said, the design and production were incredible which means I give BHD  6.5/10."

"janyeap","Null","1","2","19 January 2002"," HAUNTING TRIGGERS OF HUMAN EMOTIONS IN ACTION...
","SPOILERS... BEWARE!<br/><br/>What a haunting movie filled with an explosion of graphic realism! I've never been more traumatized with any other war movie since ""Apocalypse Now."" All the adrenaline-pumping feelings that came with the book flooded back on screen.  This is not a movie about the politics of Somalia war, nor is it one that's meant to impress anyone with exhibits of sophisticated military gadgets and surveillance techniques. This is about a collective group of honorable men willing to die for their honor and for their buddies. Plato's words: `Only the dead have seen the end of war,"" at the beginning of the film, sums up the contents of this film and Evermann's final statement, at the end, confirms my expectations. This is the story about soldiers who are not out to try to be heroes, but end up doing things that make them heroic.<br/><br/>
Two Black Hawk helicopters shot down; men trapped in a perilous city gone crazy.  The Director has superbly captured the personal accounts of the dangers, frustrations, fear and grief of the soldiers on the s***ty Mogadishu battlefield. This movie provides an uncanny exhibit of distressing portrayal of human behavioral struggles, inherent and unpredictable. It's watching members of the US Rangers and of the Delta Force as if they were badly manipulated pieces on a chessboard. No organized moves only to be faced with surprised attacks! Most of the soldiers were very young men called to battlefield mission for their first time; many are from the Rangers infantry.  Their implied well-planned task was to capture two of warlord Mohamed Aidid's high-ranking deputies.  But they soon discovered that their real combat engagement was different from their routine training. Young men in their early twenties summoned to serve with cocky and arrogant members of the Delta troupe.<br/><br/>This movie is not about the soldiers' individual characteristics or traits; it's about it's about a team of men struggling  for survival on a historically ill-fated day.  Embattled young victims of erroneous circumstances! Clean-cut young men filled with optimism at the beginning but had to live through hell the moment they are dropped into the `Mog.'  An hour's mission turned into 15 hours of helpless desperation. Commandos and Rangers at odds! Indeed, this is a movie that spells out their experience, confusion, fear, courage, bravery, convictions, loyalty and dignity. I watched in horror seeing the handful of Deltas plunging out of a convoy to get to a crashed chopper on foot.  I gasped as I watched hands foraging into Sgt. Smith's cauterized pelvis to grab and clamp a retracted artery.  I choked to see the splattered blood, guts, and body parts merging with mud. I grieved watching people shot and senseless deaths. Their fears were mine! Nineteen American soldiers, and hundreds of Somali men, women and children, killed as a result of one foreign policy gone disastrous and chaotic!<br/><br/>
Ridley Scott has definitely succeeded in exhibiting the inhumane brutality faced by men at war. So much visual details to leave viewers with moment-by-moment accounted chronicle of the living nightmare for the men involved. The spectacular cinematic effects and moods combined with the astounding Hans Zimmer's eclectic music score certainly pump up a hellish atmoshere throughout the movie. I was entirely mesmerized and psychologically blown to bits as if my own body was being mutilated. Yep, I felt as if I was right in the heart of the battlefield, panicking and trying to stay alive throughout the two hours and twenty-five minutes of this film. Astounding and realistic camera shots and amazingly credible cast of acting talents!  A phenomenal war film that focuses brilliantly on human emotions and spirit. it gets my A+ rating!"
"Ron-207","10","1","2","19 January 2002"," Best War Movie Ever
","I saw BHD last night and it was everything I expected. I had read the book once and was halfway through a second reading prior to seeing the movie. What makes BHD so unique is that 1)the movie followed the book closer than any movie I've seen and 2)the book was based on facts. Mark Bowden has commented/written that he did not put anything in the book that was not only reported by those who were there but corroborated by others who were there.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone. There is no love story, no slo-mo flag waving set to a swelling score. It is 30 minutes of background information followed by 2 hours of modern combat - the most hellish place on earth. I went with my brother-in-law and walking out he said he could not believe only 19 Americans were killed.<br/><br/>I realize not everyone will like this movie but I would like to address two criticisms that are being made. As for what some would call ""sappy dialogue"", try to think about what you would say if you were about to die in the worst place on earth you've ever been. As for the claims of racism re: no blacks in the Delta Force/Ranger task force, it is my understanding that most blacks cannot swim at all and/or very well. There are stringent swimming requirements to get in Special Ops which most blacks cannot pass. This is not meant to be a racist comment, just a statement of fact. If this is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.<br/><br/>This should get Best Picture/Best Director. A must see."

"the-watcher","9","1","2","18 January 2002"," Cruel, painful but necessary
","By now, everyone should know the plot, etc so I'll cut to the chase.  This show is raw, visceral and almost painful to watch.  Not because it is bad, rather it is good, too good.  You can feel the pain and torment in the soldiers caught up in the fight.  You can empathize with their loss because they are just your friend/buddy/mate next door, whom you trust your life with.  This type of bond is rarely experienced outside the uniform services, and is specially strongly here and it shows.  The cruel part is to see young, healthy people cut down in the prime of their lives for a cause that was good but so poorly and disappointedly, lost.  BTW, I had bought the hardback version of this book back in May 1999 and had only the opportunity to read parts of it as it was painful for me to read it (for the above reason).  This movie made me confront the entire issue again.<br/><br/> I can't say enough good things about this show, with a few exceptions.  The characters are not developed enough.  As such, the show is too short and too long at the same time.  Too long, because the fire fight especially some parts could be condensed since parts have already been cut out.  Too short as you don't know the various characters except for the first four of the billings: Eversman (Harnett), Grimes (McGregor), McKnight (Sizemore), and Hooten (played by the Aussie, Eric Bana) as well as MG Garrison (Shepard).<br/><br/> However, to the younger viewers, this movie will NOT strike a cord as most have already been in my view, desensitized by games like ""Counterstrike"" and various FPS where you can kill and be killed without suffering any loss, much less pain of injury.  This is in my view, another tragedy in itself."

","""Are you exhausted? "" director Ridley Scott asked his audience when he took the stage for a post-screening Q&A session in NYC on 12/20/01. And they were. Scott then claimed that ""Black Hawk Down"" is an ""anti-war movie,"" one certainly not one to be construed as a ""recruiting film,"" but the fact is, it could be shown proudly in any American Legion hall and rally the youngsters to sign up afterwards in droves. Those that are not scared by blood, that is. Doubtful that you could recruit many medics with this true-story depiction, since they bear the brunt of the horrors of war here. But I digress. The movie--to its credit--does not. Hypnotic opening visuals and atavistic tribal music create an aura of famine and hell on earth in 1993 Somalia that compell attention, attention that does not stray until final credits. It's an epic, but awesomely believable entertainment in which a real town in Morocco stands in for Mogadishu as well as Ridley might stand in for his director brother Tony. Does not compare in scope with Scott's Oscar-winning ""Gladiator,"" but certainly in craft.<br/><br/>An unforgettable old-fashioned cowboys-and-Indians showdown where the cavalry does not come to the rescue, at least not in time to save 19 young Americans. Biggest flaw here, shared by other huge combat dramas such as HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" and Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" is that there are so few central characters and so many look-a-like white American soldiers in this ensemble cast that the viewer loses track of who is who. Fortunately, Tom Sizemore is recognizable here strutting his stuff as almost exactly the same fearless non-com combat character he played in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" so thanks to him for the visible reference point. A movie that has to be seen in the wake of September 11 if for no other reason than the point it makes very early on about the crucial role solid military intelligence plays in any successful operation, especially against terrorist civilian militia in the middle of a third-world urban war zone. Makes Afghanistan look like a training exercise, especially since there were three times as many U.S. combat deaths in this 24-hour operation in Somalia than there have been so far in weeks of fighting against the Taliban."
"ashturner-79373","6","2","7","29 January 2019"," Fine, but not as clever as it might think it is.
","Despite the ensemble cast, there are only a couple of interesting characters here, mainly the ones whom the film spares time to focus on. Eversmann is the obvious protagonist, a reluctant leader who keeps morale up but feels guilty when some of his men die. There's also Grimes, who can feel overly comedic at times, but it's nice to see him grow from the out-of-his-depth coffee boy to a reliable team member. Most (not all, but most) of the others are recognisable only because their name is scrawled on their helmet, so really this is a movie about the situation, not the characters.<br/><br/>It's pretty detailed in that regard. The jargon-heavy dialogue and cold radio chatter set the tone, and there are some very memorable moments like when Blackburn falls from the helicopter or when Othic pockets a severed hand he finds on the ground (the movie literally pauses for a second in surprise at that one, which is a nice touch of editing). It's a shame that so much of the runtime is people shooting at each other, which lost my interest when it wasn't moving the characters along through the plot.<br/><br/>The score blends typical elements like synthesisers and drums with traditional African choruses and instruments, which is cool, though some of the guitar-driven rock music would feel more at home in a video game cutscene. Visually, there are lots of sickly greens making the very environment look unwelcoming, but the cinematography isn't too memorable otherwise, and there's too much headache-inducing editing and camerawork. The soundscape, overall, is very nicely designed.<br/><br/>Repeated throughout is the message that ""no man gets left behind"", but that patriotic sentiment is contrasted with horrific injury detail (poorly imitating ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)?), as well as dialogue from Somali characters criticising the Americans for getting involved in their civil war. It all feels like an effort to mask the otherwise nakedly patriotic portrayal of Americans and unsympathetic portrayal of Somalis, whose militia come across like a savage horde of zombies. I do like the symbolism of Garrison mopping up blood in the hospital.<br/><br/>I guess you're supposed to come out of this film feeling like you've just witnessed a tale of true camaraderie, but to me it felt more like the tale of a cock-up of American interventionism. It's mostly well-made, but it's not as heady or insightful as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>6/10."
"CherryBlossomBoy","4","2","7","27 December 2016"," An extended Army commercial
","At the very end of the film, Eric Bana's character 'Hoot' munches through a chewing gum and gives a soliloquy where he explains why soldiers do what they do. ""We're not some war junkies, (munch, munch) no. We do it for (munch, munch) the man next to us. That's (munch, munch), that's all there is."" Bana's emphatic munching while delivering the speech is an odd acting choice. I'm still at odds whether this was supposed to be a misguided portrayal of realistic parlance, or was he just satirizing the text. Which is what he should really do. Because that explanation doesn't parlay well into young civilian's motivation for choosing a military career. ""Hey, I'm signing up because I want to be there for a fellow man!"" can just as well be applied to deciding to join a football team, or a cult, or a stamp collector group. In any case it's an inappropriate conclusion to a film that is little more than a masturbatory love letter to the Long Arm of the US foreign policy.<br/><br/>Because the first and foremost goal of ""Black Hawk Down"" is to make the US Army look *cool*. From the slick shots of the ""Hueys"" flying into action over an exotic backdrop, over the soldiers spewing witty one-liners amidst gunfire and explosions, to a slow motion shot of a couple of them treading the streets of Mogadishu in the style of Magnificent Seven, the message is clear: ""US Army is where it's at. It may lose a battle or two, but it's righteous and glorious."" Ridley Scott, an Englishman, went out of his way to outdo his brother Tony's USAF commercial that is ""Top Gun"". He lent his mastery in visuals and direction to deliver a propaganda piece timed and engineered for the US invasion of Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Camera-work, scenery and action set pieces are great, occasionally truly gripping. Everything else in this film ranges from cynical to dishonest: on the nose moralizing, whitewashing the cast, portraying the enemy as a faceless horde, distorting the historical evidence... to name a few things. Glossed over are the murky reasons US Army was sent to Somalia in the first place. The Somalis' motives for the fight are mentioned as an afterthought, just to give an appearance of a balanced point of view. The involvement of other countries in that ""peacekeeping"" mission is neglected. It doesn't matter, it's not a historical film anyway.<br/><br/>It's not an anti-war film either. To some viewers, portraying the battle that has gone wrong and was essentially a failure is a tantamount to a call against armed violence. Not in my opinion. I think glorifying a tragically botched military operation yields a far stronger reaction than filming the one that was successful and completed. It makes a young viewer want to join and finish the job. What difference does it make whether it's Mogadishu or Kabul? They all look the same, don't they?<br/><br/>And no, Mr. 'Hoot', you're not in it for the guy next to you, you're just a war junkie. Otherwise you and that other guy would have just stayed at home."
"kenjha","2","2","7","30 December 2011"," Tedious and Rambling
","This war movie recounts U.S. military action in Somalia in 1993. It is action-packed, which is not surprising given Scott's reputation as an action director. In fact, there is little here beyond battle scenes. There is no plot other than American forces taking on the forces of the Somali dictator. As there is no drama, there's nothing to hold the interest of any viewers who are not military buffs. The battle scenes become increasingly tedious, and the film rambles on for nearly two and half hours. The early scenes focus on the strategy of the Americans, but there's little that is compelling and the characters are strictly out of central casting, wasting a good cast."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","3","2","7","3 December 2011"," Emotionless turkey shoot
","The main problem with this film is its lack of emotional engagement with the characters. There is a long build-up- too long in my view- at the start in which we see the troops larking about and preparing for their task. But, in contrast to the style of older film making, we learn nothing about their inner lives. They do not discuss their girlfriends or the ""folks back home"" or mention their hopes for the future. So when the shooting starts, the men we are supposed to be rooting for are no more well drawn than their opponents. It is telling that the most emotional moment is the shooting of a Somali whose son throws himself on the body.<br/><br/>This lack of emotion is not helped by the general style. Quick editing and the fashionable 'washed out' style of colour make this look like a PC game. Ridley Scott is no doubt trying to recreate the confusion of war. But there is a difference between depicting confusion and actually confusing the audience.<br/><br/>The music is often in a different rhythm to the film, which adds to the confusion. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not. For example a scene with an armed car going down a sniper's ally is overlaid with a folk-type tune. This does not vary even when the young man in the turret is shot to ribbons.<br/><br/>The combination of loud music and the general din of battle make the soldiers sometimes hard to understand. This adds to the confusion. I found it helpful to use subtitles.<br/><br/>After the long drawn out opening, the remainder of the film is an unremitting sequence of battle. ""Unremitting"" is the object word. In 2 hours there is no respite to the gory and violent. There are no quiet scenes. One could say this is a more realistic version of a battle than old Hollywood would make, but does that make it a better cinematic experience? Seeing one body after another being shot for several hours is actually boring to watch."
"quinnox-1","4","2","7","31 October 2011"," Wears out its welcome
","This movie is two and a half hours long, and even though its full of non stop action and war scenes, it gets boring and drawn out. After about an hour and a half, the action started getting stale and tedious. But it just keeps going for almost another hour and its the same thing, the same kind of battle scenes, it got really dull. Also, I never got the feeling these guys were really in the action, most of them seemed to come out of the many battles unscathed and there was no real sense of them in danger.<br/><br/>The movie is well done in its production qualities, and the camera is used to good effect with nice shots and overall its a pretty movie in the way its filmed. But the movie's tone seems to think that it is much more serious than it really is and has a fake gravitas that it gives itself, when its basically a very superficial movie.<br/><br/>The patriotism angle is played too hard and is without subtlety, its like the movie says - look at all these heroic American soldiers and they all are so noble and brave, fighting against these black savages who appear to have endless numbers and who want nothing more than to kill them - I mean, seriously, give me a break. <br/><br/>Plus many scenes were too composed and almost looked like a music video or something with slow-motion and corny ""African"" music playing over the scene. In sum total, an over-rated war movie. The recent sci-fi/war movie Battle: Los Angeles was better than this in both the action and being fun to watch."

","A standard issue American heroic movie. This movie is more or less the same as most ""heroic American"" moves, except for the goriness of the movie and fact that there are multiple heroes and no single Rambo-type hero. The movie does not give you any interesting characters; in fact the film gives you nothing interesting at all. The Somalians are all bad guys with guns that are killed in endless amounts or some special evil dude that's just evil and cool (in an American laconic way). The movie is practically just a loot of shooting and bombs going of and scenes of Americans who are ""just doing there job"" and saving injured friends without a though of their own security. All with a bit of heroic music playing along while they are killing a couple of hundred Somalians who are otherwise more or less completely ignored. In fact if you where to fall asleep during the middle of the movie you wouldn't miss a thing, when you wake up 30-60 minutes later (except the death of Americans who you have a very poor relation to, or a bunch of Somalians who you know nothing about). All in all, a very intense uninteresting American battle movie with no surprises. I guess you have to be an American or soldier yourself to even begin to like this movie. To all us other, it just a waste of time. Don't see this movie, do something useful instead."

","I just saw the movie on Dutch TV. Unfortunately I did miss the first quarter of an hour. I think the movie described well enough how a US military action can fail. In reality it did really fail. But from what I saw only the US side of the conflict was showed. Maybe good for the US viewers, but a bit stupid for European viewers. People all over the world aren't monkeys anymore, as we believed in past centuries. They are even as proud as some US citisens are and that's what ore small world keep spinning around. In my country there are a lot of people that want to see both sides of a developing conflict, especially when killing is involved. I red comments from outside this site over this movie. I met there the word ""war porno"" and I read about the economic interest of the US in Somalia. Leaving the portraits of the opponent soldiers behind, except just one and leaving the economic question behind makes this movie to an McDonald food, cheap and fast food for the mind. And why a four on the scale of ten: I saw it as an anti war movie."
"noralee","6","2","7","22 December 2005"," Superficial Shoot-'em-Up
","I went to ""Black Hawk Down"" mostly for the line-up of hunks, and it had even more than the highly advertised ones, including Sam Shepherd as the grizzled general and a bunch of guys who I recognized late in the film, such as Ron Eldard and Jeremy Piven, and some whose names I only recognized in the credits. <br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor was on screen for a few minutes and director Ridley Scott should have yelled ""Cut!"" when his English accent painfully came through, but as a Brit himself I guess he didn't notice.<br/><br/>Eric Bana kept his Ozzie accent under control after awhile (and I wonder if his character, one of the few memorable ones, was the guy who we are told at the end is now in jail for severe wife abuse or if I'm projecting from his staggeringly violent role in ""Chopper"".) <br/><br/>But this is no ogle-fest: it's a problem that the guys are completely unrecognizable as I simply couldn't keep anybody straight, especially once they put their helmets on and the shooting started. Couldn't they have bent reality a bit more and given each primary character different, non-buzz-cut hair cuts? Or at least have a few more with their names on their shirts or helmets? ""Band of Brothers"" was easier to follow than this troupe, like ""Thin Red Line"" as well.<br/><br/>While many critics have complained about the short shrift given Somalis and overall tactics and strategy, what I thought was even more of a problem was the Army's blithe neglect that these guys are not trained to counter urban guerrilla action. Maybe riot cops would have been better prepared, or maybe that's the future of peacekeeping actions that needs to be prepared for.<br/><br/>And all the laser gizmos can't replace understanding of local politics. There's fleeting reminders when we suddenly see a schoolteacher huddling to protect her students and a father/son attack team. <br/><br/>This is mostly just a shoot-em-up. Lots and lots of shooting.

","You cannot make a movie that is nothing more than a two-hour shoot-out.  It just doesn't work.  Apart from the fact that the 'shock' of the fight wears off after a while, having a battle scene that takes up 75% of the film's run-time leaves no room for character development - and hence you could not give a monkeys who lives or who dies.  This was the same problem with 'We Were Soldiers', where all of the storyline was condensed into the first 30 minutes, freeing the remaining screen-time to be dedicated to nothing but non-stop gratuitous violence.  You need to even out the action scenes with advancements in the plot to give the story any meaning and to keep your audience's attention.<br/><br/>What's even worse is that the battles aren't even that impressive. Certainly the visuals, sound and editing were better in both 'We Were Soldiers' and 'Saving Private Ryan' (a film made some years ago now).<br/><br/>There are obviously certain historic issues that need to be addressed, but when a movie is this dull anyway, who cares?<br/><br/>Any film that has me fighting to stay awake on a Friday night must have something seriously wrong with it.<br/><br/>3/10"

","This is a movie, made for entertainment value, and that is all I care to review here. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Black Hawk Down, but also was disappointed - for the same reason that the movie is fresh and atypical, it is also cold and uninvolving. In avoiding the usual archetypal-stereotypical characters always found in war movies,i.e., the valiant sargeant, the newbie lieutenant, the Bronx-Brooklyn-Joisey guy, the Okie from Muskogee, the maniac killer, the sensitive soul, etc. etc. ad nauseum, we wind up with ultimately faceless and nameless figures who congeal into an indistinguishable mass of helmets and guns.<br/><br/>Despite the appearance of individual story-lines, I had trouble figuring out who I was watching after a while; there were characters introduced in the beginning who never seemed to appear again, and there were characters who did pop up whose fates seemed to be left hanging. By the end, I was wondering if I had even seen the character I thought I was watching in almost any given battle scene. <br/><br/>The movie is very well done nonetheless, if all you want to see is a thrilling shoot-em-up. In that respect, Black Hawk Down is great entertainment. However, if you are looking for symbolic characterizations and political commentary, go rent a movie like Platoon."

","Ridley Scott blew me away with this tragic and heroic work on 1993s troubles in Somalia. Having been entranced as a ten year old boy viewing Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm, I found even the better war films since wanting by comparison. These two films are utterly differnt in myriad ways but this; they a perfect on their own terms, executed so well, and engrossing -- so engaging that one ought to go away only disatified that one could not have lived through it in person, although the violence is a bit much for REALLY wishing you'd been on the scene, with limbs flying about and such.
I can't adequately describe how this film was so effective, to even dare compare it to the incomparable Lawrence. Every scene just worked. So much battle action pervades, you might think, ""what is the differnce between this and a Van Damme or Chuck Norris picture?' Fair question. All I can say is the acting is fantastic and the action scenes are directed by one of the truly brilliant auteurs of cinema.

","I have one problem with ""Black Hawk Down"", and that is that it spreads itself a bit too thin. There are a LOT of characters in this movie, and while some of them do get fairly deep motivations and backstories, by the end of the film, I still had difficulty telling them apart. So if this review is light on specific character names, I want you to know why. Part of the difficulty of making a movie about a real-life story is figuring out just how accurate you can make it without losing the audience. For the most part, this film succeeds.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a brilliant technical director and visual stylist. He knows how to stage action that is thrilling without being glamorous (can you imagine what Michael Bay would have done to this material?), and the editing and sound on this film are absolutely spectacular. The film deals with a failed U.S. military raid on a Somalian warlord who was preventing U.N. food shipments from reaching the poor and the needy. The time frame of the film is only a few days (I think), and that lends the whole movie a you-are-there quality that is essential to this kind of storytelling.<br/><br/>There are a lot of recognizable faces in this film, but this is not a star-driven movie. Josh Hartnett gives just what is probably his best performance ever as an idealistic young squad leader. Ewan McGregor plays a glorified secretary who gets promoted to a proper foot soldier when the crap hits the fan. Tom Sizemore plays a no-nonsense commander who gradually watches the whole mission fail from a distance. Eric Bana shines as a seasoned soldier who, to some, seems to take almost too much pleasure in his work. Rounding out the cast are plenty of other talented people: Tom Hardy, Jason Isaacs, Ewen Bremner, Sam Shepard, William Fichtner, and more. <br/><br/>This is a film that shines in its little moments. One soldier fires his gun too close to another's head, deafening him. Another steals through an occupied house where a mother sits huddled with her children to get away from the fighting on the street. A donkey wanders through dangerous territory, still hitched to a wagon. This is not the deepest war movie I've ever seen, but it makes its points with a relative minimum of speechifying and jingoism. (There are a few of those moments later on, but they feel mostly earned.) It stands up to repeat viewings, too, which is kind of rare for a movie based on real events. <br/><br/>There are moments where I wish this film had dug a little deeper under its characters' skin, but then again, it might have sacrificed tension in doing so. And if there's one thing that this movie is, it's gripping. I was not in the least surprised to hear ""The Minstrel Boy"" over the end credits. That song sums up the movie fairly well."

They have these two snipers who are the bravest guys ever, just watching the scene where they go to secure a crash site by themselves you think wow they are real heroes. You got some clich√© characters or at least boring characters. Josh Hartnett plays this emotionless soldier he might as well not have been in the movie and definitely not the main character.

But this violence makes this movie very powerful. The score by Hans Zimmer is a masterpiece en really haunts you. Of course, I expected it would be good because of the director Ridley Scott. But still, I wondered what the result would be if Ridley Scott worked together with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I can only say 1 thing about that: the result was amazing. This is a very very powerful film, which is well acted, has amazing, beautiful cinematography and has an amazing haunting score by Hans Zimmer. It's a very violent movie, but also very realistic! A true masterpiece!"
"jgrayson_au","9","1","3","24 November 2007"," GREAT! Watch it with commentary on if you can.
","OK up front, I am going to review this in 2 ways, as a movie, and than as a 'war movie'. As they are somewhat different in a sense.<br/><br/>As a movie: A great, damn near non stop action movie. Very realistic, often brutal, violence. If you're an action movie junkie you'll love it. Whilst I cannot watch this just as a movie, if you are looking for an action flick, this is incredible credits to credits.<br/><br/>CONS: Alas, the only downside, for me, is Eric Bana. Perhaps it's because I am an Australian, but between his dialogue, script, and accent I found him to be distracting and annoying. Luckily, he's not in it very much.<br/><br/>As a war movie: Having said that, you HAVE to remember this is real events and real lives. Whilst I'm sure some people can watch war movies as a movie, I cannot divorce myself of the real events and the knowledge or real lives lost. In that regard, the 'realistic' violence I mentioned before does not boost my adrenaline, but scares me silly.<br/><br/>I own the 3 disc DVD. And as great as the movie alone is, the ability of the movie to move the soul when you see the struggle of the soldiers is amazing. About the only movie I can compare it too is the Shawshank Redemption. What I am talking about here, is mostly with the audio commentary of the returned Veterans. The real men (women?) that were there on the day and risked everything to save their fellow soldiers and finish their mission. <br/><br/>I cannot hope to give the full details on the commentary, but you learn an infinite amount more than the movie, and their struggles are sheer mind blowing.<br/><br/>I urge you, if you can, to watch the movie with the commentary. To at least begin to learn what the brave, amazing, troops do for their country and their fellow soldiers. It truly moves the heart.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it's perhaps poignant to note I'm NOT an American. I believe if I were the effect would be greater still."

","Exhausting (In a good way) and one of the best War Movies i have ever seen (possibly the 2nd best.). It's emotionally exhausting a lot of the time, Awe inspiring battle sequences, with great characters, and some good character development. It's a very powerful movie and not one soon you will forget anytime soon after you have watched it. People with weak stomach's BEWARE! this is not for the faint of heart so if your afraid of it stay away!. It's a very intense movie and it never stops, and will leave you breathless in some places. The Directing is incredible!. Ridley Scott is one of the best there is , he creates a lot of tension, making it always intense, with lots of cool camera angles moving it along at an incredibly fast pace, he was wonderful as usual. This movie is EXTREMELY EXTREMELY gory, weak stomachs beware!. We get Literally HUNDREDS and Hundreds of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, people are riddled with them, exploding body, people get hit by shrapnel (some of it bloody some of it graphic but non bloody), lots of badly wounded shoulders, people get blown to pieces by bombs, severed hand, someone gets nailed with a rocket launcher (Extremely gory!), TONS of VERY bloody corpses, EXTREMELY gory surgery sequences, we see lots of(guts and TONS of blood!) Blood Splatters everywhere, all the time and lots more!. The acting is outstanding!. Josh Hartnett is an extremely talented actor (in my opinion) and does amazing here , showing vulnerability , he hit all the right emotional notes and was extremely likable! (Hartnett rules!). Ewan McGregor is very good here his character was likable and he did a great job overall. Jason Isaacs is fantastic here and added a lot of class to this. Tom Sizemore is always a good actor he was great here and he played a similar role in Saving Private Ryan. Eric Bana was very good here and did what he had to do well. Sam Shepard is excellent as the General. Orlando Bloom was fine in his scenes and the rest of the cast was great!. Overall a must must see! for everyone see it now!. one of the best war films there is (possibly the 2nd best). ***** out of 5"
"jamesandmona","Null","1","3","11 October 2004"," Too American focused
","There is no doubt that the film is well shot and edited, with very punchy action scenes and an awesome soundtrack. But I was still disappointed, being very familiar with the book.<br/><br/>Two things come across in the book but less so in the film. The first is the fact that the soldiers survived only because of (i) the Delta soldiers, who remained composed and effective when the plan had gone to hell and (ii) the close support of the 'Little Bird' helicopters. Although the Delta soldiers' status is hinted at in the film, the impression one receives from the book is that a lot of the Rangers really struggled to cope when things got out of hand, and would not have survived without Delta's leadership (and, let's face it, ruthless killing ability and training). I think on a similar line the film also should have shown the frustration felt by some soldiers with their 5.56mm ammunition, which tended to make surgical incisions rather than knocking the enemy down, hence Delta Sergeant Randy Shugart preferred to use an old Vietnam era 7.62mm M14 - a similar conclusion reached by the British in the Falklands War. <br/><br/>The second thing absent from the film is anything substantial of the Somali perspective. It's all very well inferring that the Americans came with the best of intentions to save starving people from Aideed, but the fact is they never had appropriate local intelligence to distinguish friends from foe and, by the time of the raid, had alienated a number of the Somalis - enough to make a huge crowd want to kill them. The entrenched tribal conflicts weren't going to disappear overnight, and it was naive at best for the US to assume that the tribal culture behind those conflicts might disappear just because a few elite soldiers took out some of the ringleaders. This is alluded to in the conversations between General Garrison and his prisoner, but overall the film gives more of an impression of heroic young soldiers fighting a lunatic mob. <br/><br/>Other than that, or for those only wanting a bit of war pornography, the film is, as I said, exceptionally well shot and with the full benefit of modern technology, to give battle scenes the sort of violent realism made famous by Saving Private Ryan. But there are many far more thought provoking, equally well filmed war movies that I would recommend ahead of BHD (or SPR for that matter): check out the US Library of Congress reissued version of All Quiet on the Western Front for the godfather of all war films, and also Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and, more recently, The Thin Red Line (1998 version dir Terrence Malik)."
"Reggie_Charan","5","1","3","19 January 2003"," Mindless macho action flick pretending to have something to say...
","Here is Black Hawk Down in a nutshell: nameless, faceless white guys shoot at nameless, faceless black guys for two and a half hours. That's it. We're talking ZERO character development here.<br/><br/>The best war movies (Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket) always tempered scenes of combat with a moral regret at human beings being forced to kill each other. Not the case with Black Hawk Down. There is actually little to differentiate this film and many of the mindless macho Vietnam revenge fantasy flicks of the mid 1980's.<br/><br/>Why it garnered such acclaim upon it's release is something I can't understand...."
"rmax304823","9","1","3","7 December 2002"," Mission Impossible
","This is a very difficult film to evaluate. I'm not sure exactly how closely the narrative follows the historical facts, for one thing. Certainly some of the dialog is fictional, but it's less the dialog than the layout of the situation that needs to be understood, and the movie is weak on that point. One of the docuchannels, perhaps Discovery, showed a two-hour special on this incident, shortly after the movie was released. The documentary is a lot easier to understand than the movie itself. I emphasize historical accuracy because the rest of the film is fairly competent and doesn't need much in the way of comment. No real acting is called for. The photography is adequate, tinted beige with flying dust during daylight sequences, almost as much as silent films might have been, and a sort of sickly green at night. I had a very hard time keeping up with the location of the various units, or remnants of units, and with just exactly who was who, except for Sam Shepherd who is easily identifiable. The special effects were up to what one would expect of an expensive modern movie. There was an abundance of realistic gore, of bullets clanking off metal, and so forth. Maybe a bit too much. It was inevitable that ""Saving Private Ryan"" would initiate a new level of graphic violence.<br/><br/>The movie delineates four groups of people. (1) The heroic American elite units, Rangers and Delta Force. (2) The villainous, practically cannibalistic rabble of the Somali ""militia."" (3) The resentful and reluctantly cooperative Pakistanis. And (4) the Somali civilians who are suffering the most.<br/><br/>It's a brave film because its subject is an uninvited intervention in a remote anarchistic country done for humanitarian reasons, and it was a failure. We were supposed to relieve starvation and introduce order into a social universe of moral nihilism. I remember feeling that we were going to have trouble getting along in this place that nobody had ever heard of when clips were shown on TV news of Marines standing guard on trucks that were trundling along the unpaved streets. A handful of laughing skinny kids were running alongside the trucks and knocking cartons of food off into the dust. The angry Marines, used to more discipline, were swatting and shouting at the children. For the first few days, the ""militia"" lay low. (""Militia"" is in quotes because they weren't militia, just warring factions led by charismatic leaders.) After they realized they weren't going to be annihilated, that the UN actually DIDN'T intend to kill everyone and take over, they emerged from hiding doing what they did best, running around with automatic weapons, often mounted on the beds of old pick-ups, and shooting at one another. Well, this was what we had come to stop, right? According to respectable reports in the New Yorker and elsewhere, it was decided on our part that the biggest nuisance of all was one particular warlord. He, out of many contenders, was identified as the ""enemy"" and it was seen as necessary to arrest him, if we could find him first. The search and the attempt at capture, which this movie depicts, seems largely to have been done out of rage and frustration. Well, we didn't get the guy we were after, since this wasn't fiction. And we lost eighteen American men (all enlisted men), and the Pakistanis lost two dozen as well, though the film doesn't mention it.<br/><br/>I was gripped by the movie from beginning to end. What I took away from it was a feeling that there are simply some missions that are impossible. After all, our most highly trained troops took high tech weapons of all sorts and deployed them against a horde of disorganized hostiles armed with nothing more than small arms and grenades launchers. And we sent our men into a country in which little laughing kids could PO the Marines, a country we understood nothing about, against an ""enemy"" that ourselves had defined, in a city in which we didn't know our way around. George F. Will put it very well: ""We have no obligation to do that which is impossible.""<br/><br/>The Gulf War of course was a much larger military enterprise. And when we think of the last war we fought, we think of our overwhelming victory there. I wish that every living person who hungers for war at this moment could see ""Blackhawk Down"" so that they could envisage a different scenario, a different set of scenes than our airplanes bombing missile bases amidst pretty fireworks, our tanks blowing the hatches off those of the bad guys. It's possible that instead of ending in a quick victory, our next military intervention may end up tragically, more of a bloody nose than an adrenalin rush."

","This movie tries to be another 'anti-war' movie, but ends up celebrating war instead. As a viewer, you get almost two hours of constant shooting, gore, and heroism. Here it just comes along with the excuse that those events actually happened. As if celebrating violence is bad if it is fictional, but it is perfectly OK if it is 'based on a true story'. Even those scenes that supposedly demonstrate the hell of war are taken as an opportunity to show how brave 'our boys' really are.<br/><br/>Emotionally, this movie is extremely flat - which is mainly due to the fact that we don't get to know any of the characters. They all are just one-dimensional stereotypes. So we do not really care about them. The psychological stress those soldiers must have been under never really comes across.<br/><br/>Technically, this movie is well done, but it doesn't offer enough substance to be considered a good movie.

","I did not like this movie at all and am surprised to see that other people have given it good ratings. I usaully do not write things like this but what the hell; I don't see many other people recognizing the crappiness of this film. First off, there is no plot set up as there is in other very good war movies such as Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan. Second, there is a sad attempt at character development; the ""heroes"" are given tragic deaths while the viewer sees no tragedy because he or she does not ""know"" the character. One could say that we do ""know"" the characters: Young, American GI's. That would be fine and I could see your point if there was no attempt made at character development, but there is. Some characters are briefly labeled as ""the idealist"" who ""believes in what we are doing here"" or as a bozo who shouldn't really be here fighting this war. Besides that, the acting was so-so and the score was mediocre to horrible; at times the music didn't even remotely fit with what was going on in the action. I am getting tired of writing this review as I feel that I am wasting my time: people will flock to this movie because it plays up to their new-found patriotism, rather than the intelligence that they never had. I would really appreciate it if the intelligent people among you who enjoyed such films as: Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan took my advice and did not go see this film: it is not worth watching."

","I think I've always avoided this movie, until now, because it's a Jerry Bruckheimer flick, and there's nothing that guy can't dumb down. I really can't think of another producer who leaves such an indelible mark on a film that it's instantly recognisable as his. What other producer is mentioned as often in the marketing of a film than Bruckheimer, often more times than the director? He's become a brand, attaching his name generally means you're gonna get a certain kind of movie, no matter who's behind the lens (this time out, it's Ridley Scott, who received his third Oscar nomination for his work here). So my question going into the film was could Bruckheimer leave his usual brand of tricks behind for the serious subject matter at hand, or would it look like Armageddon in Somolia, or another Pearl Harbour? Well, it's not Armageddon in Somolia, and I'm assuming Black Hawk Down is better than Pearl Harbour (which I've never seen, and probably never will). But... it's still a Bruckheimer flick. He still has to have his slow motion epic shots, complete with swelling score, that just screams ""HEROES. THESE ARE MEN DOING MANLY THINGS AND YOU WILL CHEER"". It's that dedication to aestheticism that prevents what is a pretty good movie from becoming a great movie. It's self-reverential in the worst way, and little more than one large battle scene.<br/><br/>It's a pretty impressive battle scene, I'll give you, but it all exists without the proper context or heft that would give it's subject matter the treatment it deserves. The action is furious, the battles feel authentic, the explosions are loud. It's all terribly exciting and engrossing, but empty. Everything that occurs before the battle occurs is tired, clich√É¬©d and ordinary. Scott sets up the quirks of the men we will soon see in battle so that we shall care when they are placed in peril. But it feels stunted and obligatory, and not all that different than the montage of characters offered in Armageddon. Particularly weak is the opening of the film, which treats the viewers to six or seven pages of subtitled exposition, explaining the Somolian conflict and what our heroes are doing there (complete with poorly written, ham-handed commentary).<br/><br/>Here's the thing about movies: they're a visual medium. Use one or two pages of subtitles to begin a movie if you must, but this is a bit excessive. A simple rule is show, don't tell. Even a hackneyed device like having the soldiers watching the news or discussing the newspaper would have been preferable. The whole thing feels so much like an afterthought, that I'm convinced it was one. Test audiences were too confused about what Somolia was all about, so they threw that in there instead of re-shooting a sequence.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer can't bear all the blame for the film's short-comings. Ridley Scott is just as prone to sensationalism and aestheticism as is his production partner. As with his recent Kingdom of Heaven, it appears too often that Scott is more interested in setting up a unique and beautiful shot than finding the reasoning behind the sequence. He's all craft with no poetry. As a result, the film looks amazing, the battle is outstanding, but the whole thing leaves me very hollow, and not just because of the ""war is hell"" theme that always surrounds such films.<br/><br/>While recognising the flaws of Black Hawk Down, I still felt it to be a pretty good movie. And that's because while Scott may be lacking as an artist, he is a master craftsman. The battle is unrelenting and enthralling, and one of the best I've seen for modern combat. While most of the characters are little more than archetypes, I found a few members of the cast really stood out with their performances, particularly Eric Bana as the charismatic Delta Squadron member and Tom Sizemore, who could basically play army guys his whole career and not go wrong.<br/><br/>All in all, despite its many flaws, the superlatives out-weigh them. I enjoyed the flick for what it was, while still wishing the story was put in better hands."
"ssmyth","4","1","4","2 March 2005"," Above average camera work, sub par plot
","Before I begin this review I must note one aspect of reviewing a movie based on a real-life tragedy. In this world of ours it has become almost taboo to say that a real life story of loss or tragedy is bad because it makes us seem insensitive and uncaring towards the characters in the story. Therefore I must ask that you look beyond the fact that I criticize this film and note that I only criticize that which can be changed by the direction, writing, or acting of such a story. In now way am I detracting any honor or praise from the brave actions taken by the US Rangers in Mogadishu on that fateful October day. Now, with no further ado, my review. <br/><br/>Black Hawk Down portrays the gruesome, true story, about a US Ranger raid on the Somalian capital of Mogadishu gone horribly wrong. After a Black Hawk helicopter is shot down by rebel forces (hence the title of the film) all hell seems to break loose as a simple, 30 minute, capture mission turns into a rescue mission. Even though the helicopter is shot down only a few blocks away the Rangers must fight their way through a couple thousand Somalian rebels all well armed, yet poorly trained in a guerrilla warfare battlefield. As night falls the battle rages on and the Ranger creed of ""no man gets left behind"" is tried heavily throughout the fighting. <br/><br/>It is easy to note that the cinematography by director Ridley Scott is commendable as he attempts to capture the true horror of battle, a la Steven Spielberg with Saving Private Ryan or Kubrick with Full Metal Jacket, etc etc. There is however one fundamental difference between Black Hawk Down and other premier ""war movies"", and that is the absolute and total lack of dialogue or character development throughout this movie. It has been mentioned in previous reviews that this was Scott's intention so as to make the Rangers seem similar and almost uniform, yet it becomes easy to lose all sense of location, time, and the development of the story. With no tangible way of noting where each group of soldiers is headed, or even where they are, viewers are left lost until the final scenes when the whole platoon is finally reunited. It is fair to note that as far as I know Ridley Scott remained as true to the real life story as he could, without extensive knowledge of the war in Somalia I really can't fairly comment. Unlike other notable war movies like Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down makes the unfortunate mistake of NOT focusing on a certain group or a certain soldier, essentially losing the audience, and although we are left with a sense that all of them are heroes it is still insufficient because I am unsure as to what each soldier did, or even where they were throughout the film. When a director focuses on so many different characters it makes it impossible for the audience to relate to anyone of them because they are not around for long enough, we do not see enough of them to make any connection. The few times Scott attempts to make a human connection or appeal to our sensibilities he did it so meagerly that I see it as almost silly and unessential to the general flow of the film. The first example I see of this is when upon leaving for the mission one of the soldiers calls his wife at home and leaves a message. I cannot honestly tell you what the message was or even the soldiers name because as I have said earlier it is inconsequential. <br/><br/>In closing, Black Hawk Down ended up being a noble attempt at telling a very deserving story but its dialogue failed to build the plot and for this reason the viewer is unable to relate as much as he wants to with the lead characters. I would recommend this movie to war buffs for its good use of cinematography and above average camera work, however do not expect me to label this as a good movie, even for a war movie."

","This is the kind of movie that's probably going to show up big on Oscar night -- heck, it might even win Best Picture. It's meticulously well made, looks beautiful (if you want to call exploding bodies ""beautiful"") and couldn't come at a better time when Americans probably want to feel good about themselves, their country, their place in the world. But for what it's worth, I really, really didn't find much value or enjoyment in this movie.<br/><br/>
Do people really enjoy watching people get killed in various ways: falling off helicopters, getting fingers and legs blown off, guts spilling into the sand? Do you get pleasure from watching hundreds of Somalis get picked apart and mowed down by rifles and machine guns? Unless you consider this to be some kind of entertainment, there's nothing to recommend this movie for, especially in terms of its ideas. It offers only the most simplistic explanation for what led to the most disastrous American military operation since the Vietnam War. It doesn't offer much insight into the mistakes that were made before and during the operation, and how the government and the military might have reconsidered its policies and strategies to avoid this nightmare from happening again. Instead, it gives us the nightmare operation from start to finish, wall to wall action with little room to think about much of anything but where the next bullet is going to come from, and how the next body is going to get blown up. The underlying logic is that there comes a time when thinking just doesn't matter: it's all about ""the guy next to you"" and what you're willing to sacrifice for that. Ridley Scott calls this an ""anti-war movie"" but he's clearly having his cake and eating it too; it's obvious that he's in love with his own re-creation of bloody, intense combat, and that he can turn it into mass entertainment.<br/><br/>My comments are not meant to disrespect the brave soldiers who were placed in an impossible situation and fought tremendously to get themselves out. I disrespect the people who told (and sold) their story. In trying to give a feel-good patriotic spin to it, they do us all a disservice by avoiding the bigger picture. Heroism is great, but so is wisdom -- the wisdom to know how we can avoid disasters like what happened in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993. This film barely gives us that wisdom, and is far more interested in giving us a blood-and-guts thrill ride.<br/><br/>Four years ago Steven Spielberg claimed that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was the ""war movie to end all war movies"" -- that its graphic scenes of combat would persuade all of us that war was a terrible thing, never to be entered. Now Ridley Scott has made a movie that is even MORE graphic, and will no doubt send a wave of kids to the recruiting station with visions of its patriotic slaughter. Somehow, the madness has to stop."

"AbhiMathews","5","1","6","6 April 2014"," Fate of war
","Black Hawk Down, based on true events, depicts the world's combat against ruthless leaders that oppress their nations. When fighting overseas, especially on a ""peace"" mission, it is imperative bloodshed is kept to a minimum. This film portrays well how that is not always the case. War is not a tool for effective problem-solving, nor will it ever be, and this movie outlines the trials soldiers face. <br/><br/>War films don't always capture the true essence of fighting; the lives lost on both frontiers. One impactful and important aspect incorporated into Black Hawk Down is that it emphasizes civilian rights and how common people are the ones taken advantage of. Whether they are innocent bystanders shot in gunfights, starved to death by merciless dictators or have their children abducted from them, they are the ones who ultimately suffer. It is their participation, or lack thereof, that makes this movie as strong as it is.<br/><br/>Although Black Hawk Down demonstrates the scope of war and combat involved, this is rather superficial and lacks any true entertainment value beyond long gunfights and shooting. It fails to develop the true story of the militants and soldiers and exceedingly exaggerates the plot line. It appears to be one-dimensional in this regard. The movie even dismisses the fact prisoners were captured and does not delve into this topic at all. Black Hawk Down is also unsuccessful in realistically illustrating the events and does not properly acknowledge other countries, ulterior motives for the Americans' ill-advised actions, and is fairly propagandized.<br/><br/>War movies depicting real events have to stay true to the story and pay tribute to all involved and the events they actually endured. Black Hawk Down is too theatrical and employs unnecessary (and fabricated) plot to an otherwise memorable day. Nonetheless, war movies are not documentaries displaying true events nor should they be mistaken as one. That's why they are fictional movies and only that. Regardless of the interpretation, Black Hawk Down lacks the solid execution for an originally genuine and good plot, which is why I give it a 4/10."

There is non-stop action. I also liked the score, but it is not really noticeable because you are dazzled by the visuals and action. There are also some negatives. There is poor character development. The movie doesn't try to explain the characters. Harnett's character should've been more explained. Next, the film is a bit too gory. But, I was fine with that.

This one however is  a resolutly souless peace of film making. Ridley Scott sure makes it look good alright, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Good war movies show the impact of war on a humanitarian level - this one looks as though a hollywood producer thought the first 20 mins of saving private ryan stretched to 2 hours would make a brilliant action movie and it doesn't. whereas speilbergs war film was an assault on the senses, by giving us more gore this film simply dulls the senses, and the final words tacked on to the end of the film only highlight the sheer unabashed tastelessness that runs all the way through it. This film will not tell you anything you already didn't know, and is an insult to your intelligence the minute the ""action"" starts.

","The extras seem to be incredibly miscast in this film.

Presumably all American's assume that anybody from Africa (and Somalia is in Africa so we got that right) look just like African Americans ie they can claim their descent from west Africa? Thats a bit of a fatal error for Sir Ridley Scott, who hails from South Shields (my home town), which has had a Somali community well before he was born.<br/><br/>While those ""mosques"" look more like those you would find in Morocco. Did Ridley do a ""bulk"" location deal with the Moroccan government on his way to shooting ""Gladiator"" too?<br/><br/>Watching the film now in 2005, perhaps one can view it as a bit of substitute ""reportage"" for what the Marines'are actually up to in Iraq or what they have to put up with? As we never actually get to see what they ""do"" on TV or what it is actually like to be an American soldier there, only the aftermath?

Bad bad direction.<br/><br/>As for the event itself, it romanticized a failed mission with ""No man left behind"" catch phrase. Well, they did leave a man behind... many men behind. When they refused to send in the 3rd medevac because it would go down too, they refused to save the dying soldier at the risk of putting more soldiers at risk. Which was the right decision. But if they are going to leave a man behind eventually, they should've done it in the first place with the first chopper and save all those lives. It's about the soldiers? Really??? Eric Bana's character at the end says he's going out there again because there are still men out there.

"Wart_and_Merle","7","0","1","2 March 2017"," It does what it intended to do and does it well.
","This film, which is about a controversial battle during the Clinton presidency, does not set out to cast aspersions on said presidency. Rather, it focuses on the battle, the men who fought in it, and the battle's futility.<br/><br/>In this sense the movie is anti-war. The battle itself makes the viewer uncomfortable and nauseous, that being the intention of the film. However, unlike many war films that routinely castigate some or all of the participants of these fruitless skirmishes, ""Black Hawk Down"" rather treats the men who fought and died in Mogadishu with respect. Each man has a little humanity given to him. When some of these men die, an emotional connection is felt, even if it's fleeting.<br/><br/>It becomes a problem, however, when the sheer number of characters you need to sympathize with before they are killed or otherwise incapacitated in the battle is something like ten or so characters. Add on another ten or so characters who survive the battle or are merely observing it, and the problem runs deeper. Even though I have now seen this film in the vicinity of thirty times, I still have trouble remembering who is who during the heat of battle and what they are doing and where they are going. Although I now know most of the actors who appear in this film, when I first watched the film I had no idea how to tell one apart from the other aside from their locations (in the city, in the helicopters, back at the base). I believe much of that problem stems from the fact that ""Black Hawk Down"" has a run time of nearly two and a half hours, which is not short, but the battle takes up so much of that time (at least two-thirds of the film) that any character who gets screen time (and most of them get a bit) is given so little in any meaningful way. If one wishes to give these characters the proper amount of screen time before all goes to hell, one ought to opt for a longer film, provided the director can sustain interest in a film surpassing two and a half hours.<br/><br/>I can say, however, that the inadequate screen time afforded most of the actors here is essentially my only gripe with this movie. It's a somewhat big gripe, but it does not ruin the movie for me. In any case, I would rather have some humanity given these characters than have no humanity whatsoever.<br/><br/>Everything else in this movie is at least up to snuff. All of the actors do fine and give their characters some of that needed humanity where they can, especially during the battle. There is no stand-out performance here, but I feel that is unnecessary here as the actors get the same amount of screen time for the most part (with Josh Hartnett as the de facto lead having the most by only a bit). This helps the viewer see all of the men as equal and as equally likely to die during the skirmish, which ratchets up the tension.<br/><br/>The music bolsters the emotional basis of the movie without overpowering it in the process. Since Hans Zimmer sometimes does exactly that, it is fortunate that he does not do so for this movie, especially during the death scenes.<br/><br/>The best part of the film, however, is the battle itself. While it seems strange to recommend a movie that seems anti-war for the warlike portions, the battle is, in a sense, the main character of the movie. It is never treated as a good thing, but it is treated with wary respect. The sound, the look, the feel, ""Black Hawk Down""'s battle gets everything correct in the technical department. The special effects and sound design people deserve all the praise heaped upon them for creating an engrossing and sometimes squirm-inducing battle.<br/><br/>The emotional basis of the battle never devolves into the equivalent of a patriotic march. It instead displays a fraternal kinship amongst the soldiers as they are battered, shot, and sometimes torn into pieces. The phrase ""No man is left behind"" or a variation thereof is bandied about with frequency. Also, as Hoot (Eric Bana) says near the end of the movie: ""They won't understand why we do it. They won't understand it's about the men next to you. And that's it."" This, I believe, is why the film was made. I don't believe there exist many anti-war films that decry the nature of war without also denigrating the soldiers involved in the wars, nor do I believe there exist many pro-war films that don't lapse well into jingoism. (If someone wishes to prove me wrong, please let me know.) Ridley Scott instead, in my view, takes the nuanced position of being against war while understanding the struggles and hardships the men endure and why they do this. I appreciate this greatly, especially coming from a Hollywood movie. It is the main reason I love this film.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a fine technical achievement with a frequently overlooked message as its beating heart that, while not given its full due here, deserves more notice."

We know at the end, that this particular episode wasn't a great victory for the USA. But hey ho, every US soldier who died is a brave hero listed by name at the end of the film, the hundreds of Somali's were just cannon fodder and clearly every single one was a savage committed to the cause. Were all the Somalis on the same side? Who cares. Where did their weapons come from? Who cares. The one thing I do remember from media coverage of the actual conflict was footage of some of the bodies of American soldiers captured during the battle being dragged through the streets. Clearly this would have distracted from this ""accurate"" portrayal which rather than being heralded as a graphic representation of real events, should be more widely recognised as a recruiting flag-waver. If it didn't pretend to be something its not, then as an action thriller, it is well crafted and I would have given it higher marks. But people have been led to believe it is more than that, and that is really unforgivable."
"DVR_Brale","7","0","1","7 October 2016"," Almost completely action oriented war movie with amazing camera work but little elements which go beyond immediate battleground
","I've almost forgotten how patriotic Americans are before seeing Black Hawk Down again. There's almost no scene where natives are being portrayed as human beings. And that's my main concern with this movie. I think real war horror would have felt much better if killings of all those thousands and thousand of natives brought more emotion. Instead, this movie has a great replay-ability because it's fun and cool. Other than that, everything else is very fine; be it production, sound design, effects etc. I have to mention amazingly done camera work; camera is very dynamic and shaky hence putting you straight into the combat. Bad camera work was my main problem with David Ayer's Fury. So to conclude the first part: this movie is not similar to Schindler's List, but is more like Saving Private Ryan with almost non-stop action.<br/><br/>Let me remind you that Ridley Scot produced Blade Runner (1982) and directed Alien (1979). Blade Runner was nominated for special effects and Alien won one for special effects. It's no wonder than that BHD feels so great and fast paced. If only I had seen it in the cinema! Acting performance was convincing and solid be it American soldiers or Somali people. In my opinion latter ones out-casted American soldiers. Their role was to play savages and they did a great job. And no matter what other claim, this dichotomy of savage-soldier is pretty obvious.<br/><br/>I think directing and producing war movies is the toughest of all genres. Here you stand in front of a phenomenon which is much larger than anything else one person can comprehend. All those tears and pains, angers and reliefs, all those ""quite human"" reactions and behavior has to somehow be presented to a viewer. I don't think BHD does that very good. I love, for example, scenes where American soldiers joke around in their base just before leaving for battleground. But this alone is just not enough. There's a scene where and old man bears a dead child in his arms in the territory where bullets fly around. All those attempts to present real war horror where overshadowed with focusing to much attention on one side only. Yes, I know plot was written to tell a story about those 123 American soldiers who had to fight someone else's war, but ten minutes would've been enough to make this much more emotional movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion: if you're in for a lot of action accompanied by amazing camera work that will make you feel like a comrade, you won't find few movies as good as BHD. If you're looking for true war horror which goes beyond battleground, look for something else."

Watch Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys 2, the Transformers movies. They all have the exact same filter that this movie has on, and they are all ugly looking. The action is more coherent than in a Micheal Bay movie, as you can actually see what is going on, but that doesn't make it any better. The action in this movie is so... labored, rudimentary. It's...

"C22Man","4","0","2","2 July 2016"," Could and Should Have Been so Much More
","You have to question what Black Hawk Down is trying to do in order to understand it. If it's trying to be a simple, straight to the point war film then I suppose it succeeds on a number of levels. If it's trying to tell a detailed and interesting account of real life events then it fails massively. This is a film where everything is on a surface level. Even attempt to dig a little deeper and you will be left bitterly disappointed. For all its technical excellence and hammering intensity, the film lacks intrigue or balance or emotion, just anything that makes you invested in what's taking place.<br/><br/>The film is based around the real life Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993, when a raid by the U.S military went disastrously wrong and troops were trapped on the ground under heavy fire. I say based because a lot of stuff is fictionalised (as you would expect) despite what the film tells us. The first 30 minutes of the film are absolutely pointless in reflection. Instead of at least trying to develop the vast array of characters or explore their internal thoughts, the film just wastes time on a whole host of war movie clich√©s. The soldiers lounge around, they insult each other, some of them are scared but others are calmly confident. This might make them seem authentic, but it isn't going to make the audience remotely interested in them once the shooting begins.<br/><br/>Once the troops land the film basically becomes one gigantic action sequence. Men are split up, helicopters get shot down, the injured have to be rescued and the superiors behind the scenes bark out orders. It's all done with great efficiency. However, the film is so pounding and forceful that it never gives itself a chance to breathe. As a result there is little chance to build up any drama or provide vulnerability.<br/><br/>You have a number of capable actors present who are just playing blank slates when they could easily have delivered so much more. Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs, Sam Shepard, these guys are perfect for the film yet they're so underused. Josh Hartnett is effectively the main character but he delivers a performance of dour machismo because the script won't let him do anything else. The Somalians themselves are faceless antagonists, which I don't usually have a major problem with as most war films have portrayed the opposite side negatively, but I think the lack of any type of development is disappointing. They just seem to want to irritate the American forces, there's little to them beyond that.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott shoots the film with great vibrancy and a visceral edge. His vivid visual style is easily one of the films highlights. He manages to make the battle scenes feel up and close, giving them an almost documentary-like quality that works very well. There's also no denying that the action is incredibly gritty and intense. There's no attempts to sugar-coat or exaggerate and I respect the film for that. Plenty of blood is spilt, limbs are blown off, soldiers are trapped in wreckages, it's very brutal stuff and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The attempts to recreate these hectic fire fights are some of the film's most effective moments.<br/><br/>Yet no matter what the eventual outcome of the film is, it boldly makes the point that these men are heroes. It doesn't matter if they're victorious or defeated, the fact that they were willing to die for their fellow man is enough. Now I like the thought behind this idea, but it ends up falling flat. Because the film doesn't explain why the soldiers are there, we never know what they risked their lives for. I don't like how the message ends up being handled or how preachy it gets. It's almost as if the film is saying that it doesn't really matter whether you're fighting for something that might be morally wrong because you stood by your fellow soldier and got behind your country. War films should always at least attempt to examine the psychology and reasoning behind war, but this is something that Black Hawk Down completely bypasses.<br/><br/>Going back to my earlier point, the main problem with Black Hawk Down is that it is all surface. We end up knowing very little about why the United States is there in the first place, what they're trying to achieve or what is going through the minds of the soldiers. I understand that the film is trying to make these soldiers more true to life, but for the film to really work then they needed to be fleshed out because once the action starts you don't really care who lives or who dies. It doesn't even bother to deal with any complicated issues that may arise, whether they are political or moral. For all its grittiness and technical skill, if it's not going to develop anything then why should we should we try to be invested in it?"

","Black Hawk Down is stated to be based on actual events, the story focuses on highly trained American troops sent to Mogadishu, Somalia, in late 1993 to disable a powerful Somali warlord. Their mission is to kidnap high lieutenants who've helped him hijack United Nations food shipments and sustain a rule of terror and starvation. Their obstacles include aggressive enemy soldiers and legions of hostile civilians, plus what they see as inadequate support from US leaders. The nightmare grows worse when two of their high-tech Black Hawk helicopters are shot down in the heat of battle. The soldiers in Black Hawk Down acquit themselves bravely, achieving their goals in some cases, sacrificing their lives or limbs in others."

Based on the true story novel by Mark Bowden, Ridley Scott does the 1993 event justice by bringing it to the big screen.

","There is no doubt about the level of realism exhibited in Black Hawk Down. The explosions look more like real explosions compared to the fuel explosions we're used to, the fog of war is dense throughout, and the steep difference in skill between trained soldiers and angry men with automatic weapons is clearly visible. I was reminded of a recent Vice documentary about the Malian Army's fight against their local rebels where in the end the French army had to come and clear the village like a deus ex machina when the local force couldn't.<br/><br/>Well, realism is expected when based-on-real-life-events meets Ridley Scott. And realism, to an extent, is good. But here it seems to highlight the testosterone-fueled romanticism we are fed with in between all the shooting and mayhem, which just doesn't sit. In a more drama- like war film it wouldn't bother me that much, but when the tone of the movie is the same as in a military recruitment video, it sticks out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>The grittiness of a shootout, with dust and mud getting everywhere, the numbing stress, the mix of utter fear and cold determinism, those all come across here. But the drama part, the content this movie advertises itself with, is a bit cheesy to my tastes and exposed with the well-done fight sequences. Soldiers under fire are not in shambles, I should know, but neither are they spitting out instantly quotable lines or delivering moving monologues at every opportunity."

It also would have been more judicious to reduce the number of protagonists because it is sometimes very hard to identify them in the heat of the action.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it is incredibly dense but this pile of fancy names, in the context of the film, turns out to be kind of pointless.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Black Hawk Down is just a vast street fight, surely very well filmed, but too long and totally unproductive."
"TheMarwood","6","0","1","27 May 2014"," Jingoistic, kind of racist, but spectacularly well made
","Ridley Scott delivers a blunt force patriotic American film that is so jingoistic that some scenes seem one step shy of having 1-800-GO-ARMY appear on the screen. It's an unabashedly American film that shows delight in filming the American flag, as well as mowing down as many 'skinnies' as possible. There is a scene when an American soldier is wounded next to the downed black hawk and after he is killed by a rampaging mob of Somalis, they tear off his clothes and parade him around. That is not the offensive part, it's how Scott films them - close ups of grunting Somalis that seems like he's filming animals. In fact there is very little humanity on display in Black Hawk Down, the American soldiers are all cardboard cutout noble and most of the cast is indistinguishable from one another, with the exception of easily recognizing Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner because of their poor American accents. When I saw this film in theaters in 2001, I detested it, as it felt like a piece of violent propaganda. Years later, I revisited the film and while it still suffers from those issues that bothered me on first viewing, I was able to appreciate just how damn well made the film is. The cinematography is masterful and the action is staged almost perfectly. On a technical level Ridley Scott did deserve his Best Director nomination and the film is worth viewing for the sheer level of craft on display."

","Black Hawk Down is a film that shows a true story of a group of soldiers caught up in a fight with Somali soldiers and citizens who attack a US aircraft. This is not an anti-Somalia story as one very specific scene will help to present. This story is one that shows how a group of people can turn on a country they consider to be the enemy and how that perception of the enemy country can be perpetuated. It also shows how one small mistake in a hostile environment such as the one shown can lead to disastrous consequences.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is great at action. That is no secret. He has made several great movies with some excellent action sequences. This one is one of the most tragic tales he has put on screen. There are many scenes that are hard to watch. The shots he gets on screen are incredible. Scott does a great job to direct these fine actors and puts together a gritty film that puts you in Somalia during this battle.<br/><br/>The actors were great but I thought Tom Sizemore was excellent. He built on his role in Saving Private Ryan to become that leader who will never stop until every last man is out of the line of fire. He put on one heck of a show. Josh Hartnett was good but he sometimes tends to lose me in the many blank faces he makes in just about every role I have ever seen him play. It does work very well in this film however.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to just about anyone that likes a good action movie. I could see some people having a hard time with some of the scenes as they are hard to watch and even heartbreaking at times. This is a fitting tribute to those soldiers involved in this incident but nothing will ever be enough to make up for the lives lost."

","Ridley Scott's account of the U.S. Marine incident in Somalia of October 3, 1993. Scott provides the drama, producer Jerry Bruckheimer ensures the expected carnage and explosions (plus a bunch of actual Black Hawk helicopters!). A wonderfully diverse cast of both top actors (Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard) and former unknowns (among them, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Tom Hardy, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau and Orlando Bloom) portrays the various Army Rangers and their commanding officers, who set out to perform a mission that soon spins out of everybody's control, resulting in a spectacular but horrific onslaught. Dispatched to arrest several high ranking officers of a vicious local warlord in Mogadishu, their objective swiftly turns into a basic fight to get out alive as the soldiers find themselves severely outnumbered when confronted with thousands of angry Somalis. All hell breaks loose on the city streets as a humongous firefight ensues that will witness several Americans gutted publicly and not one but two Black Hawk helicopters taken out. Not to mention the hundreds upon hundreds of Somali footsoldiers that got themselves killed in their attempt to simply overrun their highly trained opponents instead of going about their business with any tactical sense. Starting things at a surprisingly slow pace, an eerie calm before the storm you know will follow, Scott introduces the platoon of sympathetic young soldiers at his leisure, portraying them as fairly naive and rather bored by the lack of action, clearly not entirely grasping the gravity of the tense political situation they're in. But then, how could they predict things would get this bad, considering it wasn't supposed to go down the way it ended up doing? The moment they go in, there's no more time for levity and laughs since what follows is two hours of non-stop action where these boys have to deal with everything their military education had hoped them to avoid. Scott proves completely uncompromising, revealing the absolute brutality of the events in all its graphic horror, resulting in a harrowing viewing experience that's clearly not suited for everybody: if you're uncomfortable at the sight of bloody operations without sedatives or any type of gory dismemberment, you had better stay away from this film. As sudden as it started the fight is over and we're simply left numb and combat fatigued, wondering how things could have gotten so terribly out of hand so fast (even though the mission wasn't actually a failure by definition, as its goal was secured!). Despite its powerful punch, the movie tends to feel monotonous after 80 minutes of relentless gunfire, while it's a shame the Somali point of view is only briefly addressed (since 90% of the Somalis in this film end up as cannon fodder, it would have been nice to know what they thought they were fighting for). Nevertheless, Sir Ridley has clearly proved he's just as adapt at making daring, gripping war movies as he is at historical epics and science fiction pictures. Though there's little doubt audiences will prove as adapt at sitting through this cinematic battle from hell without any sense of shock and horror."

","I've seen this film three times now, and after the second time felt that it was your typical Hollywood revisionist film that attempts to turn a failed battle into another victory by the invincible United States army. However after watching it again last night I realised that this was not the case. In fact the film, despite changes to the scenario to make it more palpable for the viewing audience, shows the United States Army in a scenario where they have always found difficulties facing, and that is with guerrilla warfare.<br/><br/>I guess the reason I have come to that understanding is because at the beginning of the film there is a belief that the mission will only last an hour, and in fact we have soldiers removing metal plates from their Kevlar vests and not taking bottles of water simply because of the belief that they will be back in short order. Obviously this failure to prepare for the inevitable was one of the problems that they faced.<br/><br/>The mission to Somalia as a whole was pretty much deemed to be a failure. The original objectives was to attempt to restore order to a fragmented country and this has basically not happened. Somalia today is just as dangerous as it was back in the early nineties when the US led UN intervention force first arrived. In some ways it can be seen to be even worse now due to the infiltration of extreme Islamist militants, and is one of those countries, like Afghanistan, which can be considered a haven to terrorists. In fact the region around the Horn of Africa has become one of the most pirate infested waters in the world.<br/><br/>I can't say that Ridley Scott is one of my favourite directors, but that is probably because he is typically Hollywood, and in a way what this film does is that it does show some American success in what turned out to be a failed mission. They do say that this particular mission was a success because all of its objectives were met, however considering that the US military lost two Blackhawk Helicopters, and nineteen special forces soldiers were killed, thanks to a bunch of untrained militiamen who, according to one character, 'can't even shoot straight' makes one wonder about the definition of success, and whether they attempted to rewrite the events to gloss over the failures of the US army."

Every man goes into the army full of pride and thinks that this will become the best adventure in his life, sadly it turned out to be total chaos. Every solider in the movie was determined to rescue the injured pilots no matter what.<br/><br/>Every close up shot of each solider showed real fear, a fighting spirit and determination. This kind of spirit keeps solders energized and ready to fight again tomorrow and without it then where is the purpose of putting your life endanger if there is no fighting spirit and some one who appreciates your hard work. Each solder has a purpose on the battlefield which includes watching each others back and sometimes having to make the hard choice of rather letting you take the bullet rather then your comrade.<br/><br/>The battle shots sometimes take me into the actual movie. The movie shows that it can be me fighting a war somewhere in the future. You never think that you have it hard until you see this movie or you read something about a conflict happening somewhere around the world. Directors have the great opportunity to bring film making to the next level which is fantastic. Steven Spielberg did an amazing job on this film, he even brought a war that I didn't even though And made it fantastic and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Even though this movie was one of my favorite I do wish that there could have been for story and a heroic conclusion. Most movies that I have seen either end in great conclusion or they continue in another movie. This movie left me puzzled. I did intend to see a comeback from the United States military but sadly there was nothing. Nevertheless this move was fantastic, this movie is recommended for people who love brotherhood within movies, determination and those who have a fighting spirit."

","""Black Hawk Down"" was a very good movie, however, it starts losing its intensity midway. The main story of American soldiers trying to take over a city in Africa to stop the starvation of its people, gets broken down into separate stories of the groups of men who have different missions. It starts out well but slowly gets confusing as large amounts of soot start covering the mens faces, and soon you can't tell who's who. Then, as the stories jump back and forth from group to group the viewer becomes utterly confused on who the people are and what they're trying to do. The plot starts out following the stories behind 3 men, Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Grimes (Ewan McGregor), and Blackburn (Orlando Bloom). The story sticks with Eversmann the entire time but slowly loses all contact with Blackburn, (after a nasty fall), and Grimes. This leaves the viewer thinking ""Where did those guys go? Were they the ones that just got shot? So who did just get shot? And why is he making coffee in a battle zone?"" It leaves a lot of questions unanswered but is overall pretty riveting."

","I'll start off saying the first 40 minutes of the movie is a waste of time. I get no attachment to any character and the only thing I get out of it is the mission plan to go inside the city and get the warlords.<br/><br/>After that, the rest of the movie is filled with lots of action and gunfights. However after 30 minutes of watching the action, you get annoyed and frustrated at people missing shots constantly at 20 yard range.<br/><br/>You can't place a machine gun with a 100% clear view 20 yards from 10 guys and have him miss every shot. To go on and then claim this is one of the greatest war movies is even more of a shame.<br/><br/>Another huge issue I have in the story is Mike Durant, the pilot of the second chopper that goes down, is taken hostage after exhausting all his ammo and the two snipers who go to save him die. This is historically accurate, however after being taken hostage they show him being talked to by one of the Somalian soldiers, and then you never hear of his story again. What happened is he was taken hostage for 11 days and then let free. They could have at least put it inside the ending credits next to the 19 Americans dead and 1000 Somalians dead. Seriously, how R. Scott was nominated for Best Director is mind blowing.<br/><br/>However, giving credit where it's due, the sound in the movie was excellent and so were the visuals.<br/><br/>Definitely wouldn't even put it near the same level as Saving Private Ryan, FMJ, and other great movies."
"tomb_92","6","0","4","30 January 2010"," Disappointing and badly written, but it's not all bad
","I'm not a fan of Ridley Scott, I find he so often gets carried away with ""projects"" and makes them unnecessarily long and often they become boring. Black Hawk Down is no exception. It is too long. The character development is virtually non-existent, which considering the length of the film is inexcusable. Also, it means that I actually don't really care about the characters because I have no emotional connection with them whatsoever. So when it comes down to it the only way to identify the characters is to classify them as either American or Somali, which for me kind of defeats the humanist point that Scott was obviously trying to get across. On the other hand there are some good actors to look out for, Eric Bana, Josh Harnett, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom all make welcome appearances. The film does also make some interesting points about war, interesting given modern events and that it was made pre-9/11. In the end the film is good to watch for its nice visual effects and extremely gripping fight scenes. The film did grab me emotionally, but not because of the events that the characters found themselves in, more because of the situation that the Somali civilians found themselves in, something that the film didn't cover (which is fine because that's not what it's about). I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't particularly connect with the characters, in what was an overly long film with drawn-out fight scenes that are well done, but frankly boring."
"Blueghost","Null","0","1","30 November 2009"," Good dude flick.
","I've written some pretty lousy reviews of late, even on films I liked. I dunno... maybe I was feeling rotten, or it was that cold I've been trying to kick for the last week. Anyways, here's a film I'm good with. A good old fashioned shoot-em-up flick.<br/><br/>A little history; Somalia was an independent kingdom until the European Age of colonialism. Prior to and during the second World War it was an Italian holding. The extreme racism that characterized fascist Europe did not penetrate deeply into Italian Somalia. As such you get some very mixed and interesting ancestries on the proverbial Horn of Africa.<br/><br/>The Italians eventually left. And with them went any semblance of civilization. Tribal ties in that area of the world are the only political force recognized. Well, that and an AK47. So, when there's a drought and the crops and cattle die, who do you blame? Why, logically your neighbors and whatever multitude of tribal deities abound.<br/><br/>So it is with Somalia, and so it is that the population has overburdened the ecosystem, which, without modern farming techniques, cannot sustain the population levels. When you mix that with an uneducated people you get a disaster brewing.<br/><br/>""Black Hawk Down"" shows one of the many episodes of military intervention that the United States has had to venture upon, and usually with mixed results. The episode regards the planned ambush and downing of a US Black Hawk helo, and the combat that ensued from that.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott puts his masterful commercial-film-making style to the story , to create something that's actually worth looking at once, possibly twice. Shot in North Africa (Morocco I believe), Scott craftily reverses angles to make the North Western African coast appear to be its polar opposite.<br/><br/>Cinematography is a must see in this. There's a lot of detail and mood manipulation via color extraction and enhancement from scene to scene. The acting is solid, though the drama seems somewhat overplayed. The story is told mostly from an accurate account written and transcribed from the meticulously researched book of the same name by Scott Bowden. Bowden actually went to Somalia to ask questions and look at the locations of the battle. A thing this writer would not do. Kudos to him.<br/><br/>If I had a gripe with this film, it would be the story telling avenue that Ridley Scott took. And that is to meld a couple of the characters together to keep the story moving. It's not really his fault as such. It's a common enough device to more compactly transcribe some real world event onto the big screen. For me, I would've preferred the approach used in ""TORA TORA TORA"". Keeping things real, so to speak.<br/><br/>So, why were we in Somalia? Initially to feed the population that was starved because of crop failure brought on by drought. The result of that was the creation of a ""Mad Max"" like world where armed gangs roamed the streets, wielding power by stealing UN Food shipments. George Herbert Walker Bush ordered the military to go in and escort/guard the UN food shipments. Clinton came into office, and decides to try to solve the Somalia dilemma by pursuing a policy of ""nation building"". Hence our forces are beefed up, and we're suddenly trying to go after the various warlords. Aidid, the most powerful one, sees an opportunity to demonize the US so he can eventually reign over Somalia by generating support for himself. Things spiraled out of control from there.<br/><br/>I actually remember the day this episode happened. And scratching my head as to what was going on down there. The media reported that an engagement had taken place, showed that horrible footage of the dead US soldiers (rangers?) being dragged through the streets, but then nothing more. And no one, and I mean absolutely no one, in the mainstream news audience got anymore information than that.<br/><br/>Circa 1996 or 1995 Frontline did an investigation, and aired piece that ran one and one half hours on the disaster that was ""The Battle in Mogadishu"". Again, I was there when it premiered (though I may have the air date year wrong), and was very curious to learn the truth of what happened. Incredible.<br/><br/>Some thing left out of Ridley Scotts film; there were two Apache gunships also involved in the fighting providing support, as well as a SEAL team who were with the holed up rangers and delta operators. <br/><br/>All in all it's an extremely violent film, but one that's pretty true to the facts and spirit of what happened in Africa some 20 years ago. I can't watch it more than perhaps once a year. The special edition DVD has the Frontline piece I mentioned, though it's been trimmed down to an hour in length. The one comment that's been edited, but that I'll never forget, was a large bald serviceman smiling at the Frontline camera crew and shaking his head as he told them his thoughts during the firefight ""Nobody, not my friends, not my family, not my school teachers, knows what's happening to me right now."""

What bothered me was that there was no attempt made to show the Somalian side of this crisis that occurred after the Black Hawks were downed, neither the militia or the civilians. Could it be that it does not matter to Hollywood?<br/><br/>A scene at the end was disgraceful. Were those Indian soldiers there to serve the US soldiers drinks? The way they came with the drinks on trays and towels on their arms made me think there was a 5-star restaurant in the US base.

"jzappa","8","0","1","8 July 2009"," A Combat Blockbuster That Does Not Trivialize the Experiences of the Troops
","Neither a nationalistic constitutional in military muscle nor a sublime allegory about the fruitlessness of war, this Bruckheimer-produced blockbuster chronicles a U.S. military raid that went miserably awry when Utopian intentions ran into unforeseen defiance. In Somalia, in 1993, 18 Americans were killed, 70 more were wounded, and inside days President Bill Clinton pulled out troops that were on an altruistic errand. At that point, some 300,000 Somalis had died of starvation, and the U.S. purpose was to assist the arrival of U.N. food shipments. Somali warlords were more concerned with insulating their territory than feeding their people, a beforehand word to the wise of the sort of fanaticism that led to 9/11.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's $90 million thirteenth feature is unbending in its intent. It wants to chronicle as precisely as possible what it was like to be one of the soldiers under fire on that mission. Hour by hour, step by step, it patches up the sequence of actions. The idea was to set up an unforeseen incursion by helicopter-borne troops, joined by ground forces, on a meeting of a warlord's top lieutenants. This was thought to be such a bottom-line errand that some soldiers left behind their canteens and night-vision gear, expecting to be back at the base in a few hours.<br/><br/>Enemy rockets brought down two of the helicopters. The warlord's troops rapidly cohered and surrounded the U.S. positions. Roadblocks and trifling transmissions hindered a support convoy from convening. And a cruel crossfire blossomed into a struggle of shame, remorse and erosion. The Americans gave better than they got, but from any perspective angle, the U.S. onslaught was a total mishap.<br/><br/>The confrotnation indeed appears to have disintegrated into a gory free-for-all. Ridley Scott's realization is to relinquish it to some coherent degree to the audience. We understand, more or less, where the Americans are, and why, and what their situation is. We follow several leading characters, but only the sharpest of us may keep track of them and discern one from another. The movie doesn't rely on dialogue or characterizations. It is about the coordination of that day in October, and how training did help those soldiers to secure their own lives as well as probable when all the designs went wrong and they were forsaken.<br/><br/>Showing implicit resilience in the face of a logistically mind-boggling production, Scott's compositional approach makes use of the aspect on that day of aerial spotter planes with infra-red sensors that could expose the action of the humans below. As the engagement unravels, Sam Shepard and his fellow officers can follow it on screens, but are incapable of taking advantage of this news. It is a valuable means for keeping the audience informed. We trail various dispersive strands: A man falls from a helicopter and is injured when he misses his descent rope. A pilot is taken prisoner. Frantic melees expand in streets and rubble as day turns to dusk. The Americans are short on ammo and water, confronting attackers not too reticent about subjecting themselves to peril.<br/><br/>Though designed for action fans, Black Hawk Down doesn't have leonine limelight characters like most war movies. The leading characters are played by stars who will be acquainted with persistent moviegoers but may be hard to tell apart for others. They include Josh Hartnett, who makes us truly belief his character's concern for public welfare, as a staff sergeant in command of one of the raiding teams; live-wire Ewan McGregor as a Ranger specialist whose specialties are paperwork and coffee-making until he is pressed into service; Tom Sizemore as a veteran who provides steady counsel for younger troops, and the ardent William Fichtner as a chivalrous fighter who seems to have mentally embedded every atom of training, and exemplifies it inherently.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak eschews the glaring hues of celebratory combat movies, and its desolate, granular shades steadily spend of light as night falls. The later scenes of the movie feel chilly and forlorn; the surrounded troops are alone and endangered in the night. The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Steve Zaillian, working from a book by Mark Bowden, understands the material and tells it so clearly and efficiently that we are involved not only in the experience of the day but also in its strategies and unfolding realities. Works like Black Hawk Down help audiences comprehend and invest in the real experiences of combat troops, rather than dispensing them into formula entertainments."

","I've seen this movie for the first time when I was 13. As a little boy I was a fan of the action scenes, however I didn't follow the story. Now 4 years later I have the movie on DVD and gave it a second look. <br/><br/>Now I recognized a whole lot of movie stars like: Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, Sam Shepard, Gabriel Casseus, Kim Coates, Hugh Dancy, Orlando Bloom¬Ö This war movie directed by Ridley Scott won 4 awards in 2002, of which 2 for the sound in the movie. Something I didn't even noticed 4 years ago. This time I listened very carefully, and I understood why this movie received these awards Off course gunshots, rocket impacts, helicopters¬Ö sounded like the real deal. But the true beauty lies in the music, which goes perfectly along with the actions of the characters.<br/><br/>This movie is great because of different reasons. I already explained one, the music, however there're more. First of all, the actors play there role great. You see the fear in there eyes. Delta force actors are clearly different from the Rangers. And because of the fact that the movie follows both, makes it pleasant to watch. Another reason is the subject of the movie. The war in Somalia is a subject that isn't overused like World War 2 and Vietnam. It wasn't a big war like these last to, but it lasted for a few weeks. The last reason is the story line. In the movie you follow the actions of different soldiers with different tasks in this operation. This may sound that It could cause confusion when watching it. The truth is contrary, it all falls perfectly together. I had no problem at all with all the switching of characters and locations because you can recognize the soldiers, vehicles and locations.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a decent war movie, and is aware of the fact that war isn't like a Rambo movie. The moment that these men are in Mogadishu the story really grabs you.<br/><br/>This movie scores 9 out of 10 for me."
"dbborroughs","6","0","1","25 July 2008"," As a look at men in modern battle this is very good. As a depiction of the actual event its fair
","Prompted by listening to the book on CD going to and from work I finally sat down and watched Ridley Scott's film of the day everything went wrong in Mogadishu Somalia.<br/><br/>The plan was to go in, secure a building where some of a wanted warlord's men were meeting and then get out. From the minute the soldiers started to lad things went wrong when one soldier falls from a helicopter. Complicating matters even more is the fact that the Somali's know how to take out the helicopters and soon one of the Blackhawks goes down. This is followed by a second helicopter. With men and machines scattered all over the city it becomes a desperate race to get the soldiers out before they are cut to ribbons by what seems like every person in the city.<br/><br/>I'm of mixed emotions about the film. Certainly as a representation of urban guerrilla war this is a kick in the pants. You are there in the thick of chaos as choppers go down and everyman is fighting desperately for cover. As a war film the film is amazing and its frightening since where do you hide when everyone it seems is out to get you? The problem for me is that the film is often not very clear. The battle is not in context of history. Granted that this is not always needed or desired, and I understand the ""why"" of it all isn't the point of the film, but without it the battle just seems to be a bunch of guys going in to a place they don't belong and getting in over their head. While that is certainly part of the story its also not entirely true. I think the problem is that the opening bits of the film which gives the film its place and time while explaining what things are like in Somalia promises more background then we get and perhaps it would have been a better film if we had just skipped all of that and just went into battle.<br/><br/>We also get lost as to who is who. Even with the modification of names on helmets I found it tough to tell who was who and which story thread I was following. Yes the casting of Eric Bana (who is excellent and actually gives a real performance), Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor and a few others help to make things easier to follow but for the most part much of the film was people in uniform shooting at people out of uniform.<br/><br/>Okay yes, I had just heard the book which neatly lays everything out, but at the same time knowing what I know, I was still confused (and not because what I knew conflicted by what I saw).<br/><br/>To be honest once I divorced the film from any sort of depiction of actual events and took it to be just a story of men under fire I quite enjoyed it. Is it the be all and end all? No. its a good story told in an action packed manner.<br/><br/>Worth a shot Personally I'd like to see another version of the story which manages to tell the larger story as well since there are too many stories that weren't covered or left hanging.."

It's non-stop, not giving any time to flesh out any characters. You actually wish for a moment of peace but any of these moments are probably 30 seconds in length. I like how all the action came together, but there was just too much for my taste.<br/><br/>On a positive note, all performances were believable. Even the Samalians, who were most likely no more than paid extras, were highly believable and you can feel a hatred growing for their monstrous behavior in the film.

Scott has crafted a vision of war unique to his own style but draws from many other sources. this movie, for me, was just too much. it seemed to be one long battle for the entirety of the movie, with no breaks whatsoever. of course, i realize that's probably how it played out in real life, yet i think that if that is the case, why turn it into a movie? the ending especially seemed to have tried to hard to redeem the rest of the movie for its lack of personal sense. those final moments and scenes, where the idea of war and fighting are discussed, and a fallen soldier is given a final goodbye, bring the movie to a good conclusion, yet seem to not fit with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>i also thought as i watched this film how stupid (sorry) the whole movie seemed. they rushed into a dangerous war zone to find a few dead bodies and maybe one or two wounded at risk to the entire squad. why risk the lives of many, maybe hundreds, to save just one or two? sorry, but i really think that it was not worth it for the casualties they sustained in this battle.<br/><br/>this movie, though, unlike saving private Ryan, stops not to examine each character individually. instead, they are revealed briefly in the bookend of the movie- either at the beginning or very end. saving private Ryan, on the other hand, begins with a bang and pulls us into the story, then pulls back and crafts the characters realistically and with time.<br/><br/>all in all, a good film, though. recommendable, yet not one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>*******/********** (7/10)"

","OK, it's gritty, it's realistic and it shows us like many, many, many other films before it that war is hell, but American soldiers are buddies and heroes.<br/><br/>What it adds is to document a true incident and its ensemble playing (that we also see in films like Band of Brothers, made around the same time). As in BOB, it's hard to follow who's who. One man in a scruffy uniform and covered in grime looks much like another. It was only when I looked at the cast list that I realised some of the well-known actors who were in it. I'd completely failed to spot a few of them while watching the film.<br/><br/>The story goes on for a long time on the same note of non-stop action. This may be true to life, but in a film it's wearing.<br/><br/>Others have well noted the racism implied in the film."

","It's sort of fun to watch this film again and just realize hoe much would-be star power this film had. I mean, come on, Josh Hartnett? Ewan McGregor? Freakin Orlando Bloom??? Get out of town! I had no idea who these kids were when I first saw this, and it made the second time a lot more fun! Actually, I had no idea Orlando Bloom was in this until I recognized him in the movie. Anyways, this film is just amazing, it tells of the true story of when a Black Hawk Helicopter went down in a truly nasty part of town in Mogadishu, Somalia.. The attempt to rescue the soldiers there get nasty as the residents fight back. Of course, in this political climate we have now, it's sort of interesting to view such a film and wonder what the feelings are towards soldiers now. In any case, this is a high gripping story, and I was quite riveted to the story from the get go, even though most of the time one soldier doesn't look any different from another, so its sometimes difficult to figure out which character we're following.. But that's just a small quibble, Black Hawk Down is great entertainment"

BHD is a roller-coaster ride through urban close combat with a realistic portray of war on the ground. This movie is a lot of fun to watch because of its drive and the beautiful camera work.<br/><br/>What weakens the impression of most US war movies is their ideological approach: BHD tells us that the US went to war to protect human rights, not their oil interests.

","When I watch a war movie, I expect to see lots of disturbing deaths, full-throated explosions, and rousing action. But most importantly, I expect a compelling story with strong characterizations that'll engage me for the next 2 and a half hrs. Black Hawk Down only delivered half of it! The movie's major flaw is the characters. None of them are 3-dimensional and we really have no reason to care for any of them. There are about 30 soldiers who get screen time and none of them are nearly as developed as they should be. There are many scenes showing troops reacting to the death of their fellow soldiers, the music playing in the background indicated me these were sad moments. Those scenes were intended to move me (the audience) but since I hardly knew any of them, I felt nothing but disgust, as some scenes were graphically full of gore. They were gross but not emotional. This may be war, but cinematically there is no true conflict here, no emotional investment, no setbacks to surprise, no obstacles to draw the viewer in. Nice attempt from director Ridley Scott but he definitely came up short of what he could have accomplished on this. Maybe Bruckheimer should be blamed!"
"ghostofdaniel","6","0","3","13 August 2004"," A very good action movie, that's all.
","In my point of view, war is bad. So I prefer movies which criticize this activity.<br/><br/>This is not the intend of this movie. Nevertheless, I must admit it doesn't contain too much ""patriotic-propaganda"", like I was fearing it.<br/><br/>Like someone said : it's a ""pop-corn movie"" with no ideological purposes. Except of course, the soldier's macho friendship as the ultimate life value. In the movie, every soldier is obsessed to be useful and says : ""Yes Sarge, I can't fight ! I want to go back to fight !"". And the classical ""war clich√©"" (present in every war movie since the 50's) : ""Say to my wife I was courageous ! - You will say it to her yourself !"" and the soldier dies.<br/><br/>Frankly, where is the originality ? Some say the movie is almost a documentary. Are you kidding ? The historical frame is ejected in one minute after the movie starts. The enemy ? End titles say there were 19 killed US soldiers , and about 1000 killed Somalis. And what this movie shows us about the Somalis warriors ? Nothing ! They are just targets, with no personality, no humanity, they are ""objects"", like in a shoot-them-up video game. Like the monsters in ""Aliens"" or ""Starship troopers"". Soldiers US are the goods, the others are the villains. But the reality is more complex.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me ! I'm french, but I'm not giving a judgment about American policy, but about a movie. And the base of this movie is stereotypes. Sometimes, I like stereotypes ! Like everybody. I like ""Rambo"" (really !) but it's fictional ! And if BHD would have been a fiction, directed by Peter McDonald or Roland Emmerich, I would be OK. But I was waiting a little more from a director like Ridley Scott and more from a movie about a real event.<br/><br/>So it's really a very good action movie, (among the bests, I admit it) but it's not a ""great philosophical analysis"" about the war or about an historical event.<br/><br/>7/10"
"simonmills47","9","0","1","14 May 2004"," Excellent, but one flaw!
","Blackhawk Down features genuinely harrowing and tense battle sequences, but for me is slightly let down by what I consider to be a dreadful performance from Ewan McGregor, as a normally deskbound soldier thrust into battle. I bet I'm not the only one who found his ""cup of Joe"" line to be actually embarassing, and they have even managed to shoehorn into the cast one of his sidekicks from ""Trainspotting"" as an American soldier too. Fortunately his appearances are relatively rare, and not enough in themselves to be off-putting. Very well worth it, especially on a good home theatre system. I have given it 9/10, and taken off the one point because of this casting error."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","0","1","2 May 2004"," Could Have Been Better
","Ridley Scott has made some great films and made some bad films and Black Hawk Down is one of the bad ones.   The fact that the film is an orgy of action disrupts the fact that there is actually no story to this.   I suppose you could say that there doesn't really need to be a story because what happened was pretty straight forward and that was a bunch of American soldiers went into a city where they became surrounded and trapped.  A lot of them died and it became a famous story.  The thing is that Ridley Scott concentrated on bringing us an action packed film about an important story but didn't really give the cast the character development they are deserved. The cast was huge with Josh Harnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore and a young pre Lord of the rings Orlando Bloom.   None of them get the chance to shine unless they are all running from bullets and explosions. It is a touching film and is great to watch and look at as the cinematography and editing is excellent but it doesn't count for the point the story was not used enough to complete the film that it could have been.   The film was shot straight after Hannibal wrapped up so it can only be explained that Black Hawk down suffered because Scott went from film to film in a matter of months.   <br/><br/>It's a shame that films like this cannot become the Masterpieces they deserve to be."

"andyetris","9","0","1","3 March 2004"," Exciting, Inaccurate War Story
","I enjoyed this movie very much, and I would say that it is effective at getting its point across - but it's far from anti-war and is fairly described as a flag-waver.  Anyone interested in a more 'balanced' account should read the Mark Bowden articles upon which the film is based, and which have been collected in book form.  The movie takes some dramatic ;-) liberties with the original material!<br/><br/>As the movie is extensively described elsewhere at this site, I will just say that I found it difficult to tell the soldiers apart at times, which sometimes makes it hard to follow exactly what is happening and why.  The story is almost continuous action, involving many characters seperated into different groups, which makes it hard to 'get to know' the individuals as in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  On the other hand, ""Black Hawk Down"" avoids some of the schmaltz of the Spielberg epic (despite two slightly forced speeches by Eric Bana's ""Hoot."")<br/><br/>The movie presents a (literally!) black and white look at Americans vs Somalis, and implies that the Clinton administration was pretty much to blame for keeping too tight a leash on ""our boys.""  The book is VERY different on both counts, and states that, ironically, the Somalis deliberately planned to down U.S. helicopters to force the 'surround-the-wagons' shootout that actually happened.  Bowden asserts that this plan was developed by foreign Arab extremists - read Al-Queda!!!  This isn't explored in the movie.<br/><br/>None of that is required to make a good film, and I'd say that, like ""Battle of Algiers,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" is an excellent film - but take it with a grain of salt!"
"mgarland","10","0","1","22 February 2004"," Gritty, violent, action-packed and ""realistic"" (**contains a couple of SPOILERS**)
","I have seen several negative comments about this movie and felt I had to add some of my own (positive comments, that is). Several folks have said this is a propaganda flick or that the characters weren't all that memorable. I beg to differ: not only do I definitely NOT want to be put anywhere near a situation like these guys had to endure, but I also don't think Ridley Scott intended to make any kind of statement about this being ""the right thing to do"" or any political statement whatsoever. He set out (and succeeded in my opinion) to show the general populace how brutal armed conflict is and the high price the men of the armed services have to pay for the whims of the 'suits' in Washington.<br/><br/>Getting off my soapbox now, this is an amazing movie. I think ""gritty"" is the perfect word to describe this movie. It's tense from early on and never lets up. From the fine performances put in by a wide range of actors, to the intense firefights on the dirty urban landscape of rundown Mogadishu, this movie is a potent reminder that ""War IS Hell"". Although there were many moving and memorable lines and characters, my favorite ones came from Eric Bana playing the character of ""Hoot"". He says, ""You wanna know what I think? I don't think it really matters at all what I think; once that first bullet goes flying by your head, politics goes right out the window."" And when he comments on why he does it, ""It ain't about being a hero; nobody sets out to be a hero. You do it because of the guy next to you."" (I paraphrase some, but the general idea is there.)<br/><br/>***A FEW SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>So, it may not have been the ""just"" or even the ""right"" thing to do, but these guys did it and went through hell to get there. I think it deserves a looksee from anyone who wants a little insight into the kind of stuff that goes on for the sake of ""freedom"". Watch it for what it is: a gripping story about a bunch of guys doing their jobs and trying to stay alive long enough to get out and continue on with the rest of their lives. Anyone who thinks this film is ""propaganda"" needs to watch the faces of the actors in this movie, especially near the end. The anguish and loss these guys went through are summed up in the end when they're all standing around panting and crying in exhaustion and frustration and hugging each other as they look at all their injured or dead comrades lying in a row against the wall when they get back to base. They aren't high-fivin' each other or laughing raucously about how many skinnies they killed; they're shaking and puking from the exertion and tension they've been through.....Some are even gearing up to go back into the battle zone because there are still guys left out there...the guys who **were** next to them, but aren't anymore. Watch the documentary/behind-the-scenes extra on the DVD: the real Rangers and Delta Force guys slipped a note under the actors' door in the barracks and told them to tell their story. And they did."

","The year is 1993 and US special forces are in Somalia to catch the warlord Muhammad Farrah Aidid, who has thrown the country into civil war.  One October afternoon, US soldiers are sent on a mission to retrieve two top luitenants of the warlord.  The mission was expected to go no longer than 30 minutes.   However, a Black Hawk helicopter is shot down and the mission spirals out of control.  For 16 hours, the soldiers are trapped in a relentless city.  Eighteen soldiers and over 1000 somalis loose their lives during the ordeal.    <br/><br/>I thought this film was exciting, and amazingly realistic.  Josh Hartnet, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, and others are terrific and bring the truth of a combat soldier to the screen.  Orlando Bloom is in this too.

","This was a hard movie to watch.  It was excellent in its portrayal of the battle in Mogadishu but the action got so intense and had so few pauses that I had to turn the tape off at one point to take account of my senses.<br/><br/> Ridley Scott does an excellent job directing the intense street battles between the Rangers and the Somali militias.  The fighting begins pretty early in the movie and continues unabated right up til the end.  Even with all the action going on, he still finds a way to personalize some of the characters.<br/><br/> Tempering the film is the sadness of knowing how messed up the battle preparations were, how the politicians back in Washington didn't allow the men to go in with proper cover (armored vehicles were held back until the rescue operation).  Also, there is the knowledge that despite these men's heroics, nothing ever changed in Somalia.<br/><br/> Not a film for everyone, but well done nonetheless."

","I passed up on this gem when it first came out and I'm sorry I did. It may not have all the elements of a classic war movie, nevertheless it was still very effective storytelling.  The first thing that an intelligent moviegoer should realize, whether the movie is a ""period piece"" or ""based on a true story"", is that it can't be all factual. What I believe tripped a few people up about BHD is the almost reality TV style Ridley Scott employed. I'm sure many who are blindly hooked on this genre felt somewhat betrayed. Any drama on a historical event good or bad, realistic or propagandized should inspire one to do his/her own research.  These movies sometimes entertain and always raise questions that prompt me to search for more information on the topics raised by the movie."

"trpdean","Null","0","1","12 August 2003"," Graphic, Gripping Story of Battle from American Soldiers' Point of View
","This movie about a single battle is so gripping, so relentless in its realistic gore and horror and astonishing courage - that it's difficult to credit the complaints. I'm sure everyone I know would be enthralled.<br/><br/>
So perhaps I can comment on some of the comments. <br/><br/>1) Some complain that it portrays the battle from the American soldiers' point of view. Offhand, I can think of only two that do not (""Tora!, Tora! Tora!"" and Gettysburg). From Paths of Glory to Grand Illusion, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Saving Private Ryan, from Back to Bataan to Zulu, from Thin Red Line to Northwest Territory- we see war in movies through the eyes of one or other side. To complain that this renders the enemy ""unimportant"" or ""zombies"" or that their deaths don't matter, is silly. <br/><br/>Sure, we know there are dead British soldiers in the trenches during All Quiet, dead British fliers in Blue Max, dead French soldiers in Battle of Algiers - but these movies aren't from the British or French points of view - they're from the German and Algerian points of view. What's wrong with that?<br/><br/>Movies need a place from which to look. When we see a cavalryman killed in fighting Native Americans in Soldier Blue, Little Big Man, or Dances with Wolves, which are all from an Indian point of view, of course we know the deceased were human - but the movies aren't from the white cavalrymen's point of view - and that's fine. It doesn't demean the enemy of those from whose perspective we're watching the movie. <br/><br/>A second complaint seems to be that the movie somehow ""whitewashes"" the American presence. This is absurd. There was a single initial reason to send American troops - the vast numbers of deaths due to starvation, brought home on American television news every night. Such images came immediately upon American failures to act in the Serbian-Slovenian War, Serbian-Croatian War, and Serbian-Bosnian-Croatian War, and the tens of thousands of atrocities committed (by all sides - but by Serbs and Bosnian Serbs in far greater numbers). Moreover, the UN and European Union had so dismally failed through vacillation, incompetence and weakness to stop the massacres in Srebenica, the bombing of Dubrovnik, the starvation and bombings of Sarajevo and Mosul, and dozens upon dozens of other towns and cities - that there was a sick feeling that we MUST be able to act in Somalia to alleviate the suffering.<br/><br/>
The American arrival stopped further starvation in Somalia, despite the banditry and robbery by the warlords. Food WAS distributed and for the most part got to Somalians. Three hundred thousand had already died, but yet further deaths were largely avoided. President Bush left office with only half as many American troops still there - and a plan for UN troops to replace those remaining. <br/><br/>UN pressure on American policy caused the U.S. to expand its purpose after President Clinton was inaugurated. UN Sec'y. General Boutros Boutros Ghali (of Egypt) had a natural and strong desire to unify and pacify Somalia to help Somalis escape from their decades of violent horror. He knew well (and despised) chief warlord Aidid from Ghali's own days in Egypt. Under pressure from Ghali, American policy changed from the apolitical distribution of food to the political one of capturing or killing Aidid and/or defeating his troops in order to afford Somalia some future hope of building a unified nation-state. After all, one might argue, isn't that what the UN is supposed to do? Nevertheless, UN troops were scheduled to replace the remaining American troops - but shortly before they were to leave, Pakistani UN troops were ambushed by Aidid's forces and dozens killed. The pressure from Ghali grew - U.S. troops were already there - they must do something to capture Aidid (thus opening hope for Somalia's future) and to discourage future attacks on UN troops. <br/><br/>Clinton reluctantly agreed - and the American forces changed purpose.<br/><br/>
Some of this is spelled out by the movie - but I wish it were made more clear. Thus I agree with the third common complaint - that we don't see enough backstory - of why we were there, and of who these particular characters were. Those who say it's like a ""video game"" are harsh - but do have a point. We need to know more about these people - despite the (largely boring) initial 20 minutes, we aren't given characters to hold onto - and it's more difficult because everyone is in uniform. We move very quickly among two dozen young white men in uniform - and it's hard to grasp who is who.<br/><br/>That aside, this is very powerful stuff. All should see it. I highly recommend it - if you can take MUCH graphic violence. The heroism is astounding."

","One of the most overrated films on the imdb (how it scored over six out of ten I do not know) is also one of the most shallow and monotonous. But, hey, it DID come from the same man who produced the worst film of the last few years, Pearl Harbour and the dumbest film of recent memory- Armageddon.<br/><br/>Based on a true story of a 1993 mission to topple a dictator, Black Hawk Down is, if anything a vivid depiction of the horrors of war. With one of the best directors around (Ridley Scott)and an all-star cast (Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor etc.) how could this fail? The movie really fails from the start as it possesses a dog of a screenplay which does not bother to relate the audience to the characters in the situation (a la Saving Private Ryan)as we never get a chance to get to know them. This would be less of a travesty if the final act of the film didn't need the audience to relate to the characters, but it did. The supposedly poignant ending just comes across as pathetic and cliched. Ewan McGregor is the only one who comes out of the film with their reputation intact as the remainder of the cast come across as wooden and lifeless. Josh Hartnett is a capable actor but after this and Pearl Harbour, his credibility and hireability should really be brought into question.<br/><br/>One of the only plus points of the film, is the combination of Scott's direction and the superb cinematography. Visually this film is superb and extremely arresting. The lighting and some of the visual contrasts employed are nothing short of astonishing. However good cinematography does not make a good film and it only emphasises the fact the film is so emotionally and ideologically shallow. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott- why?"

Anyone reading this before watching the film needs to know just one thing: this film is exactly the same as you are expecting it to be.

For reasons that are not made particularly obvious to the simple viewer, this is all done without informing the UN of their intentions, or even their close allies in the campaign, the Pakistani peacekeepers.<br/><br/>What appears to have been a rather sparsely devised Plan A goes smoothly right up until they actually arrive at Mogadishu when chaos theory comes into play and it all falls messily, noisily, to pieces, forcing them to resort to Plan B.  What do you mean, there's no Plan B?<br/><br/>""30 minutes in and out"" nothing can go wrong, so no need for a Plan B? Oops...<br/><br/>Essentially, what follows is a convoy of trucks trundling around getting shot at quite a bit; hordes of anonymous Somalis scurry around, shooting but mostly getting shot, and there's a whole barrel-full of bad acting thrown in for good measure (stand up Mr. Hartnett).  And what lunatic thought of reuniting three members of the cast of that other cinematic historical document Pearl Harbour?  As if this film didn't have credibility problems as it was.<br/><br/>This film also displays a startling coldness to the Somali casualties in large part.  While it would be  insensitive to mock or deride the loss of 19 Americans in this exercise, it is extraordinary that the film refers to these young men as having 'laid down their lives', and yet mentions almost as an incidental that around 1000 Somalis were also 'killed'. No laying down of lives for them then?  And as exemplified by one of the better scenes in the film, many Somali combatants were little more than children.<br/><br/>Add to this a scene in which a soldier berates the UN for not being battle-ready when they had not been informed of the operation, and you have a fairly repulsive exercise in jingoism.<br/><br/>If you enjoy cliched, propagandist militarism then this is most definitely the film for you.  Otherwise I'd file it under the label 'only if there's nothing better to do'."

By that I mean there is no St Crispin's Day-style speech hailing the righteousness of The Cause, not that we are not asked to care about soldiers.  Is it pro-America?  Pro-military?  Racist?  Does it focus too much on the American angle of the story?  Does it glorify the American soldiers?  No to all.<br/><br/>
No defense is given, nor ever can be, for American troops having been there at all.<br/><br/>
And yes, most of the soldiers are white, and the Somalis are unilaterally black.  Well -- that's the way it happened.  No wait!  They should have cast a black helicopter pilot, a Latino machine gunner, and an Asian...something. Just figure out a way to write in an Asian, we need at least one Asian. We have whites, blacks, browns, we need a yellow.  Oh, rats!  We need an Indian!  Okay, I think you see how I feel about that issue.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the story is told from an American point of view.  When an American dies, we are with him.  When a Somali dies, we move on immediately. There are three reasons for this.  The style of filming gives the viewer the feeling of being a combat journalist operating with the American forces, thus we are given that point of view.  Secondly, there were nineteen American casualties, juxtaposed with Somali casualties in the mid hundreds on that awful day.  It would not be possible to treat each Somali casualty with the same level of detail.  Thirdly, I DON'T CARE about anybody in this movie except my brothers!  It's just a movie, but the characters depicted are real people, who really fought, really bled, and really died.  When the shooting starts, all I care about is my brothers.  And if one has to die, then I want to be there for him.  That's what war is.  The man next to you. That's why they fight.

The thing is, none of you trolls ever prove anything.  You just say that Black hawk down is pro-American BS and then you run away.<br/><br/>For one, there is no glorification in the movie.  One soldier falls out of a chopper before the fight starts, another soldier's lower half is blown away, and two soldiers' bodies are nearly ripped apart and dragged through the streets.  Real f*cking glorified, isn't it? Second- the movie is probably the most historically accurate war movie in recent years.  Yeah, lots of you jackasses love to say Hollywood made stuff up, when in reality, the movie was faithful to Mark Bowden's book down to the dialogue.  The only significant fact that was twisted was that Eversman (Josh hartnet) did not spend the night in Mogadishu. Thirdly, some people say it's racist because it shows Americans (mainly white Americans) shooting at Somalis.  Well, Somalis happen to be BLACK. What was Ridley Scott going to do, color the militia purple so you won't get offended?  BHD is a realistic re-creation of what happened and not intended to be racist. Fourth- some claim that BHD is very gung-ho and has images of Americans slaughtering Somalis by the hundreds.  Except for the sequence where the two Delta snipers are defending the crashed chopper (which happened), there are no John Wayne-type images in the movie.  Any soldier in this movie can get hit.  Nobody is special.  You also have to remember that the US troops were severely outnumbered, in hostile territory, and fighting the entire city. They were fighting for their lives, not killing Somalis because it was fun. And finally, people p*** and moan about how negative the Somalis are portrayed.  How are they portrayed negatively?  They get guns and defend their homes against invading US troops.  Both sides suffer.  You see this in the beginning, which shows images of starving somalis, and you see it at the end when the doctor is carrying the dead child across the street. And then there's the speech made by the pilot's captor about how it's not America's war, and about how the US troops come to his country and kill his people. So I suggest that a lot of you guys think before you start posting negative BS about this movie."

This opinion was reinforced when I heard MSG Eversmann himself give a talk at my school, Johns Hopkins, where he now works in ROTC.  Of course there were things that were embellished and Eversmann himself feels that he was given too much credit and occasionally put in a situation where he wasn't present (like the clamping the artery scene), but he thought that it was extremely good at portraying the intensity of a battle.  If someone wants to know what modern day urban warfare is like, this would be an excellent reference.  Eversmann also feels that the portrayal of the Somalis was accurate.  Many were on drugs during the battle, and he can only guess at how many Somalis were killed by other Somalis (since their tactics often had them at ground level on opposite sides of the road shooting at Americans in the road).  So for themost part, the movie was good at depicting the battle accurately.<br/><br/>As for the movie from a movie standpoint, I had some trouble with it.

","Sadly, I expected a lot from this movie.   Unfortunately, it is about the worst depiction of an important event that I've ever seen, particularly considering that the entire mission was so well documented by the Army, the media, et al.   <br/><br/>First, I think it only correct to say that I did not read the book and therefore cannot reasonably comment on what may have been written by it's author, but the motion picture left so much about the actual event, it's purpose, the events that occurred before the ""mission"" and other important facts out, that is it left out so much about what was ordered and what actually happened before the events depicted ever happened and how they happened, that I found it agonizingly tiresome.  How am I an expert concerning the mission?  I'm not, but I do remember it vividly and I particularly remember that the American media, after being ""scooped"" by the European media to the point of absurdity, finally told a great deal of the story, if only obliquely - which the motion picture does not.<br/><br/>For instance.  The while the movie depicts itself as the ""mission,"" it was not, as the actual mission was not the attempted abduction of Aidid and his aids, but was the ambush of the America combined force that attempted the abduction.<br/><br/>There is one redeeming factor.  This motion picture does show in some truth what happens to ""green"" troops in their first real battle, that is troops that have by and large never seen any real combat.   These troops were extremely well trained and a few senior officers surely served in the first Desert Storm, and possibly other very limited engagements.  Therefore, this show of what happens to unseasoned ""green"" troops the first time out is the redeeming feature of the movie.  In the coming months, Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of War as he may more appropriately be called in future, as a member of The White house team, had approved a plan sometime around the first of January to attack Iraq based on the best possible scenario.  Fortunately two of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Marine Corps have made apolitical speeches around the middle of December criticizing this ""best case scenario"" plan and may have actually awakened The White House to the real potential for possible disaster in Iraq if the president and his aids continue with their initial strike plan against Iraq assuming that there will be no need for reinforcements or √Ç‚Äòback up' troops.  In fact, the now announced delay of our attack on Iraq from the first of January until sometime after the first of February may be a result of what this motion picture illustrates.  No matter how well trained our troops going into Iraq may be, they will be unseasoned, ""green"" troops and when the operation does not go exactly as planned, may well, as they did in ""Black Hawk Down,"" become desperately confused and badly need reinforcements and a second wave.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, after watching it more than once, I do not recommend this movie to anyone but those who want to see the results of a documentary style history lesson that does not explain or depict the truth."

","First of all I would like to start by saying that I am a Ranger.  I read a few critiques that bothered me.  Some people criticizing this film had no idea as to what they were talking about.I read one where the guy talks about asthma would have given the guy a desk job.  If he did any research on that particular soldier or just read the book he would know why that soldier was allowed into the 75th Ranger Regiment.  It was his willingness to risk his life to become a soldier and a Ranger.  At the beginning of basic training he threw his Inhaler away for fear of getting in trouble.  He nearly died of an asthma attack.  His drive to succeed impressed a higher up.  For that reason he was allowed to become a Ranger, and he was given his inhaler back. I even read one guy calling us Texas Rangers(a law enforcement group). You criticize us for killing all those poor somalis.  Soldiers follow orders. That is our job.  Also remember as you demonize the people portrayed in this film, they were real people and some of those people died.<br/><br/>
I want to comment on somalis for starters.  The 3rd Ranger Battallion was sent over there after an incident where 24 UN soldiers were slaughtered. If anyone is to blame it is those who sent them over.  That blame falls on President Clinton.  US Troops can't just go to Somalia or anywhere for that matter without some governmental authorization, so lets stop blaming the military as well.  I read comments dealing with the portrayal of somalis as a rag tag militia and just running towards the americans bullets.  Well they were just roving bands.  We aren't talking about an organized trained professional Army.  Secondly Somalians did just run towards our soldiers. Why?  They were on drugs.  One very popular one in somalia called Khat especially.<br/><br/>Next why does Ridley Scott make the U.S. Soldiers martyrs.  It is because they were just following orders.  It is not like american special forces soldiers do what they do because they like to kill people.  We do our jobs out of patriotism, honor, close tie with one another, and so on.  He doesn't even try to make the somalis evil.  They aren't an evil people.  He tried to show what the conflict was like from the only viewpoint it has really been documented.  The american one.  Why didn't Ridley Scott have a list of the 1,000 to possibly 5,000 somalis killed.  Once again they weren't an organized army therefore there is no real list.  There isn't even a definite number of somalis killed that night.<br/><br/>You people who criticize our nation and the soldiers in the conflict for their horrible actions against the somalis should think about what they say. If an Army Ranger read the comments then maybe some of the dead soldiers families may read these comments.  People love to criticize us.  What does the United States do?  We go into Kosovo because of genocide.  We have no interests there.  We like stability .  That is exactly why we didn't get rid of Saddam after Desert Storm.  Though an awful human being, the Iraqi government was stable and who knows the person that would take Saddam's place.  Could have been Osama bin Laden.  That would have been great a terrorist nation.<br/><br/>The United States is not a perfect nation, but we are a good nation.  We attempt to promote fairness, and not all of us wish to spread our ""christian ideals"" to other nations.  If you are going to criticize this movie or our country at least get your facts straight."

Ridley Scott's GI Jane and Gladiator haven't been much better. Hence, Black Hawk Down's saturation with cowboy imagery and gung-ho catchphrases can be expected. What viewers might find disappointing is that all of the lessons taught by the Battle of Mogadishu, most importantly our failure to learn from the past, end up taking a back seat to appropriate but overemphasized gory footage. When General Thomas Montgomery (whose name is not mentioned in the film) is denied by Washington the sufficient resources to enact this mission, does he risk angering the top brass by refusing to accept supervisory responsibility unless his demands are met?? Of course not. Instead, Ranger Task Force Leader General Garrison is ordered to send  troops into harm's way from the safety of an office bunker. Critics of this ""going along to get along"" trend also consider it to have seriously undermined our efforts in the Vietnam War. Even if we can forgive that, why does the film neither mention the previous seven missions in Somalia conducted by Garrison nor explain that they were all identical, giving the enemy plenty of insight to our methods? If the writers didn't want to be political or point fingers, maybe they should have just constructed an entirely fictional street battle.

The casting was also similar, A Bridge Too Far, starred big names such as Gene Hackman, Micheal Caine and Antony Hopkins, as well as a large cast of other notable actors.

While the combat sequences are impressive, they don't quite live up to the standards of 'SPR' - somehow Ridley Scott's fixed camera dipiction of a battle scene just doesn't have the same effect as Speilberg's shakey-cam. Unfortunately I was left fairly unmoved by the death of the characters due to their lack of development. Mcgregger's character, Grimes, was obviously meant to provide what little 'comic relief' the film would contain, but came off as a rather annoying and unbelievable figure with a dreadful American accent.

"TheJudge-2","9","0","1","22 September 2002"," Exceptional and unemotional observation of the futility of foreign military involvement.
","More often than not, Ridley Scott can make exceptional movies - of that there's no doubt. Okay, so occasionally he comes up with a turkey (Legend and Hannibal, anyone?), but, although to date he's only directed 13 feature films, among them are numbered Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain, Gladiator and now Black Hawk Down. Not a bad strike rate, all things being considered - and more than a few might consider me uncharitable for not also mentioning Someone To Watch Over Me and Thelma & Louise.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down details a single incident during American military involvement in Somalia in the early 90's, where a small contingent of US soldiers was sent deep into rebel-held territory in Mogadishu, the capital, to capture warlord leaders. The film catalogues this mission from start to finish.<br/><br/>Looking at the acting first, one can only use the word adequate - not that any of the cast does a particularly good or bad job. So, if the acting's not noteworthy, what makes this film exceptional?<br/><br/>Well, it's not about character. The protagonists are stereotypical - Josh Hartnett ""stars"" - but that's entirely the wrong word - as a young US ranger staff sergeant, Eric Bana produces a noteworthy performance as a war-hardened Delta Force loner, Tom Sizemore gives good value reprising his ""Saving Private Ryan"" hard as nails soldierly role and Ewan McGregor is nearly anonymous as an office-bound Ranger dragged into the heat of battle. Scott doesn't develop any of these notables as fully rounded characters, primarily because the movie is *not* a character piece. In fact, it's often confusing when following the various fates and fortunes of the separated groups of US soldiers to tell them apart - and I'm more than sure that is intentional.<br/><br/>The ""star"" of the movie is without a doubt the cinematography. As with Ridley's best, all the stops are pulled out to give you a completely seamless atmosphere of heat, dust, urban chaos, violence and futility - the visuals are simply stunning and engrossing, but in no way beautiful, and nor should they be, given the subject matter.<br/><br/>The action sequences, or more accurately, the continuing long action sequence which comprises three quarters of the movie, is again expertly handled. It has none of the gimmickry of ""Three Kings"" for example, but is handled in a style much more reminiscent of parts of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and maybe moreso the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>However, this is where the movie outscores its Spielberg WW2 counterpart, and heavily. It's the unemotional observation. Whereas Spielberg seems to need heroes, Scott goes out of his way *not* to judge - at least on the surface. Of course, his audience will go in with a firm preconception of who the good guys are, but to see this movie as US heroics against impossible odds is to miss the point entirely. History has shown us that US involvement in Somalia was a complete waste of time - it changed nothing, got tens of US troops killed and thousands of Somalis - and Ridley Scott is all too aware of this. It's not about right or wrong, it's not about US hi-tech warfare versus guerrilla fanaticism - so aptly highlighted by helicopter gunships on one side counterpointed by Somali machinegun-mounted rusty pickup trucks on the other. It's not about heroism, either. ""Heroes"" live or die randomly in war - they make no difference at all. The two Delta Force men who volunteer to be dropped at the 2nd crash site kill a lot of Somalis, but get killed themselves in the end, and the pilot (who was the only survivor) gets captured anyway, just as he would have been without their involvement. It's not even about leaving no man behind - yes, the dead are brought back, but they're still dead, and for what?<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is about the utter futility of war, of the uselessness and the sheer inappropriateness of the world's last superpower getting itself simplistically involved in a far-off situation, where the rules of combat and the motivation of the local inhabitants are completely alien. The most telling moment in the entire movie comes when a Somali militia man is talking to the captured helicopter pilot, and he says:<br/><br/>""Do you think if you get General Aidid, we will simply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this. Without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world.""<br/><br/>Overall, an exceptional movie, and one of Scott's best. Realistic, unemotional, visually brilliant and thought-provoking."

The edge of the wedge, the Sacred Band crushed a Spartan phalanx 12-deep, stronger than the legendary Spartan group who held the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes.  Each of the 300 was bound to one other by a sacred oath of mutual protection.  Like Jonathan and David, their mutual love and respect for each other were only broken by death. <br/><br/>
Blackhawk Down is about this type of loyalty, the sacred bond between soldiers.  War in general, and the conflict between the US and General Aidid in particular, are the movie's background.  In the foreground stand the soldiers themselves.  <br/><br/>Blackhawk Down fits you into the battle fatigues of the Army Rangers. Before going out on their mission, we feel the nervous energy of the men, who relieve their stress by joking around, or by prancing and farting and strutting like brewery horses in bock-beer time.  As they leave base to battle, heading toward the uncertainty of their fate, the hypnotizing pulse of the helicopter, together with the funk of fear, induce distortions of sound and vision, the nauseous feeling of adrenaline overload.  When the Blackhawk helicopter goes down, and the people of Mogadishu recognize their opportunity to shovel up hell, we actually feel the calm focus of training and instinct one feels when the fight is finally on.  More than that, we feel what a soldier means when he says that `It's all bout the man next to you.  And that's all it is.'  <br/><br/>Leaving aside larger issues about the moral justification of one side against the other, Blackhawk Down pins the red badge of courage on all the combatants.  There are poignant scenes of death and destruction on both sides of the conflict.

For that same reason I had no desire to view the film either. But then I did, and no rational viewer looking at this film independantly can say its not a well done movie. Sure the large number of war films released in the last decade takes away from its impact but it also makes the fact that it was original and unique even more of a surprise. Let me respond to some of the  negative reviewers points<br/><br/>Its characters are not realistic = Funny, if you read the book or the original series of newspaper articles that are online. You will find that most of the scenes in the movie occured. I am not just talking about battle scenes but the conversations between soldiers. Its HARD to find a scene in the movie that you cant find in the book. I would love to go scene by scene and point them out but space does not permit. But take whatever scene you thought was far fetched and then read the book odds are its there. Most of the characters are compilations of many real life soldiers but without an 8 hour movie and 50 characters they had to be.<br/><br/>Its too American= Well thats just the way its goes isn't it. Once the somalies come to dominate the world wide  media industry then they can tell their side of the story. People want the both sides of every war story but then want book like character development at the same time. It cant be done in a movie with 120 contributors. From the eyewitness accounts of the battle its safe to say that the movie is accurate in portraying what the ground forces there saw. Somali soldiers in there own words tell of hoards of people attacking the Americans in  waves. From every location possible. Women with babies in one arm and gun in the other running right up to hum vs and firing shots only to be mown down. Waves of people running straight into death such as in the chopper scene. Its true. Just because its outside of some guy in sweden's comprehension does not mean it didnt happen. The book outlines many more scenes that were to gruesome for the movie.<br/><br/>
Its not a good war movie= Some posters claim that there are dozens of movies better than this one. Name them! Keeping in mind that this movie accomplished so much by foccusing on ONE battle. It did not have the luxury of examining the entire politcal and moral landscape of a war like the Vietnam movies were afforded. Nor did it have the implication of world history such as WW1, WW2 or civil war films.  It was the simple story of men who fought and lost their lives fighting for an outcome that in the end accomplished very little. Thats what makes it so compelling. To see what those men were  living  through while we sat at home and watched our evening news. I wont ever forget this movie because it made me feel like I was there. Can't say that about too many.<br/><br/>All that is required to enjoy this film is too put yourself in those soldiers shoes. If you cant do that for whatever reason then you wont feel any of the emotions that those of us who can--- felt watching the show. IF Harry Potter is your idea of a great movie you may want to skip this one."

","From director Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes this pulse-pounding story of bravery, camaraderie, and the harsh reality of war. The film chronicles an elite team of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers who are sent into Somalia in October 1993 on a routine mission to capture a violent warlord responsible for the mass genocide of his country's citizens. When the mission goes awry, they soon find themselves fighting not only to complete the task at hand, but to save their very own lives as well. Based on an actual event, this volatile, supercharged, highly emotional saga authentically captures the fear, chaos, and genuine heroism prevalent in the world of modern warfare. Good performances all around and Scott's gritty, uncompromising direction make this like watching a contemporary version of Saving Private Ryan; a knockout! ****"
"m3a75bary","10","0","1","15 August 2002"," Possibly the most realistic potrayal of war ever!
","After seeing the horrific Jerry Bruckhiemer logo at the beginning of the trailer, I was skeptical. Jerry Bruckhiemer hasn't produced a good movie in his career. But that all changes with the riveting war movie ""Black Hawk Down"".<br/><br/>The movie starts out with one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever scene. A helicopter flying towards the market. As simple as that sounds, Ridley Scott makes it so much better than many directors could. For the next 20 min, we get into the lives of the characters, and then it happens. the next 80 min. are possibly the most amazingly graphic, realistic war sequence ever(yes, even the first 30 min. of Saving Private Ryan) What makes this such a great movie, is that it doesn't waste time with love stories or old memories, it puts you right in the middle of Mogadishu, Somalia firing a weapon and some bushy-haired militiamen. That is the beauty of ""Black Hawk Down"".<br/><br/>Many people say that this movie lacks character development. Which I suppose it does, but that doesn't mean it's a great movie. The movie's point is to put you in the battle, which it does wonderfully. The acting is more than stellar for this movie. Josh Harnett is surprisingly believeable in his starring role. Eric Bana steals the show as the experienced Delta Force soldier, while Tom Sizemore is great as the leader of the ground convoy.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, but defiantly not for the weak-hearted, as there are a few(a lot) of disturbing scenes. For a very entertaining and realistic view of war, look no further than my favorite movie Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>****/**** rated R for intense, realistic, graphic war violence and language."

Some of you expected some message to be conveyed by this movie, like a lesson in life or whatever. That wasn't the purpose of this movie. BHD is a step-by-step retelling of the Mogadishu (sp? too lazy to check) incident which involved U.S. Delta Force / Rangers on a near-botched mission against the thousands of warring-Somalians.

","When I first saw this movie, it was very strong. It made me want to buy the DVD so I could understand the movie. Everything in the movie was perfect.<br/><br/>Story: 300,000, and counting Somalis died from starvation. Warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid seized all of the ports and is giving the food to feed his army. The U.S. tried to send food with 200,000 Marines as escorts. Aidid waited until they withdrawed and started again. Now, President Clinton sent in the Rangers, Delta Force, and SOAR to remove Aidid from the region. However, on a mission to capture Aidid's advisors, one Black Hawk helicopter gets shot down by one of the Somali soldiers carrying RPG launchers. While trying to rescue the survivors, another Black Hawk helicopter gets shot down.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS:<br/><br/>As for the characters, they are great and have their own reasons for things. Sergeant Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) is just a drill sergeant in a training camp in Somalia. Lieutenant Beales had a seizure and Captain Steele put Eversmann in charge of Beales's chalk. Eversmann just joined because he wanted to make a difference, ""(about the Somalis) It's not that I like them or don't like them. These people have no food, no job, no education. We can do two things: Help them, or watch the country destroy itself on CNN."" However, he is in conflict on the field considering it is his first live mission and wants to do everything right.<br/><br/>Grimes (Ewan McGregor) is just a ""desk jockey"" and coffee maker. ""You are actually looking at the guy that believes the commercials 'Be all you can be.' I made coffee during Desert Storm. I was sitting behind a desk while everyone got to fight in Panama."" Grimes felt that his talent is being wasted while the rest of the Rangers got to fight in the past missions. When Grimes's wish finally comes true, it becomes a nightmare for him because most of Mogadishu is fighting all of the teams and just wants to stay alive. At least he gets to be successful in one scene.<br/><br/>Hoot is a ""tough guy"" warhorse, but he has some morals and was kind of like a big brother and a teacher to Eversmann.(Spoiler) ""Once that first bullet flies past your head, politics and all that s*** fly out the window,"" was one of the good points. And at the ending, he tells Eversmann one of his great lines, ""When I get home, my friends ask me, 'Hey, Hoot, why do you do this, man? Why, you're some war junkie?' I won't say a goddamn word. Why? They won't understand why we do it. They won't understand that it's all about the men next to you."" He even doesn't want Eversmann to rejoin him because he probably did not want to jeopardize Eversmann's life.<br/><br/>Captain Steele (Jason Issacs) is upset at the Delta Force soldiers because he thinks that they lack discipline (from modifying their weapons and wearing sunglasses) and there is a rivalry between them and the Rangers. ""You Delta boys are nothing but a bunch of undisciplined cowboys. Some day, you WILL need my Rangers""<br/><br/>Colonel McKnight (Tom Sizemore) has most of hell on his convoy. They kept getting poor intel on the locations leading to the crash sites. He lost about ten soldiers while struggling on getting the directions. Even after he is back at base, he still wants to go back to the field even when Lt. Colonel Cribbs tells him that Mcknight does not have to go back.<br/><br/>As for Shugart and Gordon (the people that tried to defend Durant), they were very heroic in the line of duty. I was surprised that they received the Medal Of Honor. It was too bad that it was the three of them fighting.<br/><br/>END CHARACTER<br/><br/>This movie shows the very grim reality of modern-day war. On one scene where Yurek gets separated from his team, and gets attacked by a Father and Son Somali team and Yurek leaves through a back window, Yurek slips and the boy shoots the father. It made me feel sorry for them. It also made me feel sorry for the families of the soldiers that died during the mission.<br/><br/>As for the start of the credits starting out as ""1000 Somalis and 19 American soldiers got killed, it showed a list of the names of the soldiers that died. A person from another review complained that there were no names of the Somalis that died. To talk back at that person, it is impossible to ID the Somalis that got killed. It is even too dangerous to go there as of that time since there are still a lot of crazy militiamen.<br/><br/>This movie could have gotten an Emmy or Oscar award. The most dramatic scenes in my opinion were the part where Shugart and Gordon are fighting the whole city while defending Durant and the Wolcott's crash site at nighttime to dawn.<br/><br/>Wish they could do a segment like this on a video game.<br/><br/>I give this movie unlimited/10.<br/><br/>Seriously: 10/10"

","I can be silent no more. The comments about Black Hawk Down truly amaze me.  Especially those from world citizens other than Americans.  IMDB is a website for movies, not political commentary.  Personally, I greatly enjoyed the movie, especially after reading the book by Mark Bowden and seeing specials on both the History Channel and PBS.  It's no epic tale and yes it is gruesome, but the movie accomplishes what the director, Ridley Scott, set out to do.  It tells the story of a dark chapter in the history of the United States Army and United States foreign policy.<br/><br/>Many of the comments regarding the ""plot"" and the politics associated with Black Hawk Down have come from people that obvioulsy know very little about what actually happened in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993. For that matter, these critics know little of the circumstances leading up to that fateful day.  I have no problem with a person expressing their own opinion.  After all, the personnel of our armed forces secure our personal freedoms day in and day out.  If you're going to express that opinion, please make it an informed opinion.  Read the book.  Watch the specials on television.  Don't dishonor the memory of those who fought and died in an attempt to stop bloodshed and starvation among the Somalis.<br/><br/>This is my opinion and I am sure someone will take issue with it. But that is fine with me.  It's your right.  I'm grateful to our soldiers that have sacrificed for our nation so that I can type these words.  The story of Black Hawk Down was forgotten by our country until it was put into print. I'm thankful that Ridley Scott put this story in cinema for all the world to see."

","As the proud owner of a digital high definition, wide-screen projection television with DTS surround sound, I could barely WAIT until the DVD version of this film was released, given all the hype.<br/><br/>I don't even bother going to the theatre anymore, because it's far more enjoyable to wait four or five months and watch it in the comfort and ease of state-of-the-art home theatre technology.  Let me hasten to add that this film does not disappoint in that regard...it's magnificent in terms of picture and sound.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I must confess that I turned it off at Chapter 14, and damn near threw the rented jewel case at the screen.<br/><br/>During the BIG ONE, as Archie Bunker called it, we were subjected to many jingoistic ""John Wayne"" propaganda-laden Hollywood productions, some of which were nonetheless very good AND served the useful and justifiable purpose of galvanizing Americans and their Allies into an all-out effort to wipe the (then) rotten Huns and Nips off the planet.<br/><br/>This one, however, is simply preposterous!  There's not a commander, from platoon to division level, who would for a moment allow virtually all of his troops (having already accomplished their mission...rounding up the ""bad guys"") to return to a heavily defended area to rescue one guy who fell out of a copter or several others in a couple of other  Blackhawks"" shot down during the heat of battle.<br/><br/>I recently watched a documentary on the Battle of Midway, where the flight commander just prior to their mission told his torpedo bomber pilots ""If 5 percent of you come back, I'll be surprised"".  As it turned out, he was overly optimistic....one squadron lost 28 out of 29 pilots.  Now THAT was true and documented heroism, but the silly, needless and wasteful loss of further life depicted in BLACKHAWK DOWN is just another example of the brainless ""feel good"" mentality of our current movie fare.  Even more sad, it is gobbled up by most of today's moviegoers, who've been programmed to accept and even rave about this and other manipulative horse droppings....eg. Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>One fairly recent and notable exception which offered me some fading glimmer of hope for Hollywood ...the magnificent SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Although based on a similar premise, it was openly a politically driven order from Washington (rather than the ridiculous BLACKHAWK decision by the front line commander and his eager troops to return to a needless but oh so admirable kamikaze-style slaughter) which sent all those  troops back into harm's way.<br/><br/>A MAJOR disappointment!!!!"
"naderiq","Null","0","1","13 July 2002"," flaws with Black Hawk Down
","I am a huge Ridley Scott fan and wanted to see this movie when it would come out. I loved this movie in terms of how it was made[music, look of film etc]. I highly recommend the music CD as I experienced flashback to the movie.<br/><br/>However, after reading the book and watching the ""True Story of Black Hawk Down""[which faithfully rehashes the book for people too lazy to read it], and reading the comments about the flaws by Mr. Superslick I am a bit dis-illusioned by the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, Delta Operator Paul H in the book, BHW, was extremely disappointed by the level of training and experience of the RANGERS. In the movie, the rangers were seen to be in control of their emotions, but in the book, they ""completely freaked out"" that the Somalis would fire back and actually hit them. This was the real tragedy of the BHD incident where Rangers, who are suppose to be the elite[step above the rest from normal US army types] were completely freaked out in the situation. It was the D-boys that were the real heroes in the sense that they held it together.<br/><br/>
Second, the discipline among the ranger units completely broke down under the pressure of the shooting. In the book, the rangers did not obey orders to go out at nighttime to reinforce the Black hawk. Considering the elite special forces could not handle this situation, imagine a bunch of dumn ass ROTC graduates put in this situation. Normal Army types would have completely p*ssed in their pants.<br/><br/>
Third, Eversmann in the book completely LOST IT[ie emotionally] and was no way in control as portayed in the movie by Josh Hartnett. No ranger in this event displayed this level of professionalism. Only the D-boys were that cool under pressure. This angle was not played up in the movie as it would have weakened the heroic nature of Special Forces.<br/><br/>Fourth, this fact that the Somalis were p***ed off with Rangers and the BlackHawks as stated by Author Mark Bowden was that the blackhawk fighters were always disrupting the traffic and blowing away the houses in Mogadishu. In addition, the flyboys were always flying UNDER the rooftops that also p*ssed off the Somalis.<br/><br/>In a New York TImes article about BHD, Ridley and Jerry stated they wanted the movie to be more about what it was like to be in a firefight and not the Story about a particular Special Forces operator in Mog. So the incessant complaints about plot is annoying."

This movie gets off to a bad start when we see enough cuts and different camera angles to give anyone an epilectic seziure.  This seems to be a common problem with director Ridley Scott.

Sure there's a story behind all this nonsense, but a story would move along a lot better with dialog (bullets and bombs don't count as dialog (see The Mummy Returns)).

I think Ridley was more interested in showing the utter gore of battle than anything with emotion in this movie.  With a guy known for Gladiator ( a movie that'll have you tearing up in no time) this movie is a disappointment as far as showing any kind of real emotion in this movie.  I found the actors to be nothing more than cold rocks.  It was rather hard for me to care about anyone dying in this movie.  Ewan Mcgregors piece was useless. I'm not totally certain that filming a movie with a bunch of unknowns was the best idea.  There's one thing with Tom Hanks dies in Saving Private Ryan and quite a different thing when an unknown does.  With all the body parts falling in this movie... I actually don't remember anyone who actually died in the movie. The dvd is also rather skimpy on extra's.  There is a 25 min making of though that should suffice.  I also was disheartened that they did not include Country in Sam Shephards list of credits.  That's a great movie that's slowly slipping into the past :(<br/><br/>The good things in this movie.  I think this movie was very well shot.  It seemed rather realistic.   I gave this movie an 8 simply because I did feel they accomplished  a great deal.  Although I thought the ending was rather sub par.  It is rather hard to read the text at the end of the movie.  I'd say anyone with a tv under 32 in, might not be able to read it.  If you don't... you'll never find out what happened to Michael Durant. <br/><br/>
I do feel that this is a little bit of a fad movie.  There is alot of patriotism going on now.  But patriotism can sour really fast.  So I'm not sure how long it'll be before we see anti war movies again.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable:  depends   5/10"

Ridley Scott made a gem of a film, one that is powerful in its imagery than its dialogue and other aspects. This proves to be one of the few films with bad dialogue I actually liked, simply because of the detail and care placed onto the technical side of the film. The cinematography was quite stunning, even though it was thinly guised as your typical action-movie cinematography. <br/><br/>While I felt Josh Hartnett was WAYYY out of his element, the other actors were all exceptional. Ewan McGregor and Ewan Bremner, both known as the druggies from Trainspotting, were quite convincing in their roles as Army Rangers. Tom Sizemore proved he is the ultimate bad ass when it comes to war movies, and the likes of William Fichtner, Eric Bana and Sam Shepard proved to be worthy background characters.

No jingoism here, and no false notes; no holding back, either, as we see dismemberment, intestines, and meatball field surgery without morphine.  Gripping and convincing, and an indictment of civilian micromanagement of the battlefield (for political reasons, the American troops are denied the protection of tanks and C-130 gunships), and therefore an acknowledgement of the sort of results you can expect with a draft-dodger in the White House.

"DrDread","4","0","3","26 March 2002"," Easily forgotten?
","What was it Ridley Scott tried to tell me about war in general and the Mogadishu incident in particular?<br/><br/>Well, I'm not quite sure. The War movie as a genre is a tough genre for film makers to handle. To make a war movie a good movie, there's tons of stuff to consider. It's too easy to just tell a fast-paced story with a lot of gun-totin' soldiers running around wreaking havoc and/or defending themselves. War as an experience is at its core totally meaningless, and it is important to have that in mind when telling the story and (hopefully) conveying a message.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott I feel, has a problem here. The meaninglessness is too shallowly portrayed, mostly due to the one-dimensional characters in the movie. We never learn what the true thoughts of the soldiers are, except cliche one-liners as ""there's only the guy next to you that matters"" and ""when bullets start flying, the politics go out the window"". And making the Somalis card board figures only meant to be blown away doesn't make things any better either.<br/><br/>Still, the craftsmanship is top notch. Ridley Scott is known to paint ""pretty pictures"" and does so in this movie also. This has worked well for him, especially in movies such as Alien and Blade Runner, set in constructed fantasy environments. Maybe this is a problem when he is to make a movie set in a ""real"" setting. It has a glossy feel to it, and as such works against the realism he wanted us to believe in when watching his movie.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie didn't make me think about the horrors of war, didn't touch an emotional chord inside of me the way Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or even Patton did. If you are to watch a movie which depicts a debacle as horrible as the Mogadishu incident, it is imperative that these elements are in place. If not it only leaves you indifferent, and indifference towards war is something we definitely don't need in this day and age."

","I see this as not so much a movie.  This is a story, a story of the horrors of War and of the disgusting filthy jobs that must be done to preserve democracy.  Being such I will first comment on the Movie/Film Aspects of it. I feel if release as a straight out fictional film it would have done very well in theatres.  The effects were at times BREATH TAKING, totally awesome. The complexity of the crowd scenes must have required thousands of people. The Battle Choreography also, amazing.  They needed to employ realistic elements of squad combat, (i.e. Squad Automatic Weapon deployment, covering fires and kill zones) these were done with total believability and VERY few, if any, errors.  What a foundation to put down for the remaining aspects of the film the story line and the principals.  The adaptation from a Novel to Screenplay is NO small undertaking.  There are MANY MANY things, characters, and battles, subplots that must be cut while simultaneously adding necessary elements intrinsic to film.  Good job on this count.  I read the book, but it down, saw the movie, then came home and read the book again.  It fit, the stories were believable, one story begat another and vice versa.  Good Job. NOW, the Principals (Actors to you and me) WHOA WOWOWWOW.  Josh Hartnett is the future, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, SHIFT IT here come da man.  This is the role of a lifetime.  Be honest.  Be a soldier.  Do you know what it's like to COMMAND 20 men and have them trust you with their lives?  Also, be compassionate.  Your only human their son... these boys fresh out of boot, want to fight, make a difference.  The Sergeant just wants to have everyone who gets off the chopper, get back HOME ALIVE.  Josh KICKED ASS!  He led, he commanded, made mistakes, beautiful role and a masterful performance. Eric Bana, the dark, mysterious yet OH so beneficial soldier, he is a man who's seen ""The Elephant Charge"" way too many times. At just those perfect moments Sergeant ""Hoot"" steps in and saves the day with gunfire or if needed, some tough words.  Ewan McGregor, Obi Wan... this is not.  Here he is a reluctant, almost comical character, someone truly more likeable in print. Well-done shaping the role into something that worked.  Don't let the real soldier's charges detract from his character's performance.  FINALLY, TOM SIZEMORE the Master, THE MAN ALL HAIL TOM.  Ala ""Apocalypse Now"", ""ahhhh... Love the smell of napalm in the morning""  Proudly leading his men ""Just DRIVE"", ""I'm blinded sir!""  ""Just DRIVE, put your foot down and DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!!!!!!""

","Let me start off by saying that Jerry Bruckheimer has never made a good movie. Everything he does drips with feel-good summer blockbuster emotions which lack any kind of depth or genuine emotion. Enter Black Hawk Down. When I went into the theater I didn't know that Bruckheimer was involved in the film. I knew Ridley Scott directed it, but I had no idea that Bruckheimer put his tainted hands on the script.<br/><br/>Black Hawk down is basically a remake of Armageddon, only set in Somalia. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long. With all that time, we still know nothing about the characters. I would have felt more emotion for the dying soldiers if I knew who they were. Every time some young American soldier was gunned down, I was too busy wondering who it was to watch the movie. Rather than take some time to establish the characters, we spend the entire movie watching battle after battle.<br/><br/>This movie is one long continuous boring stretched-out nauseating action scene. There are no dynamics. It's 150 minutes of gun fire. I love a good war movie. What I don't like is a gun fight which takes up an entire Friday night. Bruckheimer is to blame. Ridley Scott has done some great stuff. Bruckheimer has yet to prove himself. He can't work on film with less than a $100 million dollar budget. That should tell you something about his skill as a director/producer."

","Blah blah blah blah blah. 'Black Hawk Down' was a 15 minute story stretched out in to 2 and half hour production. The only mildly redeeming part of this movie was it's solid cinematography, which was largely stolen from other better war movies such as 'Apocalypse Now'. I had difficulty staying focused through the length of this movie, but let me say now that in general I despise war movies and find them as boring as growing grass, so let my bias be known. The characters were all stock and cliched yet somehow largely unlikeable, and ultimately unknown even at the end of this overly long snore-fest. The movie offers nothing new to the tired war genre and disgraces itself by adding American nationalism to a story that didn't really deserve any. It failed to capture most of the mistakes made by the American army during this operation and managed to somehow make it a story of great Americans (Pearl Harbour anybody?) All in all, 'Black Hawk Down' was a boring cliched movie that had nothing to say and very little direction."

","May contain spoilers.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The story is incoherent at best, and the whole point is simply lost on me. Like others, I would have preferred more of the historical backstory. Instead, we get a brief overview that tells the viewer very little.<br/><br/>What surprised me most was that this film got released when it did. Not being an American, I really don't have the same passion to see a US-based glory film. However, despite that, I really don't know if I could call this a glory film. All it did was show the stupidity and ineptness of the Americans at a time when the whole of the US wants to rally around its troops. Americans go in, get their heads way below water, and have to be saved by the UN. I guess that I would definitely like to see more of that theme in films -- Americans realizing they're not the be-all and end-all in resolving the world's problems.<br/><br/>At any rate, it would have been nice to see the movie explore more of the before & after story, instead of just throwing a bunch of words onto the screen to say how it all begins and turns out. Movies are a visual medium, show us how things happen. If we want to read about them then we'll pick up a newspaper or book to do that.<br/><br/>3/10 for decent direction, good editing and good sound."

That Americans respond to repetitious violence by labeling it ""courage"" is a travesty to both the terms ""American"" and ""Courage.""

Sure, it beats the world record for the number of lost limbs and balls shot in the head (there's barely 2 minutes without any shooting), but it's so patriotic and stupid at the same time.

After reading the compelling book by Mark Bowden i couldnt wait any longer to see it, its just too bad i finished the book two months before it came out.  After reading such a graphic novel i knew Scott could show the violence and gore in his own way, which would be a realistic way.  Seeing the movie get an R rating for ""intense realistic graphic war violence"" kind of surprised me since ive never seen any rating reasons like that. But being a fan of these kind of movies i couldnt wait to see it.  thought some say that you can compare the violence to the first 20+ minutes of Saving Private Ryan, you cant really, though it is pretty gory its not actually that bad, some scenes make you want to turn away or close your eyes but Ridley Scott is just trying to make it as real as possible.  The acting is ""ok"" but you dont really get enough time to know any of the characters well because of the many different story lines, but war movies arent supposed to have that much character developement.  if you want to see action, and drama this is one of your best choices of some of the poor films hollywood has to offer this time of year. so in conclusion Black Hawk Down is a first rate war movie without all that ""getting to know the main character"" stuff. its simply what it is, and it deserves 10/10 stars."

","I have read the book and have now finally watched the film by Ridley Scott, and in both instances I was left with a feeling of mild shell shock. The book just blew me away, with its harrowing account of the 17 hour fire fight within the city confines of Mogadishu or as the U.S Military reffered to it, ""The Mog"". I had told a few of my friends to read the book and they were left with the same feeling as I, and as the release date for the film kept changing we waited with growing anticipation for what we knew would be a great film experience.<br/><br/>Before I get into the film let me confess something, after reading the book and seeing the film I am scared that I didn't quite absorb the message about what hell war is, I mean I understand how horribly scary and stupid it is, but my lasting feeling from both book and film is that ""Damn I would love to be a 'D-Boy'. No matter how I look at the story, what these guys went through, what they  will forever live with, I still think, Wow those Delta guys kick ass, so for me I feel that the book and film play like a recruitment ad for the US Military, that scares me a little, Anyway.<br/><br/>----------------------Spoilers---------------------------<br/><br/>There are a few things that I wish the film would of included, but I understand why Scott decided not to<br/><br/>1. Definetly it would of been nice to include a little more facts into the stupidity of the higher ups of the American Government, including President Clinton's misguided efforts or lack there of.<br/><br/>2. give a little more understanding as to why the Somalis were so pissed this includes the 71 elders killed by an american bomb, and the perceived arrogance of the american troops by the somali villagers, also the targeting of Ahdid when there were many other warlords that could of been equally held responsible.<br/><br/>3. The Rangers and 'D-boys' killed alot more people than they showed, especially when they first started to return gunfire. In the book they opened up on crowds with 50 and 20 calibre guns.<br/><br/>4. There were alot of humorous moments in the book that were left out. I understand though how including these events would of given the  film a hint of non - believability.<br/><br/>5. Finally, the downplaying of the ""little bird' action and the Malaysian troop involvement was regrettable.<br/><br/>Now, overall the film conveyed the frenzy of the action and included many gory scenes, if you really enjoy this sort of thing, as I do, then you will love it. The moment the action starts it is truly unrelenting. I myself didn't find it confusing figuring out who was who, as the beginning gives adaquate introductions to all the players. I also thought that Josh Hartnett was actually pretty good, along with Sizemore and Mcgregor. I didn't really care for Fichtner's Character or the sillyness of Bremners'. They both seemed out of place and uninteresting.<br/><br/>What I especially liked was the Ridley Scott style of the film, it looked amazing, and the action was shot with such realism and force that I was sitting there just riveted to the screen. Here is a list of the moments of the film that stood out for me:<br/><br/>1. The approach of the choppers to 'the mog', very unlike the chopper scene in ""Apocalypse Now"", Instead of blaring wagner over speakers, there is complete silence as they get nearer to the city, shot beautifully, and almost as powerful as ""Apocalypse""<br/><br/>2. Eric Bana is awsome. I would love to see a movie made about SAS in Afghanistan, with Eric Bana as a bad ass SAS soldier, because he just rocks,(aside from a little melodramatic speach at the end). The best character in the film by far.<br/><br/>3. The Durant scene, with the two Delta guys giving the ultimate sacrifice to protect the lone surviving crewman of the second BlackHawk to go down, was done very well.<br/><br/>Anyway I would not recomend this film to most women I know or people that don't really care for military action, for people who do like this kind of film I would say that it ranks right up there with the best war films ever made."

I don't know if you remember or ever saw the dead bodies of  4 U.S. servicemen being dragged around the streets of Mogadishu, nude, being spit on, being knifed and beaten. This was shown on all TV news stations around the world at that time in October of 1993. All the Somalies rejoicing and ""praising Allah"". If you don't remember this then you need to get out from under the rock you live under and watch the news more often. As a member of the military myself I was outraged and angered of what they (the Somalies) were doing to the bodies of these fallen soldiers. Then I began to ask ""what happened?"".<br/><br/>When The book came out It answered alot of questions and the movie depicts that. It shows how a simple mission got totally screwed up and cost the lives of 19 American soldiers.<br/><br/>The U.S. Government in a rare form of cooperation with the film makers agreed to work with them. Especially in a movie where a debacle and US defeat is shown. Past requests for Govenment cooperation was rejected due to any negative depiction of the military. In an unusual move the government did participate and placed all the actors through actual intense RANGER and DELTA training at Fort Benning, Georga. The thought being, if you're going to do it then do it RIGHT.<br/><br/>Don't look for a message. Stop reading between the lines.

","Black Hawk Down is a cinematic reconstruction of the events that took place in Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993. Civil war was destroying the country and the chief warlord, using hunger as a weapon, intercepted international food supplies and starved 300,000 people to death.<br/><br/>The film starts well, although there are a lot of cue cards to get through which describe the situation in Somalia. The first 30-40 minutes of the film set the scene for a mission to grab the warlord and his cronies from their stronghold in the market area of Mogadishu. But before you know it two Black Hawk choppers have been shot down and the ground troops and Humvee column attempt a rescue. Fighting starts and bullets and RPG's whizz around the theatre, hardly letting up for the next two hours. Somali militia fall to the ground one after the other as they are gunned down by the seemingly invincible US soldiers. Then fatalities start to come in on the US side and things get rather gory in places.<br/><br/>The first half an hour of the movie looks very pretty but fails to set the scene for the conflict or bother with much characterisation, leading me to wonder what purpose it serves. Then when the battle begins the visuals and aurals takes over from the plot. As a film it becomes overpowering, especially in modern cinemas with deafeningly loud sound systems - the action sequences are as intense as the start/end of Saving Private Ryan but barely subside for the remaining two hours.<br/><br/>Speaking of Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down does not compare well. Although over-sentimental in places, SPR shows the army machine working as a whole at the beginning but then builds the characters it introduces so that while the film ends with another bloody battle, you actually care about the soldiers involved. And in the opening scene the counterattack against the Nazi's is so brutal it forces you think about the horrors of war. In contrast, Black Hawk Down is one of those films where you just sit there, spot the ""bad guy"" and wait for the good guy to blow him away. The Somali's are depicted as idiots with guns who (quoting) ""can't shoot for s**t"".<br/><br/>I was seriously thinking about walking out half way through and wish I had. I couldn't have cared less about what was going to happen next, and I'd had enough of gunfight after gunfight. It simply becomes tiresome. And I like action movies.<br/><br/>Still the action was well filmed throughout, as you'd expect from Scott. The sound of the fast-firing machine guns on the helicopters was particularly impressive. We all know what handheld machine-guns sound like, but these were like buzzsaws. Terrifying.<br/><br/>5/10.

I have worked with many Marines before and understand their mentality, however this movie did not bring home that point as intended. The only feeling I got was an enormous sense of anger that the US govt sent so many young men on essentially a suicide mission.  I find it hard to believe that intelligence could not have told us that so much of the city was armed.  And even I could have told you the helicopters would probably be shot at - I mean come on.  Yes, that is not the movies fault - it is the account of the conflict, however this movie should have been a documentary.

It was in places overly patriotic.  I'll use a comparison to Saving Private Ryan.  SPR was a patriotic movie, but Spielberg did not concentrate on patriotism as his main motif.  He also displayed cowardice in SPR which is a common element in war.  In Black Hawk Down, there was no element of cowardice which I think provides a slightly unrealistic view of the event.  I was very surprised by the level of acting by Josh Hartnett.  I haven't been a fan of his previous work, but he actually did rather well in Black Hawk Down.  I'd give the movie an 8/10 - not Saving Private Ryan quality, but better than Apocalypse Now."

","Black Hawk Down is easily one of the best wat movies ever made. The war seqeunces are intense and hard to watch at times. But Ridley Scott has made a brilliant film with amazing cinematography and a fast paced film. Josh Hartnett contuies to make his name in film in the lead role. I give this film a 10/10."
"kgprophet","6","0","1","21 January 2002"," An effective but incomplete depiction
","The following is more a critique about the film compared to the book, than a review.  I give this film 3 stars and a thumbs up.  This is what Pearl Harbour should've been like.<br/><br/>I'm sure people who read the book will react differently from those who didn't.  The book is excellent in cranking out the many details that transpired,  making the reader feel like they are right there.  So many anecdotal events occurred,  it seems strange that a 2 hour and 20 minute movie could not show them all,  even though the actual event lasted a little over 12 hours.  Most people have already seen `Saving Private Ryan'.  We were all shocked by the brutal reality of battle,  and the film deservedly got many Academy Award nominations.  So this time around,  when the blood splatters on the camera lense,  it feels somewhat familiar.   'SPR' also worked because many of the cast were fresh faces,  allowing us to see them as their characters,  not as familiar actors.<br/><br/>In 'BHD',  we see Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, and others from Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbour'.   That cast,  along with the battle,  is fresh in most people's minds (since it was mandatory that everyone see it).    So this time around,  we, the audience,  feel like we've got combat experience going into this film.   Also,  Ewan McGregor,  now quite familiar as a Jedi Master with a Scottish accent in `Star Wars',  does a poor job with an American accent.  One thing that both 'Private Ryan' and 'Pearl Harbour'  did NOT have during their battle scenes was music.  Without music,  the battle scenes feel like documentary footage.  With music,  like in 'BHD',  it pulls us out of the immediate surroundings,  and reminds us that it is a movie. I was quite surprised how much of this non-stop battle was underscored with a Hans Zimmer soundtrack.  Perhaps the decision to go heavy on the music was to pump up the patriotism,  post 9/11.<br/><br/>All that said,  `Black Hawk Down'  is a smart, unflinching,  realistic, and unapologetic film.<br/><br/>There are periods during the battle where events seem incoherent,  which realistically depicts the confusion that really happened.  But it stops short to show the whole story behind some of details on screen.  Near the beginning of the film, we see a short clip of the film 'The Jerk',  where Steve Martin is being shot at.  The gunman misses and hits some cans.  In the book,  this scene is referred to later during the battle,  where bullets are puncturing a piece of metal,  demonstrating how poor a shot most of the Somali shooters were.  `It's the cans!  He hates the cans!'  the soldier declares.  It is a telling piece of humour that helps relay the sense of disbelief the Rangers had while it was happening.  Many of them said it was like a movie.<br/><br/>Another such moment occurs when another Ranger stops when he sees a hand sitting on the ground.  The movie literally stops when the soldier stops to pick up the hand and put it in his jacket, (I almost thought that something had gone wrong with the movie projector).  We learn later in the book that the hand was matched up back to the soldier who lost it.   Then there is Mike Durant,  the most memorable part of the original incident in 1993. The book gives more detail about him being held captive and how he was eventually released.  The movie merely supplies some post-script about his fate.<br/><br/>There is some obvious foreshadowing at the beginning of the film,  and Capt. Steele,  trying to corral his troops,  goes against Hollywood type by showing his vulnerability.   The movie doesn't quite effectively show the Delta troops' influence on the Ranger's behaviour.  It is an important sub-context in the book.  Delta soldiers are trained to be very independent, and the Rangers are trained to stick together and go by the book.   My guess is that the Delta side of the story could not be told, since officially they are not allowed to reveal anything about themselves.  This is unfortunate,  because the movie could have done a better job in setting up the relationship between the Deltas and the Rangers.   It would give more depth to the clash between Capt. Steele and the Deltas later in the film.<br/><br/>Those are my gripes,  but everything else Ridley Scott does is right on. Scott said he wanted to show things how they really happened,  good or bad. For that,  this movie allows the good guys to do not-so-good things,  and gives credence to the fact that the men in charge don't always make the right decisions.  Other than the wall to wall music,  the movie puts you right there,  with very few of those glitzy TV commercial style shots that Bruckheimer is infamous for.   I felt that futility and desperation of the lost convoy was less effective when the film jumped back and forth between them and the pinned down Rangers.  The lost convoy, as it reads in the book, is a trip into pure hell,  the reader wants to scream in horror as much as those that were there surely did.  By cutting away from convoy,  the audience gets a chance to escape,  where there was no escape from the hail of bullets and RPG's in real life.<br/><br/>If you are trying to decide to see this film,  it is up to you whether you can handle the graphic violence,  and the somewhat one-sided point of view of the conflict.   If you can,  you will be rewarded with a gripping story, a thoughtful narrative,  and 2 hours and 20 minutes of film that will never leave you bored.  Few films have done that."
"ari-25","5","0","1","21 January 2002"," Misplaced comic relief and lopsided portrayal of a complex situation.
","The only things that saved this film were the sheer drama of the actual events and the acting.  The comic relief, provided by an idiotic near-deaf soldier, becomes increasingly out of place as the action progresses.  The Somalis are portrayed as incompetent brutes who come out ""ahead"" by sheer force of numbers--a depiction which neither the actual events nor the book supports.  Minutes of screen time are wasted introducing elements that never find their way back into the plot.  For instance, the desk-clerk informs a rookie that Mogadishu is called ""The Mogue,"" yet that term is never used in the rest of the film. Not a horrible film overall, but it could have been so much more."
"SmurK-4","10","0","1","20 January 2002"," Just fun to watch.
","This film is a documentary. So far as a storyline that you actually will get into, forget it. But if you want to know exactly how battles are fought and won in the 21st century than this is your chance. It has a score, great actors, magnificent direction and tons of action. Think Discovery Channel rangers documentary on the big screen. Definitely do not miss this film if you don't have a problem being entertained without a storyline. They say it is impossible to have a great film without a storyline. Ridley Scott is targeting this rule, and he might shoot it down."
"gracie28","5","0","1","20 January 2002"," A depressing little movie with little redeeming value
","Ridley Scott's worst. It is depressing, shallow and pointless. Although it did serve as a good comparison to the way we handled Afghanistan this time around.  Compared to recent war classics such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket, it suffers. The most glaring problem is the lack of character development."
"ferraro","5","0","1","19 January 2002"," Shallow execution makes for mere sensationalism
","If you're going to make a movie that's basically two straight hours of combat, there's lots of different ways to make it stay interesting. You can show the political forces at work or the simple tactics that make the events unfold, or otherwise give the audience an overview of what's happening on a larger scale to give the smaller events meaning. Think Three Kings. Or you can divide the action into several set pieces of different types of battle to keep the action fresh. Private Ryan. Or you can make the characters people that you care about and let them arc or at least play off eachother in interesting ways. Or you can make the action so visceral that the audience feels like they're going through the events themselves, hoping that the experience is fascinating or harrowing enough to be the point of the film. Or hopefully, like any good war movie, you put a bunch of these things together.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down does none of these things. It gives you ""characters"" who are all boring interchangeable ""hero"" archetypes with no backstory and are even harder to tell apart for all looking the same. That would be fine, but then it puts them in a maze of streets and rubble, without a sense of where they're trying to go and what they're facing against, shooting in every direction at ""bad guys"" who pop up in random places at random times, for the whole movie. There's no sense of how far they are from their targets, how far the teams are from eachother, or even how far the army base is from the action when it's time to refuel and rearm. (Some long shots is all I ask.) The action is pretty visceral, but the perspective jumps between the different teams so much that you never get any sense of how long someone has been traveling or waiting, no elation when someone finds their objective, and it's even confusing what most people's objectives are or what direction they're heading.<br/><br/>I guess it can be argued that that's exactly the nature of being thrust into urban combat and having everything go wrong, and that the movie in fact does a good job of keeping the events straight, but if you ask me it's just a lengthy two-plus hours of Bruckheimer-driven sensationalism. It would be a complete disaster if not for Ridley Scott's technical skill keeping it watchable. But I spent nearly the whole film thinking about how many ways it could have been much better."
"malfunkt-1","6","0","1","19 January 2002"," Engrossing, unbalanced and insensitive.
","This movie is worth seeing from a historical context. This movie is based on an actual event and takes some cinematic liberty to fill in some of the blanks. Let's face it, this is not a ""re-enacting"" of the event - this is a movie. The actual event says as much as you need to know and to make your own conclusions about war and humanity. Hell, there's a countless number of hopeless and bloody battles raging all the time. A movie - as art - can transcend historical context and give us a new insight. Unfortunately, Black Hawk Down is rather one-dimensional. Considering that around 1000 Somolians were killed, this movie portrays little of their experiences save their bodies being torn apart by bullets and grenades. This is insensitive, but alas, this is war and - Hollywood. This movie succeeds in delivering the white knuckled combat action sought by combat deprived American males, it does not offer much in the way of acting. Some of the dramatic scenes seem contrived and out of place. Though based on real events and even real dialogue, the presentation of these parts reeks of Hollywood. It is the intense hyper-realism of the battle scenes that make some of the scripted scenes seem so out of place. So you want it real then? Okay, how about shut off the silly American patriotic sound track then. Or how about a scene showing Master Sgt. Gary Gordon body dragged through the streets of the Mog. After all that is what happened. But I digress, it might not be entertaining! No, but it would be respectful. This is that man's last hour, that is how he died, why not tell us.  An event such as tragic as this shouldn't be entertainment for our popcorn, CNN fueled society. I think we can all agree that after Sept. 11th it just isn't 'fun' anymore. Let us remember then."
"eclipsse","4","0","3","27 January 2002"," Technically brilliant, but uninvolving
","I thought this was a very well made dramatisation of the events of the Battle of Mogadishu, the cinematography was brilliant, but although it was well acted (not a British accent in sight - well done guys!)I found that there was no ""hook"" to the characters, meaning that their fate was, ultimately, not that important to me.<br/><br/>I know there was little screen time for each, being somewhat of an ensemble movie, but it can be done (see The Longest Day for how!)<br/><br/>It looked, and felt, like a documentary, rather than a film. I didn't feel ""involved"" with the story, so it was a very long 2 1/2 hours. I kept looking for the next pyro or clever camera move, rather than staying with the plot.<br/><br/>Glad I saw it, but ranks low on the star rating, I'm afraid. 4/10"
"Chris Do","7","0","1","26 January 2002"," Propaganda
","Let's put it this way: the soldierly fraternity antics at the beginning were bland and incomprehensible; Americans never missed their shot (except when firing at one another), and are accorded 5 minutes death scenes; the locals, on the other hand, are killed at a rate of 5 a minute, if not more, and are seen charging headlong into withering fires to be shot like they were Zulus at Isandwanah, or just running aimlessly about, again to be shot, nameless and faceless. They may have no notion of tactics but they were certainly not that stupid or suicidal (which kind of remind me of the final combat scenes from Saving Private Ryan where German elite Waffen SS troops were running around aimlessly too). The dialogs of course were ludicrous: the locals got to say endearing lines ""killing is negotiating"" while Americans had: ""tell mom and pop I fought well"". And by the way, they looked nothing like Somalis but were clearly West Africans. So in closing, I expect this movie to serve for years to come as recruiting video for the US military, and that's about it."
"g.m.mark","Null","0","2","18 January 2002"," This film is racist, one sided and despicable
","This is one of the most horrible films I have seen in a long time. The somalis are depicted as savages wihtout humanity, everything is told from the american persceptive and the somalis are just there to wave spears and be cannon fodder for the brave americans. Ridley Scott is one of my favourite directors and the fighting scenes (which are basically the whole film) are very slick and realistic, and so is the attention to detail but Josh Hartnett is ludicrously bad as always. If you are a racist and like films where innocent people are slaughtered and made to look like savages and where the Americans rule the world as always then you'll like this. If you have a brain in your head and any respect for the human race then you will hate it. Two out of ten."
