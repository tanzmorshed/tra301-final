"The_Fifth_Echo","9","567","870","17 June 2010"," Kathryn Bigelow's Masterpiece
","I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film ""sucks"" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also ""some"" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended."
"Dogwhiz","10","292","441","15 August 2010"," Strong contender for best movie of 2009
","Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapid-action combat scenes and the oh-so-emotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesn't diminish when the guns are holstered. And that's where you'll see the real difference.<br/><br/>The film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town– a concept that allows the typical fast-action war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members' escapades and arguments. It's all about survival and this time around, it's the calm, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of never being truly safe that creates the ever-present suspense. The exceptional editing is partially to thank for such constant energy and pace. Quick transitions ensure that there is never a dull moment and the audience is always thrust into the middle of the action. Plus, director Kathryn Bigelow employed some amazing cinematography (thanks to Barry Ackroyd, United 93) and some of the best shaky hand-held-cam and zoom work I've seen yet. It seems that, for some, this might be a turn-off, but personally, I believe those who complain about shaky cam need to take a closer look at its purpose and realize that it's far more effective in establishing a documentary-like feel for raw and engaging films such as this one.<br/><br/>The interaction between the soldiers is a key point of the film and the entire project is clearly intended to be largely character-driven. You will more than likely find yourself sympathizing with all of the main characters at some point and several others along the way. More than just observing a character's breakdown at the scene of war such as in films like Jarhead, The Hurt Locker immerses the viewer in the world of the characters themselves and practically forces you to care for them– and I mean that in the best way possible. And perhaps the difference is also partially distinguished by the quality of acting. And if there's anyone who deserves recognition for their acting, it's most certainly Jeremy Renner, who surprises with a top-notch performance as Staff Sergeant William James. His performance will have you laughing at bits of humor scattered throughout, gasping in disbelief at one point, shedding a sympathetic tear at another, and yelling at him in exasperation in yet another scene. The characters are never two-dimensional and the film always manages to provide constant reminders that all of the soldiers are just normal people in war situations, driving its purpose home even more effectively. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are impressive in their own roles and share great chemistry both with each other and with Renner. The relationships between the three follow no stereotyped guidelines and their interactions are almost always unpredictable. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hurt Locker is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and packs a visual and cinematographic punch without the over-the-top Hollywood action scenes and special effects. While the storyline may be inaccurate when it comes to certain little details (as many war vets have noted), it's a unique one and allows for much more realistic and well-rounded characters. You'll walk away with your heart still beating fast for a good while after the credits roll and it'll make you think for an even further extended period of time. Everything about its design and execution will stick with you.<br/><br/>--The Motion Picture Underground"
"agmancuso","10","715","1131","28 June 2009"," A Perfectly Shattering Film Going Experience
","Kathryn Bigelow concocts a masterpiece of a film without tricks or gimmicks, at least none to be detected and that in itself is a triumph. Realistic yet poetic like the works of the great masters. It enters and fits a genre and at the same time is unique, unexpected. It shutters, moves and alters every sense, like a powerful drug. I saw it last night and I'm going to see it again tonight. Last night Jeremy Remmer came to speak to the audience in a face to face moderated by Sam Rockwell, great idea but it change my perception of Remmer in the film, of his character. Although he praised Kathryn Bigelow, he said things like ""I don't tell her how to direct and she doesn't tell me how to act"" Watching the film I felt that childish arrogance belonged to the character by his personal appearance showed it belonged to the actor. In any case, it works on the screen. A character you warm up to almost immediately in spite of his contradictions. Remmer will remind you at times of Robert Redford and others of Michael J Pollard. He is truly terrific so try to avoid his personal appearances not to contaminate that impression. The rest of the cast works wonders and the brief cameos by Guy Pearce and Ralph Finnes are the most organic and unobtrusive cameos I've ever seen in my life. All in all extraordinary. I predict, even if we're only in June, that Kathryn Bigelow risks to be the first female director to win the Academy Award. She certainly got my vote."
"toqtaqiya2","9","262","403","12 August 2010"," An engrossing film that takes one's breath away.
","Here we have one of the best films of the last decade. A war film that succeeds in showing what it's like to be in the armed forces nowadays. It was directed be the underrated Kathryn Bigelow. The focus is on American soldiers in the Iraq war. But it's not about them being involved in assaults or shootouts. Instead we're shown the lives of a bomb squad. Jeremy Renner is commanding as Sergeant First Class William James. He provides an excellent performance. So do Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty as his partners. They really do act like real soldiers. The Hurt Locker consists of a series of bomb threats that the team have to overcome. These are all thrilling, tense. What makes the film really shine, however, is its anti-war messages. In the tradition of Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985) The Hurt Locker shows that people get hurt and killed in wars, even if they don't deserve it. It shows that the victims are just like anyone else except that they're in a war zone. The film doesn't directly criticize the American war effort. There are no discussions about whether the Iraq war is moral or immoral. Bigelow's direction is truly impressive. She certainly knows how to work with actors. The acting is obviously superb, and this is the film's greatest strength. Also notable is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd. The war hasn't looked this realistic or this interesting in cinema until The Hurt Locker. The images captured are thoughtful and memorable. No wonder the film was the big winner at the 2010 Academy Awards. Some films that win Best Picture don't deserve it, but The Hurt Locker sure did deserve it. It's one of the best war films ever, and I highly recommend it."
"krigler","10","800","1291","18 March 2009"," The work of a master filmmaker
","The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action thriller at once.<br/><br/>The subject matter itself - the work of a bomb expert, possibly one of the most nerve-racking jobs on the planet - yields most of the suspense but Bigelow manages to squeeze out every bit of tension of the premise.<br/><br/>This film to me was very apolitical - though set in Iraq, it is distinguished from most of the Iraq-themed war films in that it concentrates much more on the job itself than the political environment. Iraq seemed more like a backdrop - any other war would do, The Hurt Locker does not preach about this one specifically.<br/><br/>The story is deeply emotional, depicting a thoroughly disturbed individual's life in hell. Jeremy Renner gives an incredibly powerful performance as an EOD officer completely hooked on adrenaline stemming from his everyday close shaves with death.<br/><br/>All aspects of film-making are top-notch, from the brilliantly subversive screenplay through vivid cinematography, masterful directing and perfectly paced editing.<br/><br/>In its storytelling the filmmakers wisely break with traditional Hollywood narrative techniques. There is no clear antagonist, no rising action, no obvious character development and no climax. And yet the film manages to be more interesting, tense and suspenseful than any Hollywood action thriller I've seen in years while making a powerful, yet subtle statement about the insane addiction that is war. Kudos for everyone involved for making this film without compromising.<br/><br/>This is pure quality, cinematic storytelling at its best, a thinking man's actioner."
"carlostallman","10","815","1319","28 June 2009"," The Brilliant Explosion Of Kathryn Bigelow
","I spent the entire film grabbing the arms of my seat. I was there in Irak, steps away from my death and the death of those around me. The tension, the suspense is at times breathtaking, literally. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a miracle and the definitive consecration of a great filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This is also a rare occasion in which I went to see the film without having read a single review or knowing anything about it. One should try to do that more often because the impact of the surprise translates into pure pleasure and in this case, sometimes, you have to look away from the unmitigated horror. Jeremy Renner is a real find. He is superb. A kind soul, wild man with enough arrogance to make him appear reckless and yet his humanity precedes him. People may commit the mistake of avoiding this gem thinking that it's just a war film. Don't. It isn't. It's a great, engrossing film about human emotions, not to be missed."
"Katie28217","1","367","597","5 March 2010"," What the heck??? Best picture? Not even close!
","As usual, I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. There is no story!! A group of guys meander around Iraq. One day they are here diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Bagdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think is going to happen??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look ""artsy"". And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Deerhunter"" or ""Platoon"". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!"
"gelman@attglobal.net","10","177","281","26 July 2010"," A Movie to See -- Not to Enjoy
","Except for the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" no film I've ever seen comes closer than ""The Hurt Locker"" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and -- yes -- the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.<br/><br/>The principal character, Sgt. First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is one of those who seem to get an adrenaline rush in the face of danger. His colleagues, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackle) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geaghty), see no glamor in their task. Sanborn is a workman-like soldier, trying to do his duty in as safe a manner as possible. Eldridge is in a near-constant state of panic, eager to be somewhere else, any place else. They are not presented as stereotypes, however, nor is anyone else in this absorbing movie. Everyone in the field knows he may die at any moment, and how they manage to hold up in the searing heat of Iraq in a war they aren't asked to understand may be the main point of this film, if indeed it has any point other than War is Hell and the Iraqi War is a particularly terrible slice of Hell.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow deserves every award she won for ""The Hurt Locker."" It is completely unsentimentalized. There is no moral drawn, except what the viewer concludes based on the judgments he or she brought to the movie and the impact of the story on those judgments. Of its type, it is far and away the best war movie I've ever seen."
"hughva","1","430","708","28 January 2010"," Completely, absolutely, totally inaccurate. Pathetically ignorant
","I'm a huge fan of war movies, and, as a Vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details. I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling, ""Stop dialing"" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why ""La La land"" is so named."
"corstay","10","498","826","10 September 2008"," TIFF 2008: The Hurt Locker - World class war-action cinema
","Simply put, action ace Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" is a near masterpiece of suspense and unrelenting intensity.<br/><br/>Her first film since 2002's ""K-19: The Widowmaker,"" The Hurt Locker is definitely a return to form from the director of probably the greatest (in this man's humble opinion) surfer-action movie of all time ""Point Break."" The film follows Bravo company, a team of bomb technicians situated right in the heart of the Iraq war's modern IED warfare. Jeremy Renner, mostly known for impressive performances in ""S.W.A.T"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James,"" gives his most riveting performance yet as the lead, Staff Sergeant William James, a reckless but brilliant soldier who has taken down almost 850 bombs.<br/><br/>What separates this film from the bulk of mainstream cinema that has tackled the Iraqi situation is that it doesn't simply exist as a political polemic, or even a reminder of the humanitarian horrors that plague the Iraqi people.<br/><br/>Instead, Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal give us a story that transcends politics and can be seen as almost a straight up kick-ass action pic. The film is plotted by increasingly dangerous and fully realized defusion sequences, all of which were shot from beginning to end in single takes with DOP Barry Ackroyd's cameras continuously roving around set in order to create a tense realism that translates well to the screen.<br/><br/>Very elaborate attention to detail and mise-en-scene is in every frame of the pic, with Bigelow choosing to shoot in Jordan and locations being less than 10 KM away from the Iraqi border. And from a searing heat wave ranging up to 49C to actual Iraqi refugees used as extras to impeccable sound design and special guest cameos by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes, Bigelow has succeeded in creating an entirely memorable and visceral experience that will surely leave its mark in the pantheon of the very best war spectacles put to film."

","I am so surprised that this movie is getting awards for absolutely nothing....<br/><br/>This so called realistic and objective movie seems like a propaganda filled stupidity that insults both peace advocates and solders...The Iraqis are portrayed as crazy bombers and the solders are portrayed as independent thrill seekers.<br/><br/>When discussing realism I must say that I'm not in favor of the war down there, I haven't been in the military and have no idea how things are done but...I 'm pretty sure it is not like this. Except for the first scene of the movie the rest seems ridiculous and fake.The squads seem that they don't follow a single rule and do not have a single superior to keep them under control or give them hell because of their stupid heroics.And I may not be a military man but I am an engineer and i know that cars cannot catch on fire by a single bullet and that a butcher doesn't have to get out of his shop and wave his cell phone( so that the men he is trying to kill see him) to detonate a bomb. And if someone thinks ""Well its not realistic because its poetic"" I tell him: There is a difference between poetic and stupid. The scene when Clive Owen gets out of the building and no-one shoots because of the baby in ""Children of Men"" is unrealistic because its meant to be poetic.Certainly you don't see something like that in this movie.<br/><br/>From a Cinematic point of view the script is just a series of missions without any reason,The characters do not progress at all and the story is full of clichés. The unexperienced military doctor that does crowd control like an English butler and then dies horribly, the scared solder, the thrill seeker with an underground sense of sensitivity and the list goes on....<br/><br/>As a conclusion...WHY OH WHY DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE...Even if I was a solder i would probably be insulted by this...."

","Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br/><br/>From real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences. From the very start to name a few: the bomb cart, the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts, the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC, having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs, to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect; and the point was made.<br/><br/>This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.<br/><br/>People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy."

","There's a good reason why this film pulled in only $16M at the box office. ""A full-tilt action picture"", ""Ferociously suspenseful."" Yeah right. If the hype on the DVD cover were true, this film would have rocked the box office. This movie was irritating with it's inaccuracy and boring with it's lack of plot.<br/><br/>It started with the opening scene. It was very gritty, suspenseful and tense... until the guy with the cell phone showed up. ""Put down the phone!"" Really? I've never been military but even I knew at this point that man would have been instantly shot, as proved by the reviews I've read on here by military types.<br/><br/>And this continued throughout the movie. Time after time this three man bomb squad behaving as if they were the Justice League of America (except for the one time when the nut case on the crew went into Baghdad by himself. At night. For no particular reason, as it turned out.) By the time we got through the sniper scene I was seriously annoyed and just wanted the movie to end so I started fast forwarding in tiny increments.<br/><br/>What a complete waste of time.

"lolatengo","1","105","164","7 May 2010"," Offensive, to put it mildly
","I have to add my voice to the list of people who really disliked this movie. Imagine a German director making a movie in 1948. Imagine the director asking us to feel sympathy for the soldiers because it was very cold in Russia. (I'm not saying that the United States is a perfect analogy to Nazi Germany, because that would be a grotesque exaggeration.) I actually do have sympathy for all of those young Germans who lost their lives in WWII. But the rest of the world would be appalled to find that this was the take-home message from World War II for the Germans. Bigelow asks her viewers to feel this very emotion for Americans in Iraq.<br/><br/>If there were other scenes that provided a different take on the situation, the hot desert scene would be insignificant. But every Iraqi in the movie is used simply to show how sensitive an American is, or how afraid an American is, etc. The Iraqis are allowed no existence of their own, they are simply plot devices. Don't America's major critics see this? <br/><br/>Some have said that this movie isn't political. By this, they seem to mean that it doesn't criticize the war. This movie is in fact deeply political in that it completely objectifies the ""enemy,"" and glorifies war as a potentially exciting escape from domesticity."

To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad. <br/><br/>I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????<br/><br/>I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best.

I watched it yesterday and for me it was much more than just action, this movie was a deeply affecting series of shots that make truly feel the war in Iraq and make you see the sacrifice that's going on out there.<br/><br/>There are a few things that everyone must notice while watching the movie. There is some superb acting present throughout the whole movie, especially by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie and I wouldn't be surprised to see one or more Oscar nominations for acting. There are also some pretty extreme editing achievements, that even I, an amateur movie-lover, could see. Cinematography and some other technical achievements are stunning as well. As far as technical part of the film goes, this movie is more than successful, it is to be expected that there will be some technical Oscar nominations as well.

","I liked this movie very much because, apart from being a good thriller, I believe it is a quite good psychological comment of how people function under extreme circumstances such as war.<br/><br/>Basically the movie introduces few different types of character and then inspects them. Firstly SSgt. James who as he says ""loves only one thing.."". He is a person who loves war because it gets his adrenalin pumping. Anybody who ever loved doing anything can easily understand what keeps him going, except in his case it is something, hm..., not so nice and widely excepted. This results in creating extremely dangerous situations for all the people (soldiers) that surround him. He is aware of that, and is torn by that fact but he really cannot help himself, he has no choice because he is the way he is. He seeks danger on one end, and when he finds it, he appears to be the best person to be around. A nice touch in the movie was the way in which he tries to rationally ""validate"" his actions by taking a righteous stand regarding the death of an innocent (not to go into the details)...<br/><br/>Other soldiers are a wide specter of human beings with feelings of regret, fear, compassion etc.. The people who are very much affected by the war and are changed by it. Two supporting roles of Sgt. Sanborn and Spc. Eldridge are well placed in contrast to SSgt. James for being ""human"". Acting is great, and all the important characters convey their state of mind very well. David Morse was in the movie for just a few seconds and played his role of a ""hillbilly cowboy"" marvelously as Col. Reed.<br/><br/>A really good movie..."
"fallyhag","4","199","328","29 December 2009"," The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating
","I love a good war film and I fall into the ""been there, done that"" category. So I would like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this film to you.<br/><br/>It started off with me shouting at the TV saying ""you wouldn't do that"" etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...I was right.<br/><br/>There simply wasn't any logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so I was left scratching my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.<br/><br/>The sniper scene was just so laughable. It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.It started with the ""Contact Right"" and went down hill fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet?<br/><br/>Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It added nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched. It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. I still don't understand why they wasted time on it. Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :)<br/><br/>The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, action(ish) scenes.<br/><br/>There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. Sorry folks...it just ain't!<br/><br/>Not recommended...it will just bore you."
"truthandlit","1","45","67","15 May 2010"," an apology for imperialism
","The Hurt Locker is really an abominable film. It presents itself as an apolitical portrayal of the difficult lives of some US troops in Iraq--and it portrays those lives as incredibly difficult and the soldiers as meriting much sympathy. However, the film can only do this by narrowing its focus so extremely that it completely falsifies the situation that it describes.<br/><br/>The basic problem, as with virtually all American films of imperialist conquest, is that although 99% of the people in the situation portrayed in the film are Iraqis, they exist merely as a backdrop for the wondrous portrayal of the American occupiers.<br/><br/>The significance of this can be seen easily if you imagine a film about the WWII Nazi occupation of, say, Poland, or the Japanese occupation of north China. A film about this, that focused with intense sensitivity on the sorrows and travails of the imperialist troops while just shedding a generalized tear over the difficulties of the local civilians caught in a war zone--the imperialist propagandistic character of such a film would be perfectly obvious--would even eclipse everything else about the film. But in The Hurt Locker, we're supposed to see the film as non-political and only focus on the poor American soldiers. This focus of the film is carefully built in to the mission of the soldiers shown: they're not fighting Iraqis, they're just defusing bombs.<br/><br/>I'm not denying the sorrows of the soldiers. Yes, to be in that situation is absolutely horrible. But the Americans are not there doing a good deed at the behest of their friends the Iraqis. The Americans are invaders. Of course, the ordinary soldiers didn't decide on their own that they wanted to invade Iraq, but they have been caught up in the war deliberately started and continued by their government. The great horror of the war that is completely absent from the film is the horror of naive young people who are tricked into participating in the imperialist subjugation of another country. The American soldiers are victims, but they must also be held responsible for their actions, which are criminal. As the war continues, their experience gives them some insight into this terrible dilemma, which appears toward the end of the movie when the most balanced of the soldiers says that his life there is meaningless: 'I hate this place.' The utter futility of their situation can also be appreciated if you compare it to my example of WWII imperialist occupying troops. The Iraqis are more effectively hostile to the American soldiers than the people of occupied France or Poland were to the Nazis. Occupying troops know that any friendly or accommodating civilian can actually be a supporter of the resistance. But the Iraqis are more committed and more organized and more lethal: the friendly civilian can also be a suicide bomber, and any onlooker can dial his cellphone at the proper moment and set off a bomb hidden in a pile of trash. Yes, the American soldiers in Iraq have it worse, in many ways, than the German troops in Eastern Europe, and this shows the weakness of the US policies and the strength of the Iraqi people's resistance. The German army was driven out of Poland and France by the attacking armies of the Allied countries; the American army is getting driven out of Iraq by the Iraqi people (even the US media have pretty much given up on the idea, once pushed very strongly, that the Iraqi resistance was armed, organized, and directed by the Iranians).<br/><br/>But all of this is of course far outside the tiny focus of The Hurt Locker, which tries to show that the angst of the American soldiers is far more important than the political situation or the agony and heroism of the Iraqi people, which is the actual source of that angst.<br/><br/>So The Hurt Locker is a film about the white man's burden. Gosh, imperialist conquest is so hard and takes such sacrifice--but imperialist conquest is a given, not to be examined or questioned. The Hurt Locker is an abominable film."
"Chris Knipp","9","57","87","17 July 2009"," ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.""""--Chris Hedges.
","Already celebrated for its breathtaking realism in depicting soldiers and explosions, The Hurt Locker is being called ""the best Iraq war movie,"" with the qualification that the genre has been weak and the public response weaker. This is Kathryn Bigelow all right: macho men in dazzling exploits, exhilarating and always a little terrifying to watch, with adrenalin and testosterone spurting off the screen. If war is a drug, this movie could give you a contact high. Bigelow was obviously born to make a war movie. The only question is why she took this long to do so. Writer Mark Boal led her into it. He embedded with a bomb squad in Iraq, and came back with remarkable stories and a character to hold them together. He's Staff Sergeant William James, who's what in the genteel days of The English Patient was more commonly called a ""sapper,"" a combat engineer who specializes in demolitions, minefields, and the like. Bigelow wisely chose Jeremy Renner, an unknown and unglamorous actor, for this pleasingly enigmatic role of a man who may be closer to bombs and timers than to his own comrades.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker (soldier slang for a real bad place) gives you immediacy and vérité soldier life, with the shaky digital camera and in-and-out zooms of the genre (the action is so good, we soon forget them, while in Brian De Palms's crude 2007 Redacted, they grate all through). Such authenticity is achieved in Brit documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield's more political, excellent, little seen, low-budget 2005 drama The Battle for Haditha. It may not make his film unbiased, but Broomfield most notably gives more detail of the Iraqi P.O.V. -- using real Iraqis -- while Bigelow sticks to showing Iraqis as the American soldiers experience them -- an experience that turns out to be insane, paranoia-inducing, and scary. (In both movies one of the few friendly forms of contact is buying and selling pirated DVD's, the US soldiers buying, the Iraqis selling, and in both this contact becomes a key plot element.) Obviously Bigelow also had a much bigger budget, the better to provide a wealth of spectacular explosions, essential (or justified anyway) since this is about a small team of three men whose main (but by no means only) job is to find and defuse improvised explosive devices (IED's), the DIY but sometimes highly ingenious signature weapons of the Iraqi insurgency. There is also a horrifying body bomb; a complicated and lethal car bomb in front of a UN building; a suicide bomber who has a change of heart (as in Hany Abu-Assad's 2005 Paradise Now); and a hairy firefight with snipers (and a somewhat obtrusive cameo by Ralph Fiennes) out in the desert. Besides which the adrenalin-numbed Sergeant James independently gets himself and his two squad members, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), into various private and probably unnecessary severe crap storms. All of this is staged with stunning accomplishment and a strong focus on character and the interactions, intense even when alienated, of these three men.<br/><br/>The movie takes no political stand, other than Hedges' ""war is a drug."" This is like the point of view of Andrew Swoford used for Sam Mendes' 2005 Jarhead, which, however unsuccessful in some aspects and poorly received, conveys that soldiers don't question war because they're too busy doing dangerous jobs, or waiting and hoping to do them, and trying to stay alive till, God willing, their tour ends.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is episodic and cyclical. It ends where it begins, with the protagonist joining a new team of strangers for another tour. Thanks to Boal's writing, Bigelow's fine directing, and an excellent cast, the episodes never seem routine or repetitive. But if you emerge with a sense of numbing danger and pointlessness that may not be inappropriate. The only structure is the routine one of datelines saying how many days are left in Bravo company's tour. But this is a figure that, as Kimberly Peirce's Stop-Loss depicts, is often set back to start again.<br/><br/>The opening sequence, where James's predecessor is killed, leaving Eldridge and Sanborn in need of a new leader, is pretty obvious. It's so carefully set up you know what will happen. It's still excruciatingly tense, a textbook street IED diffusion job that conveys how terrified the two backup guys are and sets up what's to come. This is a team, with all three in radio contact and each with his function, Eldridge the lookout in charge of Sanborn, who's the guard. The street is surrounded with buildings and people and deep in unknowns. When James arrives shortly after his predecessor's body has been shipped home, he does a similar job, but it's all different.<br/><br/>First we don't feel the danger except by remembering the first sequence, because James is so immune to it. Sanborn and Eldridge are freaking out because James doesn't stay in touch with him when he's suited up dealing with the device. They feel lost. We realize that the three before were a great team and we sense the rage and abandonment of his bereaved mates. There's immediate intense conflict between Eldridge, an elegant, chiseled black man with extensive Intelligence experience, and the puffy-cheeked James whom Eldridge calls ""redneck trailer trash"" straight off to his face. These telegraphed macho conflicts, essential Bigelow, work because the jobs being done are all so convincingly and intensely depicted.<br/><br/>This is a great movie but it leaves you empty. The director is so caught up in what she's doing that it's infectious, but the compelling intensity also represents a loss of perspective. Still, if there is any non-documentary Iraq war movie that's a must-see, this has got to be it, and it's by far the best thing the uneven but gifted Kathryn Bigelow has ever done. It's a game-changer, the new American war movie to beat.<br/><br/>(This is a cut version of a 1,600-word review.)"

"shanayneigh","1","46","69","7 May 2010"," The usual US propaganda
","Technically, there's nothing wrong with this movie. But nothing spectacular either, I might add.<br/><br/>I have no particular views on ""The Hurt Locker"" winning the Academy Award for Best Movie, considering that 2009 was a spectacularly dull movie going year (don't even get me started with Pocahontas-cum-Smurfs!)<br/><br/>This movie hides behind a thin veneer of ""war is hell"", but never for one second - like most American war movies - veer from the ""support the troops"" discourse (in fact, the people in the US armed forces are described as ""superheroes"" in the supplemental material on the DVD). Although war might be hell, we always are supposed to sympathize with those (supposedly) brave and gallant men and women who are fighting it, never portraying them in a negative way, or even delivering the slightest criticism towards the actions of US troops.<br/><br/>This, of course, is true of most movies claiming to be anti war. Those who dare step outside the propagandist ""support the troops"" framework and deal with the atrocities perpetrated by US soldiers are punished by being accused of treason (like Brian De Palma who did ""Redacted"", a fictionalized account about the Mahmudiyah killings, where an entire Iraqi family was murdered and a 14 year old girl gang raped and murdered by US troops) or punished economically (like Nick Broomfield's ""Battle for Haditha"", a movie about the massacre where 24 civilians where massacred in their homes by US troops, being shown in one single theater, raking in a whopping 10,000 dollars in its theatrical run).<br/><br/>Whenever someone from the US military is a bad guy in a movie, it's always some rogue element - never that the military in itself is bad and commits atrocities directed towards civilians on a regular basis. This criticism isn't limited to movies dealing with the Iraq war and subsequent occupation, but it's valid for just about any military conflict in which the US armed forces are engaged. And of course there are examples like ""The Rock"" where the military bad guys really turn out to be good at heart, fighting for their brethren who have been betrayed by the government (it's funny how movies are critical towards some nondescript behemoth ""government"", but are silent when it comes to the armed wing of the same).<br/><br/>In ""The Hurt Locker"" the US troops might as well have been wearing white hats, and all the cardboard cutout Iraqis black hats, because this movie is about as multidimensional as an old western when it comes to good guys and bad guys. In this movie Iraqis fulfill the same function as the Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"" - a faceless crowd of bad guys ready to be gunned down in scores (except for one token character; most likely a result of liberal guilt).<br/><br/>In the DVD extras, Bigelow claims to want to ""put the audience into the soldier's shoes"". Her lack of interest in the plight of the Iraqis under occupation is blatantly obvious. In fact (if memory serves me right), all violence directed towards Iraqi civilians is perpetrated by other Iraqis. The US soldiers are just there to protect Iraqis. The movie is well in line with the talking points of the US regime (it doesn't matter if it's run by Republicans or Democrats - same sh*t, different suit).<br/><br/>This movie is just another example of a cowardly movie industry, resulting in a film which is anti war in name only. Always a good way of getting movie going liberals to ease their guilt."
"t_baker","9","38","56","9 August 2009"," An excellent film
","Military and war movies are problematic for me, at least modern-era ones; I wasn't in World War II or Vietnam but the post-Desert Storm era Army is a very well known quantity for me, and military movies set in this period (to include those set in the current Iraq / Afghanistan wars) almost always get some nagging thing wrong. Lieutenants and Captains don't call Colonels by their first names, and no one would ever wear a class-B wool sweater into a jungle at night, just to name two examples I've actually seen on screen in recent years.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" slips up a bit, too, but to my surprise, I was able to forgive those missteps almost completely, because the movie on the whole is the most compelling war movie in many years, and just a great movie, period: terrifically acted, brilliantly conceived and directed, a work of true cinematic art. Like the committed professionals that it portrays, ""The Hurt Locker"" as a movie shows what movies are capable of when knowledgeable, experienced professionals are on top of their game.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" is generally regarded as THE modern war classic, and just about any picture set in war is going to draw at least a peripheral comparison to Steven Spielberg's flawed masterpiece, thanks to the still-detonating power of that film's master-class opening sequence, which took filmed combat to levels of never-before-seen verisimilitude. ""The Hurt Locker"" doesn't have that level of intensity, because it works on a smaller scale: the majority of the action is between individuals, not battalions. But there are extended sequences in ""The Hurt Locker"" that rival ""Ryan"" for impact, tightening the screws more slowly, more claustrophobically, until you feel as though you've been holding your breath even when you haven't. There are at least three of these sequences in ""The Hurt Locker,"" all done in their own pace without dragging, all expertly performed, all showing a face of war that we haven't seen on film before.<br/><br/>There are bit roles from recognizable actors like David Morse (brilliant in his few moments on screen), Guy Pearce, and Ralph Finnes, but the majority of the acting load is shouldered by lesser-knowns Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie; they're both excellent. In a just world, this movie would be earning four hundred million in the US, not ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" But while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has pulled plenty of ""say what?"" moment in the past (""Crash,"" really?!?), they still have a chance to do right by this film and quality cinema in general: Best Picture nomination, a Best Director nod for Kathryn Bigelow, Best Screenplay (of some sort; this is based on journalism by the writer, Mark Boal, which may qualify it as ""adapted"" work), and acting nominations for Renner and Mackie. Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>It's still only August and there's a lot of film to come in the ramp-up months to awards season, so this may be a stretch. But any movie that's going to top ""The Hurt Locker"" as my favorite of 2009 certainly has its work cut out for it.<br/><br/>BONUS POINTS: Unlike so many lesser films (""Crash,"" again looking in your direction), ""The Hurt Locker"" feels no need to explain its title on screen. There's never a point (at least that I recall) in which a character earnestly says, ""Man, we're really in the hurt locker now"" or words to that effect. A small point, sure, but just another nod to the creativity and confidence of the filmmakers."

Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie.

","""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the most incredible films of the decade. It looks fearlessly into the heart of the conflict in Iraq. Exposing the harsh reality of war, the film is able to give the viewer sympathy towards both the soldiers and the civilians of Iraq while they continue in their struggles, exposing their true humanity. The characters and film-making is so realistic, you could have sworn that you were there. This movie has given me a newfound respect for Kathryn Bigelow as a director. *SPOILER* The scene of Beckham as a body bomb is one of the most powerful scenes I've witnessed in a film. James's emotions during that scene aren't over-acted, but entirely natural.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films I've seen on the Iraq War yet. I recommend it whole-heartedly. The dialog and imagery cuts deep emotionally. The acting is excellent. It should be considered iconic of this generation.<br/><br/>9/10"
"moviemanMA","10","53","81","18 January 2010"," Addicted to war
","The Hurt Locker is a brilliant examination of the war in Iraq, in particular a bomb squad unit faced with the task of replacing their bomb technician.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is SSgt. Williams James, the replacement bomb specialist. He knows that the unit lost a valued member, but he makes it clear that he is no ordinary bomb diffuser. James is a renegade, adrenaline junkie set on doing the job his way. He has some regard for his unit members, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), but when it comes to him performing his job, he doesn't let them get in the way.<br/><br/>The three members form a bomb unit that go around encountering all sorts of situations to suspicious automobiles to possible suicide bombers. James wears the bomb suit while Sanborn and Eldridge are his eyes and ears. They rely on each other to stay alive, whether they like it or not. Much like a chain, each link depends on the other to stay together.<br/><br/>I have said this several times, but it is the originality of a story that makes me interested. War is a popular genre. For a movie to interest me, I need to be invested in the story, the characters, and the technical aspects. A good filmmaker focuses on one or two of these. A great one makes the package complete. Kathryn Bigelow, who before this film was probably more well known for being the ex-wife of James Cameron, has established herself as a very gifted filmmaker. In the opening scene she shows her ability to build suspense, releases it, and follow through with intensity, action, and fantastic camera work. Great tracking shots and impressive slow motion effects help make this a very memorable opening sequence.<br/><br/>Bigelow wasn't the only person to impress me. Renner takes a big step in the right direction with this role. There is something about him that is so interesting. We know nothing about him other than he is the unit's new member. After seeing his renegade approach to the job, we assume he a nut job, someone who doesn't care about whether he lives or dies. As the story moves along we learn more about him and his family back home. He develops a friendly relationship with one of the kids that hangs around the base. Renner slowly peels back the layers of his character through little interactions with those around him. We see he is a true, blue collared soldier who wants nothing more than to serve his country.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie we are given a quote that ends with, ""war is a drug."" Renner's character exemplifies this statement, being virtually the only person who wants to be where he is. It's a perfect way of setting the tone. A movie called The Hurt Locker is not going to be about sunshine and lollipops. It's going to be gritty and powerful. Bigelow presents some intense and moving images. This is a movie that stays with you. It's a movie that opens your eyes. That's exactly what a war movie should do."
"grivand","1","103","166","9 March 2010"," The Hurt Locker Hurts
","There is nothing worse than a hugely overrated movie, indeed a bad movie is infinitely better. If the list of overrated movies were to made right now, the hurt locker would be the runaway winner. Popular with the critics, for what reason, I cannot fathom. One assumes that to be a professional critic, you need to have seen a movie or two, but here they are, people who have watched the likes of the hurt locker a million times and give it disproportionate praise. Something is fishy. The movie is not making any statement beyond what is known and hasn't been packaged better by far superior movies of the past. Friend and foe are very sketchily described. By the end of the movie, we know nothing more of the protagonists beyond the fact that the lead character is a nut job, who shouldn't even be in the army let alone as a leader of any sort.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury the academy has added it's blessings and voted this picture, best picture. The academy's decision is a bit easier to explain once you take the academy as a body that is more interested in making statements rather than one that actually rewards merit. The statement here is that it was high time a woman won the coveted best director award (Streisand more or less said so). Not much beef from anyone there but just giving her the award would have exposed it for the token sham award it was, so her average run of the mill, been there, been done a million times before and much better,see Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (Not even nominated for best picture, in it's time), had to be given the most prestigious award in the whole of cinema, in order to give the best director nod more weight. Indeed the only award that mattered until now. In the words of Jay-Z, we are not fooled, they need many more people. The academy was already on shaky ground to begin with by giving Scorsese's The Departed best picture as a reward for past glorious achievements and oversights - The critically acclaimed Raging Bull and the truly masterful Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. Next was the award going to another average run of the mill affair called Slumdog Millionaire, which had the cinematography and look lifted straight out of City of God, a film which truly deserved best picture status, the year the award went to mediocre Chicago. I won't be taking any of these cinematic awards seriously anymore but in their own interests this sort of gestures are much more meaningful when they are merited and thus cannot be viewed as some sort of affirmative action. When they do decide to reward the first black director, I hope they choose a work that stands to very close scrutiny like Spike Lee's Malcolm X that should have won that honour in 1992.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, my sentiments are already expressed above. The only thing that would make it special are not anything on screen but the fact that it's an explosive filled war flick directed by a female director. I gather there are so few of these around that the first one that comes along has to be given crowning glory. People talk of suspense.What suspense? You have the lead character dragging about 20 bombs on the ground and he emerges out of that situation virtually unscathed! Not only that he has time to find and cut the right wires while the shadowy figures who planted the bombs patiently wait for him to finish his job. If you are looking for suspense after that, I suggest watching more movies. No, this is John Rambo or that chick from Kill Bill. Basically a bullet proof character, who is wholly unlikable and continually puts the lives of everyone around him in danger and is extremely arrogant to boot. The only reason he is alive at the end, is because, well, it's a movie and a poor one at that. Talking of reality then becomes academic unless we are talking of reality in a superman/seinfeld-like Bizarro world. In the world where I live in, this is just another pop-corn flick that should not be taken too seriously. It neither transports any amazing insights into the human condition nor describes any sequence of events that can be related to reality. It has no interesting protagonists but cardboard like figures whose archetypes have been long been established in Hollywood and the narrative is neither imaginative nor innovative. Only because every one and their mother is so willing, so eager to dish it with awards is it even gaining attention. Otherwise it would have sunk in the long list of utterly forgettable, inane films, perhaps popular with a certain group, where it invariably belongs."

","Well I too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the Best Picture Oscar so I went to see it today. What a major disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played I - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself, ""say WHAT? there's no way that would happen like that.."" 2) There's very little that actually happens in terms of plot. A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed (a death that isn't really clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed. If you want suspense try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over-hyped Apocalypse Now), or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark, which, especially for an English film, is unbelievably heart-wrenching.

"adimosh","1","41","62","7 May 2010"," Did I watch the correct movie?
","After watching this movie, I actually had to check twice whether or not I saw the correct one. Either critics have suddenly forgotten everything that the movie industry has produced until now, OR there are other interests at stake. And considering who the director is (a woman - no offense to all), I suppose it's safe to assume that the second option is the correct one.<br/><br/>What I cannot understand is the public reaction. I'm used to people judging extremely poor movies as ""fabulous"", but this is a bit too much. The vast majority of people appeared to like the movie for qualities that simply weren't there. There is no suspense (unless, of course, by suspense you understand a guy casually disarming crude bombs in a manner so disconnected from everything else, that you feel as if he is literally taking a walk through the park), very little action (there are, admittedly, two or three moments in which one may think ""Yeah, action time!"", but they are overshadowed by the fact that less than 30 seconds later, one cannot but say ""What? That was it?""), absolutely no character development (by the time I got to the sniper scene, I couldn't have cared less if the main characters had shifted to the English sniper crew) and so little realism (I mean, come on! One three-man crew perfectly disarming bombs, doing security sweeps, clearing buildings, blasting UODs, sniping and pursuit/recon, all this while seemingly not giving a damn about any form of supervision, orders or chain of command? Anyone who buys into that is either a mindless troglodyte or has been paid to buy into it) that it makes the movie a joke way past its laughing time.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the first 10 minutes (right up to the first bomb explosion) were good. I expected that if the movie went that way, it would be at least decent. It didn't. The new guy comes in to replace the dead guy, they disarm bombs, sit hours at a time in a sniper situation in the middle of the day in the middle of the damn desert with one (one!) pouch of juice for at least 4 other persons, without sending any man to check the status of their marks (which had been dead all that time, by the way), they disarm more bombs, they are then overcome with guilt (though it is impossible to understand why), and so on and so forth... And all this time we have a countdown... When the movie reaches the end, where the countdown is reset and we realize the movie is actually coming to an end, the only feeling any normal person can get is relief that it finally ended.<br/><br/>The shaky-cam idea was actually not that bad. Except for 2 scenes in which one can't distinguish anything due to the motion blur (but I didn't expect it to be flawless, anyway), it is quite enjoyable (it is one of the few things that kept me from throwing the movie in the trashcan). However, the acting is, in most parts, so visibly fake in a completely senseless way, that it is annoying.<br/><br/>I fail to see what people see in this movie... it is simply a BAD movie. And to compare it to war/conflict movies, even with the Rambo series (which has been awarded numerous razzies over the years) is an insult to cinematography and to the public.<br/><br/>If this is the best war movie that the cinema industry can offer, I'm not impressed. And shame on all ""professional critics"" who have sucked up to the obvious feminist statement of this movie's release."

The other takes the same gun on the same place and STAYS here for hours. This is very bad decision of course! The ridge is on the east, the house is on the west. You stay on the ridge until the sunset - sun shines directly into you face which means you cannot see anything but the insurgents must see reflection of your scope lens very clearly. This is very strange. In another scene you see team of three pyrotechnics searching building which has only recently been abandoned by insurgents - very dangerous!

","Like a latter day Ayn Rand, Bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough American hombres stuck in Iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless, relentless, child-killing Arab terrorists. As Bigelow posits the Iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama, one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty, hot, ugly rubble that is Iraq, and a new hero is born.<br/><br/>The new guy is what John Hershey described in his book, and later the movie, The War Lover, as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life, and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires. The war lover can only fully function in war, peacetime suffocates him. While Hershey chastised the war lover, (played in the film by Steve McQueen in one of his greatest roles) Bigelow glorifies him. The army needs war lovers, they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies. We can't handle the truth, that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers, the toughest men. According to the unironic Bigelow, regular men are pussies, the war lover is a special breed, the last of the cowboys. So what if he wants to bare-back his men, or fondle an Iraqi boy? He is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war. In war, sex is a thankless, loveless, don't-ask, don't-tell kind of male bonding. Bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism. Only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong, between American innocence and Arab perfidy. Bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism. She's just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.<br/><br/>On the political front, Bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again, ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier, which happens to be some one else's country. (""You can shoot people here"" says a soldier ); the tough but human black guy companion, the soldier with a premonition of death, the gruff, possibly crazy commanding officer, the college-educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy. You name it, Bigelow resurrects it.<br/><br/>The man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute Arab boy who befriends the war lover, but Bigelow plays it straight; she doesn't consummate the sex, just sanitizes it. What Bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly, sneering face of the Arab enemy. Any Iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented, hostile or up to no good, anyway. They all deserve to die for their impudence, and many of them do in this glib gore-fest film. The Iraqi women are all hysterical, they only make their presence known by screaming. They could be male stunt men in drag for all I know, you never see their faces. There is no female presence at all on base or in battle, although female casualty rates in Iraq would certainly disprove this.<br/><br/>Bigelow goes through all the motions one by one. She glorifies war, she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero. The cowboys, surrounded by the subhuman Indians, prove their mettle by doing God's work and subduing the wretched terrorist-infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania. Toward the end, I felt like rooting for the Indians. In Bigelow's world, though, no mercy or understanding ever makes it through. The Iraqis are dehumanized par excellence. The slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle. Every U.S, bullet finds its mark. You have to love the guy, the war lover. It's just his way, he is the true hero. He's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way, and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side."
"treborcracker","3","71","114","25 January 2010"," This movie was amateur and terrible and doesn't deserve the hype.
","When i first read about the hurt locker and seen the reviews it was getting, i was excited to see it. I have seen enough movies to know what ones are good and bad, and the Hurt locker was clearly bad. I don't understand why its getting such good reviews and being nominated for golden globes and other awards. I even watched it twice to make sure that i wasn't just imagining things, this movie is getting a free pass and does not deserve it. I originally gave this film a 6/10 but changed it to a 3/10 because the reviews have bugged me so much. The Hurt locker is so far fetched and is not realistic, There are so many flaws in the movie that it just gets dumb. The acting in it was not that demanding for the actors and they still couldn't pull it off (Jeremy Renner being nominated for best actor!!!!????!!!). The cinematography was amateur, I didn't care for the shaky cam at all, the slow mo explosion scene at the beginning that they felt to show like ten times from different angles looked right out of a lame 80's movie. I think while you are watching a good movie you should care about what happens to the characters, but in this, they could have killed off all the main characters and replaced them 3 quarters of the way through the movie and i wouldn't have cared at all. The movie feels a lot longer then it is because its so boring and makes you wanna leave or turn it off. and what a douche name for such a bad movie- The hurt locker, it doesn't deserve such an intense name. Whats with the 3 man EOD Rambo team that does everything, They were sniping, clearing buildings, going off in the middle of the night by themselves without permission and fighting their own war, while in the process shoot their own guy by accident and don't get in any trouble for that. There are several things in the movie that the army and especially EOD's just don't do. The sniping scene was ridiculous especially considering EOD's aren't trained as snipers, first off why are they out in the middle of the dessert unescorted, but then they sit there looking at this building after they shot the guy, for hours, like what are they doing??. Another scene when they get called in, there's a bomb in a car, and some Iraqi shoots the gas tank and the vehicle ignites, now first off i am pretty sure they proved on Myth-busters that you cant blow up a gas tank by shooting it, and why didn't the Iraqi shoot at the actual soldiers, and why didn't the car being fully engulfed in flames set off the bombs inside of it, and why did they put it out with fire extinguishers knowing that it was full of bombs. And what was with Jerremy Renner and that Iraqi kid, and him getting revenge for the kids death by going into Baghdad in the middle of the night and breaking in to someones house, changes his mind or something then walks back to the base and of course doesn't get into any trouble at all. I didn't care for any of the characters, Jeremy Renners was supposed to be like a weird adrenaline junkie who got a thrill out of disarming bombs(???) and what was with that annoying wuss that was on their squad. this movie felt like a amateur-right out of film and acting school movie. Its funny cause i didn't even mind this movie that much when I first seen it, but seeing all the hype and all the stupid reviews its been getting, its been pissing me off more and more, so it feels good to write all this. There are so many better movies than this that didn't get the hype or the reviews this ones getting, this is an insult to the film industry and to all the great film makers who actually deserve it. By the way I am not in the army and i am only seventeen but it doesn't take a soldier or a major film buff to notice all the flaws that were in it. And to all the people that gave this film good reviews, F-you, and go watch more movies cause you don't know what your talking about-Gripping and ground breaking...F-that. LOL its to bad you can't use bad language in these reviews cause my original copy of this review had a bunch in it."

","I don't understand all the praise being laid upon this movie. Even as a non-military person, I could tell that the scenes were just ridiculous, and that seriously detracted from my enjoyment. I was certainly gripping my chair in certain scenes (opening scene particularly) but then when the EOD team of three starts acting like they are the only ones in Iraq, that's when I started losing interest. And looking at my watch. Its unfortunate because I think they could have had a good movie here, maybe you remove three or four of the scenes, or at the very least, don't make the EOD team do everything BY THEMSELVES. I saw Avatar and loved it despite the plot. I think Hurt Locker, if it wins the Oscar, will cement 2009 as the worst year for movies ever, or at least since ""Crash"" or ""Shakespeare in Love"" won Oscars."

","I had no problem with the acting, and the directing was fine. My issue is with the editing and/or the screenplay.<br/><br/>The scenes appear random and often have no context. The 05, played by David Morse, comes on as hooah (look it up), and then doesn't appear in the movie again. It was almost as if they had paid a great deal of money for his acting and needed to use something with him in it to justify it (and maybe get a screen credit for him). The entire set of shots related to locating the boy (kidnapping, professor's house, running the streets, main gate) were useless. It was 5 minutes of my life that I'll never get back and it resulted in no added value to the movie. What happened to the child that had the body bomb? There could have been a lot better use of time in the movie to show the disparity of civilian life vs. the adrenaline of war, but 30 seconds in a cereal aisle doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for a lot of things (I still love Willie Wonka), but to believe that EOD can pick up a .50 cal rifle and operate as a sniper team...I'd rather believe that little men make chocolate (the snosberries don't always taste like snosberries). I'll forgive the uniform issues, but in the end, there were just too many things for me to forgive. I found myself wanting Samuel L. Jackson or Tommy Lee Jones to pop up and take the movie somewhere I could lay my disbelief for a little while.<br/><br/>I've read in some reviews that this is the best war movie in many, many years. If that's so we're in a lot of trouble. I've walked out of only 2 movies - Break Dancing and some other movie that was so bad I can't even remember the title.

","I was eager to see this movie even before the Oscar's, but never found the time to do so until last night, when I saw it on Blu-ray. This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment ever! The plot is twisted, but not in a smart way, just in a pointless way. The characters are dull and shallow, as are the dialogs between them. The cinematography, while probably the most attractive feature of the film, is hardly groundbreaking or innovative in its intensity. The movie, supposedly so close to reality in Iraq, is riddled with factual errors and inconsistencies, which make it completely detached from the reality it purportedly portrays (please refer to goofs here on IMDb). All in all, I cannot fathom why anyone would nominate this for the Academy Awards, let alone actually award 6 of them. It's probably one of those instances when Hollywood attempts to be political, and the only reason the 'Hurt Locker' got any awards is because it is the first majorly distributed film portraying the ""dark-sides"" of the War in Iraq since Obama took office...Personally, I found Chicken Little more suspenseful.."
"chunga95","9","31","46","16 January 2010"," Surprisingly good... but not to the level of critical acclaim.
","'The Hurt Locker' surprised me on many levels. In many regards it has all the trappings of the conventional war movie: soldiers' daily grind, explosions and gun violence, gritty realism and tragedy. What sets this movie apart is the characters.<br/><br/>Moreso than any other war film I've watched, I felt like this was more of a character study first and a war movie second. Jeremy Renner expertly plays SSgt. James, a replacement EOD team leader deployed to Iraq. His brazen style immediately clashes with the other two regular members of the team, Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldrige (Brian Gerarghty). As they anticipate their unit's rotation back home, tensions rise as they have to continue to perform their ordinance detonation duties.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Renner's character. SSgt. James is a moral, caring, and thoughtful leader. But, his thirst for action pushes Sanborn and Eldrige out of their comfort zones. EOD is dangerous enough, and James' antics test their resolve and grit. Where the movie separates itself from other war movie is this: the action serves the character, as opposed to characters thrown into action. Each mission reveals new dimensions about our heroes, their fears and ambitions, what they are trying to preserve and protect. The dialog and the actors' portrayal felt very organic to me. These are real people having real conversations, in realistic situations, trying to operate rationally and compassionately in the most illogical and irrational of circumstances.<br/><br/>There are no preachy political overtones or lessons on the morality of war. There really is no villain, except a faceless, formless enemy. There is nothing except the next mission and trying to survive it. The documentary style cinematography and gritty locations are great. I felt like I was in the Humvee many times, in modern Iraq, privileged to conversations and emotions rarely shared except in dire circumstances.<br/><br/>That said, I don't know if this movie is as good as it's being reviewed. It is an excellent film. If you're a fan of war movies this certainly is a don't miss. It's thrilling, wonderfully filmed, and the acting is great, if understated. Still, there's something missing that keeps this movie from being a top-echelon flick. In the end, though, this is an engrossing and entertaining movie that should not be missed!"
"ArasimusX","9","31","46","12 August 2009"," The best modern war movie in my opinion...
","Let's get the highlights out of the way first <br/><br/>Pros: - Great premise - Authentic atmosphere/locations - Great Tension - Good Acting - Best modern war movie to date <br/><br/>Cons: - Forgivable unlikely scenarios<br/><br/>OK now some people may disagree with me but out of the modern war movies, this one has the least political agenda of them all. Having said that I could enjoy the movie's true grit without rolling my eyes about some strong pro/con message about the Iraqi war. One of the movie's best attributes is how it maintains a certain degree of tension the entire time; basically your thinking anyone can die at any moment. Even when a bomb is disarmed the mood encourages you to think that the situation still isn't entirely safe. Another great attribute that isn't normally mentioned is the dynamic between the 3 men in the bomb unit. Sergeant James did not fear war or death at all; in fact, he treats most situations with an uncaring attitude. Sanborn hid his fear by being professional and operating by the book. Finally specialist Eldridge showed his fear by being unsure about everything and basically thinking he's dead already. Overall this movie is great. By default, I liked it because—like Public Enemies and hopefully like District 9—this movie is very original unlike most movies these days. Secondly, I liked it because it created a great modern war atmosphere without over-the-top special effects or graphic violence. In conclusion, I'd defiantly say this is the best movie I've seen in 09. <br/><br/>-AX"

","By far one of the greatest ever war movies and one of the greatest movies of the decade. ""The Hurt Locker"" perfectly demonstrates the brutality of war but also highlights the sensitivity in soldiers, people who don't know each other coming closer in order to survive in the unbearable circumstances of war. This film makes people who have never experienced war to realize that is not just shooting whoever you find in front of you, it makes us see the importance of each soldier individually and to respect their contribution and their sacrifices in order to fight for their country, I am not americanized I talk for both sides and for any side that is at war, all those soldiers are humans and have families but due to their patriotism and because others sent them there they have to kill in order to survive. I am young and have never experienced war however this movie made me feel part of it, I sympathized with every single person in there, ""The Hurt Locker"" is much more than a movie, it's reality, good family men suffer, either us soldiers or us innocent victims, women die, children die and it is not just killing people of the other side, we see Becham, a young child that does nothing bad, he sells dvds and wants to kick a ball however he is used by his own people us a human bomb. This movie is not to be seen us just another long film but as a lesson of life. The acting is great as the actors in many cases spoil there image just to give a message.

","I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded. Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts, but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors put in a good effort, but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not as action packed as...well, anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much, nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions.

"jaredmobarak","9","55","87","30 June 2009"," Spoken like a true wild man ... The Hurt Locker
","I was always under the impression that it would be another liberal propaganda-driven message movie like all the others coming out recently. To my great surprise, it was not. Rather than use the war to tell people already against it to protest, Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal decide to use Iraq purely as a backdrop to the real subject matter at hand—war itself. Plain and simple, war is hell, but it is also a drug each soldier feeds on, an adrenaline rush that makes him wake every morning to see what may happen. We are thrown into the action as Bravo Company's bomb team has just 38 days left in rotation. Let's just say the day doesn't end well and the final month has its ups and downs showing the world what is going on over there—the pressure, the friendships, the duty, and the loss.<br/><br/>The authenticity is astounding throughout. I know people will gripe about the shaky camera style, but that lends itself to the realism and puts you into the action of this bomb squad under the cowboy antics of leader William James, played by Jeremy Renner. He is a recent addition, replacing the team's last technician after a tragic accident involving a bomb and an Iraqi cell phone. It would appear that he has a death wish, going into situations without recon and letting his emotions get the better of him every step of the way. He does have a girlfriend and son back home, though, and the compassion a father has comes out at times, especially when dealing with a young Middle Eastern boy named Beckham selling DVDs and playing soccer. James uses his sense of humor strangely, telling people he'll chop their heads off or some other such nonsense with a straight face before smiling, saying he's just kidding, and rubbing their head. His carefree attitude may seem cavalier, but by the end of the film we will realize what makes him tick. He is doing this for his country, filling a job in high demand with the US army, a job he's damn good at.<br/><br/>The other two members of his team don't necessarily share his laidback demeanor. As another soldier says later on in the film, this team is wired tight. Anthony Mackie's JT Sanborn is a by-the-books guy, holding the safety of his men above all else. He is willing to have a good time and can drink, punch, and joke with the best of them, but when it comes to a live bomb out in the middle of a street, he wants you with your radio on, listening to what he has to say. When a surrounding area has been evacuated and he asks James to pull back, letting the engineers take over, he wants to be listened to. Renner's technician is not that kind of guy, though. He sees a puzzle and he wants to solve it, almost admiring the bomb creator whose work he is dismantling. Unafraid to give his Sergeant the finger and continue with his work, headphones and bomb suit off—Specialist Eldridge right next to him in the blast zone being told to fall back by Sanborn but having to stay since James is the commanding officer—he lives for the excitement at the edge of life and death.<br/><br/>As for Eldridge, played by Brian Geraghty, who is used to the desert having been in Jarhead, he is a young novice on the team, never having seen a dead body, never having been in a firefight, and yet here he is putting himself in the way of active bombs that could blow him to pieces. A boy that isn't quite able to shake the fear of death, nor the thought that being in Iraq means he already is dead, Eldridge is visited often by a Colonel, who is also a psychiatrist of some sort, helping him through the war. Their relationship ends with devastating effect that resonates from Geraghty's performance despite being an obvious result when watching the sequence leading up to the event. It really is the performance by each of these three leads—Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty—that makes The Hurt Locker as effective a tale as it is. Eldridge may keep his demons on his sleeve throughout, but both James and Sanborn keep theirs hidden until they can no longer. Both do brilliant work at expressing the inner fears and desires, especially those dreams they aren't sure they'll ever be able to fulfill.<br/><br/>A lot of credit must be given to Bigelow for getting all the pieces together and crafting a very effective war film. It is character-driven throughout, hinging on the audience believing that these men are in life or death situations each and every day. She opens the film through the eyes of an Army bot, calling to memory the first person filming in—what is my favorite film of hers—Strange Days. And while many will label Bigelow as a man's director, doing action and testosterone-induced work, you can't deny her delicate care in expressing the human psyche. It isn't even just the fight scenes or the high-pressure anticipation of a bomb going off; no my favorite moment is when Renner goes off camp to seek revenge for something he believes occurred. He is alone, without his uniform or equipment and only a sidearm at his disposal, wandering the streets of Iraq. Just the matter in which he has to return to base shows how on edge everyone is. This isn't a video game played by faceless automatons, no, war is most definitely hell. It's being fought, win or lose, by people just like us, full of aspirations and dreams we just hope we'll live long enough to see come to fruition."
"Argemaluco","9","52","82","28 January 2010"," An excellent war film
","Despite all the acclamation poured into The Hurt Locker, I started watching it with pretty much skepticism, because I think the Irak war has already been examined in cinema from all the possible angles, not to mention that the protests against it feel increasingly tiring and irrelevant (even though they are right).However, The Hurt Locker ended up being a fascinating experience because of its innovative subject, lack of dull ideology, excellent performances and specially, because of Kathryn Bigelow's intense direction.<br/><br/>One of the things I most liked in The Hurt Locker is that it does not pretend to instruct us about the failed reasons of the incursion in Irak, or repeating oil conspiracies or complaining about the lies about the weapons of mass destruction.It is simply focused on the experience from three soldiers specialized in disabling bombs, and it leaves us to interpret the situations from our points of view.And it also shows us brilliant scenes of action and war suspense.<br/><br/>During the first seconds of The Hurt Locker, screenwriter Mark Boal establishes the message from the film: ""War is a drug"".And during the rest of the film, he shows us the effects of that addiction, making a realistic portrait of the dehumanization provoked by the uncertainty of combat, the impersonal management of the soldiers in the army and the psychological afflictions provoked by the horrible life conditions during war.But all those messages are set in the background from the movie, assimilating themselves to the spectator's point of view.On that way, the main attractions are the incredibly tense missions from the soldiers and the brilliant performances from the cast who interprets them.Jeremy Renner brings a very detailed development, which lets us see his character as a likable and competent man, but who is truly devastated in his soul.Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also excellent, since they completely become on their characters.By the way, the marketing from The Hurt Locker emphasizes the presence in the cast from Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and Evangeline Lilly, but their roles are so short that they could be considered as cameos.I understand that strategy, because the main actors from this film are relatively unknown, and in order to raise the profile from this movie, they hired famous names; however that could disappoint the spectators who expect to see Fiennes or Pearce as the centre of attention, when reality is very different.But really...the performances from Renner, Mackie and Geraghty are so powerful that I barely noticed the stars on their fleeting appearances.<br/><br/>What takes me to the real star from this film: Bigelow.The filmography from this director includes some of my favourite movies (Near Dark, Strange Days and Point Break).However, in early 2000s, her career declined with two mediocre movies: The Weight of Water and K-19: The Widowmaker.However, after that low period in her career, Bigelow makes her return to glory with The Hurt Locker, at the same time she created precise, energetic and very exciting action scenes in this movie.However, I have to make clear that the action of The Hurt Locker is not based on massive battles, confusing shootouts or heroic displays of machismo.Compared with the excesses from directors like Michael Bay or Stephen Sommers, Bigelow's action seems slow and methodic...but it is infinitely more striking because of the emotional weight from this film.Besides, Bigelow creates an appropriate sensation of anguish on the action scenes, which perfectly shows the nightmare of being at war.<br/><br/>The only complain I have against this film is that it has a few irrelevant moments.But that does not avoid me from giving a very enthusiastic recommendation to this excellent movie, which is absolutely worthy of the acclamation it is receiving."
"alexkolokotronis","9","52","82","17 July 2009"," A Rare Occurrence of Thought Provoking Action
","Over the past three years, give or take, there have been an assortment of films that have attempted to articulate and illustrate the many complexities of the Middle East. Paticuluarly in the aspect of Western involvement in this tense region. The Hurt Locker is that: tense and at times nerve racking.<br/><br/>The generation of such sensations and feelings of anxiousness and distress should be much accredited to Kathryn Bigelow, the director. Yet the reason for her success which of course is her direction, is quite unorthodox. The most tense and debilitating moments are done so in slow pacing and seemingly tranquil moments rather then rushing into rapid action and quick camera-shots. The screenwriter of the film, Mark Boal continues to rise with The Hurt Locker as only his second screenplay, the other being In the Valley of Elah. The two combined together create not just greatly done action sequences but ultimately thought provoking ones.<br/><br/>The performances as well were quite convincing from almost seemingly upcoming stars in Jeremy Renner, Brian Geraghty and almost certainly Anthony Mackie considering his powerful résumé. There are also greatly meaningful quintessential cameos from such well accomplished actors such as Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Films on this subject have tried focusing on very focused and specific aspects of this plight and find themselves wandering off into unnecessary and confusing aspects of the story. Others have attempted to assess the situation broadly but with doing so, most often make the mistake of presenting the different facets in a much too mundane or simplified fashion. With this it is obvious very few films have succeeded in presenting a thorough, accurate and sensible look at this tense region. The Hurt Locker creates a tension that I last felt from Apocalypse Now. I'm certainly not saying the film is of the status of Apocalypse Now but I certainly advise to watch at the least a very good war film."

","I joined this site specifically to comment on the scene in this film which showed SAS soldiers acting like raw recruits when confronted by a sniper, whereas a US bomb detonation squad dealt with the situation as if they themselves were elite forces. How a movie containing a ridiculously conceived scene like this can win any Oscars is beyond me. Would a bomb detonation squad in the US have a sniper masquerading as a bomb disposal squad member? Also why do they take all day watching the insurgents hideout? Can you imagine this happening in World War 2 for example, the war would have been lost if the Allies had approached every battleground with this kind of nonsensical caution. There are many other questionable scenes in this film and I don't understand how anybody with a modicum of intelligence would vote for it to receive any sort of prestigious award."

"comco-1","1","32","48","7 June 2010"," dull, incredible military fantasy
","With all of the drama and suspense that the Iraq War has produced, it is difficult to understand why the producers paid for a fantastic script such as the one used in this film. Beginning with the arrival of the maverick member of the bomb squad, the mood is set for an individual who does not want to play by the Army rules. The film goes downhill from there. None of the military engagements made any sense, neither military sense nor common sense. Following the first attempt at suspense, the main character (Sergeant William James - played unconvincingly by Jeremy Renner) removes his protective clothing saying ""If I am going to die, I might as well be comfortable."" He then removes his communication equipment. Afterwards, he was punched in the face by the platoon leader who rebukes him saying ""Never take off yours ears again."" Sgt. James just takes the punch neither saying nor doing anything. The scene where Sgt. James calls his wife, but says nothing, was difficult to understand, and the wife asks ""Hello?"" four, well-spaced times. The military confrontation that occurred after they encountered a British patrol was the best part of the film, although their poor marksmanship was hard to believe. The enemy only fired four shots, each of which killed someone. The idea that the tire wrench was ruined trying to change the tire, and the same thing happened with the second tire iron, and that the US patrol had another tire iron, should have been eliminated. The idea that three soldiers would undertake an unauthorized pursuit at night was incredible. The technique of scanning the surroundings, and showing how the locals watched the events was effective, and clearly demonstrated the terror of guerrilla warfare. In spite of the inconsistencies, poor acting and improbable scenes, this film was awarded six Oscars. Who would have guessed?"
"dognotbarking","1","18","25","11 November 2011"," Like we never saw an Oscar winning film
","I am sorry, but I think that this movie is made and being awarded with Oscars only because it glorifies something that should not be glorified. I feel sorry for the soldiers dying in vain while they are still teenagers, and everyone should feel the same way. What this film tries to accomplish is not really clear. It is clearly not a critic about war, because if it is then the message is too weak. Besides, how do you expect the audience to see war from a critical angle if you portray every American soldier as pure absolute angels. If you are against war, do something like Full Metal Jacket, then you can really deserve an Oscar. If this is about one man going slowly crazy, hmmm...it does not work. Sorry. You can not just expect people to identify with a soldier just because you made him play some football with a local kid. So what is left is the possibility that this film is a totally populist production, made because you know very well that it is going to work, this is the weak spot of every American. This is a perfect example of the discourse we all heard thousands of times: American Soldiers are there to protect freedom, they are fighting for us and dying for us. So let us applause them. So they can die in peace. Every Iraqi is a potential threat but again, as we are so awesome, we play with Iraqi kids and risk our own lives not to shoot one Iraqi guy. <br/><br/>Come on guys!!!Who believes that? This is really a propaganda film for the world and the Americans. On top of it, 6 Oscars? It is like we haven't seen any Oscar winning films before. Back in time; Oscars meant something. Now they are-it seems-become the propaganda machine for war industry. What a shame"

This reminded me of Black Hawk Down in feel and I actually enjoyed the tension of the earlier movie better.<br/><br/>I have to say, this looks like a typical Oscar political win, because they needed to give a female director the nod this year - it's like the year that Halle Berry, Denzel Washington and Sidney Poitier all got awards! A lot of people were up in arms because Avatar did not win best film, but I thought that District 9 and Inglorious Basterds were both better films than this rather pedestrian war flick."

Platoon?!? Really?? Like Werner Herzog is to a good story teller as Rescue Dawn is to a true story? <br/><br/>Now I need to watch The Hurt Locker again, but, besides knowing the base they're stationed at is legit, I'm hard-pressed to offer examples that Bigelow makes much serious determination, if at all, to suggest this film's location at being in Iraq...simply an area of the Middle East...She didn't play with us like that; this could have been Afghanistan or in any of the other countries we might soon be at risk.<br/><br/>Second off, but now I'd like to exchange paragraphs, I have the utmost respect for what American men and women do to protect this country and others'. I can only imagine how your mind rambles. And I can understand the criticism of The Hurt Locker sometimes totally lacking authenticity. <br/><br/>I quickly need to add though that this movie had me, like so many others, on the edge of my seat, tears in my eyes, with nothing but deepened adoration for the sacrifices others make for those of us typing away in front of a computer screen.<br/><br/>Bigelow completely and blatantly dramatized actual situations with Hollywood shenanigans but made no attempt at hiding this fact. She did so in a manner that left the majority, like me, speechless, but those with the real experience upset.<br/><br/>Stop stressing. We all, for the most part, know better, and knew better going into the flick. We know that you aren't all looking to throw your personal lives away for an adrenaline rush. This movie did not muddy my thoughts on any of that.<br/><br/>Bigelow directed such a fantastic Hollywood screenplay that forced countless hearts to beat waaay too fast for almost all the right reasons. I know, I hear ya, why would he and how could he have done what he did in the middle of the night to run through the streets of Iraq...in the middle of the night...without an interruption? Check. Got it. What rating would you give Die-Hard just outta curiosity? Let's not compare oranges to ""Army Wives?""<br/><br/>She was phenomenal at making us feel why many soldiers for many reasons feel the range of emotions that they do. And she did so without vomiting narrative. She did so by providing circumstances that felt too real and far too livable. Bigelow took Boal's well-crafted script and drove it with near perfection, allowing us a long but smooth ride. Jeremy Renner's performance left me not contemplating another ""3 Kings"" thrill-seeker, but of one with a severely conflicted inner-self where the Kill Zone is his only constant, his comfort zone.<br/><br/>Bigelow might win It for a ratings success, but still deservedly so.<br/><br/>Kudos<br/><br/>Time for another early morning movie..."
"movieguysla","10","54","86","5 October 2009"," War is a Drug
","""War is a drug"" are words among the first to appear on screen in Kathryn Bigelow's extraordinary new film, ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>DRUG (n): An often illegal and sometimes addictive substance that causes changes in behavior and perception and is taken for the effects.<br/><br/>The main character in ""The Hurt Locker"", Staff Sgt. William James, a bomb diffuser, enters the story after his team's previous bomb specialist dies in action. Death in the line of duty doesn't deter Sgt. James. War for him is addictive, and he participates for the effects (I'll leave it up to you as to whether you think the war is ""illegal"". Even the film shies away from political grandstanding).<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is about Sgt. James and the team assigned to protect him and work alongside him as they scour Iraq for IEDs and other hidden explosives. Documentarian Ken Burns, in creating his recent series ""The War"", mentioned once that a big difference he found between the World Wars of the early 20th century, and the current war in Iraq is the mission. In World War II, soldiers fought for the cause – fight off Japanese oppression, end Nazi occupation, etc. Today, in an era when the overall mission can be unclear, soldiers fight for the man or woman next to them on the front line. In the case of ""The Hurt Locker"", that leads to a very complicated and sticky relationship.<br/><br/>Routinely under-heralded Anthony Mackie plays Sgt. Sanborn, head of the team that goes into the most dangerous zones of the war to uncover and diffuse bombs hidden in the ground, in the walls, in cars, nearly everywhere. Sanborn is counting the days until he leaves the desert, certainly a different mindset than war-addicted Sgt. James., yet it's clear that he and Sgt. James would die for each other. That male bond is brought vividly to life by director Bigelow. She doesn't employ tricky effects like David O. Russell did with his brilliant but different ""Three Kings"", her direction is more drenched in reality, one I would never want real for me. Jeremy Renner plays Sgt. James with a fiery deliberateness, and he referred to Bigelow's direction as that of ""a voyeur"". This is a great asset to the film. The movie has top-notch production value, but never announces it. Instead, we get a very credible relationship drama about people under intense pressure.<br/><br/>The film was written by Mark Boal, who wrote the great and very underrated ""In The Valley of Elah"", also about the Iraq War. That movie (and other Iraq-themed films) tanked, but I'm glad Boal remained undeterred and continued to write about the war. It's paid off, as ""The Hurt Locker"" is a money-maker, and is destined for Academy Award consideration. An acting teacher of mine often praises work in class when the relationship is ""complicated"". Too cut and dry, too easily-explained, and we're bored. Boal nails the complicated world of an Iraq soldier, who balances grief, fear, anger and exhilaration on a daily basis. They make life and death choices for themselves and others over and over again. ""The Hurt Locker"" is the first film to really portray Iraq as the most dangerous place in the world. Nearly everyone these soldiers come across could be guilty of planting bombs. Is it because they hate Americans? Is it because they are tired of Americans in their country? Do our soldiers belong in harm's way? Are they keeping peace? The end resultis complicated.<br/><br/>SPOILER TALK: How great is it to see Ralph Fiennes in the middle of all this? Then he gets offed. Same with Guy Pearce, as if to say, ""Yeah, we're an indie film. We don't need no stinking movie stars!"". The scenes near the end of the film are a true masterstroke for Boal and Bigelow. Sgt. James returns home and slides right back into cushy family duties like cleaning storm drains and shopping at a horribly bland grocery store bathed in bright light. I suppose we take those situations for granted as being safe and most likely we are happy to do them. Drumming out our little existence in our little corner of Earth is the goal of most people. But, damn, if ""The Hurt Locker"" didn't make normal life seem DULL."

"Tender-Flesh","9","30","45","14 August 2009"," Pulls all the right pins
","First of all, let me say how disappointed I am that hardly any theaters are showing this wonderful film. While almost every chain in town has two or three theaters for multiple showings of GI Joe, The Hurt Locker is a movie you practically have to hunt down to find. And, in this case, I'm glad I hunted it down. The last time I had to search all the theaters for a film, it was House of 1000 Corpses, a stinker to be sure, and that only made sense as to why so few theaters chose to carry the film. But in the case of The Hurt Locker, well, I'm sort of at a loss for the reasoning behind its lack of publicity.<br/><br/>This film will blow your doors off. While it's probably not an action-packed braindead bit of fluff like GI Joe, there are some fine action sequences that are more low-scale. Oh, yes, there are explosions, firefights, and some 50 caliber action, but it's not rammed into your eye sockets like so much of the usual popcorn fare these days. This flick delivers the goods on multiple levels. It's a war film with no war, just small skirmishes. This is why it's so intense. You don't have your usual enemy soldier. You have everyday people mixed in with bloodthirsty killers who are skilled at not only creating deadly roadside bombs, you also have secondary devices set to create as much collateral damage as possible. The acting is realistic. No one is trying to be the biggest badass out there--although James will make you wish all soldiers were as awesome as him. The direction is taut, the guerrilla cinematography goes for the jugular.<br/><br/>This is a good example of a pro-American war movie that doesn't ram a flag into your face every five seconds. It's about guys who are doing one of the scariest jobs in the military and what's more, they volunteer for it. You have two groups of people: one group that will go the distance for an ideal even if it means sacrificing themselves and those around them, including children, and then there is the other group, who also are willing to sacrifice themselves, but they are dedicated to saving lives of people who they will never meet and in most cases people who hate them even though they are saving lives instead of taking them. Granted, yes, it is ""just a movie"" but it certainly gives you more to think about than the usual Hollywooden films we normally get stuck with. You see the tension between fellow soldiers(some of it bordering on murder plots) and the sort of psychological breakdown that probably is not only all too common but also gravely undertreated by soldiers returning home.<br/><br/>Hats off to the brave soldiers who do this sort of job every day. I'd have stomach cancer inside of two weeks if I was in their boots."
"Faceless_Moon","9","30","45","7 August 2009"," Bigelow, Renner and cast deliver one of the best war movies in recent memory
","On paper, it doesn't see difficult to make a war movie these days; Iraq and other recent wars give filmmakers plenty of material to work with, in terms of both action and commentary.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow doesn't only deliver on both thrilling, adrenaline pumping action and insight into the effects of war on soldiers, though she does both of these things almost flawlessly. She gives us the best movie made about the Iraq war thus far, possibly one of the best ever. Thinking about it, the only war movies I can unequivocally place above The Hurt Locker are Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. Others require further deliberation.<br/><br/>She does this two ways. First is the action: from start to finish, this is one of the most intense, thrilling movies I have seen. That doesn't simply mean huge explosions and gory deaths, in fact, there aren't even that many of those.<br/><br/>The excitement lies in the situations; there are so many things happening at once in the missions Bravo Company undertakes, and so much at stake, that you can't help but truly be thrilled and captivated by it.<br/><br/>The second way is the superb casting. Jeremy Renner, of course, as the seemingly reckless bomb tech, is the star here. His performance is breathtaking, and in my opinion any actor who can make you uncertain whether you like them/agree with what they're doing is really good. Oscar worthy performance? Maybe. But I wouldn't count on it. Regardless, this is the role that's going to make people notice him.<br/><br/>But Renner doesn't steal the show. Anthony Mackie also delivers a flawless performance and is somebody you root for no matter what is happening. However, without hopefully giving anything away, his character also has several moments just like Renner that makes you go ""man, I can't believe he's doing this"" that, in a way, makes him just as ambiguous of a character as Renner's. His and Renner's relationship and the contrast in their personalities and approach to war is in a way the focal point of the movie.<br/><br/>Renner is getting all the buzz but Mackie is also really, really good in this, and I hope he is not overlooked, because he is simply a terrific actor, displaying great range in this and deserves more roles.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast (with one exception I describe below) is also good, but not as solid as Renner and Mackie. Geraghty's fine for his role. The supporting cast is great, with Maracho, Morse, Fiennes and Pearce all delivering good performances, Maracho and Pearce especially. They're all really minor though in comparison to the three leads My only qualm with the film is, after all the seemingly split-second action throughout the movie, it somehow drags towards end! This part is completely unnecessary and simply shows what we already knew had to happen based on the rest of the movie. It seems an excuse to give my one disappointment in the cast, Evangeline Lilly, some screen time just because she's hot.<br/><br/>Overall, though, The Hurt Locker simply needs to be seen.

"jmanchak6","3","24","35","4 April 2010"," ""The Hurt Locker"" with emphasis on ""HURT""
","I was watching the Oscars, and I thought ""WOW"" because AVATAR didn't win best picture. I honestly thought that it would be a clean sweep for AVATAR, it would win pretty much everything that it was nominated for. AVATAR was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, it won three. This film was also nominated for 9 Academy Awards, it won six, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won for writing, sound, editing and sound editing. I watched it with high hopes that it would truly be the best film of the year. I was disappointed to say the least. I wondered how it won those Oscars. So lets analyze this.<br/><br/>Writing- There was no clear line from point A to point B. It was simply a series of events in combat. That COULD'VE worked, but it didn't. The character depth was shallow and they were very unlikable. Plus, it had a pretty stupid and pointless ending.<br/><br/>Sound & Sound Editing- I don't fully understand the categories, but I guess it sounded alright.<br/><br/>Editing- It was alright, but it shouldn't have won.<br/><br/>Direction- Are you kidding me? How was this the best directed? Do you think that the Academy just didn't want to be sexist, and give the Oscar to a woman? Maybe. Kathryn Bigelow is a good director, but she wasn't the best director. The Queasy-Cam was seizure inducing, and I get that she was trying to give a real war-like feel, but it just didn't work for me. It was basically shot in second person.<br/><br/>Picture- Now I haven't seen Precious, A Serious Man, and An Education, but i've seen the other nominated films, and they were all superior to this film. Up, Up in the Air, Inglourious Basterds, The Blind Side, and District 9. Even though AVATAR was just a piece of eye-candy, it was still WAY better than this.<br/><br/>It was also nominated for Best Actor, Jeremy Renner, who I can honestly say did a pretty bad performance. Not Razzie worthy, but not Oscar worthy either. Cinematography (refer back to Queasy-Cam) and the music, both nominated, were awful. There was actually no music that comes to mind.<br/><br/>Either way, don't believe the hype. Roger Ebert's 4 star rating, RT's 97% fresh rating, IMDb's 7.9 rating, and the best picture win doesn't mean anything. For anyone who calls it a redefining of the action genre, there is no action in this. Go watch T2, True Lies, Die Hard, and all of the Indiana Jones flicks so you can immerse yourself in REAL action.<br/><br/>The final word: I would give it a 6 or 7, but the fact that it is HUGELY overrated makes me deduct points. 3/10. Go watch it, get disappointed, then watch a real action movie."
"JimD73","9","27","40","21 January 2010"," An excellent example of how to make a non-political Iraq War film
","My advice is to see the movie and not read the review if you were planning on seeing it anyways.<br/><br/>Movies based on current events can be a strange breed. They're often preachy and always biased. However, they often get good reviews regardless, so I wasn't putting too much stock into the amazing reviews for The Hurt Locker. I remember when I saw 500 Days of Summer, I had the choice of seeing this instead. Both were only playing in the one theater in Toronto at the time, and it turns out they are both two of the best movies of the year hands down.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker defies expectations and, instead of being about the war, is a character study. The movie has zero poltical stance. It portrays the bombers as monsters and many other Iraqis as sympathetic. If it had been about the bombers, it would have probably found some sympathy, but this isn't their story.<br/><br/>This is the story of Staff Seargent William James, assigned to a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, replacing their recently blown-up teammate. James is reckless, which pisses off his teammates whose lives are put in danger. This is made explicitly clear during his first job, where he holds up a speeding taxi (and bomber suspect) with a pistol.<br/><br/>James is a static character, and while he learns over the course of the film, he doesn't change per se. The initially unsensible character simply becomes more and more clear to the audience over time. In fact, I would bet his actions early in the film would seem quite natural if seen a second time having gotten to know the character. Renner's performance is absolutely excellent and completely believable and the most realistic and complex badass to cross the screen as of late.<br/><br/>The movie also focuses on his teammates, who do evolve over the course of the film. Veteran soldier Sanborn is the straight man of the film, and at first appears to be the main character. We sympathize with his troubles with James and his position of responsibility. The other member of the squad is Eldridge, representing those who really don't want to be in Iraq. He's not a pansy, but he panics and desperately wants to go home. Both of these characters serve as foils to James, and as such are often sidelined, but nonetheless add to the film.<br/><br/>Aside from those three, few characters are expanded upon. Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes are excellent in small roles, the latter as perhaps the closest the movie comes to commentary, singling the issue of military contractors. Lost's Evangeline Lilly and House's David Morse also make cameos.<br/><br/>While not an action movie, The Hurt Locker is chock full of tension. The situations that James puts himself into are pulse-pounding and the outcome never seems certain. There's a sniper battle which is excellently filmed (one odd slow-down shot aside), although some parts of it make little sense (notably the accuracy of the enemy sniper). I've also heard some complaints from people who know their stuff about realism, but these are moot to the average film viewer. This is one of the most suspenseful movies of the year hands down, and whether realistic or not, it certainly FEELS realistic.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is an excellent movie that only gets better the more I think about it. A great character portrayed with a clearly Oscar-worthy performance with ridiculous amounts of tension add up to make The Hurt Locker one of the best war movies of the decade and proof that contemporary war movies can work without being political.<br/><br/>War is a drug."
"WriterDave","9","44","69","28 July 2009"," Bigelow Detonates All the Right Marks
","Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the ""wild man"" team leader who has defused more than eight hundred bombs and has built his reputation on being an adrenaline junkie in order to mask his inability to cope with the emotional connections he feebly tries to make at home and on the job. Sergeant JT Sandborn (Anthony Mackie) approaches his work with a by-the-book stoicism that can't comprehend the recklessness of James. Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is highly trained but still feels overwhelmed by his morbid thoughts on war and his role in it. These are the members of the EOD Army bomb squad stationed in Baghdad in 2004, and ""The Hurt Locker"" is their story.<br/><br/>After failing to do so with the depressingly somber and serious ""In The Valley of Elah"", screenwriter Mark Boal wisely places politics and moralizing aside this time to give us an intimate look into one squad with a highly specialized job to do. Hollywood has always loved to play with the grunt's-eye-view-of-war-as-hell theme, but ""The Hurt Locker"" spins that volatile cocktail on its head and blows it up all over the screen by focusing on an elite team and proposes the notion that maybe war is a drug...for some.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow hits all the right detonators with her fascinating presentation of modern warfare in the Middle East. Bigelow hasn't really made anything memorable since her 1987 breakthrough, the cult vampire/western ""Near Dark"", but she has always managed to make interesting failures-- just take a look at her attempt to do a literary adaptation with the superficially obtuse ""The Weight of Water"". Often living under the shadow of ex-husband James Cameron or having to share the title of ""that female action director"" with Mimi Leder (until Mimi murdered her film career with the abominable ""Pay it Forward"") Bigelow, determined to finally leave her mark, displays an astounding technical prowess with ""The Hurt Locker"" that can only come from the wisdom of experience. Close-ups, slow-mo's, quick cuts and inventive plays with the camera's point-of-view are used sparingly and with pin-point precision to heighten tension. Here she shows the ""good ol' boys"" she once emulated but has now trounced that style can be used for dramatic effect but need not be excessive. Her sense of space allows us to be right there with the bomb squad as they are faced with unimaginable danger. We always know where each character is positioned in relation to the bomb, and we always find in turn our stomachs have hit the floor. Her technique is brilliant and delivers a picture that is so taut it might be the most intense experience this side of Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"". Now knowing all the moves, however, I wonder how the film will hold up on return viewing.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is not for those seeking generic thrills or anyone currently on medication for emotional problems. It gets deep down into the gritty nature of bomb defusing by offering us lessons on suicide bombers, IED's and body-bombs that will make your gut churn. There's also some fantastically rendered sniper scenarios that are used not just for a visceral jolt, but also as a way to explore character development. Soldiers are not only put in precarious situations during combat but also in their day-to-day life dealing with their own conflicted emotions on top of a moody Iraqi populace that includes people treating them as tourists and looking to make a quick buck, people looking at the carnage as a spectator sport, people suffering as innocent bystanders, and people who wish to kill the soldiers and any one else in any way possible.<br/><br/>While there are a few details one could quibble with (for instance, the title is never explained), ""The Hurt Locker"" is impossible to dismiss and sometimes hard to digest. It paints a picture of war that shows there are no politics when it comes to the daily experiences of soldiers in the field. Their everyday heroism is painted in varying shades of moral ambiguity, while their internal struggles are shown to receive no emotional closure. As in real life, the story arcs of the fictional characters seen here are left open-ended, and the possibility of redeployment looms not just as an act of cruel fate but as a conscious and determined choice."

","This is a tough one. How do I review this movie? Is it an action flick? Is it a war flick? Or is the Hurt Locker a social comment on the Iraq experience?<br/><br/>While some will claim the movie is all three of those things, I personally don't know the answer and after watching the Hurt Locker I'm quite sure neither does director Kathryn Bigelow.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a movie full of all the right intentions, a lot of competent actors, and many many camera setups. But there is not one powerful scene, not one notable performance and not a single memorable image for all its two hours of run time.<br/><br/>We follow a group of U.S. Soldiers, but it feels like they are the only group in all of Baghdad. Intentional or budgetary restraints? We roam the anarchic streets of Baghdad (which, credit to the filmmakers, actually feels like a real Arab country. And after seeing the movie, I learned they went all the way to Jordan. Bravo, as the setting actually feels authentic.) We disarm a lot of bombs and enter many uncertain doorways. While the movie aims to be exciting, I just couldn't ""suspend disbelief"" when the director is trying so hard to be realistic by shaking the camera so much. And why can't a troupe of former British SAS officers handle a handful of insurgents in an empty cinder block shed. I call shenanigans.<br/><br/>OK I understand the idea of dramatic license, but there is no way a former SAS sharpshooter is going to miss a shot, die from a window sniper half a mile away and an American G.I. will save the day taking over on the guy's Barrett .50 cal.. I'm not putting anybody down here, but I would bet most people with some sort of know will be with me in saying ""Yeah Right."" This scene is a poster child for the movie at large - like most of the movie, makes little sense and very little is rooted in any sort of reality. But the camera shakes so its oh so real! Quite frankly I laughed my butt off in the sequence.<br/><br/>Dude, she made Point Break...POINT BREAK! How could you expect any different? If you haven't figured it out by this point, Kathryn Bigelow isn't going into the books as one of the greats. From what I read, the crew shot endless setups to get a ""documentary feel."" Well as a documentary photographer I can tell you, to document something, you only really need one camera. The rest depends on vision. Something Kathryn Bigelow doesn't have.<br/><br/>The script is laughable, the characters forgettable, and the direction completely platitudinous, the only Hurt Locker is the seat you're stuck in until this turkey plays itself out."

It tells you right at the beginning. What is the first thing seen on the screen? ""War Is A Drug"" it was at the beginning of the movie because That's What It Was About! Please, take the time to watch it again and ask yourself this question. Did the film accomplish its task: of showing the audience how being addicted to the adrenaline rush the main character receives in combat affects his life? Yes it does. this was what the entire movie was about, besides the smaller subtle parts which i loved. the same theme could be applied to plenty of other professions, but the role of a soldier was chosen because the writer spent time as a reporter in Iraq.<br/><br/>So please stop complaining about how unrealistic the damn sniper scene was, and watch it for what its worth.

"jymwrite-1","10","34","52","25 April 2010"," No Climatic Scenes, No Big Plots, But Compelling Viewing
","There's no story, no heroic plot to Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker. There's no search for prisoners, no tracking of a villain, no hostages to rescue, no hill to liberate, or town to capture, or even a search for looted gold. There's not even an overarching allegory of life or war built into the theme of the movie. Despite this lack of war movie plots The Hurt Locker is still compelling with the only goal of the characters, is to stay alive.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker follows the lives of a team of EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit members, Sergeant First Class Will James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Gerahty) as they finish the last five weeks of their deployment in Iraq. Their job in Iraq is to defuse IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices) and after their first Sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed Staff Sergeant William James is assigned to the unit. Sanborn and Eldridge discover that James takes more risks in the field than their previous Sergeant and is addicted to the adrenaline surge of war which is putting them at risk. They find themselves in the position of finding out if they can live (literally) with James' approach to the job.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's direction isn't heavy handed and neither does she use a heavy hand in imparting themes or other usual theatrical devices. The Hurt Locker is a very naturalistic representation of the Iraq war zone. While it touches on aspects of war that other movies have, such as the surreal aspect of war that Apocalypse Now illustrates or the dual nature of war that's found in Platoon, she lets them exist as a natural part of the world the characters find themselves in. This low key, naturalistic approach is also evident in the actor's portrayal of their characters. There's no big emotional blow ups between them, no huge revelations of a characters' back stories to pull on your heartstrings. The film highlights just what occurs naturally from the job they're there to do. The movie also doesn't take a political stance on the war. It's neither anti-war nor pro-war. It puts the viewer in the situation with the characters and you're free to feel or have whatever reaction the events stimulate in you. Bigelow even sparingly uses a soundtrack. It's more of a tense buzzing that keeps us feeling a little uneasy, as must soldiers in the field feel.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker was written by Mark Boal who had been an embedded reporter with an OED unit in Iraq in 2004. While the story is fictionalized, many of the events shown were based on actual events Boal either witnessed or heard about from soldiers in the field.<br/><br/>Bonus Features: The Hurt Locker DVD has a small bonus feature section that includes an audio commentary that I found a bit lackluster, but I thought was more than compensated for with an image gallery section that includes a Q and A session from the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. And there is a behind the scenes documentary that I found myself wishing there was more of."

","Whoever wrote, directed, and/or produced this movie should be ashamed of themselves. There are so many major errors that I can't address them in this short review. As a soldier who daily works with Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), I can say that they have absolutely no concept of what EOD or any other military units actually do. They didn't bother to research either. This movie presents support units as ground-pounding heroes and elite units as incompetent mercenaries. The plot was all over the place. Full of propaganda and very misguided stereotypes. They did get a few things right though. The explosions are somewhat realistic, and bombs can be hidden virtually anywhere.

The U.S military industrial complex obviously held Hollywood hostage on this one.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is nothing more than a slapped-together documentary or a 90-minutes-too-long, recruitment public service announcement for the U.S. Army. The most telling, revealing moment? Probably when Sanborn decides that he wants to go back home and have a child with his wife. Wow. Nice build up with a few bombs to help nudge along that epiphany.<br/><br/>Besides the ""be all you can be"" aspect ... did I say PSA? ... the Oscar voters piled on James Cameron, sticking knives with his ex-wife's name on them in his back. Come to think of it, this was a better story line than Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>What memorable mark, if any, did James Cameron's ex leave on this film? The 850-yards apart sniper fire scene could've been lifted from CNN footage following 9/11. How can the American sniper miss by five feet and then hit a moving target from that distance?

I think there are two officers in the entire movie, both colonels: One gung-ho Rambo type, the other a genteel psychologist, who practically wears a sign on his back: ""I'm a hopeless stereotype, please martyr me somewhere in the middle of the movie."" Otherwise, I guess the Army forget to deploy any lieutenants or captains to Iraq, because the bomb squad didn't seem to be taking orders from anyone.<br/><br/>On and on it goes, one implausible situation after another.

"MetalAngel","10","39","61","11 January 2010"," Rivals ""Avatar"" as THE best film of 2009!
","""War is a drug,"" declares the caption on the opening scene of Kathryn Bigelow's masterpiece ""The Hurt Locker"", and this phrase (written by an American soldier in Iraq corresponding with the New York Times), in its four-word simplicity, summarizes perfectly and shockingly the premise behind this astounding film. Bigelow has gone beyond her trademark film ""Near End"", and has given us an even deeper and infinitely more intelligent film. Simply stated, ""The Hurt Locker"" is THE film about the Iraq war we've all been waiting for.<br/><br/>The film follows Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner, in a possible Academy Award-winning performance) who specializes in defusing bombs as he completes his mission period in Iraq, walking alongside his two specialist companions (Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) in a hostile land where everyone is an enemy and where everything might be a bomb. Unlike his fellow teammates who go about their dangerous jobs with caution and with a terrifying proximity to death, James pursues his missions with such excitement; with such charisma and with such longing that we begin to understand how the soldier who said ""war is a drug"" was right. James craves the excitement and the sense of self-importance defusing bombs gives him, and he's THE best at doing it. He's untroubled by the danger; on the contrary, that's what makes his job all the more likable. But even though at first he seems like your typical savage-boy war hero, little by little he begins unveiling a deep and shockingly poignant personality, which he doesn't express through words but through his actions and facial expressions. This is a tough guy who's battling demons within himself and who's torn between life and excitement. This is a character unlike any you've ever seen before.<br/><br/>The film paints a painful, eye-opening and crude portrait of the war on Iraq. We see children used as body bombs, honest civilians used as suicide bombers, we see people gather around the place where James is trying to defuse a bomb against the clock, the faces of women and children expectant and entertained by the violence. We see a country torn by war to its very core; we see simply humans trying to survive with no hope whatsoever and no dreams to uphold. The action sequences are driven by an unbearable tension which makes you gasp in pain; this is definitely THE most suspenseful and tense film of the year. Bigelow has demonstrated in past films that she's an expert at creating tension by submerging her characters in difficult situations and stressing their sanity; with this new film, she turns this on to a sky-high level, not only putting the characters' sanity at stake but wrecking the audience's nerves. The film is violent, but not so much as other war films, and the horror and suspense is gathered from the drama unfolding between the characters. From the first sequence to the last, we find ourselves riveted to our seats, not able to believe our eyes.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, it's fast and cuts to different scenes madly, taking in the entire environment and every single character on screen giving us a million different points of view and a sense of knowledge of the surroundings. The editing is savagely effective, and never does a scene linger too much or switches too fast- it's always precisely in tune with the emotions and the drama. The score is a cacophony of war sounds which heightens the tension even more and, like I said before, there will be moments when you'll believe you'll die from holding your breath so long. Add a pitch-perfect story written by Mark Boal (who also wrote ""In the Valley of Ellah"", another movie based on the Iraq war), and you've got yourself the best picture of the year! The film really has no flaws, and at two hours long it doesn't have a single uninvolving second. Bigelow has taken a intelligent and effective war story, added art and controversy, mixed in exorbitant levels of suspense and therefore created a true masterpiece which will be remembered among the best war films ever made. See it if you know what's good for you! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"
"dking1583","10","32","49","18 August 2009"," Movie Review: The Hurt Locker (2008)
","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a sure fire Award season contender and the most intense action movie of the summer. This is not a movie that is focused on plot or storytelling. Shot in documentary style using hand-held cameras, it is a movie that is focused on putting us in the shoes of the people at war, and that is why we care about them – because they can die at any second.<br/><br/>The movie, written from a script by Mark Boal that is loosely based on his real life experience following a bomb squad, focuses on three people that work within a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) unit disarming bombs in Iraq. Those three people, played by actors who the average moviegoer will have never heard of before, are Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).<br/><br/>All three characters have distinct personalities. It is a pleasure to witness the conflict between James and Sanborn. Renner's character is the cocky type who approaches his job of defusing bombs about as cool as you can. Sanborn, on the other hand, is a vigilant, by-the-book leader who is not too polite to share his disapproval of James' methods. Eldridge is the quiet one in the bunch. He is the nervous guy, always thinking about the possibility of death.<br/><br/>Even though three leads aren't big names, the movie does feature a variety of cameos from well-known actors such as Guy Pearce (Memento), Ralph Fiennes (The Reader), and Evangeline Lilly (ABC's Lost). The acting in the movie is top-notch, with all three leads turning in great performances. Renner gives a career-making performance in the lead role, while Mackie plays the perfect foil to his character. Watching all three of these men work together and bond over time is a joy to watch. You couldn't ask for better casting here.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that it is so effortless in getting us to care about the men involved. It realizes that the people don't have to bear their feelings to each other to gain our sympathy. Why does the character's brother have to be dead in order for us to care about if he lives or dies? Why does his father have to be a former soldier to gain our respect? Simply by putting these basically good people in life or death situations, we care for them instantly.<br/><br/>It is so refreshing to see a war film that isn't trying to send some universal message, or trying to preach to the American people. This is simply a movie about the soldiers, because when people think about war they should think of the men who are risking their lives day in and day out. The result is an experience is as good as any action war movie I've ever seen. Bigelow's spot on direction and the great sound effects provide us with situations so intense that your heart rate is constantly flying during this movie."
"keller102","2","14","19","1 April 2010"," Total nonsense & not worth the hype
","I saw this movie on DVD shortly after it came out and it must have been fairly forgettable because I thought no more of it until it picked up all the major Oscars and that prompted me to watch it again to see if it was that good. I have to say that it wasn't and I really can't figure out why it got all the plaudits. I can only imagine that nobody wanted Avatar to win and the Hurt Locker was the next best option.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie was its total lack of realism and a plot line that was simply incredulous. In the opening scene, the EOD man has to go out in the open, because a cart that looks like it was made by a 9 year old falls apart. The sniper scene was a complete nonsense and must have been put in purely to show how even the SAS are complete incompetents compared with the heroic Americans. One of the main reasons why the Iraqi insurgents & the Taliban have to resort to IED's is because they have no military skills whatsoever and are no match for open engagements with professional soldiers, so for this film to make us believe that an Iraqi sniper squad could pick off 3 SAS men from 800 yards away with what looked like AK47's is laughable.<br/><br/>Even more ridiculous is the scene where he goes after the boy's killers on his own, wearing combat fatigues and then tells the driver who is at gunpoint, ""wait for me""! I think even I might have thought it would be a good idea to take the ignition keys with me, just in case the driver did a runner! Then he comes out having achieved absolutely nothing and trots through the streets of Baghdad without getting a scratch on him. The film continues with each scene more stupid than the next.<br/><br/>In conclusion, beware, this is a war movie for children, not thinking adults, I cannot fathom why the critics give it such high marks."
"hnt_dnl","10","36","56","15 March 2010"," Absorbing character study set during the Iraq war
","THE HURT LOCKER won the Best Picture Oscar of 2009. It also made history in that Kathryn Bigelow, it's director, became the first female to win the coveted Best Director Oscar. Right off the bat, I have to say that I think she deserved this award. The direction is definitely expert. Bigelow keeps the action at just the right pace and every scene is the right length. There is just the right amount of character exposition also. Actually, not much is revealed about the main characters SSG Will James (Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner), SGT JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and SPC Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). It is a straightforward tale of men in the most tense combat situations. James, Sanborn, and Eldridge are a 3-man Explosives Ordnance Division (EOD). Their job is to diffuse bombs. James is the EOD expert who did the diffusing and Sanborn and Eldridge were his security and point men.<br/><br/>What struck me most about this film is how tense EVERY scene was! I found even what should have been the most unassuming scene very tension-filled as I realized that these men live on the edge every second of every day. The bomb-diffusing scenes are all very exciting and tension-filled and not just because of the impending doom of a bomb exploding, but due to the unknown factor of whether it is a timed bomb, or if there is a trigger man nearby. Any Iraqi in the vicinity was a suspect and not to be trusted. There is a very tense scene in the middle of the film that ironically has nothing to do with diffusing a bomb, but still is an ""action"" scene, and I found it to be the most tense, powerful scene of the film.<br/><br/>Renner definitely deserved his Oscar nomination, and perhaps should have won. It's not a showy role at all, but he makes the most of it. He plays the role very close to the vest. He simply IS SFC Will James, a man who is perhaps TOO good at what he does to the point that he gets lost in it sometimes and forgets others around him, due to the gravity of what he does. He kind of comes off as a modern cowboy and a wild man of sorts. He gets a rush out of what he does and then tops it all off at the end of the day with a smoke and a drink and doesn't get phased or let his emotions get in the way of his mission.<br/><br/>Mackie (as Sanborn) and Geraghty (as Eldgridge) are very solid in their roles also and are given their moments to shine as well. Eldridge suffers from immense stress as he must interact with the camp psychiatrist Lt. Col Cambridge (a solid, straight-laced Christian Camargo) on a daily basis when he comes back to the rear. Geraghty gets to play a very emotional scene early in the film where Eldgridge recounts the opening film scene where one choice by him could have made the difference between life and death. Sanborn is a by-the-numbers grunt who just wants to get the job done with a minimum of fuss; while at first he kind of resents and dislikes James, through the course of the film, he gains a healthy respect for James's professionalism, bravery, and leadership skills. The last scene between Mackie and Renner late in the film in the Humvee is extremely provocative and powerful as each man essentially reveals what the war has done to them.<br/><br/>The film also has 3 big-name cameos in Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes in small, but pivotal roles and these actors do a great job with their small parts. <br/><br/>The original screenplay (by Mark Boal)also won an Oscar and I think it deserved it as well. While the dialogue is nothing new, it is very realistic and convincing and there are actually moments of legitimate humor at the most perfect times that comes out of it. This actually seems like the way that these guys would interact and talk to each other. The focus is strictly on these 3 men, especially James, so this is much more of a tight character study than a treatise on war, although it definitely makes a powerful statement about what combat does to a soldier.<br/><br/>I find most of today's war films somewhat overrated. Seems like they either try to do too much with a lot of hard to follow action, heavy breathing, and shaky camera movement (like BLACKHAWK DOWN) or they are extremely downbeat and underdone (like JARHEAD). But THE HURT LOCKER manages to avoid these clichés and essentially be honest and truthful about the way men would act. Again, it's not about the Iraq war...It's about men at war.<br/><br/>The film itself is not even really a commentary on the war in Iraq. It just shows us what these men go through in their day-to-day grind, but it doesn't pontificate and become preachy. The film moves in one direction and doesn't stall at any point to become boring. THE HURT LOCKER is a superb character driven drama with immensely tense and riveting situations that just happen to take place in the Iraq war."

","I can't believe this movie won the Oscars. back than at the release, i gave it a 6 out of 10, not knowing that this movie would even be considered for nomination. i'll tell you why i rated it that way:<br/><br/>first of all, the main character is so damn NOT authentic. seriously, such an adrenalin addict would never ever made it into a position in which he had to defuse bombs... nor would he be very long in the military, if he would constantly get into other guys, or get drunk on the base. he's such an ass and i'll get angry just seeing him. not the actor, the character! if you'll get connected to him in any way, than in getting to hate him. great job! :P<br/><br/>than there is the shaky cam. i really hate that. i assume the directors want to distract from or hide the flawed scenes?! damn it, i want to SEE whats going on!! not to get a headache figuring out, what COULD be going on the screen!<br/><br/>many reviews have told this already: almost everything is so far away from reality. yeah i know, it's only a movie, but it's meant to be a somehow realistic depiction of war. one team going out alone? hunting bad guys in the streets and buildings, doing almost everything on their own? thats a joke. even better (watch out for the irony here): one guy running around all alone in the streets... sure, why not?! :P<br/><br/>the whole movie feels very slow. it's so slow, you have to try not to fall a sleep! in fact, you just want it to end. there is no real climax and i didn't feel any suspense... that's not what you want from an action movie. an if it's not meant to be an action movie, why do they constantly try to get so much action in it?!<br/><br/>in my opinion, this movie is on the same level as the usual steven seagal movies. i like the seagal movies for its ""easyness"" and plain, (often) stupid action plot and characters. you can relax and laugh here and there about how silly or dumb some things are, but the action is quite enjoyable. but that's exactly what you'd expect from a seagal movie, not what you'd expect from an Oscar winner! that's for sure."
"ajping","10","40","63","24 June 2010"," Worth every Oscar
","This was clearly one of the best films of 2009. There is simply no dead time in the movie. I don't mean to say that every moment is action packed, but rather that every moment helps move the story along or develop the characters. There are some moments of outstanding direction, such as when desert flies land on the lead while he is trying to hold still and maintain discipline during an exchange of sniper fire. Another stand-out scene is the direction when the team enters a recently abandoned bomb factory. Perhaps most importantly, the film creates the impression that anything could happen, and this is largely done by the choices made during direction, which heighten the feeling of volatility surrounding the nature of the team's assignments."

","COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS.....I'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest..really am. All I saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say. (Note to self must check the rating for Platoon on here)This movie was so black and white...Americans good...anyone else either evil or useless. I take it the British troops in it were meant to be SAS (one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with I'm pretty sure) they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the US troops who weren't even Elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky Iraqis. Aye dead-on strings to mind. The only good thing I have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the SAS man...muzzle flash from distance, good noise used...really well done that bit but the rest...Spare me what am I 10 years of age over here??!! Well I'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it.<br/><br/>SPOILER...Oh aye and in the main crazy,wild guy can't stay at home with his wife and young child..no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war!! Why...because young men need thrills or something apparently. Like say I'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am.<br/><br/>P.S. I'm not hating America I'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war (in my eyes) which OK fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it's a just war for whatever messed up reason (wanted to say something else her but censored) but hey that's up to them. But to churn out a movie so one-sided like it's black and white...good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child. In war there is a lot of grey and it's two (sometimes more)sides who believe in what they are fighting for. Not Star Wars with something something dark side verses the goodies. F' sake Hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs...then again 7.8....well maybe you are right to but I'll not be buying it. Glad I downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing. ;)"

I felt nothing for any of the characters and the only reason I can think of that they cast a little boy is for the shock factor, which wasn't shocking at all and it was pretty obvious what his fate would be from the moment you saw him. The camera work seemed amateur, and the whole thing doesn't seem true to life in the army. I tried extremely hard to see how the film won so many awards but I have drawn a complete blank. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money as you will be extremely disappointed."
"joe16vind","3","4","4","18 January 2014"," This was Best Picture?
","Can I get my eyesight back?<br/><br/>I don't care about fancy cinematography or being tricksey as Gollum would say<br/><br/>This was tortuous viewing- if Renner had watched it with me, I'd still feel the same way<br/><br/>Cue the ominous music- what the audience doesn't know disarming bombs is dangerous work? Cue the scene of male camaraderie- forced as it was (only Renner took his shirt off- what the other guys couldn't?) <br/><br/>Cue the obligatory scene of the guys rationalizing why they are doing this<br/><br/>The 3 principals were typical screenplay 101- the arrogant prick, the guy who fellows rules regardless, the milquetoast fellow who broods over death. Guess which one Renner was?<br/><br/>The film was loud, unnecessarily so. If a bomb disposal expert(removing his protective gear) is going to Jesus as Sgt. James states, shouldn't he have sustained at minimum first degree burns on his uncovered hands?<br/><br/>Like Crowe in A Good Year, Renner doesn't play cute and cuddly well.<br/><br/>For all the laudatory praise heaped on this film, it was still a film about war , no more or less. There was nothing new added to the canon of war films or war themed cinema. For myself give me Das Boot, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima and Stop Loss- with these, the fellows who fought weren't anybody special. They were caught up doing this, whether they wanted to or not. And sometimes there is no answer for the why of war- it just is.<br/><br/>It was hard to be sympathetic since these bomb disposal guys volunteered.<br/><br/>Yet there was a moment near the end upon his return home, when Renner's Sargent James is at the supermarket- lost in the cereal aisle. And he says nothing and in that stilled nothingness, he was on his way to where he was. It is so very hard to do this and he does this so very well. Just as in Avengers, Legacy and MI4, it's him. For in that briefest of seconds, he elevated Locker and gave an understanding as to why."
"paulappleyard17","3","4","4","15 January 2014"," Incredibly over-rated
","Incredibly overrated This movie is very overrated. Whilst I don't think Avatar deserved best picture at the Oscars, neither did this film.<br/><br/>In many of James Cameron's movies we have an unrealistic gung-ho military, I'm thinking in particular of Aliens and Avatar. But at least those movies are fantasies. The hurt-locker is supposed to be based in reality, so the ridiculously inaccurate depiction of the current day US army is just lazy. Getting an accurate depiction of Vietnam 20 yrs after the war (Platoon) and WW2 60 yrs after the war (Saving Private Ryan) is challenging, but getting an accurate depiction of the Iraq occupation (sorry I can't quite call the action a 'war') whilst it's still happening should be relatively easy! I have some military experience, but not US army and certainly not in the Middle East, so not all the inaccuracies jumped out at me (read other reviews to get details of these). However, the very notion that a nut-job would allowed to continue operating as an EOD is just stupid. EODs need to be extremely calm and collected, and never take unnecessary risks. I'm sure that in reality EODs are regularly psych evaluated too.<br/><br/>The scene where dozens of Iraqis are 'spectators' of the diffusing of a bomb, was just absurd. Most sane civilians would clear the area fast. That EODs would continue to diffuse a bomb with Iraqi spectators handling mobile phones (possible bomb triggers) is even more ridiculous. That an EOD unit would have no escort is also absurd.<br/><br/>As a Brit, I found the SAS (R. Fiennes) / sniper scene completely absurd too. Since when would members of an EOD unit be crack snipers? Since when would an insurgent/Iraqi sniper 'team' be good enough to take out an SAS unit at that distance? One lucky shot maybe, but come on. That whole scene was just nonsense.<br/><br/>On top of all this there is no real plot, or story. The cinematography is not that great, and the particularly annoying 'shaking camera' technique is over employed.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, this could have been so, so much better. A more realistic depiction of military practices and operations coupled with less absurd characters and an engaging story could have equaled a genuine masterpiece. There is plenty of real drama in any military conflict, with no need to dream up fantastical tripe like this! Come on Kathryn .. some more like Point Break please, less like The Hurt Locker."

","This movie's success literally depends on the ignorance of the audience watching it.<br/><br/>I can understand that non-veterans might find it somewhat entertaining. There is drama. There is action (albeit completely unrealistic). My problems with this movie could fill a warehouse, but they've been verbalized by many other veterans of the Iraq war, so I'll keep it short. This film requires that you have an extreme desire to connect with veterans of America's current conflicts. When you look back at a war movie based on the legitimate exploration of emotion (such as Platoon), you find that it takes decades for the purveyor of that emotion to fully capture the message they wish to instill in us. This movie is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the public desire to experience modern warfare before another more meticulously researched movie could be made. Obviously the ""Best Picture"" nomination has sealed this film's fate in the eyes of the majority of movie viewers but, I urge you, as a former Non-Commisioned Officer in the United States Army Infantry deployed to Iraq, and a serious student to film, do not believe the hype. This movie is all wrong and, as most veterans of the Global War on Terrorism will tell you, its an insult to the men and women who have served and given their lives."

I am an ex Soldier so yes I may have been watching with an over critical eye but it was so unrealistic.<br/><br/>Military Vehicles do not drive around on their own in Iraq. An EOD team would not ""bump into"" an SAS team in the way they did, and even if they did they would not take over while the SAS guys just sat there and watched their mates getting shot! Before going into investigate a device normally the scene would be secured by at least a Platoon of infantry, not a lone Humvee with three guys doing it all! There was no chain of command for the team, they would not keep IED parts under their beds. Any parts found are investigated in order to work out the latest bomb making techniques and also forensics are sought in order to catch and kill or prosecute bomb makers!

","Thanks to Law Abiding Citizen, which has nothing to do with this movie except one line ""someone has to do some pretty nasty things so we can live in our American dream"", I came to understand what's the movie is about. Of course, it's not the greatest war movie ever made, and it's definitely not your heroic take on wars. I mean, even movies like Saving Private Ryan and Flag of Our Fathers nailed the icons of heroes into characters' heads when the main objective is to cleanse the dirty war of its dirty heroism. But The Hurt Locker, man, is almost 100% anti-hero.<br/><br/>Everyone who's a role model in this movie has been blown up, from Guy Pearce's character to the Christian Camargo's Col. John Cambridge. The one who survived and screwed around them like a ghost and a jerk was our protagonist, SFC William James. Don't make me wrong, he's a good guy. He started out successful in every mission to get rid of bombs and OEDs, and he's a good shot and strategist too. But, he's also a regular trespasser, a nut-case who does sports in war to win a ""reckless"" from fellow soldiers, and a failed father figure to his family or any families. There was a very compelling thread in the middle of the movie where James pulled out a personal investigate into the little boy's murder. And it's like a turning point which lead the whole Iraq war into James' personal story. Every time he tried to make a good pursuit in the middle of combat, he messed up the whole thing into a bloody irony. Every friend he made was claimed by death or hatred, or both. When colleagues called him a madman and hostiles considered him a monster, there's really very little human left in him except the adrenaline rush war brought.<br/><br/>So, what's so different about this movie, is it not another Platoon mixed with post-modern concepts like ""Gulf syndrome""? No. Like I said, it's a very personal take on a war that's still going on. Clyde Shelton in Law Abiding Citizen is a good mirror to William James because they had everything in common except the former's family were slaughtered while the later's were disconnected. And as common sense tells, the later happens all the time, which gives The Hurt Locker a realistic edge that no recent similar productions can match. You see, American dream doesn't always die in the hands of thugs, breaking into a thousand pieces in tragic slow motion. That's just a stereotype people adopted in their minds from Hollywood. American dreams can walk away on its on feet, echoing in the hollowness of modern lifestyle(if you consider war and war games a lifestyle), making you wonder what the heck had happened. For the record, William James really should be given the honor of a war hero because he saved hundreds of lives by disabling OEDs. But the real hero in him had long been killed, the body disposed in nowhere. He's definitely one of the deepest roles in movies. And if the real figure who provided the character basis for him is still fighting on the front-line, I'd pray for his return safe, sound and redeemed, amen."

The ""enemy"" is portrayed as non-human, and largely irrelevant. These soldiers have enough to do fighting with each other.<br/><br/>The film is entirely unsympathetic, and a wonderful example of species self-hatred (if we assume those who made it are indeed human).<br/><br/>Nine Oscar nominations for this picture is an insult, not only to other war movies, but to war itself.<br/><br/>I can only conclude that, if this picture accurately describes our forces in Iraq, we not only deserve to lose the war, but we should be required to learn a great deal about civilization from the Arab Middle East before complaining about it."

The only real part of this movie is the fact that they're US Soldiers in Iraq, that's it. The writing is terrible: the plot was lacking in many ways and the characters did things that even a mindless robot would ask ""did you seriously just order me to do that?"" The acting (and this is surprising because I liked Jeremy Renner in 28 Days Later...) is sub par, not one of the characters was believable and the lead was a loose cannon taken a little over the top. And sorry Mrs. Bigelow, but you really should stick to movies like Point Break and Strange Days, war movies are just not your strong point, especially ones that are so ludicrous as this that I almost feel shamed wearing a uniform for my country because of how people correlate this movie with the real world. Another confusing thing about this film is how people thought it was so good. I think everything about this film puts US Service Members in the wrong light. We are not heroic to the point of stupidity, and not many soldiers can use a sniper rifle to take out a target over 1000M away. EOD does not perform in the way depicted, much less anywhere close to the way depicted, and the direction this film took was so ridiculous that I seriously question the intelligence of America for putting this up for Best Picture and it being boasted as the ""Best film of '09."" 2009 had many films released that were above and beyond better films in every aspect by comparison. I question the opinions of anyone who rates this movie more than 3 stars and wouldn't take any recommendations from anyone who liked this movie as I know they have poor taste in film. If you haven't seen Hurt Locker, don't. Much like Napoleon Dynamite, I want those hours of my life back."

","This movie is absolute garbage. First off, it is not a good depiction of ""life on the ground"" from any aspect. Actually, strike that. There is one good scene in the movie. ONE. The depiction of looking downrange through a scope for a ridiculously long time happens and it sucks. That scene, I thought, actually captured the essence of what a crap job that is. However, the rest of it was absolutely ridiculous. Running off by himself in Baghdad? Get your head cut off. This movie has zero redeeming value. The fact that it won Oscars is proof that the Academy is an effing joke. War is a drug? Shut up. No it is not. Weed is a drug. Coke is a drug. Smokes and coffee are drugs.

While this is definitely a theme in the film, I feel it, unlike most other war films, takes a back seat to the character study.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film can be considered an excellent action picture filled with excellent sequences. However, this has provoked some to say, that while the sequences themselves are good, the film seems broken up and a very loose. However, I feel that this is where its brilliance lies as well as why it desevred its Best Original Screenplay Oscar.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is brilliant as it breaks down James' character without really feeding the audience. The audience must truly analyze each bomb scene and see exactly what it tells us about his character.

"ptb-8","9","35","55","27 October 2009"," Bad title, great film.
","Well, here's my vote for what might turn out to be the best war or war related film so far this century. If you seek an Afhganistan experience that humanizes the 'war effort' and its suburban impact there and here, THE HURT LOCKER is it. Jeremy Renner is a strange new-ish actor, I have never seen him before but felt as though I had. He reminds me of Daniel Craig. Or maybe Craig's younger brother. I see today that Renner in in the running to play Max Rockatansky in MAD MAX 4 FURY ROAD. He is not suited for that but his suitability for the role of bomb defuse expert in THE HURT LOCKER is truly terrific. Strong guest appearances from Guy Pearce and Ralph Feinnes helped raise the budget cash and the international sales, I am sure even their roles are tiny but effective. Renner though is spectacular. I am not impressed with Kathryn Bigelow's previous directorial efforts but she has presented here with this film a redeeming result. Much of the hand held camera-work mars the quality and interest in the film, some of it downright irritating. However for a 2 hour war related film about the seductiveness of the adventure of war and its impact on one man with a family back home, THE HURT LOCKER is a great film. the scene in the supermarket with him searching for breakfast cereal is majestic emotional understatement. The title is terrible and will have put potential ticket-buyers off. So take my advice, and go, and then settle in for an experience in tension and emotion and humanity."

","Despite the fact that I'm not a strong advocate of war films, let alone action films, I'd be lying if I didn't say this is the best film I've seen so far this year (and I highly doubt anything will compare to it). I went in with high hopes after reviewing the many critic/user accolades, absorbed the meaning of the opening statement presented as a fact—""War is a drug""—and came out feeling inebriated on the entire cinematic experience. Not only was the journey of watching the film terribly engaging, the aftermath reflection was equally as cathartic and tantalizing. It's as close as you can get to a near-perfect film: emotionally-driven, patriotic, contemplative, free from overt bias, adrenaline-based, strong acting, stronger characters, provocative theme, extremely well-paced, edgy and exhilarating. I strongly recommend it!"

","""The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" The Hurt Locker is about the soldiers involved in the Iraq war. Thompson is a bomb disposal expert and he gets killed during a mission to dispose a bomb. Then Sergeant First Class William Jones takes over Thompson's job and he becomes the team leader of the EOD unit. He has Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in his team. Will is kind of a free spirit who doesn't give a damn about his life, this is what Sanborn thinks about him and is weary of Will. Owen is a newbie and he is very scared for his life every moment of everyday that he is out there outside his camp, he doesn't want to die. But theoretically, everything out there could be a bomb meant for them to die and they have to survive. 'War is really hell on earth' is what these young soldiers will learn on their journey.<br/><br/>Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film is a very great character study of the soldiers in Iraq rather than just another mediocre war movie. This made me feel sad both for the USA soldiers, the children struck in Iraq and also some good Iraq people. They are just stuck in somebody's war and live in fear most of the time. The film has many moments and dialogues which bring a smile on the face, but beneath it all you can still feel the gloom the war brings. Will knows that he lives for the adrenaline rush that only a war can bring. Without it, in the real world back in America with his family, he feels like a nobody and he wants that rush of adrenaline. Sanborn and Owen are very angry over Will's 'devil may care' attitude because he is also putting their lives in danger. There is a scene with snipers in the hot desert and it is very heart breaking to see them suffer. Also the scene in the shower is very good. William, even though he has a lethal addiction to war, is a very sympathizable character. The little Iraqi boy, Beckham, I liked him a lot. When he becomes a human bomb, I cried for him, the pain in Will seeing him dead like that overpowered me and I just couldn't stop myself. I have seen loads of deaths of kids and people in movies, but never have I been this affected by a war film. I cared so much for the characters. The movie gives an insight into the everyday life in Iraq and its very agonizing to see what they do. All of them have just over a month to survive in Iraq, before they can come back to America and new recruits are brought over for one more year so that the whole cycle repeats itself.<br/><br/>William Jones, Sanborn & Owen Eldridge give very good performances in the film. And how could I forget one of my favourite actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost, the TV series) who plays Connie James, wife of William James. She gives a highly believable performance as the hurting wife of Will. She just wants him to stay with the family, while he thirsts for war. This isn't like all those other war movies which just wants us to say ""look at those soldiers suffering, I want to help."" This is an intense film and is made with a lot of passion. You will have to decide for yourself, what moves you in this film.<br/><br/>I went to see Clash Of The Titans and couldn't get tickets, so I went for this and am I glad I did. I think it deserved all those 6 Oscars that it got. I didn't know before this that no woman director had won, how sad, but I am very happy she won. But, this a film which will be always remembered as the film which resulted in the first Oscar for a woman director. Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a winner all the way. Go and see it if you still haven't seen it. The dialogues, camera-work, setting and everything is made to perfection.<br/><br/>P.S: I can't believe how hot Kathryn Bigelow is:) Me & my mom thought she was only 34-38 when we first saw her in the BAFTA Awards on TV and we wondered why James and her separated. Also she is thrice my age and I have the hots for her!! Why James Cameron would divorce her, I don't know. Don't you agree? <br/><br/>10/10"
"charlies123","1","51","84","3 February 2010"," Not very good
","This was a disappointment. All in all, there was not enough action scenes. The movie spent much time developing the main character, Sgt. James, who I absolutely hated for his recklessness and disregard for the safety of others. He was utterly despicable. Yet he was the hero of the movie. Boo. It would have been much better if the other Sgt. were the main character. It is much easier to identify with him, rather than the racist hillbilly Sgt. James. James is a character not deserving of sympathy. I was rooting the entire time I knew him, within minutes of meeting him, that he would die. Some of the experiences he had throughout were meaningless. Attempts to show his human side failed miserably. The ending was a letdown. Completely without action, and really just meaningless. This is a blah movie. I want my money back."
"Jackpollins","10","37","59","19 July 2009"," Quite possibly the best war film ever....but without a doubt one of the three best war films ever
","Now a days it seems very hard to make a tense and smart action-thriller. I am here to declare that The Hurt Locker manages to do that and more. The story is fresh, and the action builds up so tensely you forget you're watching a movie. The story is so involving that you forget the movie is two hours and ten minutes because you're sucked in so much. The story is about a group of army men, who upon having their last bomb disarmer killed in a bomb accident, hires a new one. The one they hire is named William James (Jeremy Renner, turning in a fantastic performance.) He does things his own way, much to the dislike of the leader, JT Sanborn. It starts to become intense being in the moment not knowing if William is making the right decision, or if JT is making the right decision. The fact that a lot of these bombs are seemingly impossible to disarm makes you on the edge of your seat. This movie has as much, if not more authentic thrills and chills as any horror movie, thriller, or action film of at least the past 15 years. This is by far my favorite film of the year so far, and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not go see it as fast as you can."
"countvonbarron","Null","270","498","25 August 2009"," Inaccurate overrated movie
","First off let my start by saying that I am a 3 time veteran of Iraq. This has been called the ""definitive"" Iraq film. Is is not. The definitive Iraq film has yet to be made and probably won't ever be made. It always amazes my how the critics laud the inaccuracies in these films and call them ""masterpieces"". To us vets, however they are as phony as can be. To cite just 4 examples of what is wrong with this movie: 1. When the lead character Sergeant James encounters a car bomb filled with explosives he immediately removes his protective suit and begins to rummage around looking for the trigger wire. I have met EOD guys and have a lot of respect for them but I know for a fact that they WOULD NEVER EVER DO THIS. If any self respecting EOD soldier did that he would be court- martialed. No soldier would ever remove all his gear especially in the middle of a city. The critics showed his as being brave but this was plain out stupidity. 2. When James encounters the body of a young Iraqi boy he had befriended and sees that explosives have been placed in his abdomen, he attempts to find out who killed him. He does this in the most implausible way possible. He gets into the car of an Iraqi merchant dressed only in his fatigues and with no gear on points a pistol at his head and orders him to drive him to what he thinks is the boys house. Upon arrival there he finds nothing so what does he do then? He WALKS ALL THE WAY BACK FROM THE HOUSE TO HIS BASE WITH NO PROTECTIVE GEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF BAGHDAD AT NIGHT AND NO ONE NOTICES HIM?! This defies belief. Again no soldier would ever or has ever in 6 years in Iraq ever done this. It could not happen. 3. After defusing the car bomb his fellow soldier a subordinate punches him for taking off his radio headset. In real life that soldier would be done. He struck a superior?! No way. 4. During a climactic battle sequence the aforementioned soldier takes off his helmet while firing a sniper rifle. Again this would never happen. 5. Last but not least at the end of the movie the lead character has returned to Iraq after an unspecified amount of time at home. The scene shows him walking towards another bomb with his suit on. The caption reads "" Days left in Alpha company's rotation-365. This is also wrong as all soldiers coming to Iraq train at least 2 weeks in Kuwait and this is counted as part of your year there.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie the credits list the main character as a Staff Sergeant but in the movie he is wearing the rank of Sergeant First Class. This may have been an intentional error but it is still an error.<br/><br/>When ""Apocalypse Now"" came out critics called it a masterpiece, the definitive Vietnam movie. Vets I talked to however said by and large it was garbage phony as hell. It wasn't until ""Platoon"" came out that the vets were pleased. ""Platoon"" was written directed by Oliver Stone who was a veteran. To me it is the definitive Vietnam movie. I believe when and if the definitive film about the current conflict comes out it will be made by a veteran someone who really knows what went on over here. I believe this film does not portray these soldiers heroically but rather as gung-ho reckless cowboys. The real heroism displayed by these guys every day is not shown at all. Hollywood owes it to us veterans to make a film that is honest about this war and not resort to phony heroism when there is plenty of real heroism out there every day. ""The Hurt Locker"" is well acted and well made but utterly preposterous and not a realistic portrayal at all."
"doughelo","3","368","688","28 August 2009"," Too many inaccuracies and shakycam, too little character
","I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. <br/><br/>For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility. <br/><br/><ul><li>A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it?</li></ul><br/><br/>There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too.<br/><br/>Many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle.<br/><br/>Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point?<br/><br/>If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch. Just based on the half hour I saw of it, I'd recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead."

"jimdalton33","10","39","63","20 April 2010"," Exactly what it should have been
","The Hurt Locker is a movie that begins the same way it ends, but my saying that isn't going to give anything away. It's true that it's not a typical, Hollywood-camera-caramel flick; it doesn't adhere to any formula but the one that was discovered for its sake when it was filmed. It is certainly an independent film in this regard, and, if watched intently, is a powerful experience.<br/><br/>The filming style reminded me of the way another true-to-life, brutally honest portrayal was done, Drugstore Cowboy. Both movies involve a handful of characters that we watch and learn from; we learn what it means to have their lives, their joys (hardly any), their fears (horrible realities). Because there is no polish here, we don't expect any, and that in itself is a breath of fresh air in today's movie-making grind. The trick here is to accept that what you're watching is the way it really is. The trick to doing that is to accept this film in the trust-mode. In the documentary voice.<br/><br/>If you can do that, and if you don't have any typical, modern film making clichés close to heart as you watch, I'd be incredulous if you were able to tell me this wasn't one of the most powerful war dramas you've ever seen. What's more, this one was done without big names. But this movie doesn't need big names. It just suffices. And it's DAMN good. It hurts. It has an appropriate title."

"Cinemadharma","6","480","915","13 January 2010"," Just like the war it portrays, this film lacks direction, focus and clarity of purpose.
","This is a different kind of war movie for a different kind of war that ultimately fails in the same ways the war fails - in that it lacks a singular focus, it has no direction or goal, and the purpose is not clear. It's not a bad movie, I just couldn't find anything to connect to or engage with - and when a moment would arise in which I thought that thing to connect to was coming... it didn't.<br/><br/>The film drags along at a snail's pace at times, which works for some scenes, such as a great scene wherein the main characters are pinned down for several hours by insurgents in the middle of the desert - but mostly the slowness just feels slow. There is no real story here, yet it isn't just a docudrama, either. It doesn't seem to know what kind of a movie it is, or from which characters' view point it is being told. In my opinion the story that it started to tell (and would have made it a much more interesting film) was of the drug-like addictive nature of high risk behavior, and how people who engage in that sort of thing in war will return to civilian life only to find other dangerous, high risk behavior to engage in... which is not dissimilar thematically to another of director Kathryn Bigelow's films, ""Point Break"". Alas, it seemed as if she forgot about that angle halfway thru the film. The worst part of the film is the ending, which after 125 minutes of slow pacing suddenly races past what should have and could have given the film its purpose. <br/><br/>If I had seen this film back when it first came out, I think I would have said, ""OK. A well-acted, decent film despite its problems."" The thought that this film would be nominated for and would win so many major awards, including being the front runner for any Oscar whatsoever -- would not have even crossed my mind, and it is mindboggling to me now that that is the case."

As someone else already mentioned that it was made from the same theme as ""The War Lover."" Just changing the roles from a fighter pilot to a Bomb-tech doesn't make it a earth shattering movie....now does it?

","I happened to catch the tail-end of the Oscar's a few months back, and when ""The Hurt Locker"" had beaten out James Cameron's ""Avatar"" I was understandably confused due to the fact that what I perceived as a masterpiece of cinema had lost to ""The Hurt Locker"", the existence of which I had never been made aware. I committed to seeing the film as soon as possible. Little did I know just how confused and disappointed I would feel after viewing, and learning more about ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>I sat through this film, all the while wondering how it could have possibly taken best picture. The Hurt Locker is a drawn-out, boring, un-emotional film that could be categorized as an ""Iraq War Exploitation Film"". You would be right if you accused me of sarcasm when I say ""There is nothing I love more than marines pointing and shooting guns, blowing things up, and punching each other as hard as they can."" This film contains little to no plot, bereft of any perceivable ""moral lesson"". We appear merely to meander through these soldiers' experiences waiting and hoping (sometimes praying) for something worth ""taking away"" from it all. If anything I think what we can gather from this film is that ""...this one time in Iraq, there was this one guy who loved diffusing bombs..."" After thoroughly souring my desire to ever view another war film again, I proceeded to learn more about the masterminds behind this bore-fest. I was hugely surprised to discover that the director of the film was non other than James Cameron's ex-wife. This knowledge, paired with the fact that ""The Hurt Locker"" was voted by the academy to be superior than ""Avatar"" I found deeply curious. Which lead me to what I believe is the only viable hypothesis for why such a lackluster film could have ousted such an impressive one. After all, how could the driving force behind the creation of the ""classic"" film Near Dark (in which the majority of the cast was pirated directly from Cameron's 1986 smash hit Aliens) be worthy of attention, not to mention an award. A conspiracy emerged in my mind:<br/><br/>The Academy, bored of James Cameron's track-record of successful, powerful, outstanding, and emotional films, decided they would prevent him any form of further glory in a mad-bid to humiliate him and confuse the general masses, by nominating a film that was directed by his Ex-wife. A film which--despite it's blatant inferiority--can be passed off as something greater than it deserves due to the fact that it addresses the conflict in Iraq. If you enjoy soldiers pointing and shooting weapons, human beings being blown up, or desert warfare, you will surely relish this film."
"countrymoviebuff","3","13","18","28 March 2010"," forget what you have heard - whatever you are looking for in this movie is not there....
","I fail to understand what anyone saw in this movie. Entertaining? no. Great war film? no. Character piece? no. Study of the human psyche in battle? no. Action packed popcorn flick? Not even close. I see no value in watching this film at all. Maybe the point was to show three types of soldiers: the adrenalin junkie, the soldier who can barely function for fear of the seeming inevitable, and the soldier who does his duty as best he can even with full understanding of the reality of his day to day risk. If so, none of these characters are really explored or explained so we can empathize or at least understand them. The ""brave"" solder does have one or two acts of bravery such as when he attempts to cut a bomb mechanism off of a civilian and is obviously upset about his failure to do so. But most of his actions seem only to satisfy his craving for adventure - not as sacrifice for country or comrades, bravery, duty or any other discernible reason. His actions throughout the movie are pointless and add nothing to the story. I am not sure if she is trying to demonize or show him as a hero, either way is abject failure. The combat scenes were embarrassingly inaccurate - an insurgent can pick off a soldier(twice)from hundreds of yards away with what a appears to be an ak47 without a scope and yet two American soldiers have to sight in a guy after several shots who is hanging out of a window with a spotter and a shooter? That was by far the most glaring but there were oh so many others. There is no plot, no compelling moments no great story being told, nor lesson being taught or introspective to ponder. What is the point of this movie? If it were at least entertaining that would be something. Watch one episode of Band Of brothers, time much better spent."

","I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. ""The Hurt Locker"" has won more ""Best Picture"" awards from the critic groups than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it hard to sit through.<br/><br/>There is minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. That is the entire movie. <br/><br/>But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it. The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.<br/><br/>I normally don't care for war movies and ""The Hurt Locker"" was no exception. But you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it."

","I am sorry to say, but this film is no more then American propaganda at its finest and the awards it won were the ones that proved it. It's not a bad movie, but its not Oscar or any award material, it has nothing, its not even simple its not that complicated either. Its just a movie about the war that Americans have with themselves and this is the boost they needed. Really disappointing that the first woman to win an Oscar for directing was for this kind of... movie. You would think that after all these years of continues movies about the war in the middle east the one who should have one the most would have been more inspiring. <br/><br/>I know that this movie may have touched a lot of people or scared them, but even so, you can't say that it was a good movie, that it had the elements that make a good movie."
"H_Spengler","2","20","30","27 March 2010"," Ridiculous, over-hyped, clichéd, inaccurate & grossly overrated.
","I remember several years ago watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" with my grandfather, a WW2 vet, who also survived storming the beach that day. Ten minutes into the movie he had to leave the room, because of how ""real & accurate"" the beach scene was for him. I think i've made my point. Bigelow needs to learn from this kind of example. It's possible to recreate a scene/war realistically.<br/><br/>I have a few friends who have bravely served in Iraq, most, more than one tour of duty in infantry, tanker, equipment mechanic, etc., who put their lives in danger patrolling streets, dodging gunfire, detecting IED's, in some cases assisting to disarm and quarantine off areas, & processing the gruesome aftermath of an incident, or suicide bomber.<br/><br/>That being said, from the previews, & ridiculous hype, I figured this was going to be a no holds barred, gritty, realistic peek into the everyday life of American Soldiers more specifically, bomb tech soldiers.<br/><br/>I realized the inaccuracies start almost immediately, no skilled soldier in his right mind would've let that guy with the cell phone even start dialing...he would've been shot dead right away, IED units, patrolling alone, soldier wandering on vigilante mission alone in the night through dangerous Baghdad, are just some of the dangerous situations you can expect to see, glaring errors even to a non military observer.<br/><br/>No team leader would EVER risk the lives of his entire team plunging them into nighttime, uncharted territory ""on a hunch"" because he feels that whomever set up/detonated this nighttime bomb was surely hiding in the shadows watching. When in truth, they likely would've been long gone, blended in with the locals, if they were in the vicinity at all.<br/><br/>No team would've tolerated the rogue, ""wild card"" bomb tech, who repeatedly defies orders & odds, placing his entire team at risk, time & time again. In the words of my friends ""would've zip tied his a** and thrown him in the back of a Hum Vee first."" Do I need to go on? Ladies & Gentlemen, who else is going to know what's wrong with this picture more than the people who were there for real?<br/><br/>The main actors are clichéd cookie cutter cutouts. I found myself not caring about any of them as they meandered through the predictability of the movies as one cliché after another was rolled out: the various types of bombs, the shady terrorists, the doctor who is killed, ironically while on his first voyage out into the field, the angry by the books soldier, the ""wild card"", rule bending soldier, the innocent, sweet, soft spoken soldier. The done to death conversations and ""coming to term"" conversations. ""By the books"" soldier clashes with ""Wild Card"", but in the end, likes & respects him, despite his crazy methods, and realizes himself, he's overcome his fear of procreation, and indeed, wants children. ""Wild Card"" has trouble adjusting to civilian life, and in a dull scene, realizes he loves ""one thing"", which left me wondering, ""is it war he loves?, or his son?""<br/><br/>Not one storyline is deep enough for me to give a crap what happened to any of them. Camera work is sloppy, & abrupt (not quite to Blair Witch levels, but irritating enough), if a director is going for a realistic camera situation, I think it's more important to not have to take Dramamine when watching it. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes & Guy Pearce also throw in a much too short cameo as apparently ridiculously inept British Officers, (their appearance subconsciously beckon you into wanting to watch a better film.) They of course are taken out by terrorist snipers occupying the only structure within eyesight. <br/><br/>The Academy needs a serious overhaul...it's absolutely shocking to me that this won ""Best Picture"". It's fine that someone wants to make a movie about the day to day of soldiers in Iraq, but for gods sake, at least make it accurate.<br/><br/>2 stars--for Fiennes & Pearce, & for the sets & locations...which are the best things about the movie."

","Don't waste time or money on this boring movie! .There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Shaking the camera around to disorient the viewer gets old after 5 minutes. That does not count as good editing or cinematography. The so-called 'tension' of defusing bombs becomes tedious at the 3rd try and never recovers.This movie is a mere succession of scenes that do not follow any plot. It is not a good movie because it has no main story. It is not a good documentary because it does not reveal any truth, new aspects of the conflict.

","I love watching movies and I know when a movie sucks or not. The camera work in this movie seems amateurish, it's wobbly most of the time. The dialog delivery it seems is being read directly from the script. I thought this is a war movie, but not really. While watching it on the first five minutes of the movie, I could swear this was meant as a TV movie. For a movie fanatic like me, I never made it past the first thirty minutes of this movie, it's that boring. The only big deal I can see on this movie is, the director is James Cameron's Ex. Seeing this movie winning a lot of categories proves that, Politics also lurks in the Oscars. Let's get an honest opinion, did you guys really liked this movie?"
"petervangalen","1","6","7","18 February 2013"," No story and boring
","I cannot believe this movie got so many Oscars. There is no story, just a sequence of stuff happening. It's could be a good representation of how war was for US soldiers in Irak, the acting is good and it is good to get an idea of what kind of things happen, how stressful it is to be there and it makes post traumatic stress syndrome very understandable. But I already knew those things from reading the news. And really, there is just no story at all, I don't understand why others don't seem to have a problem with that. Apart from the occasional adrenaline rush I thought it was very boring, and the character development is poor, and there is just no way that this movie should have gotten so many prizes."
"oscargeek83","4","166","306","31 January 2010"," I didn't get the hype
","The Hurt Locker<br/><br/>Every year we get a couple of Iraq war movies and they always turn out to be flops. The Hurt Locker doesn't star big names but is getting the best reviews of the year. This movie doesn't display the usual anti-American sentiment. It doesn't treat our soldiers as evil (unlike Avatar), or as stupid, and drunk hoodlums. It shows the psychological effects on soldiers who know any day could be their last. This provides for some good drama as most war movies do. Although I thought it was well directed and well acted, there wasn't enough there for me to call it a good movie.<br/><br/>The movie stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty as officers William, JT, and Owen. They are a bomb squad in Iraq who are called on to disable road bombs. If you have watched any news on the Iraq war you will probably know, there are a lot of road bombs out there. William is the bomb specialist in the group that has to get up and close to these bombs and disable them. JT and Owen watch his back and assist him in these missions. William is also the new guy in the group and immediately sets himself as a risk taker. JT on the other hand is cautious and plays everything by the book. This will bring William and JT at odds with each other throughout the movie. Owen agrees with JT and seems so nervous on missions that he is about to have a mental breakdown at any moment. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with several bomb disabling missions and then JT and William arguing back and forth about the missions. JT thinks Williams's inability to listen to him and follow his commands is putting all their lives in danger. He likes to follow his own instincts and doesn't seem to work with the team. I think most people would have to agree with JT it does seem like he is putting himself in danger over and over again instead of doing what is safe. Why does William act this way? William has such a determination to disable the bombs that it seems that he will die before giving up. Does he have nothing to live for? That doesn't seem to be the case; he has a family waiting for him back home. It seems that he enjoys risking his life day in and day out more than going back to the safety of his home. I don't understand why this is, and it's one of the problems that bothered me throughout this movie. <br/><br/>Critics seem to love this movie for its thrills and intensity. I on the other hand didn't feel tensed or thrilled. Disabling a bomb over and over again isn't really that interesting. It takes about 10 minutes to put on the big suit and walk over to the bomb, and then another 10 minutes to disable it. It's actually quite boring to watch and there are about 5 scenes just like that, that take over most of the movie. I was never scared for the characters because I figured hey they can't die they are the main actors and I still have an hour left of this movie. When not disabling bombs JT is constantly getting after William which gets annoying and in one awkward scene they are fighting for no reason. Other scenes just drag on and seem to have no point to them. What is the goal for these soldiers in this movie? It seems to me that it is just to survive their round in combat until they get to go back home. It just doesn't seem like a good enough reason for me to care about this movie. <br/><br/>Grade- D<br/><br/>Rated R- Lots of cussing and violent images."
"mallitch","Null","17","25","10 March 2010"," Waste of time
","I couldn't help compare this film with Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk down"". Both films are military action flicks. But when Scott's film shows the seemingly psychologically indifferent amount of cruelty of war (it just happens as inevitable part of it), when all involved and their loved ones are simply victims, this one tries to build up an overview of human psychology. This policy of treating us a target of social manipulation has always made me upset.<br/><br/>It has failed as far as I have been concerned because it is overly politically correct (which I do not condone because of its clearly manipulative goals). They want to pass a clear message, not a view to think over. I could call this a propaganda. In fact I do."
"parag1dubey","1","236","445","20 February 2010"," A Highly Overrated Film
","The Hurt Locker is one of the most overrated movies ever. Although there are some good sequences in the film, they never really amount to anything. There is very little plot in the movie. In other words, this film has no purpose. Most of the characters are cardboard cut-outs. The only exception to this is the protagonist of the story(whatever little there is)played brilliantly by Jeremy Renker. The film meanders all over the place. There are episodes in the film which are very loosely connected (if at all) to each other. This certainly isn't my idea of ""The Best War Film In Years"", etc... Watch Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan instead. They are far better examples of the genre. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is one of the weakest efforts I have seen and I will be highly surprised if she wins the Academy Award this year. Indeed, I am astounded that she was nominated at all. Just because she is a woman is no reason for a nomination. Michael Mann for Public Enemies was a much stronger contender. All in all, I feel this is an average, flawed film which suffers from a weak screenplay and terrible direction. Watch it at your own risk. If you liked Platoon or the other war films I mentioned, then there is a good chance you will hate this one."
"latinese","9","76","134","27 October 2008"," Not just an action movie
","OK, the action aspect has been described in other comments. No need to repeat that it's extremely well done, and that it's powerful. The first 30' of the films are so gripping you feel you're going to die with the artificer.<br/><br/>I'd like to say something about other aspects of The Hurt Locker. First, the fact that, though only focusing on the 3 main characters, the members of the EOD team, Bigelow manages to put Iraqi people in the picture. Not trying to tell the story from their point of view, which would be very difficult and might easily sound false. But showing how the war in Iraq is fought among common people who are desperately trying to live a normal life. This creates a situation of deadly uncertainty, which is well caught in the movie, and also moral responsibility. The final scene, where the artificer talks to the human bomb, is not just gripping and suspenseful: it's also a sort of moral allegory. Can the US troops there defuse the bomb, which is a metaphor of a country totally out of control? Well, the ending of the scene probably tells you what's Bigelow opinion on it.<br/><br/>But let's go to the little lower layer. If danger is an addictive drug (that's what the film tells you right from the start), it should be said that William James is not the only addict in the film. He tries to get back home and live a normal life again with his wife and child. He can't. He gets back to Iraq. Is this only James' problem? Or are the US on the whole addicted to war, violence, danger? I think the ending tells another story, not just that of the protagonist. The man who cannot stop gambling on his ability to deactivate bombs may be an image of a country which cannot stop gambling on its ability to win wars (or to persuade itself it is winning the wars it's started).<br/><br/>All in all, a deeper film than it may seem at a first viewing."
"mr_shya","10","31","50","29 June 2009"," Great characters make this movie a masterpiece!
","The Action-sequences in this movie are, although better than average, not what makes this movie worth watching. It is the characters, the emotions and the relationships.<br/><br/>The Opening Words, War is a Drug, are not just to sound cool, they reappear as the main message over and over again in the movie, although they are never spoken out. Drugs make you addicted, Drugs confuse you, Drugs make you do dangerous, stupid things. These characteristics can all be seen in the movie.<br/><br/>Very interesting are as well the guest roles of Guy Pierce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes, all showing a different types of soldiers in the war. The shallow type, to whom the war appears to be fun. The cowboy, who fights for glory and is as well impressed by great actions. And finally, the nefarious Bounty hunter who is only seeking profit in the war. All these characters build a contrast to the protagonist, showing what he is not.<br/><br/>A film that has it's message hidden, yet clear and strong can only be called one thing, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>(little cheesy, I know. But I really loved this movie)"
"dancer-91","8","14","20","10 July 2010"," Good, not great
","I was rooting for Avatar in the Oscars but I hadn't seen this by that time. I'm happy that Kathryn Bigelow got the Best Director award because she was the first woman to get it, but I think James Cameron truly deserved it.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a good movie. It really is. I think it does a fine job portraying the madness of war and how everyone is in danger and death comes in a blink of an eye, it doesn't ask who you are or announce its coming.<br/><br/>But the thing that bothered me was that I think the crew was trying to make a great movie, they HAD to make a great movie. and it showed. The trying really showed and you got the feeling that it wasn't so enjoyable. I keep comparing this to Avatar, but with Avatar and with a lot of past Best Picture winners (or movies that should have won it..) you get the feeling that people behind the camera love what they're doing and it brings something more to the film. I didn't get it here.<br/><br/>But The Hurt Locker still does its trick. The actors are great, I loved Jeremy Renner, his character was really interesting, especially in the end. Visually, it's... interesting. I think with shooting in documentary style, if you will, it's risky, because some will love and others will hate it. I personally liked it and I think it fit the movie but I understand that not everyone will like it.<br/><br/>In the end The Hurt Locker is a good film and I'm not sorry that I bought the DVD. I'm happy that this won the Best Picture award because it takes you right there where the soldiers are. In the heat, the desert. What shocked me the most, was how the soldiers keep on living there. Their life doesn't stop or anything because they're in the middle of the war. It just alters a little, but it's life. Their life. and that was more shocking and sad for me than anything else there."
"joff-8","3","11","15","21 March 2010"," What a disappointment
","After all the hype, nominations and awards, this film was a terrible disappointment. It is a well-shot action film set against the background of the war in Iraq. The main character is an emotionally stunted adrenaline junkie who risks the lives of his comrades again and again and again. Military experts have asserted that in the real world such a person would be relieved of his post. However, in this film a senior officer praises the ""wild man"" for being just that.<br/><br/>The script is extremely shallow and at times unbelievable. During a counseling session, an army psychologist advises a troubled young specialist that he should think of this as a good time of his life and that it can be ""fun"". <br/><br/>In another rare moment of actual dialog, a sympathetic soldier laments that if he dies no one would care except for his parents, and they ""don't count"".

"aaronrourke","9","135","249","5 March 2009"," Exceptional War Film
","After a long break, director Kathryn Bigelow returns with 'The Hurt Locker', and shows why she is one of the most exciting film-makers working today.<br/><br/>Following a particular bomb squad currently serving in Iraq, the film shows the conflict on a number of different levels. From the ground-level troops, to the commanding officers, to the civilians who witness every intense stand-off on a daily basis, 'The Hurt Locker' puts the viewer on the front line.<br/><br/>Where other war-related films revel in the action-orientated battle scenes, Bigelow deliberately drains all the excitement and popcorn approach from the scenes involving gunplay and bombings, making for a much more natural, realistic effect.<br/><br/>The interaction between the U.S soldiers is first-rate, showing how the Bush government's ham-fisted invasion of Iraq has affected the troops' effectiveness on the ground, and its alliance with Iraqi civilians.<br/><br/>Performances are perfect. Jeremy Renner is excellent as Staff Sergeant James, who loves the rush of disarming bombs, even if it means putting his fellow soldiers at risk. Anthony Mackie is great as the level-headed Sanborn, while Brian Geraghty scores strongly as Eldridge, who admires both James and Sanborn, but can't decide which side to take.<br/><br/>A great companion piece to Brian DePalma's criminally under-rated 'Redacted', 'The Hurt Locker' is an incredibly vivid, technically brilliant drama that shows that the people who suffer the most during war are the ones who have to experience it first-hand, and that a war plan half-completed can only lead to disaster. It is also great to see Kathryn Bigelow ('Near Dark'/'The Loveless'/'Strange Days'/'Point Break'/'K-19 : The Widowmaker') back, showing once again what a terrific film-maker she is."
"wolverinesforever","10","32","52","5 January 2010"," Intense and thrilling, with few lulls. One of the year's best.
","Set in 2004, ""The Hurt Locker"" follows three men: James (Jeremy Renner), Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Eldrige (Brian Geraghty. James is an efficient though possibly reckless EOD who lives for disarming bombs. Sanbord is a by the book commander who frequently conflicts with James. Eldridge is stuck with them, but he's anxious to get home. Together, they go out on missions to defuse roadside (or car-trunk) bombs and ensure no one gets hurt or killed in the process.<br/><br/>Right away, Bigelow amps up the tension and never lets it up. From the moment Guy Pearce is killed trying to set off a bomb in the first scene, you know that anyone is vulnerable at anytime. This isn't going to be a predictable Hollywood war (or action) story with stars staying alive until the end or people avoiding explosions simply by not being in the ring of fire. Anyone is vulnerable, even from a long distance away.<br/><br/>One sequence after another involves the three men trying to defuse bombs, and each sequence is as intense as the first. It's not that there's a ton of violence in the picture; don't get me wrong, guns get shot and bombs go off. It's that you have to wait five, ten, maybe fifteen minutes for the next hit. For the entire runtime, my eyes were wide open and sometimes I had to catch my breath because the tension was so constant and unbroken. Any wrong move, and it would be their last.<br/><br/>The script, written by Mark Boal, expertly allows the characters to be defined by their actions. Although he doesn't have many expository scenes, you still get to know the characters quite well through their actions on the field and with each other. This is especially well done in the contrasts between James and Sanborn. Of course, great characterization would mean little without great casting, and Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty give their characters three dimensions. Renner, in particular, does a fantastic job showing James to be an efficient though admittedly cocky OED without turning him into a gung-ho soldier.<br/><br/>Another strength to this film is the lack of dialogue. Some war films get far too talky for their own good, or lose their direction because they're trying to insert too many ""clever"" conversations (QT, I'm looking right at you). Boal does not make that mistake; the characters only say enough. The lack of dialogue usually helps increase the tension, such as in one scene where the three men try to ferret out a bomber and have to use many visual signals to keep communication clear.<br/><br/>Bigelow's direction is magnificent. Her mastery of keeping tension up was such that before I knew it, I was scanning the screen looking for guns or hand signals or any kinds of incoming threats, just like the soldiers. She has created a war film that keeps the conflict high and allows you to immerse yourself with the characters and their plight. I hope that she becomes the first woman to win Best Director Oscar, but even if she doesn't, she's still made a film for the ages. ""The Hurt Locker"" knocks you out with it's unflinching look at life in the Army and even makes you think if we, as a country, constantly want to test our strength against the so-called ""Hurt Locker"" like James."
"Theo Robertson","8","22","34","11 January 2011"," The Academy Got It Right
","THE HURT LOCKER is a film that only got a limited worldwide release but opened to unanimous praise from critics . Nine months after its release it was up against AVATAR at the Academy Awards . . AVATAR's worldwide gross at the time of writing stands at 2.78 billion dollars whilst THE HURT LOCKER has grossed a grand total of 49 million dollars . It was classic battle of David vs Goliath and David slew Goliath winning six Oscars including best picture and best director compared with AVATAR's three minor Oscars . A lot of people have given up on the Oscars over the last couple of decades but like the year when CRASH beat BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN the Academy voters have rehabilitated themselves by giving the best picture to the film that deserved it the most . This film deserved to soundly beat Cameron's movie .<br/><br/>!!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Some people of a military background have criticised the film for a lack of realism in operational matters and having never served in a conflict I'll take their word for it . What is important in film making is artistic license , similar to John Ford's mantra of "" Always print the legend "" but the film does suffer slightly from incidents that don't ring true such as Sgt James holding a suspected insurgent t gunpoint and making him drive to a characters house only for him to hike through downtown Baghdad back to base . There's also another unlikely event where Sgt James gets two colleagues to follow him in to a dangerous district without any backup . I realise this is character development where James is becoming more addicted to the conflict but one can't help feeling screenwriter Mark Boal could have done this in a more successful way because it does jar somewhat <br/><br/>That said the other aspects of the film work superbly . Kathryn Bigelow directs in a cinema verity way with hand held cameras and sharp elliptical editing and use of sound . One noticeable use of sound is a gun battle in the desert . A bullet from a modern assault rifle travels roughly three times the speed of sound and accordingly the old cliché that "" you never hear the bullet that kills you "" happens here , and it's much more effective than cinematic convention a character falls down dead as a gunshot in the distance rings out . The scene also makes good use of lighting . There's no time frame on the scene but you can tell it happens over a considerable period due to the sun light dulling . How many times have you seen this type of sequence and it always seems to take place in real time <br/><br/>Films about the war in Iraq have performed poorly in box office terms and THE HURT LOCKER is no exception . It does stand head and shoulders above its fellows down to the critical praise it has garnished . I had previously thought that Nick Broomfields THE BATTLE OF HADITHA was the best film featuring Iraq but Bigelow's movie overtakes it . Interestingly both films try not to bring too much politics in it and whilst Broomfield has scene where a Jihadist cleric is overjoyed that civilians have been killed by the Americans , THE HURT LOCKER sees an Iraqi civilian used as a proxy bomb .

No real plot, all wishy washy... As for the realism in the use of their props, especially the devices and their make-up, very unbelievable and also completely inaccurate. Apart from that, the acting was not bad at all! I speak form years of experience in the military by the way. This movie is only recommended for people that have NO idea on how the military actually operates. If you have any experience at all do not waste your time."

I'm sure that was a big reason I was completely wired at the end of the movie (it was the 3rd of the day at TIFF, and probably helped me stay awake for the last one).<br/><br/>Another great effort by Bigelow. And I'd never heard of the 3 leads but was glad they went with no-names to tell the story of everyday hero soldiers.

"carsick_carl","2","86","155","2 February 2010"," Absolute Mess
","Not to knock this film too much, the bomb disposal scenes are gripping and full of tension, and the camera work is good. But that's it, the rest is a mess! It's directed by Kathryn Bigelow and details the chronological story of a bomb disposal team operating in Iraq with SFC William James (Jeremy Renner), joining as a replacement for the previous disposal expert. Renner's a maverick and loves the job. He doesn't play by the book and that appears to cause tension in the team initially. And this where confusion and disjointed story lines start to evolve? What's up the Iraqi driver standoff with Renner's character whilst he's on his way to defuse a bomb? What is Bigelow trying to suggest with Renner's character in a homo erotic position with his sergeant? And what about his team taking out Iraqi snipers one by one while what's presumably the British SAS run away in fear? Renner's character even takes on the role of detective in his spare time and risks his colleague's life to track some bombers down.<br/><br/>This story has too many ""huh, where's the one suppose to go??"" factors. Some scenes are long and drawn out, especially some of the more emotional scenes with Bigelow trying to shape Renner's character portraying him as caring and complex. It just doesn't seem to work or is overdone, especially how he relates with his colleagues.<br/><br/>To put a final point, I don't think it's worthy of an Oscar. If you want to watch it, there are some edge of the seat stuff, but the storyline is disjointed, lacking in direction and some bits that are downright unbelievable."

Jeremy running on the streets alone without being captured and the Eldridge got ambushed with 3 brigades in the neighborhood? <br/><br/>The only saving grace was the credible acting of Jeremy Renner. He did a great job even though his character was not well structured. Was Jeremy an anit-hero? Anti-war? Escaptist? A guy blew up literally in his hand at the end and his partner who was hiding in safety was the one who broke down emotionally? <br/><br/>I am not sure how the academy can award an Oscar to this movie.

"thesar-2","8","19","29","27 June 2009"," Hurt Some More
","War movies have never been my cup of tea, but I decided to give 'The Hurt Locker' a shot (after enormously high ratings and after watching the horrid 'Stop-Loss.') I wasn't disappointed. It had excellent acting – Renner should be nominated for an Oscar, completely believable surroundings, sounds and action and mostly, it was on-the-edge suspenseful. Granted, 1-2 deaths were absolutely predictable (the one in the beginning was such a set up, I unfortunately thought of 'Cliffhanger's opening,) the rest of the solders, you have no idea if they'll live or die, and that's the point of this movie/war. I truly felt as if I was there, and sadly, I had to compare this to my own job that I don't particularly care for. The obvious ""Okay, I guess my job/life ain't that bad"" thoughts surfaced. We have a ('Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs) newcomer/replacement (Renner) after the previously mentioned death of a bomb expert dies. His cowboy, caution-to-the-wind attitude not only upsets his comrades, they want to put an end to it. All the while they spend most of their time deciphering between who's a friendly and who's an insurgent. I don't think any recent war movie I've seen truly made me feel even more respect (although, I felt I already had the highest respect for the U.S. armed forces) and more gratitude that I live in a country so completely unlike any Middle Eastern country. Definitively see 'Locker.' Despite the hate it shows humans show other humans, it really makes you appreciate life all the more. Side note: coincidentally enough, both 'Stop-Loss' and 'Locker' were both modern-war films, directed by women and showed a true enemy: man. However, while you can take 'Locker' serious and learn something from it, the same can't be said by the ""MTV Movie""/music video 'Loss.'"

","While this film contains nothing outstandingly offensive and there is certainly nothing to criticize about the acting and film-making technique, I am troubled by the extreme praise being heaped on this film.<br/><br/>It is a very simplistic film with a narrowly focused story line that overall is carried by the highly charismatic lead (Renner) and the frequent explosions. The effects are low budget and generally adequate but some (e.g., sniper scene) are quite unrealistic. All major issues related to the US invasion of Iraq are ignored. The self-pitying title seems very ironic given the effects of the invasion on the Iraqi population, compared to which the suffering of US personnel has been minuscule.<br/><br/>Many outside the USA will speculate that the film's appeal in the USA has mainly to do with a widespread 'support our troops' mentality and the less widespread but more sinister blind patriotism that infects the nation.<br/><br/>The definitive American film about the 2003 US invasion of Iraq has not been made - if it does appear it will, in part, take proper responsibility for this tragedy."
"ClaytonDavis","10","115","214","27 June 2009"," One of the best war films of the past 25 years...
","Gut-wrenching, pulse-pounding, out of this world tension, just mere exterior descriptions of what Kathryn Bigelow's new film, The Hurt Locker is. Written by Mark Boal, The Hurt Locker overflows with intensity, passion, and reverence. In the wake of 9/11, filmmakers have struggled to create a piece that is socially accepted and respected. Only two films have succeeded in this task over the past eight years; Paul Greengrass' beautiful United 93, depicting an open interpretation of the final moments of the doomed plane and now, Bigelow's film will join the short, elite list.<br/><br/>This character-driven tale tells the stories of three army soldiers who are a part of the most dangerous of jobs to offer in the military, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), in plainer terms, they disarm bombs. Staff Sergeant William James played ferociously by Jeremy Renner heads up this story as a soldier facing death every moment of the day. With his wife and child at home and often displaying unorthodox behavior, James seems fit for a war soldier. Sergeant JT Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie is a by-the-book man, living his days at war while incurring losses along the way. Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty is young, bewildered, and thrust into a situation unknowing of the impact it would have. What these three men bring to their respective roles educates the viewer of the horrors of war. Forget what you think you know on CNN and your local news, Bigelow is running the show with Boal out on assignment and Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty as our anchors. <br/><br/>The crews of the picture are the tools in building this powerful vessel. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd uses his four camera use to keep us feeling like a first-person account of the events of the film. The mesh of Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders score and the sound effects team makes for a more suspenseful experience. Filming in Jordan was the choice of Bigelow to give it a more authentic feel. ""If you're going to make a film about the Middle East, make it in the Middle East."" Bigelow said to me after the film. It paid off big time because I always felt like I was there in the battle zone, enduring pain, torment, and dehydration. <br/><br/>With a NY & LA release set for Friday, June 26th, The Hurt Locker's deserves all the praise its been receiving and should be experienced by any movie lover. The Oscar Prospects might look a little grim based on the summer release but with no real first-half of 2009 contenders, Bigelow and her film have strong chances of taking a spot amongst the final five come end of the year. Renner and Mackie will also be strong contenders in their respective categories. The strongest possibility for an Oscar has to be for writer Mark Boal. The research he did for the film alone will keep Boal in the minds of voters. The Hurt Locker's striking cinematography, crisp editing that keeps it at a heart palpating pace, strong performances, directing, and writing is enough to take this film in consideration for your viewing. Brilliant, simply brilliant.<br/><br/>****/****"

","This is a movie without any story, just a compilation of scenes with the same characters. A lot of it doesn't make much realistic sense. There is no plot, no objective, and very little character development. While each individual scene is kind of stressful there is nothing that ties any of it together (except perhaps the same characters, who are not very interesting) Although there seems to be some knowledge of the aspects of war, the script is immature, unable to produce any compelling drama. If you watch the first ten minutes then you've seen the whole movie. At some points it seems like it comes close to developing a plot but nothing materializes and we are back at square one. There was some good camera work at times and some good direction, highlighting the silences in a hypnotic way. Overall this is a pass."

","A cheap movie on a sensitive subject capitalizing on the patriotic stupidity of some people. Shot as a documentary for unknown reasons (maybe just budget).

On the other hand, almost all Iraqis are criminals and if they are not then for some reason they are involved in criminal activities (sometimes as victims).<br/><br/>The characters don't seem real, their relationships are strange.

I am enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but i stress i do not have any military experience nor am i a marine but i feel this movie does a terrible injustice to the brave men and women who put on the uniform and serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. This movie does not accurately portray soldiers in theatre at all. I don't have military experience but i have watched the news and a ton of shows on the military channel and i even know that #1 you always go on missions in a convoy not in a three man team where you have one Humvee thats protection relies on a specialist throwing a water bottle at the back of another vehicle that is blocking them. #2 that no one ever goes outside the wire by themselves to investigate if indeed their friendly base rat has gone missing or is lieing dead with a bomb in his chest. and #3 i would like to think that an EOD's last resort is to put on their protective suit and try to dismantle an explosive by hand. I would like to think that they would do everything in their power to make that a last resort.<br/><br/>Those are just major points that i found disturbing about a movie being proclaimed as the Greatest WAR MOVIE OF THE DECADE??? The minor details that aren't accurate number so greatly that i don't have the time to write it all out.<br/><br/>In closing if you want a great account of what life is like in a war zone i recommend the HBO series GENERATION KILL it is by far one of the best war related presentations that i have ever seen."

I guess pentagon paid them of because according to this movie the money is apparently not spend on reprimanding team leaders that recklessly endanger their men. What I do know is that this movie is soooo slow. So much time spend slowly panning the camera and looking at the same scene. Nothing seems to happen for hours at a time. I've read that some people liked the ""action"". For an American movie and a bomb centered one at that there is a surprisingly few explosions or action in general. I believe you see four explosions if you count the 2 training explosions that they set off in the desert. Everything just happens sooo slowly. I realize this might be what defusing bombs is ideally like (slow). But my god is it boring. Zero suspense. Most movies have so much content that they make a directors cut with all the stuff they just couldn't squeeze into the film. This one has so little content it might be remade as an episode of CSI Iraq and still retain all content. I like the cereal scene though =)"

","Hurt locker, really? This movie has been receiving rave reviews everywhere but am I the only one finding it missing the mark? Don't get me wrong, the technical aspects of the movie are well done, good cinematography, sound, and the action scenes quite tense, especially the bomb disposal scenes with lead actor Renner. The sentimental portrayal from the actors are OK, the comradeship is just passable but overall, the movie was overly emotional, some aspects of it dragging on too long. Not sure where the director is trying to take us most of the time. <br/><br/>However, some of the storyline is unbelievable, like the one with Ralph Fiennes, presumably a crack British SAS squad on an undercover mission. Ambushed by Iraqi snipers, one by one they get taken out until the rest of the squad runs off in fear leaving Renner and his team taking on the snipers by themselves. They manage to knock all the snipers out. Are Iraqi snipers and British SAS that incompetent? And what was with the suggested homo-erotic behaviour in the bedroom? Or the lone Iraqi driver in a tense standoff with Renner in the middle of a cordoned off road? <br/><br/>OK war movie and as mentioned earlier, well shot and tense, didn't feel any subliminal political message.

","Let me preface this by saying I am a two time Iraq war veteran (infantry), so my experience with the movie will be different from others.<br/><br/>I found the characters to be compelling, interesting, and complex, and their interactions with each other to be well done. However, I found the plot which creates those interactions to be absolutely preposterous. They put the characters into situations that no Army unit would ever be put in, ever. I have a great deal of respect for the soldiers of EOD, as their jobs are incredibly stressful in regards to the risk of secondary IEDs (that were not found), ambushes, and their never ending work load. However, I am sorry to say that in Iraq, they do not generally defuse bombs. They simply blow them up, with robots and a lot of C4.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I think this movie had some of the best Iraqi city sets that I've ever seen, and they rang very true to life for me. Unfortunately, virtually every plot point just screamed fake.<br/><br/>There are certainly very real, very compelling stories that realistically portray the Iraq war (such as Generation Kill). The Hurt Locker however, was not one of them.

","I had high expectations for this film after all the critical praise it's received. It's probably because of this that I was initially disappointed by the film's first act. The shaky hand-held camera work feels like a gimmick that made it difficult to follow the action or get a good sense of each scene's setting. When the main character, Will James, is introduced, he seems like an over-the-top caricature that belongs in Top Gun or some other 80s action flick rather than an Iraq war movie that looks like it's trying to achieve a tone of gritty realism.<br/><br/>Luckily for us, the audience, things get much better. It was a great creative decision to have the narrative follow a team of bomb specialists. Pretty much everything they do is interesting. Once the film hits its stride, the drama and suspense are powerful and nearly non-stop.<br/><br/>The characters, which border on being clichÃ©s at the beginning, thankfully become developed to the point where they feel dynamic, sympathetic, and, most importantly, believable.<br/><br/>I find it likely that the main character's name is a nod to William James, one of the founders of modern psychology. This is fitting, since it seems like the film's main purpose is to draw the viewer into the psychological realities of war: the excitement, the fear, the post-traumatic stress, the tensions and camaraderie between soldiers, the constant vigilance for an enemy that blends in with Iraqi civilians, and the American soldiers' disconnectedness from their former lives as civilians.<br/><br/>And the shaky camera work that I hated at first grew on me as the film drew me further into these psychological realities. Whereas a steady, patient camera might make the actors' performances and interactions feel melodramatic or unnatural, the hand-held cameras refuse to linger on a man's face as he's enduring life-or-death anxiety or going through emotional turmoil, which ultimately makes the dramatic moments feel more authentic.<br/><br/>All in all, I strongly recommend this film. I'm not sure if it will have enough long-term staying power to become a classic of the genre, but it's certainly a worthwhile use of 2 hours' time and the price of admission."

","Best Picture of 2009, according to the Academy. It also won best director and best original screenplay out of the so called Big Five.<br/><br/>I don't see it. I have no idea why this movie got so many awards, so many recommendations, so much critical praise. Is it a bad film? No, not at all. It's in fact rather good film, fully capturing the intensity of a bomb squad. I just wouldn't call it the best picture of the year, not even close.<br/><br/>Still, it does some things very well. As stated, it is very intense from time to time. Every time one of the characters has to don on the bomb suit, the atmosphere picks up instantly. You can feel the claustrophobia, the detachment from the outside world, and I enjoyed those scenes very much. Most of the bomb situations are also creative and different enough to be interesting and I have to applaud the choice to film near actual war zone as it does add to the setting. It's a fine-looking film and the two sound-related Academy Awards were well-earned in my opinion.<br/><br/>My biggest issues with this film lie with its characters. Director Kathryn Bigelow clearly tried to show us the detachment from reality that plagues these bomb squad members even outside their suits, but unfortunately I ended up being detached from them as well. I managed to form no connection with them, because none of them acted like a normal human being - at least in my opinion. They were there to illustrate a point, to act out the story and because they needed to be there, but they felt hollow and empty. At the end of the story I could say that I had enjoyed the scenery and some of the action scenes, but that I hadn't really learned anything new about war or its conditions.<br/><br/>But perhaps that's just my failing as a viewer. Still, reviews are meant to illustrate the experiences of a particular viewer, and this one is mine. I don't particularly like this film.

There were scenes full of pointless dialogue, that seemed to be trying to communicate something but failing. Most of the acting was flat, with the exception of the protagonist which delivered a good performance despite having little to work with.<br/><br/>Given the resources it would have taken to make this movie, something interesting and resonant could have been made instead of the safe, lumbering piece it ended up being.

","Sorry, but I'm not drinking the new Kool Aid flavor of the month and hoping on board one of the hundreds of band wagons crammed with movie loving folks praising The Hurt Locker to the high heavens. Hats off to Bigelow for getting a slick film up on the screen for 11 million dollars (if that was indeed the true cost), but I'm stunned at the critical and public acclaim that this film has garnered. Twenty minutes into this implausible, almost laughingly inaccurate movie I was dying for the whole cast to wind up on the wrong side of the mother of all IED's so I could retreat for the theater exit. What's the problem? I think I know. In our mediocre, pop culture infused world of contemporary film-making, movie lovers and critics alike adore their roller coaster rides in the darkness of their local cinema or the comfort of their living rooms with their precious screener copies blasting away on their big screens. Ms. Bigelow tosses about all her primitive, macho infused, adrenaline rushing film techniques to keep her audience on the edge of their seats and turns an otherwise formulaic story with cookie cutter characters and tired predictable plot lines into something everybody thinks they should love. The setting in wartime Iraq seems to give this movie some sort of intelligent and moral high ground that it should sit on a cinematic pedestal as a gripping and defining film of the conflict. What utter nonsense. This film is so divorced from reality. Current and former soldiers of the Iraq War have roundly criticized it as a piece of Hollywood drivel. And well they should slam it for all the posturing and posing it has been doing lately on the red carpet. Shame on director Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal for dressing up a serious and deadly affair in history with all the usual Hollywood dramarama fluff and candy, letting the public lap it up and calling it entertainment. Their small minded talents and simplistic material was better suited for Lethal Weapon 5 or Point Break 2. And shame on the public for not taking the time and energy to educate themselves on even the most basic realities of the war in Iraq and wander out of the theater as I did, shaking their heads and wondering when someone's going to start making movies that avoid the amusement park and entertain us with intelligence and keen observation."

No military would have tolerated such immature heroic behaviors in an active war zone for more than a day.

This movie failed to create any remotely believable characters or scenarios. Half way through the movie, I was stunned in disbelief in how something like this could be nominated, and even won, the best picture of 2010, or ever.<br/><br/>To be fair I would probably rated this movie 3 out of 10 because I do enjoy the performance from Renner for whatever plots he had left to work with.

"ironhorse_iv","7","5","6","4 June 2013"," Hurt to say this, but Hurt Locker might not be 'da bomb' as what people think it is. Still a good movie.
","Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was one of the most accurate depictions of the war in Iraq. The look and feel of living on the edge as a bomb disposal team during the Iraq War seem realistic, but once again, Hollywood love portray soldiers as undisciplined suicidal cowboys. Most bomb disposal are 99% detonate by remote controlled robot, not a guy in a bomb suit. Still, homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were such a problem that most of the deaths of Iraq War for American soldiers was cause by them. During the summer of 2004, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) had to deal with them with his partner team of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Elbridge (Brian Geraghty) and that's pretty much sums up the plot. In my opinion, I don't know if this movie really deserve the Best Picture Award that year. It was a good movie, but not it's no way the best film that year. Up didn't win because it's hard for animated movies to find Best Picture. Inglorious Basterds was probably too out there for the Academy and last Avatar was probably too much of a sci-fi. Most of the other movies didn't have much of a fighting chance. I wouldn't say the character of William James is likable, he is just a 1991's Point Break character put into the Iraq War just there to search for the ultimate physical rush. He is egotistical fool who runs into danger not caring about how it impacts those around him and couldn't give two craps about his family. I just found it so anticlimactic. It's not like he learn anything new by the end of the film, like valuing his life, or the lives of others. At less, they could have gave him a good reason to be such a war buff similar to Eric Bana's character of SFC Norm ""Hoot"" Gibson in 2001's Black Hawk Down. He is not a hero in a conventional sense. At less, this movie help discover the actors Jeremy Renner, and Anthony Mackie. The movie nearly didn't get made, due to production problems while filming in Jordan, but Director Katherine Bigelow got it done. The action scenes were pretty good in my opinion. I think the movie is great would been better if they use more of the paranoia of bombs going off any minute. While I do like the sniper scene toward the middle of the film, I think its turn away from what made this movie interesting. It's a war movie about the bomb squad with a lot of suspense. That sniper scene would work better in a normal war film about infantry soldiers, not here. Plus that scene made the British SAS (Special Air Service) look horrible compare to the U.S Soldiers. The movie isn't pro war or against the war in Iraq, it's just tells the story of the soldiers who happen to be there. I do have to agree that the film serves as the most effective recruiting vehicles for the U.S. Army bomb squad for anybody seeking an adrenaline rush. Response among veterans are mixed, as most of them think it's a good film with a few military inaccuracies. The dialogue in the film is very limited. There is a lot of scenes with little to nothing said. I do like the scene with Colonel Reed (David Morse) and William James talking about his career. Overall: it was well-acted, probably one of the best film about the Iraq War, but just need a little bit of retouching to make it as good as other war films."
"ShowMeTheCredits","2","5","6","31 March 2012"," Nothing in here to like
","It's beyond me how this movie was even nominated for any of the many many awards it ended up winning.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this film that it's difficult to put down in words.<br/><br/>One of the bigger blunders would be the character writing. Where's our protagonist, the ""hero"", the one we're supposed to identify with and care about? Not a single human being in this movie is likable. They range from dead-weight bystanders to intensely annoying main characters whom you wish to just die and go away. I think the most interesting and likable character in this film would be the suit that the bomb guys put on. That's actually pretty nice, and it seems to be the most intelligent one of the bunch as well.<br/><br/>The actual protagonist is portrayed as a severely unintelligent, selfish and self-serving bastard who is so careless and stupid that in real life he would more likely have killed himself trying to tie his shoelaces than supposedly having successfully disarmed 800-and-some bombs in OED and lived to tell about it.<br/><br/>It's pathetically obvious what the movie tries to tell us, but it's so poorly written, directed, and acted out, that the points it ultimately brings across is that we should fear the bomb disarmers rather than the bomb makers. The bomb makers, apparently, make the most retarded bombs that they either choose not to blow up or try blow up in the most inconvenient way at the least fortunate (for the bomb maker) moment in the most obvious and public way possible. The bomb disarmers, however, will try their hardest to get as many people in the line of shrapnel fire and to make everything go as wrong as possible.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect example of how bad script writers will force dramatic scenarios into existence without feeling any need to justify the events happening or even create the logical chain that should lead the story to them.<br/><br/>Ah, can't stomach writing more about this. Just don't watch it, it's ignorant, annoying, unrealistic, and a terrible waste of time and money."

","Deaspite its aesthetically pleasing action scenes and beautiful landscapes, the storyline and characterization present in this film are filled with cliché themes, egregious errors, and ridiculous assumptions about military operations in the modern era. The plot of this movie is predicated upon the experiences of Sgt. James, a ""wild man"" who has tremendous skill in the art of ordinance disposal. James and his two fellow team members; Sanbourne and Eldridge, form an EOD team who diffuse IEDs and seem to roam freely and without any escort across Baghdad. My main issue with this film is its unrealistic portrayal of combat operations. An EOD team of 3 men would never travel across Baghdad without an escort, would never find itself clearing buildings, would never be left on its own to secure a possible IED, would never engage an Iraqi sniper, and, for that matter, and EOD trained buck Sergeant would never have the ability to effectively use a sniper rifle. Not only that, but an Iraqi sniper would never have the skill of the one shown in the film. And a British special forces team would never be picked apart by a hostile sniper while under the cover of a ridgeline and then be saved by a three man EOD team. And the opening scene really gets me. An man holding a cell phone in the vicinity of an IED, an area which should be cleared of all civilians, would be shot immediately. Throughout the movie, the EOD team display numerous lapses in discipline, fail to aknowledge basic tactical considerations in the deployment of their team, and do not operate effectively or safely. These errors show the lack of research or care by the director in understanding how the military operates. Clearly this Oscar chasing w**** has a burning desire to outshine her husband and sacrifice realism for cliché action scenes that appeal to only the most idiotic movie goers in America."

","Zero characterisation. Zero structure (a succession of sketches). Zero creativity. Since I did not care for the protagonist, I did not give a damn whether he would explode or not. There is much more stake and therefore much more suspense in “Juggernaut” (1974), another film with bomb disposal experts. Certain elements of “The hurt locker” do not make sense. Why does the first terrorist wait till the bomb disposal expert is leaving the premises to detonate his bomb ? Why does the protagonist not want to use the robot on his first mission ? How does he know the bomb is not radio activated ? One scene, the ambush in the desert, is totally unbelievable. The snipers manage to kill three soldiers from far away with plain portable machine guns when the protagonists have a hard time hitting them with a mounted machine gun. The fact that the protagonist is addicted to adrenaline is said several times in the movie but hardly shown. A little bit at the end when the protagonist prefers to return to Irak than shop with his wife and take care of his son. Which tells so much about the authors’ philosophy. One can feel very alive raising a child or working on one’s couple. It does not boil down to choosing cereals or making jacks in the boxes appear. On top of all this, the climax, if this is one, is very poor and the film carries a few clichés. Lastly, if there was a movie that proved that eratic camera shots and zoomings will never make a film alive, this is the one. ""The hurt locker"" is dead. The fact that American “professionals” are about to honor this movie is extremely saddening."

","I approached this film with great excitement and expectation but walked away deflated, and disappointed. Which is not to say that it is without merit. The action scenes are superb, the tension often on a hair trigger. But there is a curious lack of cohesion about it all which lets it down.<br/><br/>The set pieces are well crafted, what lies between is not. Jeremy Renner does well as hero defuser Sgt James. Perhaps too well. His egocentric character alienates those around him on screen, and the audience alike leaving little to warm to. A desert shoot out sequence involving English contractors is fine action, but appears to have been spliced in at random. A bomb disposal tale depends for its success upon the audience rooting for the heroes, and there is little to root for. The excessive use of non-static camera work I found irritating, and distracting, often the sign that a Director has chosen to jazz up the realism by making the perspective wobble a bit. It doesn't, it is just tiresome.<br/><br/>It took America a long time to get to grips with Vietnam at the cinema, but this is no Deer Hunter / Platoon/ Apocalypse Now or Hamburger Hill. In moving away from banal self- justification for the war in Iraq, it is a step in the right direction, but no more.<br/><br/>Director Katherine Bigelow's last feature, the excellent k-19 Widowmaker scored on narrative and characterisation, both big minuses here. This assessment swims in the face of popular sentiment on release i know. But this is how i see it."
"Polaris_DiB","8","13","20","24 July 2010"," The New Arena
","Sometimes, we take war for granted. Between arguing about its inevitability and lack thereof, there is also the constant debate over wars' similarities to previous engagements, the historical justifications, mistakes, and results of previously wars, and the analysis of wars' evolution through theory, technology, and influence. Since filmmaking arrived, a social relationship to war has changed as visions of the actual carnage have been brought back to viewers, a constant redefining of social relationships between cultures during wartime up to the infamous Desert Storm, the ultimate post-modern climax point of war AS entertainment, virtual reality, and institutional product wrapped up in full media exposure and alienating digitized distance. However, the essential thing people miss when they get caught up in these ideas is the point where regardless of whatever people believe about the ""essential nature"" of war or otherwise, and no matter how planned out the engagement from the military's side, or the training of the military thereof, each war, unfortunately, is very different.<br/><br/>Iraq has provided filmmakers with another opportunity to bring up age-old questions about wars anew, but the relative failure of previous Iraq War films to stick, I believe, is because most of the new films are fundamentally structured around previously developed war films and their respective themes, meaning for the last seven years people have been desperately trying to turn Iraq into a visual desert-arena Vietnam. With a new arena, however, comes a new structure, and Bigelow actually points directly to the specific difficulties in this contemporary engagement. Choosing to relegate thematic statements to second-tier, Bigelow's interest is in the arena itself, and the anxiety and fear of a core group of soldiers attempting to navigate a foreign maze of booby traps among a foreign civilization of nearly undecipherable motivations.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a thriller structured with a classic horror trope: within the first five minutes, the film's arguably biggest name star is killed off, and from there the audience is invited to guess at the rate of survival of the remaining cast. However, in most horror films the unknown revealed is the first step towards resolution and understanding of the ""monster"", whereas in The Hurt Locker, the soldiers' dawning understanding of the source of their conflict is met with uncertainty, indecision, and downright paranoia. James begins brash and under control, with enough experience to navigate the most web-like of demolitions, only to slowly fall apart as even the simplest relationships become a cross-confusion of static and misinterpretation. His impatience with radio communication at the beginning, in that regards, is significant: he goes into this engagement with no desire to understand, but only to do a mission. By the end, his own motivations and emotional addictions are in full question, and he is unable to remove his sense of mission from his own identity from the trauma of constant uncertainty.<br/><br/>As for the actual motivations of the Americans themselves, the movie is a little more straight-forward. Bigalow's presentation of them is balanced basically because she lets them be selfish, kind, arrogant, and completely disturbed as the action goes along, rather than firmly placing any character into type from frame one. More importantly than tracing a specific character arc, Bigelow instead makes the movie a series of specific engagements, from IED set-ups to cross-sniper fire, from kidnapping to being kidnapped, and then formulates the characters' relationships to each other from there. In each new ""day"" presented as the end of their service draws near is a new set-up for the characters to begin trying to understand again, both with the enemy and each other, and ultimately no clear standard of engagement is presented. This is exactly representative of the strenuous advance as it has been reported in Iraq, as each and every new day provides completely new conflicts for the soldiers to work out.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

It was only afterwards, when I sat down to read some of the reviews written by combat veterans that I had my suspicions confirmed.

(Perhaps not a ten because it's not exactly what I go for in films).<br/><br/>The movie is: About EOD (Emergency Ordnance Disposal). Pretty much bomb squads from the military. An undermanned special forces in the Army, Navy, etc. I know this first hand. (No, I was not EOD). EOD is undermanned is due to drop out or the more likely: Kick out ratio. People just can't cut it. So this is about a diverse sort of human being willing to risk it all to disarm bombs on a daily basis in Iraq (But also all over the world).<br/><br/>The movie doesn't go into the diverse or (simple) mechanics of disarming bombs, just the extravagance of disarming them with heart pumping stress of not just WILL THE BOMB GO OFF, but WILL INSURGENTS STRIKE WHILE DISARMING.<br/><br/>You join a bomb squad consisting of a motley crew (Wildman who disarms the bombs, and two subordinates of a strong hearted rational sarge, with a confused and scared/traumatized specialist). This crew isn't to develop some contrast of a 'weaker' link who sets back the team. Instead it's about their development and wild rides of the day to day job of an EOD squad.<br/><br/>But if you're weary of a movie that drags on with multiple bomb-diffusions, the characters if not enough to make you watch this and you want a good army-action scene, there is a sniper-stand off that makes the movie more intriguing. And you're still juvenile to the thought. The sniper rifle used is a Barret 50 cal. (Don't ask me why they had a 50 cal and not the standard issued m21). Either way it's amazing.<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie is a great story of true stories and realistic lives in Hostile Iraq. The bomb scenes are very gripping and develop well instead of slow and boring. The characters are already unfolded, so their development is only even more climactic. Also, Jeremy Renner is an amazing starring role and is upsetting to see he hasn't done more movies in the past as the hero. Damned SWAT. Check this out if you're into modern-warfare films or wanted a more enthralling JARHEAD film. (Not to say Jarhead sucked, I liked it a lot, but I also read the book).

But that is about its only flaw, and if you can overlook that we are talking epic war movies here.<br/><br/>The film draws you in from the get go as we follow the episodic adventures of a team of bomb disposal experts filmed (documentary style) on the streets of an unnamed Iraqui city.<br/><br/>The insurgents will go to any extremes (hence why they're known as extremists I guess) to ply their dirty trade, most gut-wrenchingly by creating a human bomb out of a murdered 10 year old boy (maybe it should have been called a cadaver bomb).<br/><br/>It's pretty much a three man performance but the acting plaudits go principally to Jeremy Renner, a died in the wool adrenalin freak, and his more considered colleague, played by Anthony Mackie. I am not familiar with either of their work previously but both deliver measured and moving performances.<br/><br/>The central axis of the film is around Renner's character SSgt William James who has defused over 800 bombs and approaches the task with a bravado that terrifies his more conservative colleagues. (In fact the movie's opening line essentially captures his ethos; ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" )But he always gets the job done in the most difficult situations. He's positioned as a cold and callous redneck but, as often in these movies, the cracks begin to show and an entirely more human soldier emerges which revolves around his relationship with a cheeky young Iraqui market trader (perhaps the only sympathetic Iraqui character in the movie). This ends with a delicious twist that I'll not spoil here.<br/><br/>There is no question that Bigelow deserves her place at the top table come Oscar time and might even win. It would be amusing to see her put one over on ex-husband James Cameron who is probably also in the running for Avatar.<br/><br/>This is a grown up movie with a really powerful hit. It powerfully captures the emotion of war and sense of place that few war movies do (Thin Red Line by Terence Malik being an exception as well as the excellent made for TV movie, Occupation, made earlier this year with James Nesbitt; and also set in Iraq).<br/><br/>A big fat 9 out of 10 from me."

Rarely does a woman captivate the action junkies out there by putting together a series of intense, breath taking scenes and with the lightning fast pace she simply won't let you recover and you'll find yourself glued to the screen for the whole two hours of the movie.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty all gave good performances though not memorable in any way, they carry the sentiments of the soldiers currently serving in the Iraq war and I believe justice is brought to each of their roles. Supporting roles include Ralph Fiennes, who is everywhere right now, Guy Pearce and David Morse. Although much of them are pretty much in only a scene or two, they did pretty well considering. The Hurt Locker is a movie that transcends politics and all that mumbo jumbo. Simply put, this movie is a kickass action pic that grabs you by the throat and won't let go until the end credits roll.

I've seen war movies before. Some good and some bad. I've seen war movies that have effectively tried to convey the way things really are, and have been successful in doing so. But this is the first time I've seen one that actually made me feel like I was there. From the very intense opening, Kathryn Bigelow grabs the audience and does not let them go. She beautifully and meticulously examines the complex realities of war, and she does it in two main ways. First, she does it by providing viewers with an up close and personal experience with combat. Second, and on a deeper level, she examines the effects that war can have on the psyche of a soldier. It's the latter that is the most heartbreaking. When Jeremy Renner's William James gets to go home for a period of time, we can see that he is not ready to be integrated back into society. The cereal isle scene in the super market is especially effective. For him, war has become, as the quote says, a drug. And he's not ready to come down from that high.

And what exactly are the motives of the 3 main troops? Why are they almost always on their own? What were they doing in the middle of the desert when they stumble on a bunch of Brit special forces? What a bunch of nonsense. The action scenes are well done but completely predictable. The dialog between the shrink and the 20 something year old grunt is simply ridiculous! The director stumbles along without a message or a reason.

","After reading all the critics going absolutely gaga for this movie I was excited when it finally came to my town. I'm here to tell you, don't believe all the hype this movie is receiving. This movie is a plot less, pointless, extremely boring movie. The entire movie is nothing but a string of unconnected vignettes. Some more interesting than others, but ultimately none of them advance the story, or lack thereof. There is absolutely no character arc, no plot, no nothing. There's nothing to make me care for the characters or understand their motivations. And you'd think a movie about bomb defusing would be exciting and tense, well with this one, you'd be wrong.

There is not much political bias, and it's really about just war and combat and how some people just feel the calling to fight without fear (and some that do not). While its not as good as ""Saving Private Ryan"", or some of the other greats, I think it belongs in the top 50 of war movies of all time. Several of the scenes are truly suspenseful, and the shaky cam effect was not noticeably overdone."
"tukaima-2","8","12","19","6 June 2010"," Sure it's not realistic...
","Well, I got nothing to lose if nobody agrees with me on this 'board', since I already know they won't! The Hurt Locker is not realistic. I have no military background but even I noticed that there's a lack of command and discipline straight from the get-go. I never really figured out who's higher ranked, James or Sanborn, until probably when I read IMDb.<br/><br/>Now that the general society is aplenty with war movies that are realistic, watching The Hurt Locker is kind of surreal. It's like back in the 80s. Or 90s, if you count Broken Arrow. Now that was a great flick wasn't it? You may get off my review anytime now.<br/><br/>But really if 'realistic' makes a great movie, then they aren't doing such a great job are they. Heck, how realistic are other great war movies on frontlines these days, Avatar? Inglourious Basterds?? Mind you, I love realistic films and I have bought my Band of Brothers boxset and watched it over and over. But we humans must learn to be flexible. Not rigid.<br/><br/>Lots of great movies can be made about the angst of real life soldiers confronted with hierarchy, politics, and command chains. This is not that movie. This is the movie where the characters are free to do what they want, and their emotions and experiences are thus amplified much more greatly because they do what they always wanted to. (Killin' Nazis! wrong movie.) When realism is gone, war becomes an instrument for the soul, which is the highlight of this film. It's not about conquering which Iraqi town, or disarming what highly complicated bombs to advance to what checkpoint, to be performed in duly realistic manner to great dramatic display. It's about how the individuals survive this experience and what do they get out of it? The emotional landscape of a soldier can't get any simpler and harsher. The war may be complicated, but fear, fatigue, these are simple, brutal feelings that peel away the mind of a soldier. You don't need some sensitive, deeply developed characters with a ton of (realistic) backstory to back him up to say that war hurts. It hurts no matter what kind of joe you are from what background. Your life does not matter when it's your helmet, camouflage and guns and sands that you have with you. And people deal with it in drastic different fashions. Some, simply don't. We aren't here to analyze, we are here to observe and feel. Pick a character, and feel for him.<br/><br/>James is a fiction, you should all know that. He wears different hats in this movie, one of the hats is to be the protagonist and someone that you can see the experience through with.<br/><br/>How does it feel to be a guy that got deployed out into war, with a number ""365 days left"" on the back of his mind? I can never say I know, but through this movie, I almost felt I did.<br/><br/>I thought I loved Avatar, but this is closer to heart."

","""The Hurt Locker"", the 2010 Academy Award for Best Picture. While I maintain my soft spot for ""Inglourious Basterds"", and consider it an overall superior film, I am not at all upset at the Academy's choice: ""The Hurt Locker"" is a necessary work, an exposition of the mindless addiction that war can turn into and of the horrors practiced in it. Wonderfully directed, with carefully crafted sound effects and haunting camera movements (indeed, all of the technical Oscars it won were definitely well-deserved -- and don't be fooled by those who mistake the film's lack of clarity for bad directing, for it is only a very successful attempt at reproducing the war atmosphere), this film will pass on a very accurate anxious feeling from the beginning to the very last minute: you will awe, hate and wonder; you will feel both angry and relieved; if you are at all sensitive, you may even feel the urge to shed some tears at a couple of particularly well-achieved moments.<br/><br/>Original and overall extremely successful at what it attempts to convey, this film does have a stronger social/political message than ""Inglourious Basterds"": so, in spite of my personal preference for the latter, I must admit that I'm glad for the exposition this Oscar will give it, and can only hope that many people (especially the right people) will watch it and learn from it.<br/><br/>PS: Yes, this film WAS directed by a woman.

"ruby_fff","9","12","19","8 October 2009"," Excellent engrossing film: you are not exactly seeing a war movie - you are watching highly-skilled professionals at work, literally in front and behind the cameras
","It's not so much that director-producer Kathryn Bigelow's film ""The Hurt Locker"" (with realistic screenplay by journalist and producer Mark Boal) is an intensely suspenseful war action docudrama, but that it is an intimately close look at three professional persons being seriously good at what they do as technicians of a special bomb unit, what their everyday life at work is about, and the time and place happen to be in 2004 Iraq. That is saying a mouthful. Bigelow and her expert film-making team have delivered exactly so: a remarkably perceptive insider view into the workings of the three main characters. Perfect casting of Jeremy Renner as Staff Sgt. William James - the one and only, master of his trade, flawless and grounded yet very much a human man; Anthony Mackie as Sgt. J.T. Sanborn - the stoic, staunch soldier man not at all invulnerable; Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge - the one that brings us all back to earth, the joys and pains.<br/><br/>The storyline and scenarios are complicated, technically difficult, yet the expert attention to the challenging sets and locations, action details definitively show the relentless efforts behind this extraordinary and important film. (More superlatives.) You won't have time thinking of superlatives as the film is so engrossing, and the pace kept going, that you can practically feel the intensity, the pressure, the danger, the anguish, and 'whew!' you get to breathe only when the characters get to breathe.<br/><br/>This film covers every sense of the following words: intensity, intelligence, expertise, exactitude, explosives, details, death, uncertainty, camaraderie, family - yes, it's a mouthful. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a rare diamond of a film that needs to be seen, experienced and appreciated. Kudos to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, and ""The Hurt Locker"" cast and production team - so impressively real are the sound effects, camera close-up's, sets and extras, editing must be murderously precise! <br/><br/>Note about the film title is found on the official site 'thehurtlocker-movie.com': ""In Iraq, it is soldier vernacular to speak of explosions as sending you to 'the hurt locker'."" The ever so slight of a Hollywood touch might be attributed to brief appearances related to the plot, that of Guy Pearce (Sgt. Matt Thompson), Ralph Fiennes (Contractor Team Leader), and David Morse (Col. Reed). Good to see their participation and support to Bigelow's film!"
"ruffinelli_ro","1","6","8","2 June 2010"," Disappointing.
","Many critics may argue with me but I think that the Hurt Locker was an awful movie. As everybody knows, it had won six Oscars, including best motion picture of the year and best achievement in direction. Since I don't know much about the later, I will concentrate in the ""best movie"" aspect.<br/><br/>When I heard that this movie won those Oscars, I wanted to watch it. But I was wrong. The Oscars are not the measure of good movies anymore (I didn't take into account that Silence of the Lambs won the 5 major categories, and still was a really bad movie). So from now on I won't consider the Oscars' opinion.<br/><br/>The movie went really boring at times. It just felt too long. By the time it reached the middle, I desperately wanted the movie to end. A lot of scenes weren't concluded and they were slow paced. And they didn't even create a plot. The story went nowhere. There were some good sequences though and the effects were good. But in the end those good scenes weren't able to make up for the final product.<br/><br/>The acting was bad and so was the script. I didn't care for any of the characters. They couldn't convince me, and that is the very least thing expected from an Oscar winner (Well, not anymore). Perhaps Bigelow did a great job in directing this, but as a whole movie it didn't work out.<br/><br/>To end this review I will say that this is another overrated movie from recent years. This is the kind of film that I try to avoid at all costs, even if it's on TV. Extremely forgettable with really forgettable characters."
"filipekholm","9","13","21","15 December 2009"," Definitely one of the better movies this year.
","As I've just seen the movie i'm still a bit shaken by it. It left me completely amazed. Going in to see it, I didn't really know what to expect. For once, I didn't read any other reviews for it before. That's something I haven't really done before. So here I am, sitting, having no idea what to expect, and I'll tell you, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of those future classics that we'll look back on and call it one of those great, classic war movies. The writing was great, Although we didn't get to see a lot of dialog, when it was there, it worked, and it seemed natural overall. The plot itself was amazing though. The directing, was surprisingly good, in fact, it was brilliant. How she kept that suspense through the whole movie. The sniper scene is a good example, there she shows a real talent in suspense. Or the scene (spoiler) where the bombs appear around James, that's perfectly shot.(end spoiler) Even though I think that this years award for best directing actually goes to Tarantino, this is one hell of a performance. The acting was great as well. Although I didn't get any real ""wow"" performance from anyone,it sure was a great cast. Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List) and Guy Pierce (Memento, L.A. Confidential) makes small appearances which are both great. The cinematography is also a very good part of the movie, some really beautiful shots. Now afterwards I see people calling it a perfect movie, and even the best war movie since Apocalypse Now! While I wouldn't go that far, it is sure one of the best war movies i've seen in a long while, yes possibly, ever. But I see it as the best war movie made about the Iraq war. We got the best movie about world war 2,which would probably be Saving Private Ryan or something.And then we have the Vietnam war, which is Apocalypse Now!. And now, as I said, we have a masterpiece about the Iraq war as well, ""The Hurt Locker"" a definite future classic."
"jonathan-577","9","13","21","14 October 2009"," trying to not stay human
","To Siue's protest that the world already has too many war films that focus on the American GI's point of view, I replied that this film takes that warhorse places that I've never seen it go before. Without that defining perspective, how else could Bigelow portray the psychology of war in which everyone, and everything, becomes an enemy - not just the curious and unknowable locals, but a cell phone, an illegally parked car, a herd of sheep, a pile of garbage, even their army's own sh*tty equipment? When Jeremy Renner drops the tear gas on his first assignment, it looks like he's committing suicide, but here again we have a window on an essential theme - the tension between the need for fellow soldiers to act in a predictable and regimented way, and the need to retain your status as an individual. At first Renner is as remote as the locals, but there's a slow reversal - starting with an admiring, smirking colonel miles crazier than he is, continuing as the seemingly rock-steady Anthony Mackie reveals the cracks in his own stability, and culminating in the Aguirre-like desert siege where Renner holds everything together and becomes the central character once and for all. Having taken center stage, the movie becomes his personal psychodrama as he seeks the killers of a kid he thinks he knows - it's when he tries to be a hero that we can see the hopelessness of the situation. The only way to survive is to keep your humanity in check, and it's damn hard, because these characters are nothing if not human. The chaos and despair are so powerful and so felt that the final scenes feel a little too pat, too obvious in their meaning; but even there we have an unforgettably displaced supermarket-as-nightmare sequence, and anyway the message is urgent enough to merit a double underline."
"ewarn-1","9","13","21","18 August 2009"," Why You Should See This
","A few years ago, I decided I would never watch a movie about the war in Iraq. I am still not sure why, maybe because the few that were made had a definite political viewpoint...and everybody knows from which side that point of view comes. Post Vietnam war films, with the exception of World War II movies, had to be filmed through either a cynical filter or with the simplistic energy of the revisionist. So the filmmakers all jump on eagerly at the Stone/Platoon template ...you know, the one that portrays most American soldiers as loud psychotics eager to commit an atrocity at the first opportunity.<br/><br/>I decided to see ""The Hurt Locker"" based on a couple of reviews I read. I decided not to look at a trailer but to see it cold. In this era of 150 million dollar budgets, special effects driven stories and standardized scripts, watching this movie was like taking a step back in time, maybe to the '60s. The low budget filmmakers then, like the producers of the Hurt Locker, had balls...no patterns here, no obvious viewpoint...this is as good as the greatest war films of the past, no matter what the budget.<br/><br/>There is some criticism on this site about the technical inaccuracies. I salute their observations. But the small or even obvious mistakes don't distract from this masterpiece. It's hot, dangerous, stress filled, glaring and believable. I've never seen Jeremy Renner before, but his performance is the highlight of a years' movie-going experience. I also liked seeing Guy Pearce and especially David Morse in small but hard-hitting roles."
"nljubicich","9","13","21","12 July 2009"," a fresh take on a war movie...fantastic
","""the hurt locker"" is one of those movies that really just comes out of no where. in this day and age, its rare to see a movie without a massive advertising campaign and whatnot.<br/><br/>the film follows the three men in a squad stationed in Iraq. early on in the film, the team's leader (a great guest appearance by guy Pearce...loved him in ""memento"" and i was happy to see him on the big screen albeit briefly) gets replaced by sergeant will James played by Jeremy Renner (""swat"", ""The Unusuals"", ""28 weeks later"").<br/><br/>from the get-go, ""the hurt locker"" mercilessly lets the audience know that the movie is very realistic. several different factors account for this realism. one is the dialogue. this is less of a dialogue driven film than it is an action driven film (of sorts...i'll get to the action later) but the dialogue is constantly appropriately delivered and it's simple yet effective. the characters (and the film as a whole) is very human. next is the film's look. there is no evident computer generation used which is an breath of fresh air to say the least. it's look is gritty, intimate, and it's style of cinematography lends itself well to that feel. it's pretty much all hand-held but not like the bourne movies. you can actually see what's going on. camera zoom is utilized very well and artistically throughout the film as it is not overdone and works perfectly in a warzone setting. there's even some slo-mo here and there (not ""zack Snyder here and there"") and that also adds to the overall look and feel of the movie.<br/><br/>perhaps the film's greatest strength is the thick layer of tension that it is so effortlessly and smoothly applied to most of the movie. it truly is remarkable. much of what accounts for this tension also accounts for the realistic feel (namely the minimalistic use of a score and the intimacy and grittiness of the cinematography), but what can be most credited for the film's tension are the main characters: will James and his squad mates sergeant sanborn (anthony mackie) and specialist Eldridge (brian geraghty). sergeant James, a bomb diffuser, is thrown into situations that are rooted in reality and totally believable, but at the same time they are extremely terrifying, haunting, and even disturbing at times. Jeremy Renner does a brilliant job of portraying James as a character who can totally keep his cool while being surrounded by bombs that can kill his and many others. this trait is once again not overdone and utilized well. James isn't Rambo or john mcclane. you just get the impression that he's damn good at his job and a spectacular soldier. when the audience is on the edge of their seats waiting for a bomb to explode and even the character on screen is calm, it significantly adds to the level of tension in the film.<br/><br/>with all that being said, ""the hurt locker"" did have a few issues that were really only present in the end of the film. in the final act, the film seemed to lose focus a little bit. it starts to stray from the bomb diffusals that were used in lieu of major action setpieces and firefights and begins to lose a little bit of its originality and tension. the movie quickly shifts from being about bravo team's missions while getting to know the characters to being about the characters that happen to be in Iraq fighting a war. fortunately, once this shift occurs it isn't constant; the rest of the film just feels a little bit spotty. there are moments when the final act drags, but there are a couple moments that top some of the beginning/middle's most powerful ones.<br/><br/>overall, ""the hurt locker"" is a fantastic film that takes a fresh look at the warzones of Iraq with constant tension, gritty realism, and a great main character. it stumbles slightly in its final act with a lack of focus and questionable character motives."

"bob the moo","Null","14","23","6 September 2009"," Has weaknesses in the story/characters but is mostly tense, urgent and engaging in its depiction of the job
","The Hurt Locker caught my eye while I was in America earlier this year as the worst review I saw gave it 4 stars and many seemed happy to give it the full 5. I never got round to seeing it then but when it came to the UK (to similar reception) I made a point of getting to see it in the cinema. Seeing it leaves with the conclusion that going off star ratings is no way to go about summarising a film because in some ways this is a quite remarkable and gripping film but then, in other aspects, it is surprisingly underdeveloped and wanting. The good news is though that the strengths it has outweigh the weaknesses and, while they remain in your head as an issue, they are not what you take away from the film.<br/><br/>What you do go away with is a memory of very tense and engaging film that puts the viewer right into the action. Or rather, lack of action because the film is at its best when nothing happens because it manages to capture the sense of threat and urgency associated with having civilians who may be insurgents watching while the defusing is going on and time is of the essence. Quite how realistic it is when it comes to the specifics I guess is questionable (the forums are full of people discussing the minutiae of this scene and that scene) but in terms of translating the feelings to the viewer it is certainly very good. There is a tension to all these scenes combined with an excitement to be working against someone for the ""win"" – that someone being the bomb manufacturer and the ""contest"" being to see which person can achieve their goal for the bomb – defuse or go off. On top of this we also get the suddenness and pointlessness of death in this situation, where the enemy can come from nowhere and is hard to identify, leading to this constant edge that sets the film off nicely.<br/><br/>Contrary to some opinion, the film doesn't really have much to say about Iraq and indeed the same film could be set in any modern conflict zone because of the relative unimportance of specifics. This is a good thing because it puts the focus on the men doing the job and, as suggested by the title card quote, what drives them to do it. Unfortunately it is in this area where the film doesn't quite work as well as it does when dishing out scenes of the job and the dangers inherent in it. The characters are characters and don't manage to become people for any length of time so, despite the more worthy goal of the film, we never really get into their heads beyond the obvious. Similarly the film doesn't have a great ""story"". This doesn't matter for the vast majority of the film because the tension of the job is everything, but later in the day we have several sections that don't work particularly well because they seem to be heading off from ""the job"" as if in search of a character-development point or a direction to provide narrative flow beyond the episodic.<br/><br/>I refer to the stuff involving Beckham and also the ""beyond the blast perimeter"" stuff towards the end. Both of these are OK but both seem to occur without a lot of justification and don't seem to add a lot to the story or character. Bigelow direction matches the weaknesses in the material because she is at her best when dealing with the action on the ground. The cast manage more consistency in their characters to the point where I wanted them to have more opportunity to develop their characters because it was clear they could. I've seen Mackie many times before but this is the first time I remember being impressed by him as he is very good and has the ""most real"" scene in the film. Renner plays the driven-part bang on but maybe doesn't have much to do to show his addiction, regrets etc – the scenes that do are generally pretty obvious. He is also strong though while Geraghty is a good third player albeit the film doesn't give him more than a few minutes to convey the feelings that are big part of his character. The supporting cast are solid as well as all of them play into the intensity of the film rather than the complexity (or lack of).<br/><br/>Hurt Locker is not the brilliant film that many claim it is – it has too many gaps/weaknesses in the narrative and material to really stand out as that, but these are covered by the qualities that you will remember the film for. It is the ground where the film is strongest, where the threat (or perceived threat) is everywhere, where death is sudden and without any ""death scene"" fanfare or trimmings and most of the movie is spent hoping there won't be action rather than just waiting for the next being CGI action sequence. The tension and excitement of these scenes are what the film is about and they do make the film worth seeing to the point where they carry it across the weaker aspects that come in the second half."

To believe that there is such a lack of leadership and that soldiers are uncontrolled hot shots is an insult not only to the army itself, but to the men in uniform as well. The Hurt Locker takes what is in reality, a very organized and professional group of soldiers, and transforms them into authority hating, testosterone driven psychotics. I have to admit, I really have no idea what the point was, but I think it was to show how much Hollywood doesn't respect our military.<br/><br/>In addition to the disrespectful portrayal of our troops, the film just lacks the basic quality that you would expect. One of the main things is the camera movement, which I assume was an attempt to give a more gritty feel too the movie, but instead became much more of a distraction than anything else.

","OK...do not waste the 2 hours out of your life, because you cant get it back. If you were in the Military, don't even give it the time spent wondering whether or not its a good movie to watch. Its not. THIS IS THE WORST MILITARY/WAR/COMBAT FILM EVER. PERIOD!!! That is not an exaggeration. I have roommates who are combat veterans in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom with experience in these situations. Any E.O.D. vet, would or should agree. There was little to no accurate military consultation this whatsoever. The best part about the movie was that it ended. Even that was no good. The Hurt Locker lives up to its name only in that it gives you a major headache to sit through it. The only aspect of the film that is well done, is its setting. The background is perfect. The directing and script was a dump in the toilet. The long drawn out scene where British SAS is made out to be a group of idiots who cant change a flat, while waiting ALL DAY LONG for EOD to take out a distant sniper, is unbearable. The Iraqi wife, who cant walk by the side of her husband on public streets, but has the Gall to attack an intruding ARMED MALE with kitchen utensils is totally ridiculous. All in all, the movie is a compilation of bomb engagement scenes that build to nothing. The final climactic scene of summed emotions being spilled between the two remaining team members, is anything but emotional or climactic. I cant get my two hours back. To think this movie was given praise by multiple accredited publications makes me F@#KING sick. It also tells me how little they know about how a proper WAR/Military film should be made. Because this... IS NOT!!"
"MartinHafer","10","26","49","13 March 2010"," I was on the edge of my seat...
","Before I get to the meat of the review, I should point out that I rarely give movies scores of 10. This one came very close and I was about to give it a 9. However, although I am very hesitant to give such a lofty score, considering the film's modest budget and mostly unknown actors, I can't help but be impressed. I also can't really say whether or not it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, as the only other film I've yet seen among the nominees were ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Precious"". ""Precious"" was perhaps as good, but so different it's impossible for me to say which of the two is best--plus is this even necessary? Now that I mentioned ""Precious"", it and ""Hurt Locker"" are great for completely different reasons. The big strength of ""Precious"" are the actors and the script. The actors emote heavily and the film is about, in many ways, a catharsis, or letting go, of secrets and pain. ""Hurt Locker"" on the other hand, is much more an action pick. And, while the acting and script are very good, the point seems to be on the suppression of pain and emotions--quite the contrast, now that you think about it.<br/><br/>The film begins with the team leader of a bomb disposal unit being killed on the job. His new replacement is a sergeant who is quite different. He does NOT do things by the book and seems to take many often unnecessary risks. In some ways, he seems like a man with a death wish. However, over time, his character becomes so much more. He is a complex man...he just struggles to suppress this.<br/><br/>The interactions of the three men on the team, the almost non-stop edge of your seat tension and excitement and the amazing direction make for an exceptional film that you really should see. However, I'll forewarn you--the language (like that of many military men) is a bit rough and the film is bloody and is NOT for the squeamish. Oddly, despite this, I was surprised by the audience at the theater--they were mostly post-70 years old--I was, at 45, a comparative baby! <br/><br/>One final thing I should point out which is, perhaps, the greatest strength of the film. No matter if you are on the left or right on the political spectrum, you will probably enjoy this film--unless you absolutely demand that a film takes a strong political position (this was obviously true for a few of the reviewers). The film never really says that the war is good or bad, just or unjust--it just portrays the lives of some extraordinarily talented and brave men. Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal did a good job in keeping the film focused on these men and it sure made me feel a lot of respect for anyone who could do such an awful job."

I wouldn't recommend even watching this film on its DVD release. This years Oscars for Best Picture and Director were preposterous and I was extremely let down. Where are the memorable scenes that envelop the audience, the unique situations that make it hard not to re-watch again and again, the characters that thrive in the memory long after the film is thrown back onto the shelf.

","This is quite simply the best movie in almost ten years, and the best war movie I've ever seen. It's a psychological drama, a suspense thriller, and an action flick all rolled into one unbelievably entertaining package. It's about the Iraq war, but phenomenally there is no political statement being made. It's simply an almost documentary look at war and the mechanics of being in a war. Kathryn Bigelow has long been a fine director, but nothing on her resume prepared me for the absolute mastery she shows here. And unknown actor Jeremy Renner is perfect in the great leading role. He brings remarkable complexity to his part-cowboy part-genius bomb-defuser. He's wonderfully supported by Anthony Mackie. But Bigelow is the real revelation. She's made a movie that is one for the ages."

","Males and females at IMDb both rate this film equally at 7.8 (but as usual it's 10 to 1, male raters to female). Then the other interesting demographic is males and females under 18, which is also skewered way toward males to females by 8 to 1, but both of these gave the film the highest approval rating at 8.3 of any demographic. And therein lies my objection to this film and especially to the fact that this film even was nominated, let alone won, best picture from gollywood. The academy, the industry, the military industrial complex all helped honor this film with the ""supposed"" highest award.<br/><br/>I was suspicious from the very beginning of Hurt Locker and as it went on, and on and on without any cinematic competence I began to compare it with ""Apocalypse Now"" which did NOT win best film, best director, best supporting actor , best writing, best editing, best art directing, but managed 2 awards for sound and cinematography. Hurt Locker won 6 of the 9 awards for which it was nominated. I am saddened here that the first AAward given to a female director is given to a film which I believe to be a most unfeminine film. Women have mourned for centuries the loss of their children and husbands to war, yet we in the midst of two of our nation's longest war, Ms. Bigelow is put to the task of enticing under 18's to this violence as something they might want to take part in so they can, ""Be all they can be"" as the film informs them more than once.<br/><br/>We were and are in the midst of a severe financial crisis in which ""I'm lucky to have a job"" is a phrase I hear often. These sub 18's are facing an uncertain future. But the a Huge growth industry, which has continued for decades now, in this nation, is the Military. The military will not go unfunded in this, the most violent society in the world.<br/><br/>I don't believe that is any conspiracy here. But the message sent by this film is ""war is romantic.""

","Without a doubt this is the best war film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (& I loved BLACK HAWK DOWN & FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS). It is intense & continuously involving. This is Bigelow's best film since (the classic) NEAR DARK.<br/><br/>If the subject, Army bomb squad in Iraq, doesn't intrigue you then you probably think that ""Shakespeare In Love"" really did deserve it Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent throughout but there is a star making performance by Jeremy Renner that will leave you stunned. It was smart to cast this film with mostly actors that you don't recognize.<br/><br/>The movie has a documentary feel to it which adds greatly to the tension in it. DP Barry Ackroyd also shot the unnerving UNITED 93. The editing is virtually perfect. You know exactly where you are at in the rubble strewn streets where life fights like weeds in cracked concrete to take hold (again). And the shots never linger too long (or too short).<br/><br/>Bigelow has always given us beautifully stylized scenes, but except for one very effective slo-mo shot she seems to have sacrificed that trait for the story (or shooting schedule). It doesn't look like ""a Kathryn Bigelow film"". <br/><br/>But few films rise above their script. Mark Boal's screenplay is a lesson on how to tell a great story with a minimum of exposition. The characters are defined almost entirely by their actions. I hope the Oscars reward this movie well.<br/><br/>I drove 112 miles to Sherman Oaks to see it & it was worth it. I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>Update January 2010: This film is even better on a 2nd viewing. It is just as intense (amazingly). I noticed much more character development this time around. The acting & script retain their original luster I was wrong about it not really looking like ""a Bigelow film"" because it does. There is no other film-maker that sees things quite like she does. If you missed in the cinemas don't fret; it plays just as well on a decent home screen (my 32"" flat screen was just fine)."

","Extremely sterile and dull movie. It is just one more feature film 'documentary' where you can obviously see that director has seen Baghdad ER and did not really know how to reflect her impressions on the screen. Documentary documents reality, and that's it. Feature film has to involve the plot to make the film story come alive and that's it. It is on director how to implant that plot, but the plot has to exist. Otherwise, everyone could make a movie and everything would be a movie. Just presenting the soldiers from the bomb squad does not make any plot. That suppose to be a part of the movie - not a whole movie. The one could say that director tried to make mishmash of some good war movies from the past and documentaries as one mentioned above. All in all, pretty bad and unintelligent film, I could not stand watching the whole movie. Judging to high rankings, no hope for Hollywood."

There are no false moments and you believe the hardships that the bomb disposal unit faces. Jeremy Renner's deservedly Oscar-nominated performance is another reason to watch the film. His facial expressions, display of range, and intense voice elevates his performance to that of Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. Even though there may be some inaccuracies, this is after all a general idea of a bomb squad and without the inaccuracies in the story and with the characters, we would have little of an idea about who these brave soldiers are and why they are even there.

OK, the acting is fine and writing was OK, but the plot was sad irresponsible for an independent movie. It was OK until the soldiers veered far away from their duties by running down allies they had no business being in. The only thing I think Hollywood was interested in was that the main character, the hero/protagonist is there not to serve or defend his country, but to serve his own adrenaline craving.

","Honestly. <br/><br/>This film the best of 2009? <br/><br/>An Oscar winning effort? <br/><br/>Not to me. I didn't like it. <br/><br/>It didn't engage me. The first job of a movie is to pull in the viewer. Without active participation by the viewer, the movie stays only a set of images----and like a newspaper front page can be thrown away once read. The reason I didn't feel engaged ...? The characters and situations did not seem that credible. <br/><br/>I haven't served in the Mideast wars but it seemed to me that the situations the human was being placed into were unrealistic : in today's war room, I would think Americans relying more on robotics, and then remote detonation of explosives. So I didn't get that part of it.<br/><br/>The characters were not that interesting to me. Maybe they were just not the type I would associate with... I don't know. These characters just didn't speak to me. The obligatory male bonding drunken fight scene left me cold. The relationship between the protagonist and the native child was a little better . . . at least I had a sense that he cared about the little boy, (or by Freudian displacement his own inner child), but at least I could identify with his feelings. In the scene when the soldiers go into a very dangerous area at night, ill-equipped, it seemed totally unreasonable. A person would have to be truly stupid to do something like that.... and the characters were not portrayed as that ignorant. So it didn't fly with me.<br/><br/>Really . . . did ANYONE believe that this movie was a better movie than Avatar which it beat for the Academy Award? <br/><br/>You're kidding, right? <br/><br/>The only mark I give this movie is for its portrayal of the Iraq war as distorted and confused violence without a clear sense of ultimate outcome.

"trescia-1","10","18","33","26 July 2009"," A Masterpiece in the Tradition of Stanley Kubrick
","I'm a fan of the work of Stanley Kubrick, and although I have seen films that pay homage to the master, I have never seen a film by another director that was able to convey the kind of energy that Kubrick conveyed in his films--until now. Kathryn Bigelow is not ""another Kubrick"" but she has created a masterpiece of cinema, and that's not a small thing, and it shares many of the characteristics of Kubrick's greatest work.<br/><br/>It never gives audience a break. You are expected (or demanded) to pay attention and absorb what you see. Kubrick always played fair, he never let you down by pulling you into the film and then exploiting your trust in him by asking you to overlook incompetence. His work was complete and contained within its own reality. ""The Hurt Locker"" has this same quality of forcing you to accept the film on its own terms, and then providing a proper reward for your participation. As an audience, you have to work--but the reward is readily provided.<br/><br/>Technology is woven into the film in new and interesting ways (something Kubrick was noted for). Most of the stern or negative comments on ""The Hurt Locker"" come from U.S. Army veterans who critique it as if it were a documentary. Considering that it is a character study, this is not evidence that Bigelow made a poor film, it's evidence of how well she made it. It's so ""true"" that it stirs up serious emotion among those who feel the danger as it is unfolding on the screen and feel compelled to do something about it--and correct the actions of those in danger. This is quite different from most ""war films"" made in recent years (""Black Hawk Down"" comes to mind) where the action portrays soldiers who behave like suicidal maniacs, and the result is so much like a comic book that it's beyond real criticism by real warriors.<br/><br/>But ""The Hurt Locker"" is too close to the bone to be ""forgiven"" for technical errors. Too real.<br/><br/>Finally, ""The Hurt Locker"" makes no apologies. In the best tradition of Kubrick, it tells the story that the director wanted to tell, and sears it into your mind, if you consent to the operation. Few directors can achieve this kind of intensity in a film. The names of those who can are legendary. Hitchcock. Kubrick. Now, apparently, Bigelow."
"Patrick_Waggett","10","17","31","28 August 2009"," Real war as it should be portrayed
","Going to watch 'The Hurt Locker,' I was naively unaware of the talents of one Kathryn Bigelow. Having now seen the film, I find myself wanting more, much more. This is of course the main theme throughout the film. From the offset we are made to think about a quote from war journalist Chris Hedges and standout phrase that 'war is a drug.' We soon learn exactly why. The opening scene sets the tone perfectly as a seemingly simple and straightforward procedure to end a bomb threat goes terribly awry. The familiar washed out look of many Gulf War films is there (Three Kings, Jarhead), but somehow it is fresh and new as Bigelow paces the proceedings so that the audience are only too aware of the bleak surroundings as are the soldiers on the front line as shaky hand-held camera work puts the audience there too (Barry Ackroyd delivering a gritty, very real scope). This paranoia that anything or anyone could be a threat is established. Watch as an approaching civilian seemingly distracts Sgt. JT Sanborn (the no nonsense Anthony Mackie,) heightening tension that is surrounding Sgt. Matt Thompson's (Guy Pierce) bomb disposal squad so that even the slightest of inklings to a threat as a mobile phone is missed, resulting in the horrific end to this incident . Jeremy Renner's Sgt. William James now takes over as Bravo Company's bomb disposal squad staff sergeant. Immediately he is carefree and alarmingly self assured to the particular annoyance of Sanborn. Despite this lack of professionalism as team leader, we fully believe that James is more than capable of doing the job right (he has disarmed over 800 bombs so far.) Walking head strong into the arena, James disarms with ease; it is mainly the surroundings that Bigelow uses to add a daunting prospect and tension. As James gets on with his work, the audience are with Sanborn and Special Owen Eldridge (the painfully torn Brian Geraghty) as they assess the threat and will themselves to be out of harm's way as soon as possible. Contrasting Sanborn and Eldridge's desire to be safe and precarious, James keeps little momentums ('signatures') from each bomb he disarms, revelling in the fact that it could've killed him as we understand that this is James' drug. The much talked about scene where Bravo Company meet up with British mercenaries is a thing of frustrating and never ending tension that excites and grips more than anything I have seen all summer as detail is lost in the distant desert as snipers pick out this meeting, we witness a drawn out and mind numbingly sparse stake out that Bigelow is in no rush to conclude. The tight angles reveal little and the unknown enemy who fire from off screen create a claustrophobic atmosphere, even in the expansive land. A film not about 'war' as such in the political sense, it is about those in war and how they deal with the pressure, whether they love it or hate it. Eldridge seems to have found a Father figure in lesser character Col. John Cambridge (Christian Camargo) and is agonisingly torn between his affections for Sanborn and James as role models. Sanborn, the ever professional does not like the risks and carelessness of James and is not afraid to express this and yet, in the end, we see a broken man who seemingly envies James. Then Renner as James gives the most conflicted and rounded character. Here is someone who smiles at the complexity and difficulty of disarming a bomb that could destroy half a city, secretly admiring the bomb maker. His obsession with bomb disposal overshadows every aspect of his life, he can't even bear to talk to his wife on the phone and once home with family, admits that he has one love, one drug as it were, war. The timing of this film comes perfectly as juxtaposition to Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds.' Where Tarantino fictionalises war for his story, 'The Hurt Locker,' has the brilliance of a writer with first hand experiences of the gulf war (journalist Mark Boal) and delivers a very 'real' experience. Where explosions may light the sky up in other summer blockbusters, here we are showered in dirt and debris (there are particularly beautiful touches with slow motion observations of the reverberations of explosions) and where other soldiers may talk about going home to their daughter and beautiful wife, we have men who have nothing but war and when they do, it is not enough. War is where they are at home and home is where they are at war.<br/><br/>Patrick Waggett"
"howard.schumann","10","17","31","19 July 2009"," Its strength lies in the experience
","Paul Rieckhoff, a former Marine and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America, said that ""Not everyone comes home from the war wounded, butnobody comes home unchanged,"" Indeed, the Army's first study of the mental health of troops who fought in Iraq found that about one in eight reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder: flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of detachment, irritability, trouble concentrating and sleeplessness. Even more distressing is the fact that the suicide rate among veterans is almost four times the average for non-veterans of the same age.<br/><br/>The possible reasons behind these statistics are spelled out in Kathryn Bigelow's magnificent The Hurt Locker, a heart-wrenching film that explores the world of Explosive Ordinance Disposal technicians in Iraq whose job is to locate and disarm IEDs. Structured around the 38 days three men in the EOD squad have left in their rotation, the film is set in Baghdad in 2004 and shot with a hand held camera that underscores the sudden movements and constant tension of the unit which must constantly scan rooftops and hiding places for possible snipers.<br/><br/>In the opening sequence, EOD Team Leader, Sgt. Matt Thompson, (Guy Pearce) is killed when, after his robotic hardware device fails, he is forced to manually neutralize a bomb that explodes. Mirroring the opening quote from American author and journalist Chris Hedges, ""The rush of battle is a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug,"" Thompson's replacement, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), thrives on the adrenaline rush his job entails, seemingly oblivious to the dangers he faces or even the reality of the world around him. Unsurprisingly, problems with the other two officers on the squad soon manifest. Sgt. J. T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), a by-the-book soldier finds James a bit too willing to disobey protocol and take unnecessary risks.<br/><br/>Called ""a wild man"" by a visiting colonel, Sgt. James claims to have dismantled 900 IEDs. At one point, James takes off his protective helmet and disconnects his communications gear so that a disbelieving Sanborn is unable to communicate with him. In addition, his reckless actions seems to enhance the fears of Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who is seeking private counseling for his obsession with death. Though James is a ""hot dog"", he is a complex character as portrayed by Jeremy Renner in an Oscar caliber performance. He befriends an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs, gives his support to the troubled Eldridge, calls his wife and young son frequently, and reaches out to Sanborn though their perspective on life is vastly divergent.<br/><br/>Written by journalist Mark Boal who had spent time with a bomb disposal unit, The Hurt Locker lacks a coherent narrative but its strength lies in the experience not in the story. While the film does not offer a political commentary on the War in Iraq, it more than brings home the insanity of all wars. No sequence in any recent war film is more horrifying than the scene in which James has two minutes to dismantle a time bomb strapped to an Iraqi suicide bomber. While the would-be bomber pleads that he is a family man, James races against the clock but even his normally cool demeanor gives way to a chilling desperation, an experience increasingly felt by everyone in the theater."
"Rafacus","10","17","31","14 July 2009"," One of the best war movies i've seen
","Beyond war movie and beyond another critically acclaimed movie, The Hurt Locker is the living definition of thriller. Rare is it that I find a movie that has me breathing unevenly whilst gripping my seat wondering what could happen next. The direction is simple but brilliant in it's own right, the acting is compelling and the reality of the so-called ""War on Terror"" is very real. Director Kathryn Bigelow gets it when it comes to keeping the audience centered on the important things and I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future. Before writing the plot summary I must warn you that this movie is better enjoyed by going into it blindly. The less you know of what you will experience the more immersed you will be in the story. I will attempt to avoid spoilers and any real breakdown of what occurs within this wonderful movie but if you want to truly enjoy The Hurt Locker I urge you to skip my next paragraph within this review.<br/><br/>Plot/Summary: The Hurt Locker is a situation set within the Middle East where American soldiers are forced to find and disarm bombs within the inner city. Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have a little over a month before the next rotation frees them from their duty. Although the two men eagerly count down the days to escaping the dry and thankless desert, their comrade and leader in Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) sees things differently. Battle-hardened, with a hard-on for disarming bombs, James seems to laugh at death and his recklessness alienates him from his peers. However after a few outings the three comrades reach a level of understanding and James emerges as a leader that is much more than a cowboy looking for death.<br/><br/>The most stand-out acting in this movie has to be that of the complicated Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Not only is he believable but he forces you into his world of chaos, confusion, honor and love. Between he and Anthony Mackie's Sanborn you are made to feel sympathetic and remorseful to the plight that they are in. Although the movie seemed short, within seconds you are concerned for every single character. The bomb situations are limited but within every single one of them you are holding your breath in anticipation and fright. The cinematography did not look or feel staged and the eery music brings you right into the hopelessness of the jobs these men had to do. Written by Mark Boal, the script felt real, it felt as if it was ""a day in the life of"", with pacing that was relevant and not contrived. There were no forced romances, friendships or atrocities to pull at your heart strings, the events are so seamless that it feels as if there was an invisible ""other"" with a camcorder shooting the lives of real men.<br/><br/>Sure you may need to look elsewhere if you are wanting another movie of ""guts or glory"", Rambo-like, one man against the world warfare. But if you want something that feels real, looks real and warrants intelligent thought, you will want to see the Hurt Locker. An absolutely amazing movie.<br/><br/>www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"

I would rather watch a movie written, produced and directed by Jessica Simpson. 1 star only because there isn't a zero. I realize war is tough on people and thats probably the overall message but cmon this just stinks. Nuff said"

While the war scenes were very intriguing, one man's apathy made the movie look bad.<br/><br/>Any good elements of this movie were overshadowed by high expectancy and bad execution.

","The Hurt Locker won Best Picture, so expectations were high. It was a disappointment. Why Renner was nominated for Best Actor, I'll never know. His performance was bland; typical of a CSI episode on TV. Steven Seagal could act circles around him. The film had its suspenseful moments, like will he get blown up or not? They milked this to the hilt. It should have been nominated for Queasiest Motion Picture. The plot was boring - just defusing bombs and dealing with snipers. The part where they faced a sniper in the desert was dumb. They spent the entire day looking at a stone fortification half a mile away. In reality, the soldiers would have simply called for an air strike and be done with it. The scene where Renner takes off and carjacks an Iraqi civilian to do justice on the streets of Baghdad at night was dumb, as was his decision to take his crew with him to look for the person who laid out an IED in narrow alleys in complete darkness. Renner's recklessness would never have been tolerated because by flagrantly violating rules, he put his life in jeopardy as well as others. In the end, the characters were cardboard cut outs and didn't seem real."

The bomb in the car scene, disobeying orders like that, the firefight at night, the desert shoot out... It was all completely ridiculous. I can only imagine how former Iraqis or veterans feel. <br/><br/>I couldn't believe this film got best picture. The reviews are so disappointing to me. Reading some of them is making me start to believe that I'm actually more intelligent than a lot of other people - or the people that are reviewing this film here anyway. <br/><br/>It's still a film worth watching, some of the cinematography and scenes were shot OK (even with all the continuity errors) and it was interesting to see some of the gear the guys use as well as the terrain the work in. I thought the main actor did well also - he carried a lot of it for me - made me see it through to the end. It's just such a pity because it could have been so much more. <br/><br/>I think that the director Bigelow worked on the script. While she deserves credit for some of the shots she should be lambasted for allowing that script to be used in the end-product. <br/><br/>This gets an Oscar, while Transformers 3 breaks box office records? Cmon guys, surely we can do better than this. Remember the Shawshank Redemtion? Movies from the 50s were better than these ones.

","Though this movie incorporates a wonderful message (war is a drug)and has very good character development, ""The Hurt Locker"" has probably the poorest writing I have ever experienced from any form of media, be it books, television, or movies. This script fails to incorporate the basic fundamentals of the English language. This script also contains many phrases intended for laughs, but all of them intensely fail to be funny. Honestly, was this your first-grade writing project?<br/><br/>My biggest concern with this movie is that it has no identifiable conflict. Sure, their new leader was kind of a pain to deal with, but in the movie (spoiler): he has no change of heart and continues to do the things he would normally do, and the others just out of the blue begin to deal with it. Not that they tried to fix this about him at all. This movie was basically just a bomb squad walking around Iraq putting out IEDs, which is fine if you want if you want to make a documentary, but that's obviously not what Bigelow and Boal intended, and for that, they failed in making this movie."

"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","18","34","12 February 2010"," At first it was to be all you could be, then war was hell, now it's a drug. But one thing we can all agree on: War is scary as Hell
","""The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" <br/><br/>A few months ago I had heard a little bit about The Hurt Locker, a lot of critics were bragging about how great this movie was, so I was kind of curious to see what it was about, but I couldn't find any local theaters that were playing the movie, so I had to wait it out for the rental. Without really knowing what the story was about, all I knew was it was an Iraq film. With a lot of war movies, I'm always concerned that it's more government propaganda to get us to say ""Oh, my God, what those soldiers go through; I wanna help"". But Kim Bigelow, everything that has been said about her has been taken out of my mouth. I didn't know that there was a female that was capable of creating such suspense and realism, she's absolutely incredible. I thought if not for the big names, that she cleverly puts in supporting roles, this movie was the actual war and Kim was just shooting what was going on in Iraq during these frightful times to be a soldier as well as a human being.<br/><br/>During the early stages of the post-invasion period in Iraq in 2004, Sergeant First Class William James becomes the team leader of an EOD unit with the U.S. Army's Bravo Company, replacing Staff Sergeant Thompson, who was killed by a remote-detonated IED in Baghdad. He joins Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge, whose jobs are to communicate with their team leader via radio inside his bombsuit, and provide him with rifle cover while he examines IEDs. During their first mission together, James's insistence on approaching a suspected IED without first sending in a bomb disposal robot leads Sanborn and Eldridge to consider him reckless. Being in a country where everyone is a possible enemy and the young men are almost expecting to die on a daily basis, it's hard not to say that war is Hell, but that the passion they have for what they do in this war is not only admirable but crazy.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a great film in the way it was made and told. To see these men on their journey throughout Iraq was so depressing and intense, but very believable. Wither you like the character or not, they were very real and Anthony Mackie stole the show in my opinion. You could really sense his dedication but also his worry on a constant basis if the day he wakes up is his last with this country. His chemistry with Jeremy Renner was dead on, the last scene between them made me cry and just broke my heart to see these two young men risking everything they have to wonder if it's crazy or that maybe this was fate and to be apart of something exciting as not many people to get to fight in a war. The Hurt Locker is one of the best films of the year, realism aside, it provides a new look into the terrifying life of these brave young men. I loved that Kim used the big names into supporting roles, because if she had used them for the bigger roles, it would have taken away from the film. She was a great choice for the film to direct and the actors were just terrific. The setting, the dialog, the story, everything about this film is done to perfection and will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","5","12","21","2 April 2010"," Visually and technically impressive, with excellent direction, but the film suffers from an episodic story structure and thin characterisation
","When I heard that The Hurt Locker had won Best Picture, I was keen on seeing if it lived up to my expectations. So I watched the film with my dad, brother and sister, and while there were some good things, such as the direction and how it was made, I was left disappointed as well. I really wanted to like this film, but the thing was it didn't completely grip or excite me.<br/><br/>VISUALS: Definitely what made the movie. The locations and scenery gave a real sense of authenticity, and in general the camera work was good. Though in some scenes, there was a little much of the hand held camera stuff, unless it was intentional, some of the camera movements were rather shaky. The special effects were very good though, and there are some terrific looking set pieces.<br/><br/>SOUND: The sound is wonderful. If you have the film on the highest volume, the sound the bombs and guns make is close to deafening. The sound as well as the visuals added to the authenticity.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: Kathryn Bigelow's direction here is astounding. It is secure and focused and avoids red wire/yellow wire cliché and manages not to preach too much.<br/><br/>ACTING: I will be explaining later how disappointed I was in the character development, but I thought the acting was reasonably good with what they had. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are believable and display good chemistry together. David Morse and Ralph Fiennes do what they can, which admittedly isn't much, in smaller roles. Evangeline Lilly looks lovely, but she doesn't do or say much other than be another person that one of the characters knows.<br/><br/>MUSIC: I am probably alone in this thought, but the music for me was a disappointment. There are parts where it is generic, and others where scenes are very dramatic where it felt somewhat intrusive.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: The actors don't really have that much to work with. Sure it focuses on the contrasting attitudes and philosophies of the three soldiers, who are aware that any job they do can be their last. The script doesn't do that to convey this though, some of it is clichéd and it felt like every 20 words when one character uttered an obscenity and then another. Plus it doesn't really say that much.<br/><br/>STORY: The story structure felt rather episodic in this film. Immediately after the characters do something they are immediately doing another thing without hesitation. After seeing half an hour or so of shooting guns I did start losing interest, maybe it was to do with the uneven pacing, and not even the final 10 minutes managed to excite me.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: The characterisation is disappointingly thin here, and to almost all the characters I was indifferent to. Other than the fact they are soldiers and one of them has a wife and baby back home, you don't learn that much about the characters. Throughout they feel rather thinly sketched, perhaps it would've helped if the film had a couple of back stories like they do in Lost. That way I would have felt differently.<br/><br/>Overall, worth watching by all means, but I was expecting more. I am not going to make up your mind for you, but while there were some good things it didn't work for me as well as it could've done. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

Also Jeremy Renner is a bad actor, you really don't feel that he is a person in the action, just a guy trying to act.

If the main idea is to show the insanity of Renner's character then this works on a cardboard thin level. But if this film is supposed to show a realistic portrait of the military experience in Iraq, then it only shows that experience to be morally bankrupt, utterly pointless and totally insane - and not even in a very realistic or worthwhile way.<br/><br/>Frankly it is shocking that this film would even be considered for any Oscar, much less 8?

","I was really looking forward to a great war movie, the Hurt Locker having won a pallet of Oscars, I figured I had just the right one. Boy was I wrong! The movie stunk from the opening moments in which one of the bomb squad team the movie follows is killed by a bomb that not only is detonated pretty far from him, but we see not a bit of shrapnel or debris come anywhere near the guy. The movie proceeds from one boring encounter with explosives and Iraquis to the next tedious and unbelievable encounter. The acting was just passable, but no member of the cast is even mildly interesting or compelling.<br/><br/>Boring, and stretching belief at every turn, Hurt Locker continues to try to top itself in boring tedium as it progresses. This movie does not just want you to suspend your disbelief, it wants you to explode it at the door. Stupid and remorselessly trite situation after stupid and remorselessly trite situation are unfolded, but by this time the viewer is indifferent to its bland characters and their acts of foolishness.<br/><br/>David Morse appears to have what amounts to a cameo as a loony American colonel, the obligatory ditsy and unfeeling brass that Hollywood feels obliged to insert in every war movie depicting Americans. Robert Duvall was infinitely better with his Lt. Col. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>With about 40 minutes left to run, I shut this crap off. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, nor did I care how it ended. It has no real story, so I would not have to wonder how a story terminates.<br/><br/>What the heck happened to Oscar? This award used to mean something, but lavishing so many on this piece of dung devalues Oscar beyond redemption, IMO. A real piece of trash!"
"Enchorde","6","8","13","7 April 2010"," Different war movie, but how did it win all those awards?
","Recap: A military bomb squad, consisting of three soldiers, is busy going into the last stretch of days before they are sent home. But with only 30 days left none of them dare to believe they will survive in an environment where everything might be a trap. But the squad has some internal problems when the squad leader is taking more risks than necessary. And how are they going to deal with this when they come home? <br/><br/>Comments: With as many as six Oscars, The Hurt Locker comes with high expectations, and unfortunately doesn't really manage to live up to them. It is a very detailed and meticulous movie, not told with a overall story or a defined individual enemy. Instead it is told in episodes where the squad is thrown into one unknown after another, and because of it is much more realistic.<br/><br/>Realism and plausibility is the key for this movie. There are no defined overly evil to combat, there is just war. There is no unnecessary or exaggerated effects or fights, but when used it is not low key. The soldiers are no super human heroes, but humans struggling to do their best. Therefore it is surprising that the movie abandons this now and then. In a few scenes realism is abandoned totally and simple mistakes are made knowingly or unknowingly, and it affects the entire movie. What disturbs me most is the tactics and organization used by the soldiers. If the USA Army sends it's squads, especially it's specially trained soldiers with a particular mission like in the bomb squads, without backup or support it the casualty rate would have been much higher. Sometimes the tactics used were just plain stupid. Other details just seem sloppy, or are we to believe that one is able to put out a car on fire with a normal hand extinguisher? I don't believe it for a moment, I know it to be impossible. If not it is a special almost magical extinguisher. That gives the movie a problem with credibility, and with a movie that aims for realism, that is a major problem and flaw.<br/><br/>A few odd choices from the awarded editing and directing crew too. In the middle of intense scenes where the soldiers are under heavy pressure, suddenly the scene is cut with a shot of gravel or casings in slow motion. Both the momentum and narrative of the scene is cut, and have to almost start over. In some movies such moments can augment the scene, here it just interrupts it.<br/><br/>It is a good movie, especially for those who wants to see a little different war movie. But there are enough flaws to disturb it's flow, and I can't really say it deserve all those awards. At least not in my opinion.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The trailer for The Hurt Locker got me hooked - It looked gritty and realistic and the opportunity for the war to be told from a different perspective intrigued me.<br/><br/>Unfortunately The Hurt Locker failed to deliver on the above, in quite a big way.<br/><br/>One of the main issues the film has is that it's shot in a documentary style, this gives the viewer the impression of realism. However in almost every scene there are glaring inaccuracies and Hollywood embellishments that contradicted any sense of realism.<br/><br/>Examples are numerous but two that stick out are; Sgt James ""going it alone"" by using a smoke grenade as a distraction on the first mission. Soldiers do not do things like this, survival for soldiers relies on teamwork with your buddies, not lone wolf die hard crap. The second instance was the sniper scene where the almost certainly elite ex-special forces soldiers are taken out like sitting ducks leaving the EOD team to clear up and shoot all the remaining bad guys. Not to mention snipering a running insurgent at 850m in one shot.<br/><br/>The other main issue with this film is our main character Sgt James. This is a character driven film, with the plot consisting of us being taken through Sgt James's tour of Iraq. Because of this it is vital for the viewer to understand his actions so we can accept them and be along for the ride. However there is no sufficient evidence to explain why he acts psychotic and puts his life and others on the line with everything he does. There is also no explanation for why he leaves his wife and child to go back to Iraq and continue with his suicide missions.<br/><br/>On the plus side I think this film was entertaining, the acting was good, and the special fx shots were brilliant.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 for me."

","Kathryn Bigelow is one of the few woman directors in Hollywood who can make a good action movies for the boys. With Heat Locker, this protégé of James Cameron turns up the heat in a movie clearly for the testosterone audience. Set in Iraq, the movie looks at a bunch of Bomb Disposal experts who are stationed in Baghdad for a count of days. As these men go through bomb after bomb losing fellow-soldiers along the way, the movie impresses upon the hopeless state to which the war-zone has fallen, and the mostly thankless high-risk job of the soldiers that risk their lives there. Yet the movie is not about the war, or its politics, but a zoned in look at one team's existence in it. While one soldier counts his days until they're relieved from duty, another lives at the thrill that the risk of their job brings them. Some great bomb sequences, a supremely-confidant lead performance by Jeremy Renner and a few awesome great cameos make this a great time at the movies. At least for the boys."

First, why that sniper did not shot the EOD soldier instead of shooting the car. Is this the way of trying to detonate the bomb? Are you serious? Also why he was trying to enter that house and then how the lady in the house kicked an armed man's ass? At the end of movie, director thought that she gave a big impression on the viewer. She believed that she showed an American Soldier life in Iraq. I don't think so.

","SSgt. William James, leader of a bomb squad team in Iraq, is I guess whom we should consider the main character of this film. Where we follow him and his two other team members through a series of disarmament situations happening in a single month before their regular rotation. And where we are getting acquainted with the whole variety of bombs I guess you're likely to get there: roadside bombs, a car bomb at UN headquarters, a strapped on body bomb and so on.<br/><br/>So far so good. Regarding that team's work, the film in fact succeeds in giving an idea of how difficult it is to operate in an urban environment where you can't easily distinguish friend from foe. The dangers that come with it and the tension that creates. But that's already all the good I'd have to say about this movie.<br/><br/>As for example, and especially so in view of procedures, this film makes the US Army look like a bunch of complete morons. We see the bomb squad cruising not only Baghdad streets but actually the desert in a humvee totally alone, without further escort. We see them taking on all kinds of tasks they obviously aren't meant to do, like securing a building, hunting bomb planters through the Baghdad night, even splitting on the way making each of them walk alone, sniping back at snipers in the desert and so forth. As infantry practically doesn't exist in this film, because why else did our three bomb squad members have to do all those things in the first place? And I guess we're seeing a lot more nonsense I either forgot about or maybe didn't even notice because I'm just applying common reason. All that would be quite laughable really, if they didn't try to make it look real with their docufiction style filming.<br/><br/>Leaves us with the main character, for whom we are apparently supposed to root. Problem is that he seems to break about any rule in the book, not only exposing himself to substantially increased risk but his team members as well. Where the reason for this behavior would be that ""war is a potent drug"", as we learn through the title sequence, and his participation in it the single thing he still loves in his life, as he'll later explain to his about one year old kid. Yeah, you heard right.<br/><br/>I haven't seen many Bigelow films, but this lead character in fact reminds me of one I did see, namely Point Break and that Bodhi character therein. Who very much just amounts to a suicidal cowboy, and that's what we're getting here just the same. This movie apparently doesn't really try to see that attitude as a problem though, where in reality it'd of course be a major one especially given his responsibilities towards others. On the contrary, his approach always works out, and in the end it's his more sane and reasonable fellows who come across like ... well, let's just call it what it looks like, weak losers. So if this was the message, of which I can't really be sure given how non articulate the characters otherwise are, I'd say it's the wrong one.<br/><br/>Bottom line being that this film doesn't make the slightest bit of sense to me. Addiction to war? OK, but then why present us the addicted as a kind of a high-flyer? I mean if anybody, he'd likely be the first to die. Well maybe, just maybe after his team members who were entrusted to him.<br/><br/>Well, you guys figure that out if you can. Because I can't."
"wes-blanscet","1","51","119","24 January 2010"," Terrible war movie
","I see a common theme with these reviews. The military people hate this film. As a military person when you watch a war film you have to take the film with a grain of salt and look past some inaccuracies. The films that the military hates are the ones that are so grossly and overtly inaccurate you can't look past them. That is what this film is. For people and critics to even suggest that this movie is a realistic depiction of Iraq is a crime. This may be the worst war movie made. It is up there with The Thin Red Line and Hamburger Hill. If I can save one person from watching this movie I have done a good thing. EOD as a sniper team, seriously. That scene made me want to punch myself for renting that steaming pile they call a movie. In another scene there is a whole infantry platoon outside and a 3 man EOD team clears an entire building. I can go on all day explaining the terrible inaccuracies throughout the entire movie, but I have like 10 other sites I need to worn people about this movie on."

","When The Hurt Locker was released. The joke was that if you see anyone famous in this film. They will be dead within 5 minutes.<br/><br/>At the time no one knew Jeremy Renner or Anthony Mackie, future stalwarts of the Marvel blockbuster films.<br/><br/>Set in Baghdad in 2004. William James (Jeremy Renner) is the replacement leader for the army bomb disposal unit. Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) finds James to be a maverick and reckless. Both men do not get on.<br/><br/>James befriends a young Iraqi boy who he calls Beckham. He sells dodgy DVDs and likes to play football. James is concerned when he disappears. As the unit go about their high pressure work, they encounter civilians strapped with bombs and snipers.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow became the first female to win the best director Oscar. She was in competition with her ex husband James Cameron that year who was nominated for Avatar. She made the movie like it was a drama documentary with plenty of shaky camera work. The story is episodic, these guys lives are dangerous and pressurised. Death is just around the corner. The film works better with the then unknown cast. Actors like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes make cameo appearances. However the story in retrospect is shallow.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is the more successful of the post second Iraq invasion cycle of movies. However it is hampered by its non critical approach. In some ways this mirrors Apocalypse Now, which displayed the madness surrounding its characters but is never explicitly was critical of the Vietnam war. This was left until the mid 1980s when films like Platoon were released.<br/><br/>There is no debate as to whether these foreign invaders had any right to be here. This is a country in chaos with private contractors operating for money. You see Iraqi civilians at risk if they just to be happening to hold a mobile phone, stand at a rooftop. At one point a DVD market stall trader is attacked and a house of an academic is broken into because James has a suspicion.<br/><br/>The upshot of the film is James when he is back at home in the USA is bored of shopping at the supermarket and wants to go back to Iraq. He craves the excitement, sod the people of Iraq."
"alfiemakingmovies","8","2","2","12 May 2019"," Intense action film.
","I had my worries the movie will be uneventful and a little boring, but it was far from that. It is action packed and tense. I previously saw some short parts of The Hurt Locker, so it diminished the tension a little bit for me, but the thrills and the feeling of possibility of death of a major character was still present.
The three main characters are well portrayed and we can understand their feelings. Even considering some cinematic machoism of the main hero, he still feels like a real and complex person. The movie is realistic in general, but the amount of action and the said dose of machoism tells us it's not a completely real war environment recreated. It is fast paced war action movie and it is pretty good."
"theresamgill","9","2","2","12 June 2018"," About as good as they come
","As with most really good war films, the movie is full of zooming shots and hand-held cameras. And you get the occasional soldiers acting as fools in the barracks to show character growth; however, that's basically all the similarities there are to other war films. Which is a positive to the first female best director and picture winner Kathryn Bigelow (beating out ex-husband James Cameron). The movie doesn't have a great flow to it, for it's not meant to be expressed as a story progressing; rather, setting the tone from the first scene, the audience is left guessing as to what will occur next with every encounter with explosives. Even if you are able to predict the outcome to some of these situations, the film still jars you with the suddenness and briefness of life. Now, it is not my favorite war film, but the execution is still a huge accomplishment to behold.<br/><br/>Since the film showcases life on the bomb squad, there has to be a dynamic relationship among the characters. It's honestly pretty typical after Guy Pearce's short run as leader: cocky leader who's great at what he does with little regard to danger (Oscar-nominated Jeremy Renner-- not the best performance, but a career-making performance), Mr. Ol' Reliable who follows the books better (Anthony Mackie-- personally enjoyed his performance the most), and The Kid (Brian Geraghty-- he got this role because of Jarhead). What I do appreciate the most, however, is that the characters are portrayed not by the typical banter thrown back and forth, but how they interact and have each other's back every single day in the field. And it's worth mentioning that Lord Vold-- excuse me, He-Who-Must-Not-- er, Ralph Fiennes, has a great cameo thrown in the midst.<br/><br/>In case anybody was counting, the movie won 6 Oscars and was nominated for 3 more. Did it deserve all that acclaim? No, of course not, but that's just how the Academy works. Nominated for best score, but I hardly noticed any music throughout (which is actually for the better), and nominated for all those technical Oscars. What it rightfully won was sound mixing/editing; for the record, those are two different awards, but it doesn't make too much of a difference to a simple-minded man such as myself. There's a great sniper fight about halfway through with whizzing bullets, and all the explosions throughout will release chest-hair manliness in anybody. What takes the cake is the opening sequence. It is hard to find a cooler shot than the gravel-and-Hell-raising, slow motion fatal explosion that makes the audience pay attention right away.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker's greatest strength comes from the guidance of Kathryn Bigelow, who would amaze audiences again with Zero Dark Thirty. Yes, the movie is a war film, but there is little ground to compare it to. You may not come out of the film happy, but you will not be dulled, and you will have a new found appreciation for daily tasks of those who risk it all to protect us.

","When I watched this film I wasn't sure what to expect, so I kept an open mind. After about 20 minutes it became clear that the film was not going to have a conventional plot - no antagonist, no obstacle to overcome, no crisis to solve, it was just a series of events.<br/><br/>But that's not necessarily bad, films like Pulp Fiction don't have such plots either and they still work fine. However, those films make up for plot with in characters and dialogue. This film has no great characters or dialogue - it is a couple of soldiers going through events.<br/><br/>And even that is not a bad thing; depicting what walking a mile in the shoes of a soldier might be informative, but yet again this films fails, as anyone who knows anything about this topic will tell you this film is highly inaccurate in depicting warfare.<br/><br/>No good plot, no interesting characters, no great dialogue and nothing to learn. Like I said, maybe I've missed something, but be that as it may the only good thing I can say about the film is that it's well produced, the actors do a good job and it's not a terrible film."

","The Hurt Locker won six Academy Awards©, including Best Picture.<br/><br/>Watching The Hurt Locker today, for the first time, I kept in mind the criticisms I heard in 2009 (its year of release in the US) from some active and retired military, that real bomb squad personnel would not be, or be allowed to be, so reckless. However SFC James is presented as an anomaly from the beginning, so if we accept higher-up Colonel Reed (David Morse) as another anomaly (and pretend for two hours and change that there are no safeguards against such anomalies in our military), we're on our way to a willing suspension of our disbelief. From a movie-making perspective, though, the most likely reason for SFC James' atypical bravado is the same reason the CSIs on CBS all forget they're not detectives and chase down suspects and interrogate them: it's more exciting that way. The film is exciting, and well acted. The disputed accuracy of its portrayal of Army bomb squads notwithstanding, it also has the feel of reality, perhaps owing to the acting, directing, editing, and heck, maybe the sound work too.<br/><br/>Why You Should See It You got the part about the six Oscars©, right? If the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay don't do it for you, how about Best Editing, Sound and Sound Editing?<br/><br/>Why You Should Avoid It You only watch comedies. You never read the paper because there might be a mention of someone getting hurt.

Worst of all, when women perform poorly and are lauded, it makes the world always question whenever a woman is rewarded for exceptional performance - is she getting the 'girl nod'. In this case, a pathetic movie is ranked far above its station, a mediocre director is revered when she should be let go, and truly outstanding women will suffer in the future. No good ever comes from falsely praising poor performance solely because of sex. Hopefully, the academy will ignore sex in the future and chose the best movie for the best movie award."

","This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept/theme, it really did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of a brave (stupid?) bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitious. Characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored. There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe.

"cl777","3","14","27","7 January 2010"," Boring, disappointing, well directed but too slow, no plot
","The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn Bigelow is getting fantastic critical reviews, some even calling it the best movie of last year. It has no famous actors (except for a very brief apparition by Ralph Fiennes) which is not to say that the acting is not strong. <br/><br/>The theme is the war in Iraq and it is a very realistic portrayal of the interactions between three soldiers stationed there as part of an elite bomb squad unit. There is lots of tension when they are dismantling bombs, especially during the opening scene which I found to be the most engaging. The remaining time disappointed me and I have to say I was hoping for more from this film and found it tedious, slow and repetitive. I was dozing off and had a hard time getting involved and caring much about what was going to happen. The movie lacked plot and did not engage me sufficiently. <br/><br/>It was very well directed from a technical standpoint and was a unique film in this regard, filmed in documentary style. But it is definitely a slow moving, war film and I hate to stereotype but probably more of a guy's movie. In fact you do not see a woman for 2 hours. I would not recommend this to any of my female friends; men might appreciate it more.

"fwomp","6","10","18","12 March 2010"," That Many Oscars? Really?
","I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE took home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A ""feel-good"" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.<br/><br/>I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be ""significant"" and ""modern"" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films as INGLORIOUS BASTERDS? DISTRICT 9? UP IN THE AIR? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (28 WEEKS LATER) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.<br/><br/>From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is ""the film to watch"" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or — one that didn't even get mentioned — MOON.<br/><br/>Let's hit on the Best Director item...<br/><br/>No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.<br/><br/>I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.<br/><br/>For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009. Please."

I could not get into this movie. I did not find any character particularly riveting. Instead, I believe everything was oversimplified. There are three significant characters who can all be fully described in one word. William James(Jeremy Renner) is reckless, JT Sanborn(Anthony Mackie) is rational and Owen Eldridge(Brian Geraghty) is a whiner. Talk about simple and boring. It is a complete misconception to call the ""protagonist"" William James anything more than an action junkie placed in a dramatic film. He does not fit. Sure he disarms bombs and saves lives but you get the idea throughout the film he just does it for the thrill. His experiences are nothing more than him indulging in his cravings for adventure, which makes it very difficult to connect with him in dramatic scenes. The overall point of this story was to connect with this character and how he is consumed by ""war"". I feel like I did not have this connection and the actual story was not strong enough to support where the characters were lacking. I could see how war veterans could connect because they probably have had similar experiences to relate making this film an involved reminiscence. I do not see how your average moviegoer could call The Hurt Locker a ""great"" film/experience when it lacked great dialogue, a great story, complex and diverse characters, great acting. The Hurt Locker is an average film.

The film seemed that it lacked a purpose, their only goal throughout the entire movie was to stay alive and that's all; there was no 'hunt' for the people responsible for any of the bombings, except near the end after they went looking for the people responsible for the suicide bombing. The dialogue/script gave no insight to the characters at all, you never really got to know the characters and feel what they were going through. The screenplay was quite dull as well or just not very complicated unlike Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds. How this film won best screenplay written directly for the screen or best picture of the year, I don't know. If you ask me it should have gone to Inglorious Basterds.

","""It's a video game of a movie. In some ways, The Hurt Locker is a 21st century ""Triumph of the Will."" – Marilyn Young (historian) <br/><br/>There has been a spate of Iraq-war themed films recently (""In the Valley of Ellah"", ""Redacted"", ""Rendition"", ""Lions To Lambs"", ""Battle for Haditha"" etc), most of which have been either shunned by audiences or mauled by critics. Of these films, ""The Hurt Locker"" seems to be the one have to hit the right notes with both groups.<br/><br/>Revolving around a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, the film is constructed around 6 Hitchcockian sequences. We watch as our heroes cruise from one set piece to the next, racing against time as they attempt to diffuse a series of bombs. Will the bomb explode? Will they die? Will they cut the red wire in time? These are the questions the film asks.<br/><br/>Like most war movies, the film's sole aim is thus to titillate. To string together a series of action sequences where the survival of our heroes is the audience's only concern. The film's lead trooper – a self-destructive maverick reminiscent of Mel Gibson character in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series – is himself the kind of unfeeling hero common in cop movies. He navigates the hellhole of Iraq, without any care in the world. He's surrounded by scum, but he loves his job. It's the only thing that gives him a buzz.<br/><br/>Macho-director Kathryn Bigelow specialises in these kind of films. Her previous flicks – ""Near Dark"", ""Blue Steel"", ""Strange Days"", ""K-19"", ""Point Break"" etc – all deal with adrenaline junkies in one form or another. She sees herself as a rare breed: a woman who makes subversive high-voltage action movies. But having Patrick Swayze wax poetic about peace and Buddhism after he violently robs a bank in ""Point Break"" isn't subversive or illuminating. It's just hypocritical.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" functions on the same level. In a Kubrickian move, the film acknowledges the seduction of violence, the words ""War is a drug"" stencilled in big white letters immediately after the title credits fade. Bigelow deftly fuses references to pornography, homo-eroticism and the phallus, with moments of nail-biting violence. The message is clear: war is sexy. Men love it. It tastes good. Feel the tension. Isn't it addictive? <br/><br/>But war is not sexy – technology (and by extension, cinema) is. A formation of fighter jets is beautiful in much the same way a formation of birds is beautiful. There is elegance in design, beauty in the sleekness of weapons and the phallic curves of bombs and guns. But war itself isn't sexy. Corpses, mutilated children, bullet ridden bodies, blood and guts and psychological trauma...these aren't sexy.<br/><br/>Bigelow acknowledges that violence always has a sexual underside, but then pushes the violence away in favour for sexy action scenes. It's like ""Requiem of a Dream"" with the highs and no lows. It's like fetishizing a gun being fired and then avoiding the corpse it results in.<br/><br/>7/10 – ""The Hurt Locker"" is eerily similar to Don Siegel's ""Hell is For Heroes"" and P. Leacock's ""The War Lover"", two other films about alienated war-junkie whose addiction to violence pushes them over the edge. There are also numerous similarities to Aldrich's ""Ten Seconds To Hell"", also about a bomb squad.<br/><br/>(Many have praised the film for not having any political motive, but this isn't true. The film is uninterested in why the US forces are in Iraq disarming bombs, ignores the fact that, in the larger historical context, they are the ones who are dropping all the bombs, and is content to portray the Iraqis as MacGuffins who exist solely to make bombs. Disavowal is politics at its most pure. Isn't it disturbing that, after six years of ignored Iraq War movies, this kind of flick is ultimately what resonates with critics and audiences?) <br/><br/>Worth one viewing."

Or we see them drinking and hitting each other for 10 minutes).<br/><br/>It also gets confusing when the three man team starts doing infantry type missions at the whim of it's leader, when they don't have to.<br/><br/>The chain of command was non-existent as Renner could go and do whatever he wanted and he never had to answer to anyone in either the EOD chain or in the chain that he was attached to.<br/><br/>I was hoping for Renner to either admit why he wanted to die, or for him to... simply die. Instead, he goes home and tells horror stories, and then redeploys by the time the credits are rolling (Mark Boal, stop writing movies).<br/><br/>The movie set out to ""show what soldiers go through"", but there's serious problems with this idea alone.<br/><br/>You can't ""know"" what all soldiers go through. There's too many different jobs, experiences, and personal beliefs that are told in any first hand accounts.<br/><br/>I don't think that anyone would consider EOD as a normal job, and is already far away from the traditional soldiering role, but then they force in unnecessary fire fights and sobbing confessions to make it look more like a 'war film'.<br/><br/>Nearly every scene won't make any sense to anyone that knows a little bit about the military. (Sniper scene, back alley scene, dismantling live bombs when they didn't have to, the whole Ranger EOD thing that I've at least never ever heard of, etc)<br/><br/>Boal keeps writing in this very depressing atmosphere that he used in his other film. But while that was based on a real-life tragedy, this was not.<br/><br/>I believe that this movie could have been an awesome classic as it had a very GREAT director and actors in it (except for JarJar), but was brought down with a low budget and an idiot screenwriter."

","By the time I saw the Hurt Locker, I already knew that the picture had won Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. I would say that expectations were high, but it won't change my review. The Hurt Locker is a movie lost in its own pointless plot. The story has been told before just in a different theater of combat. Jeremy Renner plays a soldier who is more comfortable in a war zone than his own home. He is the stereotypical renegade serving in an a Ordinance Disposal Unit. His character, Sergeant First Class William James, is fearless when it comes to defusing bombs. This puts him at odds with his unit who see him as dangerous and a threat to their own safety. Renner deserves no acclaim when it comes to his acting. He plays the character with well, but it really isn't acomplicated role. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow received critical acclaim as the director for creating a suspenseful documentary-style film. I didn't feel the suspense other than the suspense of waiting for the film to live-up to the hype. It was boorish and unworthy of an Oscar. One has to wonder if the distributer of the film, Summit Entertainment, really deserves the credit for a well-run Oscar campaign, or was this slight against her ex-husband James Cameron who is better known for his bad-mannered arrogance than his movies within the Hollywood circles. <br/><br/>This is a movie that leaves a viewer saying aloud ""is that it?"" as the credits rolled. It also doesn't help that the true heroes of the Iraqi war, the veterans, admonished the film as ""inaccurate"" and ""offending""."

"The_Dead_See","4","10","19","24 January 2010"," One of the most disappointing modern war movies, not deserving of such a high IMDb score
","Being a fan of all modern war movies; from the action-packed thrillers of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""The Kingdom"", to the fascinating and more gently-paced examinations of ""Jarhead"" and ""Home of the Brave""; I was really eager to see The Hurt Locker. Word on the street was good, the IMDb score was high, not to mention that I've enjoyed all Kathryn Bigelow's previous movies and I find Jeremy Renner very likable in anything I've seen him in...<br/><br/>So what a surprise it was when The Hurt Locker turned out to be uninspiring and dull-as-dishwater. If Bigelow's intention was to make the viewer feel as restless and bored as the guys behind the wire, then she succeeded. If her intention was in any way to thrill us, or to give us a glimpse into the life and mind of a modern soldier, I'd say she failed miserably.<br/><br/>The main problem with The Hurt Locker is that it feels like a bunch of (reasonably competent) scenes strung together with no rhyme or reason. There is no plot to speak of, and very little attempt is made to build audience identification with any of the characters. Every character leaves the movie just as ambiguous and unlikeable as when they entered it.<br/><br/>Some other reviewers have mentioned the inaccuracies. Not being a soldier myself I have no idea exactly how operations are run in the middle east... but I will say I harbored strong suspicions throughout the movie that it was wildly inaccurate. Rogue team leaders gallivanting around in the night? IED disposal experts that were also fully trained sniper units? I just wasn't buying it.<br/><br/>I'm truly surprised this film has such a high IMDb score. If you want action, it doesn't really deliver - go get The Kingdom instead. If you want good drama try Jarhead instead. The Hurt Locker is a poor substitute for a whole host of much better movies."

","When I first heard the movie is winning 6 (!!!)

I expected all the things I couldn't get - to get a grip from the beginning, great tension, good character development, excellent actors play, something to shake me and leave me speechless after wards and so on ... you know, what great movies are about - and I must tell you how huge really, really was I disappointed. First of all, this is an all American movie made only for Americans to see in order to empower their fake patriotism and to blow horns of one ""great superpower"" once again. But let us not forget - you Americans are AGRESSORS in Iraq, YOU started that war, pretending it to be ""war on terror"", fighting with people you once protect and supply with arms and money, like this dude Osama Ben Laden for example, who did great job in Chechnia back there on the Chechen side, killing with US help thousands and thousands innocent civilians (which US is certainly doing also in Iraq by any means!). Remember that YOU have put yourself at the enemy side FIRST and not Iraquis. So, in my native country we have an old proverb saying ""what has called, such has answered"", meaning you cannot expect kindness from the people you kill in everyday basis! The truth is the terror in Iraq has begun AFTER you INVADED this country and definitely WILL NOT disappear from there UNTIL you stay there! The truth is the Americans are hated by the ordinary Iraqui people for what US did in the country and for nothing more, hence you cannot expect anyone but US and their allies to sympathize this movie by giving it rewards it certainly doesn't deserve. In other words - do not spend your money on this pile of rubbish which is pure propaganda as well.

"DICK STEEL","10","12","24","28 October 2009"," A Nutshell Review: The Hurt Locker
","There are enough films out there made by the West over the years on the current theatre of war in the Middle East, either indirect political thrillers like Syriana or Lions for Lambs, or action based ones such as The Kingdom, or Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker, which is a superb, microscopic examination of the state of confusion, fear and desperation for survival seen from the eyes of a small, three man detachment from the Explosive Ordinance Unit, who basically risk their lives on a daily operational basis to disarm bombs and improvised explosives so as to save countless more of civilians and fellow soldiers alike.<br/><br/>The presentation style adopted, shaky cam cinematography aside for that documentary feel of the field, is a narrative joy to behold, where each scene stems from its respective incident, and there's plenty of patience devoted to the development of each scene proper without the feeling of being dragged out longer than its welcome. I think I can count the number of major sequences here with my fingers, where nothing came across as rushed, and provided ample opportunity for you to bond with the characters, ponder over their motivation and action, and <br/><br/>For action junkies, there's plenty here that will leave you literally begging for more, ranging from edge-of-your-seat type race against time in defusing devices, made all the more exciting when you have a wild man at the helm of the operations, to sniper action, close quarter combat, and the likes. You'll also applaud the authentic feel for the film in terms of its section movement techniques, and its divide between the pencil pushers versus real men on the ground with tremendous field knowledge. Watch out too for notable cameos by the likes of David Morse, Guy Pearce and even Ralph Fiennes!<br/><br/>Before you brand this film as pro-war and a one-sided view, this film actually examines how war has an effect on the soldiers participating in it. Granted that it doesn't provide a balanced viewpoint from both sides, because it is not this film. Rather, we see how some are adrenaline junkies out for action and adventure, with little regard for the tremendous risks that surround, or those who need constant counselling in order to deal with the confusion and the pain, or about those who are just counting the days to get out of the hell hole, by following orders to the book.<br/><br/>The film centers around its star character Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner in a fine outing here), who joins Bravo company and heads his two man team of Sergeant Sanborn (Anrew Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who are left rudderless after an incident gone wrong. Naturally it takes time for everyone to warm up together as a team, made all the more difficult by William's guts and unorthodox methods out in the field. But when they do gel together, it's an out of this world feeling that they could take on all insurgents, and the world even, as they buddy up and prove that they could hold their own, as good or better than private contractors and mercenaries in the war zone for profits and glory.<br/><br/>The opening quote had highlighted that war could be an addiction to some, and this is something to ponder over, since it is probably telling that some may feel more alive when they are constantly on the brink of experiencing death. William is one such man, who's actually the best what what he does, and his record of more than 800 bombs defused would have been a telling indication that he has served more than his fair share of the tour of duty. He's a wild man alright, preferring to live life on the edge.<br/><br/>I can't say I've seen a lot of war movies or am a war movie junkie, but The Hurt Locker definitely ranks up there amongst the best I've seen thus far, and it is definitely a highly recommended adrenaline pumper!"

","For a new movie about a war still going on, Hurt Locker reminds me a lot of any number of war movies I've seen over the last sixty years. A maverick who gets away with all kinds of unorthodox ways because he's so good at his dangerous task is a familiar character -- John Wayne played one in Sands of Iwo Jima, and there have been lots of others some of whom even defused unexploded bombs in WW II. I'm somewhat willing to grant all the unlikely incidents for the sake of a good story. My basic complaint is that it's not very well-done as a story. The movie is essentially a string of incidents not tied well with each other. They could be arranged in almost any order without much changing the movie. And some of them strike me as most unlikely, even for a maverick skilled at his trade. And most of them just come to an end, stop, with no real point. Specifically, the long section when the EOD team meets up with some civilian contractors and then gets into a sniping duel with insurgents just goes on . . . and on . . . and then it's sunset and everyone goes home.

Maybe the whole Iraqi occupation thing wasn't doing well on public opinion and a few awards would attract viewers and instantaneously improve the support for the war. Some vets and war connoisseurs have explained here how inaccurate this film is, regarding what happens in real life, from military discipline, chain of command, tactical stuff to the highly unlikeliness of going around Iraq alone, shooting ""natives"" and easily getting away with it. Of course, there are some details that deserve recognition, like sound and some photography. The only surprise is the killing of Guy Pearce, perhaps the best actor in the film, at the very beginning, only to be replaced by this cliché of a brave man. Guy Pearce's presence in this movie is as good as Samuel L. Jackson being killed by a shark during his motivational speech just a few minutes in in that terrible shark movie. So the movie is just a thriller full of fantasies and clichés, disrespectful to real war victims – soldiers or civilians -, the kind of movie that invites the unaware to join the military with the promise of becoming a hero, no matter what you have to do to achieve it. The kind of movie made to subtly impact on public opinion."

","over-rated, a so-what film boring at times not believable enough not a proper war film as could have been in a civvy situation but something had to get the Oscar guess this was it perhaps one year, they should be brave and not award it very predictable path through the film at least we didn't fall asleep during it better luck next time ms B. It was sold as the most intense and realistic war film ever and it is so not. Maybe I was spoiled by watching Generation Kill before seeing this. This was more like an action film. Everything about it was so obvious. I knew who was going to die and when and I could tell when they were going to ""overcome adversity"" and bond. At a certain point, I was able to turn my brain off and accept the crazy and unbelievable things the soldiers were doing, under the guise of ""it's just a movie,"" but that still couldn't stop me from seeing every plot point signposted a mile away. In a movie that's about building up tension, that's not a good thing. I think I liked Near Dark better."
"dan-649-82159","Null","3","4","20 July 2011"," Where are the characters?
","Sat down to watch this for the first time last night, expecting great things given the various gushing reviews from the critics, and of course that famous, unexpected defeat of Avatar at the Oscars. <br/><br/>First things first, the cinematography is first class. The depiction of war torn, downtown Baghdad is suitably bleak, tense, and intimidating, with hidden roadside bombs, hostile locals, and insurgents who blend into the crowd giving our heroes a number of challenges in addition to their day job of defusing and making safe IEDs. The sense of tension and the general awkwardness and danger of being unwelcome foreigners in a hostile land is both palpable, and established firmly very early on in the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after this promising start, the film goes downhill rapidly. What we have is a sequence of documentary style depictions 'days in the lives', which quickly degenerates into a repetitive sequence of bomb defusing, bit of shooting, the odd explosion, another bomb defusing, a bit more shooting and so on. Beyond this, there is no plot to speak of, and apart from Renner's character Staff Sergeant William James, Bigelow gives us no insight into any of the other characters, what makes them tick, or who they are. <br/><br/>The whole film felt to me like Renner, plus a load of extras who seem to spend an inordinate amount of time just standing around, pointing their guns, sweating and looking scared. And as a result I didn't really care if they lived or died. Compared for example to Saving Private Ryan, which engages you with a number of characters, and builds empathy to the degree where their deaths or even their fears have a deep, almost personal effect on you as a viewer, this falls woefully short.<br/><br/>There are also question marks around James, the one character we do get to understand a little bit about. Brilliantly acted by Renner, James is a bit of a cliché as a good old fashioned brilliant, but slightly unhinged genius, who follows his own rules, and does things his own way (basically a reheated version of Maverick from Top Gun). And if that means putting himself or his team in harm's way, then so be it. I have no direct experience of the US Army, but the concept that any disciplined force would allow someone to habitually disregard procedure, endanger themselves, and more importantly their team without consequence, and flip the bird to a superior when asked to stop doing something, is frankly laughable. <br/><br/>There are some good moments. Renner's banter with the entrepreneurial, porn dealing street kid ""Beckham"" is one example, but my overriding questions remain. Where are the characters, where is the plot, and ultimately, what is the point? I cannot believe this won an Oscar."

","I felt annoyed that I invested the time I did in this film so I do not wish to waste any more than I need to in writing too deep a review on it. In that respect I will keep it brief.<br/><br/>I am giving one star to this based purely on the cinematography, it was shot beautifully; anyone who can film such a bland backdrop and such slow paced scenes of nothing occurring - and keep you watching - deserves and Oscar quite rightly, its a shame the person was wasted on such a pathetic project.<br/><br/>Let me shoot this off right at the start: the credit that this film gets, the praise and all the commendations to things like tension, action, drama, suspense etc... yes they are all there, I'm not taking away from that - but this film gets these accolades undeservingly, it is all there gratis based on the theme alone. It is like heaping praise on ""Buried"" for getting claustrophobia right, when the film is nothing but over an hour of just a guy in a box. You'd have to be seriously damaged in some way, to make a film based on a guy disarming bombs in a conflict zone, to not convey a sense of tension or suspense; throw in the fact he is practically burnt out and sociopathic and there is your drama angle.<br/><br/>It isn't harsh to say the story could be turned out by anyone in a toilet break, however what is most insulting is that there is no setup or worthy conclusion. The film is all filler and due to a lofty sense of self-worth and the lovely cinematography, the grandstanding sense of it all tries to make it seem deliberate that it is entirely in medias res, and goes nowhere from there, to disguise any lack of coherent story or message deserving of the praise this film earnt.<br/><br/>This culminates leaving any viewer with a taste in film, and an inquisitive mind, feeling that whilst the subject matter in actual life is profound, should a film depicting it be respected based on that alone, or should the film be judged on its own merits? In that light, anyone brave enough should realise and be happy to say Jeremy Renner is his typical one dimensional self, same singular-expression-only face as in Bourne Without Bourne, Avengers and Mission Impossible Whatever - the story is non-existent - the dialogue may as well have been improvised - and the conclusion is insulting. If the message we are all to take from this is something along the lines of evil breeds evil, or if this was to be an examination of the apathy that the realisation of the fact conflict cannot end conflict, brings to a man whose purpose it is in life to fight... then it says very little of the audience the filmmakers aimed this at, and in that sense it is insulting; and it is very difficult to see little more in this piece than that, as it is all so ""look how bad war is"", and ""this man's life is ruined and all he wanted to do was serve his country, awww"".<br/><br/>Most insulting is that this film has this topical issue about it all... it is one thing to capitalise on the latest craze kids are into and try to make a quick buck, whether its peddling a cheap film about dinosaurs or ninjas or aliens; but people here knew, make a film about our boys risking life and limb in a sandy place, and make it grim and sad and nobody will dare criticise it for fear of appearing unamerican and a terrorist lover. Well this film is an act of terror in my eyes, I love Jeremy Renner even though I think he is one dimensional just as I think Nick Cage is a one trick pony too but I like him anyway... I can even forgive the unoriginal subject matter here... however, the lazy exploitation of everything serious that it is based on kills this, don't let your patriotism make you feel otherwise. This is slow, uneventful, weak nonsense, shamelessly dressed up in a suffering flag, to try and guilt-trip some sense of duty-to-like-it from all Americans."

","I really don't get why this film has gotten such critical acclaim. I have nothing against the film personally, and I went into it thinking it would be quite good because of all the reviews, but it was pretty much just a boring movie. I don't know how else to put it.<br/><br/>Essentially, the same thing happens three or so times: Jeremy Renner's character goes out on some mission, does the task in some way that's supposed to make you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, and the goes back to base camp. I think part of the problem was that I couldn't connect with any of the character, and thus didn't care what happened to them. Maybe I just don't like Jeremy Renner, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Anyways, everybody was saying that it was such a fantastic modern interpretation of the Iraq War, with stunning camera-work and acting, and a gripping plot line. Well, I pretty much disagree with all of that. In fact, the movie actually kind of annoyed me, because I kept waiting for something to happen, for the whole thing to go somewhere, but it simply never does.<br/><br/>I really wouldn't recommend this movie, and I honestly don't understand how it has gotten so much praise."

","It seems that people are either hating this film or loving it. Well, I think I can easily sum this up for anyone considering watching this.<br/><br/>It's basically ""Generation Kill"", just with different characters and not enough time to develop all the characters. The movie was over two hours and yet I wanted to learn more about the characters. I was really drawn into the characters and there was a lot of depth that could have been played upon, yet it seems a lot of story remains on the cutting room floor. Besides the characters, there seemed to be a few sub-plots to the story that were not being told and it really left me wanting more. Perhaps this really should have been told in a mini-series format, because some things are just left hanging and you need to fill in the details yourself. Maybe if it was a mini-series though, the Generation Kill producers would cry foul, because they're that close in format to one another. It makes me wonder which production came first or was there some collaboration between them? <br/><br/>Bottom line, if you liked Generation Kill, then you'll like this without a doubt. It's production is the same caliber and it's only missing the length to call it a true squeal."

"Vincent20666","1","7","13","5 October 2010"," Pathetic attempt of filmmaking *Spoiler*
","This must be one of the worst war movies i've seen... ever... and i've seen many.<br/><br/>There are so many factual errors in this movie that I, for the life of me, cannot... I repeat, CAN NOT understand why ANYone would rate this flick higher than the 3 stars is should have gotten at the very best.<br/><br/>If there is 1 genre which needs to be accurate in it's portrayal of characters, events and surroundings, it's movies about actual wars, past or present. Both Ms. Bigelow and writer Mark Boal obviously couldn't care less...<br/><br/>It starts with the very first 15 seconds. When the camera is facing the ground it's travelling a can of Pepsi flashes into frame. The US does not export Pepsi to Iraq nor do those countries that write in the English language. But ah well... we're just 20 seconds into the movie... how bad can it be, right?<br/><br/>Bombsquad... just 3 men, a Humvee and a robot... in downtown Baghdad or whatever... to try and defuse a 155mm grenade. Bombsquad? In a war zone? Defusing bombs? Who writes this stuff?? Not a care in the world about possible insurgents of course... The butcher across the street has a cellphone he will use to detonate the IED.. but not after being scope-spotted (missing cross-hair) by a bomb squad 'specialist' which makes a run towards him yelling, 'I can't get a shot!' Really?? He didn't just shoot the guy but RAN TOWARDS HIM?<br/><br/>Later in the movie they encounter armed 'insurgent-look-a-likes'. After disarming them they find out these men are Americans as well... why didn't they identify themselves? After receiving enemy fire from 850 meters away, half that team gets killed because they didn't seem to understand the meaning of 'Cover' or 'Keep your head down'. So now it comes down to the bomb squad specialists to take down the insurgents. They use the Barret .50 sniper rifle and guess what... they seem to be trained sniper-spotter specialists too. Never mind the fact that they're in the exact same spot where the the American sniper just got killed. The 3rd member of the bomb squad needs to clean the .50 ammo 'cause the blood of the previous sniper made it jam. But he can't get the blood off!! Scared, nearly crying and almost frozen stiff of fear as he is, he seems to manage spotting an insurgent on the track 200 meters behind him. Just in time 'cause the insurgent is already watching the exposed specialist for about a minute to shoot him in the eye. He then tells the sarge he spotted someone and ASKS the sarge if he can take the shot. The sarge replies by saying that that's his call, not even looking over his shoulder to assess the threat. Just blindly relying on the 'specialists' capabilities to cover his back. He takes the shot and kills the insurgent without him even knowing bullets were coming his way. Meanwhile, the sniper, a former intelligence-agent, not quite yet a bomb specialist takes the shot and takes down a running insurgent at a distance of 850 meters... Now that's one hell of a shot! But as if that was just a normal everyday routine the spotter calmly says something like, 'Target down... bye bye'<br/><br/>Just 2 scenes of a movie which is filled with this lame-ass crap. Not responding to incoming radio traffic, refusing to communicate, always being exposed and asking what to do, running back to camp on your own after a night out in downtown war zone without being hurt or spotted by insurgents, empty streets, being stopped by traffic jams and not fearing for an ambush, not shooting a taxi driver which runs a roadblock on purpose and then pointing a gun at his face for 2 minutes before the taxi driver decides to back up an slowly go back... It goes on and on...<br/><br/>Obviously there has been no research whatsoever, disregarding actual facts of war. It's not a war flick. It's trying to be a drama about some bomb squad specialist whom seem to deal with the daily situations each in a different way.<br/><br/>The character development is not shallow... it's missing all together, no matter what anyone else says. The emotional scenes are out of sync with the depicted situations. The bomb squad sarge claims to only love his newborn son but when returning home after his emotional distress... he seems to have no problem leaving his only love behind to go and recklessly risk his incompetent life again by signing up for another year.<br/><br/>The writer, Mark Boal, should stick to writing microwave manuals and Ms. Bigelow might try again but hopefully next time it will be for the new detergent add on TV.<br/><br/>This film is highly overrated and should have NEVER gotten an Oscar.<br/><br/>If this review can save you some money, but more importantly, 2 hours of your life, well, than...<br/><br/>mission accomplished."

It simply lost its bearing early during the film, and to watch the remainder of it was a chore. It was almost obscenely lazy and deliberately unfocused at that point. Simply stated, it was boring.

"darkblak","5","7","13","10 March 2010"," Some tension, no story
","I had this movie on my ""virtual shelf"" for a long time and was meaning to watch it after hearing all the rave reviews, but somehow eventually only got to view it after the Oscar. And it was an ever bigger disappointment for it.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow has directed a no-nonsense film here which is straightforward, tense and feels realistic(which, reading war veterans' reviews, it really isn't, but hey, it's Hollywood after all). The bomb defusal and sniping scenes, with the help of some shakycam and a great score, create a lot of tension, and along with the glimpses of life within a soldier's camp can really suck you into this grim world. I actually felt worse and worse watching this movie partly because of this, which might be a good thing in this case. (The other part though is unforgivable - but see the fourth indent for that.) <br/><br/>It has its clear imperfections - what's a soldier doing hitting a superior with so little reason? How do you hit a running target with a sniper rifle? How many Iraqis would put a bomb inside a dead body? These are the sorts of unreal moments that even the Hollywood-trained viewer can hardly tolerate.<br/><br/>But the really bad thing is the total lack of story here. The Hurt Locker plays like a fake documentary, portraying war just for the sake of portraying war and nothing else. What really happens in the film? Think about it. Someone tries to defuse a bomb and gets blown up. Army camp scene. Someone successfully defuses a bomb. Army camp scene. Go back to Step 1.<br/><br/>In the end, you are left empty-handed. What was the film trying to say? Nothing. It's hard to be a soldier, and even harder if you have an estranged ex-wife at home. Right. Is that all? Did it give you anything to take with? Any moral conclusions, anything? No.<br/><br/>I am puzzled by all the people calling The Hurt Locker ""near-perfect"" and ""brilliant"" and such. It is very, very far from perfect and the zero-story attitude is easy to see from early on. Editing is good, cinematography is good, sounds are great, but The Hurt Locker is just the sum of its parts, nothing more. And there aren't too many parts here to put together."

"tenten76","6","6","11","21 March 2010"," How can a film about danger and explosives be so boring?
","Synopsis: Some soldiers like soldiering, some don't. Bombs are dangerous. What a revelation.<br/><br/>Hurt Locker is too contrived to be a documentary, but not exciting enough to be a drama. I didn't care about the characters at the beginning, and I didn't care about them at the end. Most frustrating of all, I didn't care (and wasn't surprised) if and when any of the bombs went off. There are plot/narrative problems in virtually every scene. For a film with otherwise decent acting and production values, this is appalling.<br/><br/>Given the gushing praise by the critics, perhaps I should expand on some of the problems I have, so here goes. Sgt James: When he acts recklessly, irresponsibly and possibly illegally, there are no consequences either from his team, other soldiers or his superiors (eg. throwing down a smoke-screen so his team can't see him, even though anyone nearby holding a detonator still can.. kidnapping an Iraqi to drive him off-base into the night, armed & alone, breaking into / trespassing into Beckham's home, all apparently for nothing.. leading his team, again alone, into what could have been a back-alley ambush leading to an international incident..). However, when Sgt James does something logical - like discarding bulky armour which would have offered no protection against a huge bomb, allowing him to work faster and more comfortably to disarm it - his colleagues go nuts. If this is truly against the rules (in real life), then why again are there no consequences. A punch in the mouth for threatening his and possibly others' lives is not 'a consequence'. Also, perhaps I am wrong on this point, but if I was working to defuse a bomb and my teammates were bickering over the radio and would not shut up, I think it is entirely reasonable to turn that radio off or to shoot one of them.<br/><br/>Why do the soldiers speak almost no Arabic? I can understand the need for translators at times, but I live under the assumption that soldiers in foreign countries are trained to communicate with the locals to a basic degree, and - hopefully - to behave towards them with a little more respect, if they expect any sort of cooperation. The behaviour of all military personnel in Hurt Locker only reinforces the worst stereotypes of the US forces.<br/><br/>Would a lone shepherd, in poor cover, really try to take a few shots at an unknown number of armed soldiers? Would those same soldiers have trouble working out that several accurate and deadly gunshots might be coming from the three or four men obviously taking cover in the only structure in a 360 degree radius? Antics at the base: I imagine a lot of soldier-types probably do wrestle or fight or hold stomach-punching competitions, but this does not endear me to their characters. Quite the opposite; it confirms negative stereotypes, and I hope that anyone not able to function at 100% the next day because they allowed a colleague to beat them up (along with that colleague) would be subject to some sort of punishment. Is that how soldiers really bond? Do they sniff each other's asses and chase cars too? Am I supposed to care about these morons? A thought about casting: When you have unknown actors working hard to put in good performances, try not to a) tease us with Guy Pearce & Ralph Fiennes - two of the finest actors in the world - only to get rid of them both within a matter of seconds, or b) disrupt the end of the film with an appearance by somebody as recognisable as Evangeline Lilly, but give her nothing to do which essentially means that her only character trait is 'hey, it's Evangeline Lilly from Lost'. It's not fair to these actors, or to the other actors, or to the realism of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, although I like the look of The Hurt Locker (locations/sets/photography) it strikes me that there are no evocative views, no contemplative shots, no really authentic 'foreign' scenes. Again, HL doesn't work as a documentary, so why not get some free emotion out of the cinematography? The soundtrack (if there was one) does nothing. And the sound effects are not real-enough; gunshots and explosions in real-life are temporarily deafening, producing disorientation and ringing-in-the-ears (and drama). All they produce in Hurt Locker is ennui."

","I came out of that movie and said; ""THAT, got 6 Oscars... You've got to be kidding!"" (Daughter, 20, liked it BTW). The main character, Sgt James, just isn't believable. He is reckless, in a job where reckless would get you (and probably those around you) killed. (And the censure of your superiors and colleagues). In short, I see the movie as written, and then made by people who have a perception of the military which is far removed from how things truly are. The acting was good, the camera work good, the story line terrible. If a Vietnam era protester who has never been in uniform, would never do so because their values, experience and theories are far removed from those who would, made a movie based on their perceptions, this would be that movie.

Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away, without having asked a question (in a proper way). It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war.. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work.<br/><br/>It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural.<br/><br/>This picture left a question in my head: WHY?

""Weight of Water"" was miraculous. ""Strange Days"" was strange enough to matter. She knows what she is doing.<br/><br/>So here is a choice. War is cinematic. We will always have war movies. Do you make ""Platoon""? Or do you make ""Full Metal Jacket""?<br/><br/>This is to say, is it a movie about a man in a war, who bends the war to himself. In this case we will cheer as tides are reversed and the moon flies backwards. We win! <br/><br/>Or is is about a war, about the world that grinds us up in spite of ourselves, and incidentally can people flash their eyes in the smoke of the tornado? These are harder to make, and we do not cheer. We only have nightmares and sometimes — too rarely — do something about it.<br/><br/>Bigelow goes for the cheap shot. It is excellent and AI would see it again. But she made a clear choice to go for the testosterone flavored ice cream. And because it is so well made, we are possibly worse off for it.

","Interesting view on the war in Iraq by taking the American bomb squad crew as main characters. This makes the feature original compared to other Iraq-based films. Actors in this feature where very good, the feature covered 3 members of a bomb squad performing bomb-diffusing missions in Iraq. It showed how hostile the situations are in Iraq and how difficult the communication is when not everybody speaks the same language. The scenes and landscapes where realistic and the way the feature was directed made it less like a action film and more like a documentary. Explosion scenes are well put together, seemed like they used special slow motion/high frame rate camera's for nice effects. One of the best features about the Iraq war in my opinion."

Then, using the illegally-acquired, classified footage of the Bin Laden raid, illegally given to them by Obama, they will weasel voter opinion toward him in hopes people will forget, until after November elections, what a disaster of a president he is.

","Going into ""The Hurt Locker,"" I was expecting an Oscar-worthy couple hours. Sadly, I was disappointed. This is a somewhat enjoyable film, but only if you remove the lenses of reality and treat it as a popcorn action movie that desperately wants to be more than it is.<br/><br/>At first, I liked the treatment of the Iraq war in a neutral way -- showing the gritty awfulness of war without descending into the political maelstrom surrounding the U.S. invasion. But with time, it just became more and more problematic for me. The Iraq war isn't neutral, and much of the reality was lost with the superficial stereotyping of both sides in an attempt to steer clear of controversy.<br/><br/>The bigger problem for me, though, was the ridiculousness of the squad's behavior. I have no military experience or family or friends, but this just looked all wrong right from the beginning. Reading many of the comments on here, it seems actual military folks agree. No bomb squad works this way, and most of the ""tense"" scenes were terrifically unrealistic. They also had zero suspense for me, as the filmmakers telegraphed what was going to happen every time.<br/><br/>Where I thought the movie worked was as an abstract piece of human drama. Jeremy Renner gives a great performance, as do his co-stars. And if you let all the realism problems go and watch the movie for what it appears the filmmakers were trying to say -- that the ugliness of war creates both an adrenaline need and a fatalism that allows increasingly dangerous risk-taking -- the movie is kind of enjoyable.<br/><br/>I find that theme fairly flaccid as a real commentary on war, though -- and especially impotent as a portrayal of the Iraq war, of all things.<br/><br/>There are great war movies that reveal the horror and human drama of war while being realistic, acknowledging the truth and lies in foreign policy and still avoiding polemics. This is not one of those films."

Just like the current Iraq War; this film shows the intensity, craziness, despair, paranoia, the dangers and hopelessness of this war. This is no end in their battle. The Hurt Locker doesn't have much of a story but instead, it concentrates on giving you the realism of this actual Iraq War.<br/><br/>Unlike any other war film, there isn't a body count or taking over any property or land that determines the winner of this war. Instead, the priority of this war focuses on defusing bombs. The Hurt Locker only follows three main characters in this film, as they are members of a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in Iraq. We travel their tour together as they contend with defusing bombs, the threat of insurgency, and the tension that develops among them.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is perfect for what it is; but it doesn't have any re-watch value as this is a very uneasy movie to watch, similar to the film United 93. The only plot is for the characters to stay alive. What works in the film is the directing, photography and its cinematography. With how this film is shot gives you the experiences of how the soldiers are exactly feeling as they are in constant dangers.

The movie has got an episodic structure - the viewer finally gets used to - that mainly consists of stand-alone sequences showing details of the main characters. There's no doubt that the flick has many suspenseful scenes and effectively gets the interest rarely to flag. There are also some boring nighttime missions that certainly doesn't help but on the whole the film is taut and well acted.

","I knew little about this film and saw it on the strength of its Oscar successes. How did they get it so wrong? I am not, nor have ever been in the Army, but the bizarre behavior of these soldiers appeared totally at variance with reality - particularly for a film which was supposedly portraying ""real life"". Thinking it was just me, I read some user reviews on this site. After reading 12 pages of reviews, I found only 2 positive reviews - how does a 7.9 rating stand up? I will leave the military inaccuracies to others more experienced to comment. I found the film pointless, lacking a coherent message and worst of all boring. The characters were completely unlikable and disengaging. The scenes were disconnected, lacked explanation or context, and left this viewer frustrated. I kept waiting for a plot or a even a point to emerge but was sadly disappointed. Most of the scenes annoyed me but two in particular grated. The first was when a superior officer (who he was and why he was there were not explained) addressed Sgt James after a mission. He praises James at length in a highly sarcastic fashion. I was waiting for James to be then either hit, arrested , abused, or something - but it was all left up in the air. The officer never appeared again - what was all that about? The second scene involved the Army doctor deciding to go out in the field to experience it for himself. Supposedly a US Army Colonel, he sounded a lot more like Peewee Herman. He then gets blown to bits - what a surprise. This is a cliché-ridden, swiss-cheese ""plotted"", highly irritating film that achieves precisely nothing on any level."

I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. The same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white.

Other times just keep pointing the guns and shouting then maybe they'll suddenly get English.<br/><br/>Undeniably the topic (the job) is interesting, but I fail to find the viewpoint and focus. There are very classic moments - like the first time we see our hero on duty, and like the desert scene. But there are also extremely dull and forced moments. The tension becomes a boring routine and by the last quarter of the film whoever dies will not surprise me at all. All characters are stereotypical - you see them in almost every war film. Even the little unnaturally conducted relationship with the local boy is stereotypical. The few confrontations and the last soul-to-soul chat make everyone uncomfortable, including the camera.<br/><br/>If this was not the film that just won the best motion picture, I probably would've been kinder. But a best film should possess better quality in script, in character development, in story, in acting, AND in continuity (it's a shocker!). Unfortunately this is a long film about 3 not-so-interesting people.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a war film. The only war is a guy fighting against his own passion for work. This film is not trying to say (and criticize) that this guy is just a piece of war machine not unlike the suicide bombers. No. It's saying that if that's the only thing you love (your own son included), then go for it and be a hero.

However, every single scene that tried to be meaningful sort of fell flat. The whole ""war is a drug"" thing was tacked on poorly near the end.

A message like that is probably a poor example of how to try to appease an audience that might actually be made up of people currently in that war.<br/><br/>Though The Hurt Locker was a good watch, I felt that this movie could have really used some Rah Rah BS.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","7","15","14 March 2010"," Perfect balance between art and entertainment makes worthy Oscar winner
","Critics call this the best Iraq war movie to-date, for good reasons. Without grand rhetoric or overwrought war-horror, it is a realistic, close-up (in more ways than one) of the lives of three soldiers during their last month of a duty rotation in Baghdad, in a succession of missions in the city and neighbouring deserts.<br/><br/>Starting with a quote from New York Times former war correspondent Chris Hedges: ""War is a drug"", the movie plunges into a nail-biting sequence of a bomb defuse mission, through POV-inducing hand-held cameras (which is used only one more time in the rest of the movie, a very wise decision), expert editing, deployment of close-up as well as long shots, all backed with drum roll, pulsating-heart music. The remarking thing is that the audience does not feel for a moment that these scenes are manipulative or contriving because these are no cheap tricks to create unrealistic tension. Instead, they are taken right into midst of the endeavour of this three-man team, an endeavour that ended in tragedy, the death of their leader demolition expert, a cameo role taken up gracefully by Guy Pearce.<br/><br/>Thus we plunge into the story when eccentric Staff Sergeant Will James is brought in as a replacement. The next sequence right away highlights the interesting contrast of the three members. Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) is anything but eccentric, something vital for his role in the team as the protector of the hero in the front line negotiating the bomb. Staying back outside the dangerous ""death zone"", he monitors everything around the scene while James focuses on a most intricate set of wires that becomes the thin line between life and a hideous death. Rookie Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) completes this trio, and it soon becomes apparent that ""specialist"" spells glorified errand boy. Upon arriving at the first scene of action, and to Sanborn's annoyance, James loses no time in demonstrating that he is the sort of charismatic character that laughs in the face of death, literally. The mission is accomplished with confident skill despite James' recklessness that verge on suicidal. Those are the initial broad brush portrays of these characters that continue to be developed and enriched throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The next mission, to disarm a load-full of explosives in the trunk of a car, takes James further along this persona, as he completely removed his heavy protective gears during the job, quibbling casually, ""If I am to die, I'd rather die when dressed comfortably"" (something to that effect). As expected, the conflict between James and Sanborn sharpens while Eldridge watches helplessly. But signs also gradually emerge that there is method in James' madness and control underneath his recklessness.<br/><br/>The turning point is another mission, apparently quite easy, that takes them into the nearby desert. An ambush by sharp-shooters turns out to be just as lethal as a bomb to be defused. This is the longest sequence in the movie. The long drawn out endurance contest with the enemy, under scorching desert heat, brings out the best of the protagonists as well as cement their comradeship (and friendship). Sanborn is reaffirmed as the solidly dependable professional, cautious, level-headed, if adhering rigidly to protocol. James' gentler side surfaces, as he handles Eldridge's awkward inexperience with patient mentorship. With lips cracking dry, he also offers the juice Eldridge pass him to Sanborn first before taking his own sips. Eldridge also rises to the occasion, responding with steady maturity when given a crucial job to handle a sniper that has flanked to their back.<br/><br/>As we understand more and more about our heroes, the movie becomes more intriguing. More characters emerge such as a smart, enterprising (selling DVDs) native kid who James befriends, and an army doctor who, despite lack of real experience at the front line, is Eldridge's adviser on emotional problems. The fiendish device of the human bomb is given some rather gruesome treatment. There are casualties, lethal and otherwise, as well as dramatic conflict and poignancy. All these are accompanied by first-rate action, but in this piece of Kathryn Bigelow's masterful work, action is not mindless, but rather a coherent part of an artistic cinematic achievement that fully deserves the six Oscars it win, including Bigelow's distinction as the first woman to win Best Director.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, after a few very brief scenes of domestic bliss with wife (or girlfriend, doesn't really matter) and baby in supermarket, kitchen and family room (in that order), James is back in Iraq, starting all over again his 365-day duty rotation. War may not be drug to every soldier (certainly not Sanborn). But to James, it's all too clear. But it's neither overzealous patriotism nor bloodthirstiness that drives him. He is a born artist as well as top professional in his field, and as long as bombs are to be defused, his place is there. To most people (probably the majority) the search for a reason for existence is hopelessly elusive. For fortunate James, that is never a problem. No wonder he is sometimes flamboyant to the point of recklessness on the job."

I figured it had to be at least pretty good if it won best picture for a war film.<br/><br/>It retained my interest for 20 minutes or so. after that, i kept waiting for something remotely interesting, that would classify this as a truly great film to occur. it just never happened.<br/><br/>Then, I kept waiting for it to end, looking at the time remaining bar, thinking what a bad choice buying this on PPV was.<br/><br/>Let me say first, to defenders who say ""it's not supposed to be a documentary"" to excuse inaccuracy. True. i have no problems with artistic liberties & creating a story. That is interesting. What bugs people like me, is that it was not historical inaccuracies, it was non-realistic silliness in terms of how soldiers fight etc. I support our US/allied troops, am not political and want them all to come home safe, but seeing them portrayed so irresponsibly is disgraceful. <br/><br/>Happily, there was no ""USA #1"" jingoism, as that annoys me too. the problem, was the totally unrealistic portrayal of those units in the military. It was like a more serious, better done Top Gun with IED's<br/><br/>It became silly watching the main character flout rules & the chain of command. It was nonsensical watching 3 guys just cruise around Iraq alone, without any type of escort.<br/><br/>Even more annoying, they are all alone somewhere in the desert with no support whatsoever. they see a group of British SAS operators, who are some of the most elite special forces on earth.<br/><br/>A small firefight breaks out, where the SAS team is essentially wiped out, by 3 insurgents from over one half mile away. but the American bomb disposal unit survives totally unscathed. an elite SAS man with sniper training cannot hit a target 850 meters away, but Sgt. Sanborn, with no sniper training takes them all out? including a head shot on a guy running, 850 meters away? With a weapon he has likely never trained on? There is so much of that type of nonsense that it is maddening.<br/><br/>I do not expect rigid adherence to detail or no leeway for artistic interpretation. <br/><br/>But i do expect semi-*realistic* situations in a film that won ""best picture"" for a war film! Running around alone off base at night? three guys with limited combat training splitting up all alone to ""go rogue"" in Baghdad at night? Rarely ever staying in touch with command on the radio? It becomes ludicrous.<br/><br/>As for ""best original script"" - Wow. shocked. I thought it must have been one hell of a script, for it to win over Tarantino for Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for great dialog, some humor, interesting twists & turns, characters, conversations. Any hallmarks of a great script. Some insight, an original idea...anything.<br/><br/>I did not hear one single line of dialog that did not sound regurgitated. No inspiration. Nothing.<br/><br/>And the story was not *THAT* original. Compared to Tarantino's writing this was amateurish. this was the writing of a reporter, not a screenwriter. Just awful.<br/><br/>As for Kathryn Bigelow, well, it is pretty obvious that all the hype was to get her an award, which worked. It was a ""time for a woman to win"" selection. <br/><br/>She offered *NOTHING* new to the genre. nothing that would qualify her directing as the ""best"" of the year. Honestly, what did she do? She used shaky cam so much that i thought the camera had epilepsy. Shaky cam once in a while is interesting. It has now been going on for 20 years and has become a crutch for mediocre directors who can only do action/thrillers. <br/><br/>Using a shaky cam, first person approach to combat, has now been done umpteen times, in better, more engaging combat movies. <br/><br/>It is as if she is saying ""Shake it more! This is supposed to be intense"".<br/><br/>Let's face it...it was a woman, directing a war movie, and that was like manna from heaven for lots of folks in the academy who want to bestow plaudits based on what's ""right"", not based on what's best.<br/><br/>It is not as if she was some genius overlooked year after year, for amazing films and provocative and searing stuff that was changing cinema, but going sadly unnoticed by ignorant meanies. She's 58 and has directed 7 films in 27 years including such horrible flicks as Blue Steel, Point Break & K19.<br/><br/>Sofia Coppolla did *FAR* better with Lost In Translation.<br/><br/>I voted a 4, cause of decent acting, high production values and being an important subject about the soldier on the front lines. I did not give it a 1. it is not Gigli bad.<br/><br/>It was a war thriller, not much different than ""The Kingdom"" albeit more serious.<br/><br/>I don't know what the critics who praised this to the moon were thinking. normally i regard the critics overall as being right most of the time with some latitude. i could see calling this a good thriller, but best picture? Something stinks and it is the politics of Oscar season.<br/><br/>as far as war movies go, it is nowhere near The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>For the record, i am not an Avatar lover, i did not see it. I find Cameron's technical nous to be impressive, but his story & characters are not interesting & his writing leaves much to be desired, so my grudge is not Avatar-based.

Unfortunately for Thompson it is the end of the war and of his life.<br/><br/>His replacement, Staff Sgt. William James, is a fearless man. From the start he exudes confidence, as he approaches each task that requires his talent for disconnecting an explosive device intended to end the lives of American soldiers. His team is composed by Sgt. Sanborn and by Specialist Owen Eldridge, who cover up while James goes to do his job. It is easy to understand the pressure the three men face on a daily basis and the dangers they are under. It takes nerves of steel to accomplish each mission entrusted to them as anyone of the curious onlookers could be detonating the bombs with their cell phones.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the most accomplished accounts about a war in recent memory. Thanks to its director, Kathryn Bigelow, this picture keeps the viewer at the edge of his seat because of the action never stops. Ms. Bigelow was lucky in bringing to the screen Mark Boal's screenplay. He was responsible for writing the excellent ""In the Valley of Elah"" that dealt also with the Iraq conflict, but in a different form.<br/><br/>The film owes its appeal to Jeremy Renner, an actor that gets better all the time. His work in ""Dahmer"" was seen perhaps by a selected few, but one hopes the success of this film will bring him the recognition he rightfully deserves. Anthony Mackey makes a good contribution as Sgt. Sanborn, a man that goes by the book and who must be alert all the time to protect James. As the specialist Eldridge, Brian Geraghty does an outstanding job for Ms. Bigelow. Seen in small roles, Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes, do excellent work to enhance the film. <br/><br/>The film is triumph for Kathryn Bigelow."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","13","34","6 March 2010"," A Masterpiece War Film
","Hurt Locker, The (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Incredibly suspenseful and masterfully directed tale of an elite Army bomb squad serving a stint in Iraq where their lives are constantly at risk. A lot of this drama is centered around team leader Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner) who, as the opening quotations explains, is addicted to the dangers of war and it has become a drug to him. This is an exceptional little gem that will certainly go down as one of the greatest war movies ever made for several reasons. I think the greatest thing this film does is that it doesn't show war as some party-time exercise, which is what a lot of movies do. We see our troops killing during the day and then having parties at night. A lot of other war movies also like to take some sort of political stand but that doesn't happen here either. What's so important about this film is that it has the guts not to take any type of stand and it also clearly shows how incredibly brave these men are in doing what has to be one of the most dangerous jobs out there. Bigelow's direction is so perfectly done that she manages to drain every ounce of suspense each set up. The opening sequence of the film perfectly sets you up for everything that's going to follow as the bomb expert tries to defuse the bomb but this isn't the only threat because some civilians have started to gather around. The way Bigelow milks this scene from the suspense of the bomb as well as the suspense of having to watch everything that's going on around the bomb was masterfully done and I really can't think of another war film that put you in the middle of danger and really makes you feel the dangers of the job. Another terrific sequence is when the men run into some other American soldiers when a sniper begins to fire on them. Most films, including great ones, would turn this into a major shoot out but that doesn't happen here. Instead, this sequence runs for quite a while and it again shows the dangers and outright torture it would have to be going through this. Seeing the men burning up under the sun but not being able to move once again put you right there in showing the tortures to survive. The relationship between James and Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) is also handled quite well as the love/hate thing is certainly there and it's never exploited. Instead we get to see a real relationship and everything between the two comes off very real and most importantly it comes off human. Renner's performance is a terrific one as he fits this role so perfectly that you'd think you were watching a documentary of a real guy. He gives the type of performance that doesn't need words because his body gestures and his eyes can tell you everything he's feeling and thinking. Mackie, Guy Pearce and David Morse are all terrific in their roles as well. I would question the search for the kid in the later part of the film but outside of this THE HURT LOCKER is near flawless in its execution. The majority of the credit should certainly go to Bigelow because it's not often that I'm this impressed with a director doing their magic and really creating something special. I'm sure many people, myself included, asked if we really needed yet another war film but the answer was yes because we get to see something original and unlike anything we've seen before."

","""If I'm going to die, I'm going to die comfortable."" – Sergeant First Class William James.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker was a great ""suspense, action, war, drama"". It does a very good job of showing us the ""unsung"" inside of an American bomb disposal squad in Iraq and the ""craziness"" of Sergeant James in particular, as they count down the number of days left in Bravo Company's rotation.<br/><br/>In comparison to past films such as ""Point Break"", ""Strange Days"" and ""K19: The Widowmaker"", which were all excellent films, Kathryn Bigelow did her usual excellent job of bringing us to a point of view we hadn't experienced or maybe considered before. Can you imagine wearing one of those bomb disposal suits every day in what's probably over 100 degree heat? The sad part of watching The Hurt Locker was that it had been so built up, that by the time I viewed it, nothing could have met my expectations. Kind of like Avatar, which I didn't see for a couple of months. By the time I saw it, I loved it, but it couldn't meet expectations.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a great film about an American bomb disposal unit in Iraq. It has all the features you'd expect in a movie focused on a singular aspect of a war (in this case bomb disposal). It has all the intensity, suspense, personal tragedy, stress, male bonding and personal conflicts you'd expect if you were in a tight unit who eats, sleeps and breaths each others ""everything"" for 365 days.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow did a great job of showing us the inner workings of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq where every day is a new problem, but also the same old thing Every time that they go out, it's a life or death struggle. Had any of us considered the concerns of a bomb disposal unit before? Basically, for them it's a loop, the same old same old. But if they make a mistake it means someones life."

What was the director of this movie thinking, what was the writer of this movie thinking, and most importantly, what was the academy thinking? Six Oscars? Really? Just from watching the first five minutes, anybody can tell that it is a painfully slow and poorly paced story, with a plot that seems to have no cohesion whatsoever. The characters are also excruciatingly shallow. Why should I care about the well-being of these soldiers if I don't know anything about them? And if I don't care about any of these characters, then why am I watching the movie? Sadly, this is a question I asked myself too frequently during the 130 minute running time. That may not sound unreasonably long for a movie of this nature either, but in The Hurt Locker, where the plot just seems like an assortment of random, assorted tasks haphazardly edited together, you will be counting down the minutes until you can do something other than watching this disgustingly overrated ""movie."""

","Let's start by the simple lines. From the viewer's side, there a couple of good ""director details"", some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice. The special effects are good enough, a good acting/good scenery also. But the story is way too simple. It shows how a elite Army bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a serious action movie ""addicted"" guy, I missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. One of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to I consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time. It didn't happened to me. I stayed ""conscious"", for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Honestly speaking, I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the ""subconscious"" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator. More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that.<br/><br/>A simple thought: if this was a world war II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded?

","I saw the Hurt Locker on the same day that it won at the Oscars. It was a somewhat flawed but entertaining movie. I suppose it would be brilliant for anyone who know's nothing about Counter IED (C-IED) teams or how the military functions. I did enjoy the acting and the camera work and scene shots were authentic enough (despite the use of Canadian Bomb suits).<br/><br/>Questions? Would a real EOD team be running roughshod around IRAQ without any real supervision? What is it about Americans and the use of the Rank of Sergeant? It seems like everybody of importance in US movies is a Sergeant but in reality, Sergeants are entry level supervisors, not brilliant tacticians (I was one). If your going to go out and do any kind of operation, your going to have to go through mission briefings, give team briefings and your going to get orders and follow them. If I was on this guys team and he did what he did (endangering his troops), I'd kick him squarely in the N*^s and then refuse to go anywhere with him. What were they doing driving around without any security escort teams in old beat up Hum Vee's? Real EOD teams use specialized trucks (Buffalo, RG-31). <br/><br/>If you want to see a quality visual in the same vein, find and watch the HBO series ""Generation Kill."""
"dbborroughs","6","5","10","31 December 2009"," Pieces of a film and a spoon fed point make this less then the sum of its parts
","Story of the last 38 days of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq before they are rotated back to the United States. The story follows the group as a new disposal expert joins the squad and upsets things with an almost devil may care attitude that upsets the two men who are suppose to watch over him while he defuses the bombs. The film is essentially a series of six or seven missions and some related activity that takes them closer and closer to the time they are suppose to go home and shows the changing dynamic between the men.<br/><br/>Probable front runner for the Oscar has been consistently on the best of year lists of almost every film critic. Knowing this going into my seeing the film last evening I knew I was going in with a rather large chip on my shoulder concerning the film. I was expecting a major achievement. What I got was a good, solid film from Kathryn Bigelow, probably her best films, but not really one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Forgive me I'm kind of at a loss as to what to say since the film didn't really strike me as anything that is all that special. It is essentially a series of set pieces over the course of just over a month. As small little pieces the film works very well since one is never really sure how things will play out. However after the second or so mission I suddenly realized that the film was rather formulaic in its construction with the same thing happening (with two variations) over and over again. The result for me was a film that held me for the pieces but never really amounted to much over all. (An aside, one thing that really bothered me about the film, and made it seem like nothing but pieces, is that there is no sense of any place beyond the immediate. We are at the bomb site or this one street, or this stretch of desert or this room. There is no sense of the world outside of that one spot for that one sequence. Military base? no its a room? There are no places only sets, like the film which is not a whole film but set pieces) Ultimately I don't get the film. I got a good way in and I realized that I had kind of stopped caring. It seems that the whole point of the film is as the film says at the beginning, that war is a drug and that some people need to have that to feel alive. But at the same time we're told that at the beginning and then basically we watch as that plays out with little variation to the end when the final coda reinforces that point of view. Perhaps if Bigelow had put the statement at the end of the film instead of the beginning I would have felt less spoon fed. In all honesty what strikes me about the film thematically is that film feels like it should be about something more than the one thing, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what it is.<br/><br/>The cast is good, though any one going in with the intention of seeing the so called big stars, Guy Pearce, Evangeline Lilly, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, should be warned that most are little more than extended cameos and that its was wrong to list them over the title. The real star is Jeremy Renner at Sgt James, the bomb disposal expert.He's very good at being the hot shot loose canon who is extremely capable at what he does, even to the point of scaring his men.(And I think the anger at his tactics by some in the military is well founded since I think some of his moves would get him killed faster then one can say Jack Robinson) I'm trying to figure out how it fits into the rapidly growing Iraq/ Afghan war sub-genre. Certainly its one of the least clichéd, we don't have the convoy ambushed in a narrow street scene anywhere in it, then again its scenes of barracks life could have been swapped out to any number of other films. Since it actually deals with soldiers in the field its one of a small number of films that actually stay in the field the entire time (most films tend to deal largely with the home front). I would say that it one of the better films (and its far away from the worst which is probably Brian DePalma's Redacted).<br/><br/>Ultimately its a good, but not great film. Its more the sort of film that you'll like but walk away from scratching your head about."

I really got a sense that the people who made this film had researched their subject matter thoroughly, in an effort to present the best possible vision of what things are really like in modern day Iraq re the war there. Worth the time to see even if you are not especially drawn to war films. I did not get a sense of dominating egos on the screen-it was well balanced and was not just another film made to promote this or that star. Interestingly, because it was a war film, it was not particularly gory, although it could have been-sure there was a moment or two, but it was clean stuff compared to much prime time TV viewing."

The film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks, and defusing bombs.<br/><br/>Where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the Plot and Direction of the movie. This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, yet it feels like a 3 hour movie.<br/><br/>One scene in the movie that was particularly awful, and ruined the films perfect credibility, was the sniping scene halfway through the movie. It was both unrealistic, and very long.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a major letdown for winning Best Picture at the Oscars. I felt like this film could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost Best Picture, but was much better than this film.

","This is truly one of those Oscar-winning movies that causes a lot of people to go - ""huh?"" A case can be made for Kathryn Bigelow being named Best Director. She managed to portray a gritty and realistic look at modern-day Iraq, and the challenges of the US soldiers stationed there. The subject matter is somewhat unique - I can't think of any other significant movie that's used the Iraq War as its subject matter. But in the end, the story here lets us all down.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a great deal of tension. A U.S. Army bomb squad scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq in 38 days has to deactivate a roadside bomb. We have no way of knowing what will happen. You watch, and you're quite into the movie at this point. But it becomes far too repetitive. They deactivate a lot of bombs. There are deaths, and the atmosphere of uncertainty - can anyone be trusted in this insanity - is real, but it's just too much over and over again. None of the characters are well developed. One has a son and one wants a son but that was never taken far enough for me to really care about any of them. There's no particular story being told and there's no real resolution to the movie (which, I admit, is perhaps a pretty good statement about this particular war.) We just watch the countdown until this unit goes home, only, at the end of the movie, to see them replaced by another unit. So, yes, there's the pointless, repetitive cycle of a meaningless and totally unnecessary war being depicted, but frankly after about half an hour my attention was wandering. <br/><br/>Best movie? I really have to question that."

Nothing happens throughout the whole film and the only maybe breathtaking scene in that film doesn't take place longer than one minute. I want to educate people to learn that movies are not just a bunch of images cut together, it is about telling a story. But nowadays it seems to be in, telling stories with no PATHOS. In other words: message or meaning. <br/><br/>The direction and the editing are more than obvious and very predictable.

"shanksinha","2","4","8","9 April 2010"," A good action film
","Kathryn Bigelow is a good director, in the sense that she has made some good action and thriller films. I can still feel the adrenalin rush of ""Point Break"" which I saw as a kid.<br/><br/>In ""Hurt Locker"" she delivers a rather good war film. It's tight (though a bit too long in parts) well acted and has the kind of finishing expected from an A grade Hollywood product. It certainly compares very well to other Iraq War movies in terms of budget and content. It also goes easy on the moral aspects that we have come to expect from war movies. The fact that it has won multiple Oscars is a testament to the overall quality of the film.<br/><br/>But despite all the Oscar hype, it remains a good war action film and nothing more than that. I am sure there were many better pictures made in 2009 on various subject matters that deserved the Best Picture Oscar much more than this film. I certainly find no problems with the awards for sound, editing etc as it indeed is a very technically sound film. But there is certainly nothing extraordinary about this movie. The story and plot is just an excuse to show the main players acting out their roles. Character development is also minimal. For all its technical brilliance it is poorly researched, especially in the way it portrays a US Army EOD team operating. Tension is primarily created by bringing in big name actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pierce and then kill them swiftly. A kind of 'shock and awe' on the part of the director. The overall tone of the lead character as an action junkie who gets bored at home doing routine tasks like shopping, takes this film in the realms of a US Army recruitment video.<br/><br/>The message from the Oscars is pretty clear, US public needs reassurances that their Army is doing well in their current campaigns and Hurt Locker provides just that."
"jdonalds-5","4","6","14","14 March 2010"," No story, all about creating tension in the audience
","I can't believe this won Best Director and Best Picture of the year. I thought the main component of the movie was to frighten people in a Hitchcock style. I hesitate to even link this director with Hitchcock though as it failed to even accomplish that task well.<br/><br/>The story begins with the action already developed which is a handful of soldiers defusing bombs. It continues through the story, and finally ends with them doing the same thing. Hence there is no story. There was little character development, no conclusion, and as far as I can see no purpose for the movie.<br/><br/>Whoever is in Hollywood telling directors to use a lot of camera shake to fake realism should retire from the industry please.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see The Blind Side win the Best Picture award. Sure it was a simple story but based on real events. It was uplifting and held my interest much better than The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>I will not recommend this movie to my friends."
"flipmodeflute","6","6","14","9 March 2010"," Little to take away from this film, unfortunately.
","Upon hearing that 'The Hurt Locker' had won best picture, a friend of mine invited me round to watch it on DVD. I was full of anticipation, and when the film started up I was initially impressed. Though the movie is rife with 'how does that make sense?' moments from the outset (for example, the RC disposal unit pulls a trolley with some C4 blocks. The trolley wheels come off. Why risk planting the C4 on the bomb by hand, and just drag the box?) I stopped myself from being pedantic and tried my best to enjoy the movie as an intellectual exercise. I was disappointed. The 'nutty, reckless soldier' stereotype has been done before and done better, from the classic Vietnam films 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Apocalypse Now' to the HBO series 'Generation Kill', and as for the other two members of 'the squad' I felt zero connection with them (unlike the character of Sam Bell in 'Moon', who I feel should have won 'best actor' at the very least). The film is not entirely without merit. The scene I enjoyed was when the unit bumped into a group of British contractors (especially their leader), who I feel delivered a performance far superior to the lame warrior visage of 'the war nut'. The 'war is hell' message of the film was delivered in a manner which was frankly embarrassing. The hammy 'it's just a roll of the dice' dialogue between 'the war nut' and the black sergeant was unforgivably boring, and was a poor attempt at emulating the 'Russian Roulette' of 'The Deer Hunter', and by the second half of the film I did not give a fig about how it was going to end (especially the 'finding Beckham' subplot). That this film won best picture just shows how big names (James Cameron, James Cameron's ex) have more power in the academy than genuine talent, as Moon was not so much as glanced at, inexplicably in favour of this joke of a film. Instead of watching this, you should take out the box set of 'Generation Kill', as well as DVDs of 'Jarhead', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'The Deer Hunter', 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now'. This film tries to be all four of these, and winds up tying itself in knots."
"jcgarner","9","6","14","20 January 2010"," Very Real, Very Good
","Today there is only a short list of films about the war in Iraq, but ten years from now The Hurt Locker will surely be considered one of the best. After searching for the movie in theaters all summer with no success, I jumped on the opportunity to view it on DVD. After two viewings, I remain very impressed. The film is very good and very real.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is the story of a US Army bomb squad during their final month of rotation in 2004 Bagdad. When their leader is killed in an explosion, the three-man squad receives a replacement, SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner). With over 800 bomb disposals under his belt, he is very good at his job. He's also reckless and too much of a thrill seeker for his own good. Of course, this is a problem for his teammates, who only want to get the job done and go home. If the film claims that ""war is a drug,"" then SSgt. James is certainly addicted. Pay attention to that claim, because all the elements of drug addiction are here: the high, the low, the overdose, the pain of sobriety, and the eventual relapse.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker, while fictional, was inspired by the accounts of Mark Boal, a journalist who traveled with an American bomb squad in Iraq. Kathryn Bigelow proves that there is a woman alive who can direct some great action (something I seriously doubted after Aeon Flux and Punisher: War Zone). Her direction has style but is also very realistic. I cannot recall a single shot or line of dialogue that seemed overly dramatic or too Hollywood-esquire. I only counted two uses of slow motion in the whole film. One of which, the slow fall of an empty shell from a rifle, is particularly effective. The shell's long and slow bounce on a rock is appropriately followed by the long and tedious wait for enemy movement on the horizon. This is perhaps the best scene in the film.<br/><br/>The tension created by the bomb disposal scenes is real and certainly never forced. Where most filmmakers would have focused on the countdown of a clock, or attempted to create suspense with an overpowering soundtrack, Bigelow takes a different approach. When James is disarming a bomb, we hear little except for the whistling of the wind, or the crunch of gravel and sand. We aren't at the mercy of a timer or countdown, but of the bomb maker, who could be any of those suspicious onlookers standing in the distance.<br/><br/>The most refreshing thing for me was to see a war film (and such a modern war film for that matter) that wasn't weighed down with pro-war or anti-war messages. The Hurt Locker is a film about soldiers in Iraq, not the politics behind them.<br/><br/>PS – The one problem I had with this film was the unforgivably short screen time given to Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pierce (although this may be a trend for the latter considering The Road). Other than that, a solid 9/10."

The environment, talent, props, and/or buildings should shake not the camera. Now how stupid would it have been if when Hellboy punched the SUV the camera shook or zoomed in using the camera's zoom?

"DonFishies","8","5","11","17 December 2009"," A refreshingly thrilling and exhilarating experience from start to finish
","While some movies are immediately forgotten moments after watching them, I can still remember the feeling during and after seeing The Hurt Locker four months later. It is being hailed now as one of the best films of the year, and it deserves every accolade it is given. The film follows a bomb defusing unit in Iraq, lead by the adrenaline junkie and borderline-insane Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) and including Sergeant JT. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), and their trials and tribulations during their tour of duty.<br/><br/>While films about or involving the Iraq war are a hard sell, and make for rather pitiful films, The Hurt Locker is something of an anomaly. It deals with the war head-on, and manages to be a riveting thriller from start to finish. This is the most realistic and disturbing film to come out of this conflict thus far, and it shows in how well made it is. It borders on feeling like a documentary on the real men and women in bomb squad units in more than a few instances. It knows exactly what beats to strike, what buttons to push and what emotional chords need to be yanked at. It is a hard film to swallow, and never winces even at the most intense of times. It merely packs on more hard-edged realism.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow is not necessarily the first director you would imagine taking on such a heavy topic as this in a film (her previous films include K-19: The Widowmaker, Strange Days, and the much beloved action film, Point Break), but she proves to be the most capable filmmaker to have attacked it thus far. Her interpretation of one of the most controversial moments and ideas of the decade is one that is unlike anything you could even attempt to imagine. She captures the terror and horror of war so well that she seems more than well versed in the subject. Her research and passion for the project is more than simply evident from moment one.<br/><br/>The editing of the film is what really makes the film as powerful as it is. Music is used very sparingly scene to scene. Moments of silence are compounded by the ticking of bombs, and the clipping of pliers. We hear the unit's every breath, and feel their sweat. We are in the desert with them, feeling their every move and thought as they have them. Their fear and caution are downright terrifying, because we as an audience are so heavily invested in what happens to this small team. We do not want to see anything bad happen to them, but as the film shows us on multiple occasions, no one is safe from injury or death on the battlefield.<br/><br/>What also helps the film is the relatively unknown cast. The three principal actors are recognizable supporting characters from many films and TV series' over the past decade, but none have them have really carried a film like they do here. Because we are not watching the likes of a Brad Pitt or a Will Smith, our investment and believability in these actors is heightened. How are we able to distinguish between an actor inhabiting a role of a soldier in combat, and an actual soldier in combat, when each of these actors just seem so immersed and buried within their roles? They each have their own arch in the film, and each manages to breathe a life into their characters that no other actor has been able to do thus far.<br/><br/>Renner is the particular standout of the bunch because he is both the lead, and the character with the most emphasis placed on him. He carries the film, and makes you genuinely believe in it. All of the heartbreak, the sorrow, and the triumph this character faces, Renner makes feel unparallelled. He is not exactly method acting like Marlon Brando would, but he looks like he is coming close to it. He is just that well versed and professional in this role. And only compliments his two supporting cast members.<br/><br/>Interesting small roles from Guy Pearce, David Morse and Voldemort himself, Ralph Fiennes, are all handed well. Each brings a unique piece to the film that gives it more depth, and allows the audience to wrap onto someone they may recognize a bit better. These critically acclaimed character actors almost act like they are passing the torch on to the younger actors, to give them a chance to really make something of their film careers as they move onto their next generation of acting roles.<br/><br/>If the film falters at all, it is in a humanizing subplot between Renner's character James and a young Iraqi boy nicknamed Beckham (Christopher Sayegh). It is meant to show that James is not a total whack job who spends his day knocking on death's door, but there are more than enough scenes and exchanges between the principal actors that these scenes are unneeded. Yes, the subplot does give us one of the most truly horrific and emotional scenes in the entire film, but this scene is not enough to make up for how dragged out the film becomes with the addition of the subplot. It easily could have worked much the same way without it, even if it does help break up how monotonous the bomb defusing becomes at times (as realistic and pulse pounding as it is).<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is the best film about the Iraq war currently, and is just a great war film in general. Not only that, it is also one of the best films of the year. It is a thrilling and exhilarating experience from start to finish that may be a test of endurance for more than a few people. But that experience is more than just rewarding.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

","If you read the reviews you know what the movie's about, I'll rather explain what I liked about it. <br/><br/>It's actually a simple a story with a lot of interesting elements that made me smile at some moments, and think at others. It's certainly not the typical war movie with huge battlefields, but takes a look a some peoples behavior and it's impact on people working around them. <br/><br/>There are two or three scenes in the movie that are far fetched and defy reality, but that doesn't really harm the end result. The only thing that I didn't like about it is the one or the other scene that doesn't really add anything to the movie, but these were probably needed to make the movie more attractive to a certain kind of audience.<br/><br/>Watch the movie.

"AnOceanBetweenUs","10","11","31","8 March 2010"," The psychology of war
","""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug. "" - Chris Hedges<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker can be easily summed up in it's opening line, a line that is not spoken, but written. Such a quote cuts to the core of the film, a film that is often not spoken, but shown. It is a tense, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and relentlessly suspenseful film that is not about a war, but the people fighting it. People who are not action heroes, but who devote all of their being to doing their job, one of the most dangerous jobs imaginable. Why would anyone want to disarm deadly explosives in the middle of the Iraqi desert? The Hurt Locker gives us not easy or reassuring explanations, but thoughtful insight and complex psychology. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's film explores not only the nuts and bolts of what it takes to do this job, but also how human beings relate and interact with one another during times of unimaginable danger and crisis. Jeremy Renner is stunningly effective as Staff Sgt. William James, a man who is, in his own way, addicted to war. His work is done with the attention and precision of a surgeon, contrasting strongly with his cocky, bold demeanor. We see moments of his fearlessness, almost to the point of self destruction, and other moments of sheer vulnerability and tenderness, for his family and for his fellow soldiers. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker at her very best here. She gives us the relentless adrenaline that should be demanded of this subject matter, but she also gives us the periods of stillness. War is not made up entirely of explosions and car chases, and neither is this film. War is also waiting, war is also agonizing silence. A film about war does not need to be a film about politics. The Hurt Locker mercifully avoids taking any kind of political stance, and also avoids elevating these characters to the level of saints or martyrs. These characters are not perfect, they are not as stoic or unaffected as they behave, they make foolish decisions, they have weaknesses and they have flaws. The film does not make pronouncements or attempt to address the ""larger issue"" of the Iraq war, or even war in general. There is no reason it should. It does not preach, but it shows and it observes. <br/><br/>In terms of the basic tenants of film-making, The Hurt Locker succeeds on every level. It is written is such a way that it not seem to be written at all. It is acted in a way that does does not seem like acting, and it is filmed in a way that does not seem like a movie. Jeremy Renner and every one of his fellow actors are not reciting lines, they simply become these people. The way these characters speak transfers effortlessly from moments of affectionate banter, to strained urgency and panic, to a few moving monologues that are not done for dramatic effect, but give us a glimpse into the lives and hearts of these men. The cinematography is daringly raw and unpolished, with exquisite moments of strategically placed slow motion, emphasizing the characters heightened senses, whether at the moment of an explosion, or during an endless period of waiting. Kathryn Bigelow's direction spares us what could have been an overwrought genre exercise. This movie is allowed to breathe and function on its own, without the looming shadow of an overbearing director. <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is not a film for everyone. It demands a great deal from the viewer, it does not let up or ease off, it does not look away. It drops us in a place that almost none of us would want to be, and shows us things that we do not want to see. It is impeccably acted, beautifully filmed, and masterfully directed with compassion and humanity. A movie like this does not come around often. Every moment watching it is spent spellbound, in awe, in terror. A film that is the very definition of greatness."
"neilvanzyl","9","2","3","16 April 2019"," Hurt Locker Review
","Starting without credits or a title, we are instead provided with a quote by C. Hedges stating war can be a drug and ""the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction"". The main character, Staff Sgt. William James is a clear-cut embodiment of this mantra. James incessant need to throw himself into a dangerous situation creates well developed rifts between himself and his team. With only 38 days remaining in their rotation, Bravo Company must overcome their differences to survive. Kathryn Bigelow's use of the constant jittering camera portrays a soldier's ""on-edge"" perspective very well. Any sudden movements or sounds their weapons are poised prepared for immediate action. As an action movie it does well to keep the viewer entertained with occassional explosions and the kill or be killed mentality in the streets of Iraq. James blatant disregard for safety and rules has you enthralled hoping for the best even as he saunters towards IEDs removing his protective gear. The movie is not perfect. With a few slips in dialogue and the overbearing force of testosterone fuelled thinking and how there is no question in the ethics of what they're doing. However, it leaves you with a feeling of intrigue as James leaves his family again, and returns for another tour to do the only thing he truly loves."

","Maybe I just didn't understand this movie, but I didn't think it was very good. I mean, the plot doesn't even feel like a plot. I waited for roughly 1/2 of the movie waiting for the 'real storyline' to present itself. Spoiler alert: it never did. The entire story was simply centered awkwardly around these three soldiers even though it never feels clear as to why. The story just jumps from random event to random event without ever really tying together. The acting was undisputably brilliant, but it couldn't save the lack of storytelling. If it was more of an exposé of the lives of everyday soldiers, I could have gotten behind that. Instead the focused on these weird, wild, and underdeveloped characters who weren't either likeable or relatable in virtually anyway. By the end, I was just left wondering what the point was.

","The Hurt Locker brings intensity from start to finish, with great visuals and clear writing. It's a personal look at a three-person bomb-defusing squad that brings tension with good action scenes and is a character study of James. He seems to be an enigma early on, almost flippant which seems unrealistic given his high-ranking position. As the movie progresses, a great performance by Renner shows us layers of his character, and that it's not that he doesn't care, but that he is unafraid and welcomes risk and the adrenaline of a dangerous situation. He does care about the people around him, he just shows it selectively. The performance that captivated me throughout the movie and who presented a perfect foil to James was Mackie's, showing the intense and unflinching but also human soldier representative of many in the military. It's not a movie I could imagine anyone finding boring, but it doesn't rely on nonstop action and explosions, instead taking its time with its shots and letting the characters control the pacing. The last 15 minutes or so are what made me realize what a great movie it was: the realistic but extremely intense attempted bomb removal, followed by a touching scene that highlighted the contrast between James and Sanborn brilliantly, and then the small scene that amazed me: the grocery store, with James looking at the aisle full of cereal, that both made me realize how utterly captivated I had been by the war developments and see through James' eyes the mundane dullness held in everyday life. The speech to his son and ending sequence brought everything together as a character study of James. Like they say in the opening credits, war is a drug, and while it treats everyone differently, it sure hit James hard. I wouldn't be surprised if I never see a better war movie."

","Of late, I have not really liked the movies that have gone on to win Academy Awards for Best Picture. The Hurt Locker was bestowed with this honor in 2009. Thus, the expectations that I had with this movie were unreasonably high. However, after viewing the movie I am unsatisfied with the movie. The main problem with the movie is that there is no clear story. The movie is based on the US invasion in Iraq. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner who is fantastic as the fearless guy who always puts his life on the line while disarming bombs. We are never really told about what the objective of the movie is supposed to be. The acting feels real and it is one of the strong points in this movie. A number of war veterans have pointed out several inaccuracies in the portrayal. As a viewer, there has to be some sort of a resolution during the end but no such thing was to be found here. It definitely felt like a waste of time and if you are looking for a hard-hitting war movie, go and watch Saving Private Ryan for a much more memorable experience."

In this case however I shut it off twice coming back to it later.<br/><br/>As others have said, it has no plot, no story. Since it was based on the writer's experience embedded with a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, clearly he had good material. The trouble is he needed help writing it - more help than he received from the director - the co-writer.<br/><br/>For example, they might have taken a young boy of the American mid-west, who lost a relative in a mine explosion. Young man joins the Army, lacks direction, a grizzled old sergeant steers him into bomb disposal. They go to Iraq, he becomes seasoned by some small successes. He grows up, the old sergeant gets killed, one day a unit is pinned down and a bomb hinders their rescue. He goes in, defuses it with minutes to spare. Formulaic? Maybe, but at least it has a beginning, middle and end.<br/><br/>And while I can believe that the bomb disposal team might know the rudiments of being a combat infantryman, these guys seemed to be experts in everything. Not believable.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for a realistic depiction of a bomb squad in action. Fast forward through any scene that doesn't have a gun in it."

"YohjiArmstrong","Null","2","3","22 October 2011"," Loud, stupid and false
","Plot: A cowboy bomb-disposal tech in the Iraq War endangers his comrades through his love of war.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that it is stupid. It is essentially a series of set-pieces involving a war-happy EOD tech in Iraq. There was much hype about realism but this is rubbish. Every character is an archetype (cowboy hero, amiable black buddy, hick buddy) and their actions are pure Hollywood.<br/><br/>So, nobody can run a proper cordon (Iraqis get through cordons manned by soldiers twice). A 3 man EOD team searches and clears hostile buildings on their own. When engaged by a sniper out in the boondocks they indulge in a sniper duel that leaves a number of men dead, rather than just calling an airstrike on the place. Nobody accepts orders, everyone argues.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the hyper-kinetic camera work moves so swiftly and so often that it sucks the tension out of every scene. Only during the sniper scene, where there is room to breathe, does the film grip. Occasional flashes of visual brilliance - rust leaping off a car wreck during a bomb blast, the wire-festooned concrete buildings, a tech pulling a wire that reveals a half-dozen IEDs at his feet - are subsumed into the general mediocrity.<br/><br/>The script is a rambling mess that notably fails to develop, lacks any sort of goal and ultimately provides a rather banal conclusion: war's fun - well, who'd ha' thunk it? Ostensibly the whole thing is apolitical, which is itself a political stance. It's a chicken claim from a chicken script that prefers hyper-macho pretensions to serious thought.<br/><br/>The whole film rings false. Instead of watching this, watch a British TV series, low on heroics but high on drama, called ""Danger UXB!""."
"efs2","4","2","3","10 October 2011"," Great Ideas Gone Bad
","The Hurt Locker is based on a great idea, that war is an addictive drug. And using an EOD (bomb squad) soldier in Iraq to show the effects of that addiction is an equally inspired idea. Further, it features some memorable scenes, in particular, the lead character bewildered by the array of breakfast cereals available in a grocery store, and talking to his infant son about his addiction.<br/><br/>But the scenes in Iraq (Jordan, if you're wondering) that are intended to be the dramatic center of the movie ruin the movie for me. Instead of presenting in a realistic, gritty way what must be in real life an almost unbearably tense job, the film instead creates unrealistic, even fantastic situations and sequences that take me out of the movie.<br/><br/>And it is a perplexing approach. The screenplay was written by Mark Boal, who was ""embedded"" with an EOD unit in Iraq in 2004. Surely he experienced enough drama in the real world of an EOD team that he could have written the movie The Hurt Locker should have been without going over the top.<br/><br/>Finally, another element that bears mentioning is the ""shaky-cam"" photography. It is hard to understand the appeal of that style, especially to the degree employed in The Hurt Locker. The unsteadiness and and repeated zoom in/zoom out perspective are so pronounced that the technique seems nothing more than a gimmick and detracts from the story."

","The Hurt Locker is a 2008 War film directed by Kathryn Bigelow. This modern War picture gives a completely non-cliched look at War itself. Filled with very intense sequences and psychological looks at different soldiers, The Hurt Locker is not like any other War film. This movie follows an Army bomb squad operating in Iraq during the Iraq War. Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), with mostly his two comrades Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), experiences many terrible outcomes of many different situations. While going through many troubles with himself and with his partners, James knows there is more to come out with this war.<br/><br/>Like I said, this War film is not like any others. You get closer looks at how soldiers experience many different types of situations in battle. Also, this movie focuses on a bomb squad. The violence may be lower than other War films, but the intensity is sure higher. In what I noticed, lots of different reasons why this film is at a high rating to me is reasonable. First, the cinematography was outstanding! You got your different viewpoints, but the audience can clearly see what's going on throughout this War picture. Second, Kathryn Bigelow's direction is sure to bring attention to all of us. With a great story, the direction for this film is sure to be outstanding! Finally, the acting was fantastic as well! Surely, the cast did excellent with their soldier-intake look on the making of this film. Lots of details from this movie, alongside the movie being a great story, quickly makes it to become an Oscar-winning picture. I give credit to the cinematography, the direction (by Bigelow), and the acting. What a fantastic War film!<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker could be filled with criticism as well, but I think it could be a War film masterpiece. I give The Hurt Locker a 10/10 for its accomplishments in its cinematography, its direction, and for its acting. I've also watched this film on Memorial Day, so I thank every soldier who have made their sacrifice for this country. We all thank and salute to you!<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker won 6 Academy Awards for Best Picture (Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal, Nicolas Chartier, and Greg Shapiro), Best Director (Kathryn Bigelow), Best Writing or Original Screenplay (Mark Boal), Best Film Editing (Bob Murawski and Chris Innis), Best Sound Mixing (Paul N.J.

It shows us how intense the job of defusing bombs really is, and it draws us in when the bomb squad gets into a tough and intense situation. All the shebangs of military life is there. This film accurately depicts the struggles of brotherhood and family relationships. After watching the film, I totally understand the development of PTSD among some veterans and the unique life that is called the army. However, the more I think about it, the more I feel like that this film is like a well-made collage of photos or a photo album with great memories inside them. The focus is either not prominent enough or I suspect that it is simply not there. This showpiece of U.S. expedition to Iraq seems almost like a drama documentary that is so popular right now.

Renner is generally good but I found his character's behaviour a bit hard to accept ('believe'?) at times (especially the AWOL scene). Director Bigelow does a good job of staying neutral considering the controversies surrounding the recent US interventions in the middle-east - the film is neither jingoistic nor stridently anti-war.

Having said that The Hurt Locker really is a very good movie. It tells the story of a US Army bomb squad team in Iraq in 2004. <br/><br/>The movie is very well acted and overall very good, even to the point of being fantastic. Unfortunately, it was filmed documentary style with hand held cameras. Something I am not fan of at all.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is Sergeant James, a bomb technician and unlike his easy going predecessor, he is a wild man. He seems not only indifferent to the dangers of his job, he absolutely revels in the dangers. It is the ultimate in thrill seeking behaviour, getting that dopamine surge in his brain. Near the end of the movie, he gets accused of being an adrenaline junkie, but by then we know that the neurochemical at work here is dopamine. Bomb disposal is not just a job for him, it's his passion, his addiction, his reason for being in the Army.
While watching The Hurt Locker, a scene from G.I. Jane comes to mind when Demi Moore's character is questioned about her motivations to continue to struggle through SEAL training. She responds by asking how males in the program answer the same question. The answer being ""Cause I get to blow things up.""

"Screen_Blitz","10","1","1","12 August 2017"," Gritty, powerful, and packed with visceral intensity, The Hurt Locker is a groundbreaking war experience
","War is no picnic, and the heat of active combat is defiantly overwhelming which is powerfully demonstrated in this gritty war drama set in the heat of the controversial Iraq war. Relieving from the political controversies and social commentary of the Iraq War in favor of focusing on the hellish conditions of active combat in the Middle East, director Kathryn Bigelow crafts a tense, action-heavy experience following a team of United States army soldiers facing the unforgiving reality where the odds are tested and the inner beings of the men in uniforms are challenged to great lengths. Rather than setting the action in the midst of a specific battle, the film revolves around a soldier hired to do a job even more hazardous than shooting and dodging bullets of fellow Iraqis: disarming bombs. And it takes an ambitious filmmaker like Bigelow to effectively capture the visceral magnitude of the action and a writer like Mark Boal to illustrate the story to an astounding degree. What results is an authentic portrait of contemporary warfare. It is just another brutal rendition following a small chapter on our country's war in the Middle East. While there are a few breaks taken from the harsh atmosphere and moments revolving around some humor, these come far and few in between. Set in the hot streets of Baghad during the Iraq War, the film follows elite soldiers Sergeant JT Sanborn (played by Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (played by Brian Geraghty) of an army bomb disposal unit who hire Staff Sergeant William James (played by Jeremy Renner) as the leader of their squad after their former leader is killed in an bomb disposal attempt gone wrong. At first, he seems like the right guy for the job. However, their loyalties are for him are soon tested upon witnessing his seemingly unorthodox ways of handling his duty as the city erupts into a deadly conflict. <br/><br/>On both a technical and narrative standpoint, this film delivers the gold. It is a brutally realistic portrayal of active combat that neither glorifies war or condemns it but simply paints the vicious conditions of a country torn apart by international conflict between the east and west. And it is all captured through a documentary- style cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who adopts his filming style reminiscent to Paul Greengrass. The mastermind by this is Kathryn Bigelow crafts the action with palpable tension that not only ravages the atmosphere but pierces the audiences with a feel they are not watching the action through a screen but instead witnessing it as if they were there in the heat of the moment. Every moment Staff Sergeant William James approaches a bomb preparing to defuse, the suspense quickly revs up as all it takes is one wrong move and he will be vaporized into a fiery explosion. An even greater and tension-filled highlight of these moments is showcased during the car bomb sequence when the soldiers spends his precious time studying a bomb trying to disarm it while his comrades are eyeballed by hundreds of Iraqis with suspicious intentions. The scene is enough to make your heart rate increase to the speed of light. And what Jeremy Renner as James? This actor gracefully gets the job done, portraying the role with humanity and complex personality. It seems like Bigelow knew what she was doing when she casted him as the front-runner. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty makes good use for their role, showing off their acting chops and never letting a moment go to waste. <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is gritty, powerful war picture that captures the visceral energy of active combat and packs a powerful punch with its craft thanks to Kathryn Bigelow at the wheel. Above all, this is likely one of the best modern war movies helmed in recent years, if not a masterpiece of its somewhat underpopulated genre. It is a not movie to enjoy, but simply to experience to understand the grueling conditions of the Middle East under armed conflict."

I can say that the Supermarket scene with the cereal boxes is by far one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in a movie, it makes a grand conclusion to a great movie. The final scene where James is suited and walks towards a bomb (probably) is also great because you can see on his face that he belongs there, he can no longer have a normal life, he doesn't feel right back home, because the war made a great impact on him, the things he has seen, things he has done are to much for a single man to carry around back home, you see his wife doesn't understand the tragedies he has seen (the story about the man giving candy to children, then blowing up the car). While being sad, the ending also gives a troubling message about the real war.<br/><br/>All in all, this was THE MOVIE of the last years and I sure hope to see similar powerful movies in the future. 10/10 for me."

The Hurt Locker is an agonising pressure cooker of a film experience, an exploration of the male ego in a number of volatile scenarios based within the overall volatile situation that is the Iraq war; here is a film that systematically documents not only what it's like for one man to face his difficulties of just having to be close to the action and on tenterhooks in what he does the whole time, but the overall face of what the Western troops are going through in their darting from one situation to another in a place full of people you really feel don't want them there. As a film exploring the relationship these troops have with their task at hand, it is gripping; as a film exploring the relationship the troops have with one another, it is fascinating and as a war genre piece encompassing action, suspense and satisfying enough arcs for its characters, it is so very watchable.<br/><br/>The act that The Hurt Locker revolves around is the disarming of bombs; something that goes rather wrong in the opening scene, a plunging of the audience into the front line of bomb disposal in a sandy, dusty Iraqi street as American soldiers do their best to keep cool in likening the disarming process to a sex act; garnering a permission to panic when some of the tools used for the process break down. The precise nature of the task at hand is very quickly established, clutching at a very visceral and exposed sense of dread instilled within the audience and while we are in the company of professionals. Director Bigelow manages to maintain a steady sense of clammy threat as these severely explosive items linger in such close proximity to the characters we come to care for.<br/><br/>The tragedy that befalls the team in the opening paves the way for a certain Staff Sergeant by the name of William James (Renner) to enter the fray, a man that clashes with the chief of the small platoon of soldiers they have operating in the area, a certain Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie), in their attitudes and ideas to the hostile situations omnipresent in the war-zone they're in. Bigelow creates a dry, formidable locale in Jordan; a stunt double for Iraq. Jets soar overhead, a premature explosion of noise as one approaches an explosive item; the streets are littered with items and junk making it impossible to pick apart what is just trash and what might be the thing that takes both your legs; the locals stand and sit, calmly, from elevated positions – often shot so as to appear to be staring right into the camera: at us. These people watch the ensuing activity in the bomb disposal with a baited sense of urgency, antagonism and a somewhat perverse sense of glee. In a lesser, more action orientated and exploitative war film about how titillating the action can actually be, the on-looking; ill-minded target audience for said piece would possess all the characteristics the balcony and window dwelling locals do so in The Hurt Locker – only this time, it is us on that frontline having the onlookers gazing at us.<br/><br/>Bigelow's able to do that; that ability to shift tension and threat away from something that might go off and end a character's life there and then in order to focus on something all around the other troops, several hundred feet away, watching on intently and in doing so, manifesting an odd sensation as to whom is in greater danger. We get the feeling we're in that dusty, desert infused zone of hostility; when a gunfight breaks out at around the midway point of the film, itself a stretch of film that'll see the troops' sense of precision and patience spill out into a scenario in which the bullets are flying, the soldiers involved 'reward' themselves with juice as opposed to water, as a number of empty plastic bottles lie strewn about their area - we feel the relief in equal terms.<br/><br/>Bigelow casts a number of unknowns in the major roles, helping to heighten the sense of tension by way of actor anonymity. This is very humorously counter-balanced with how she treats some of the bigger name stars at her disposal, and a reunion with her lead from 1995's Strange Days in Ralph Fiennes acting as the best example. James' coming to terms that his own carefree, adrenaline fuelled attitudes to warfare are a threat to others, masterfully woven in when an unneeded spur-of-the-moment hunt for a bomber in the general area of a recent urban blast is a result of his own romping, stomping attitude that puts others not so cocksure at risk. Any apparent parallel between James' actions, attitudes and ideologies with recent world leaders are welcome, but ill-advised. <br/><br/>Bigelow's statement on how much she just loves to study these men doing what they do together arrives in the scene James and Sanborn engage in a play fight-come-square off in the barracks after alcohol consumption. After talking of their past failures with women, the two (with James shirtless) engage in a sexually charged sequence of oneupmanship that goes to a level one of them doesn't want it to reach. But that's the way it is; James is lost amidst house-set roof repair and aisles of different cereal brands in an American store, but at home holding a stray Arab cabbie at gunpoint as he ventures off to defuse another metallic globe of destruction. The film is a thrilling, relentless and powerful exploration of what it takes on."

","Superb cinematic direction by Kathryn Bigelow. She deserved the Best Director Oscar this year and she got it! Kathryn took a big risk with a very different script, with unknown actors, and she created history. Jeremy Renner's stellar performance of different shades of emotions will move you and he will demand respect from the audience with this role!! I noticed him first at 'North Country' in 2005 and I thought he was excellent. Two full hours of hard-core action is not for the light-hearted and it may get a little tedious for people who are into dramatic movies. However, one gets amazed by the daring cinematography and the editing of this brilliant movie. And yes, where was Brian Geraghty hiding all this time? I am sure we will see a lot more of him and Jeremy Renner, being so under-appreciated for so long. An impressive B+.<br/><br/>Please join ""Ferdy on Films"" on Facebook!"
"noriu-balandeliu","5","5","12","9 March 2010"," Possibly the worst Oscar's winner ever..
","Where do I begin.. You have Inglourious Basterds, Up, Up in the Air, Avatar (not to mention films which didn't make it to the list, such as The Antichrist), and THIS is what is supposed to be the best film of the year? Really?<br/><br/>OK, so let's begin with the positive stuff. The film is intense and quite suspenseful to watch. I found it quite interesting, although not always. Now to the negative stuff. I will make several points. First, the plot. There is no plot - just a bunch of scenes put together. OK, I get it, they meant to show the everyday life of soldiers and do not need a plot for that? Well they failed, because, second, the everyday life of soldiers is not like that. I do not want to repeat all the goofs, errors, anachronisms, etc. in this film. Errors like there was no YouTube in 2004 and the soldiers mention it just shows a lack of education by the people responsible for dialogue. But the fact that the rascal such as Will in reality would not be tapped on the shoulder when he repeatedly unnecessarily puts his fellow soldiers in danger just strikes at the very core of the film's premise and makes it all nonsensical. Oh, some people say that at least the opening scene is realistic. Well, do you really think just because a wheel broke off they would risk the soldier's life? No, they would prepare another carriage. If they are desperate, they would even tie some explosives to the robot and detonate it - a life is worth more than this. Third, the film's message really confuses me. I do not know if it is plain propaganda showing how ""the boys are fighting for USA"" or that the soldiers cannot easily find their place after the war in the real life? If it's first, it's really bad, and if second - well everyone knows that people are not the same after the army or prison, and may develop a sort of addiction. Fourth, the characters are stereotypical and bland. You have the adventurous type, the cowardly newbie type, the doctor who has no field experience and gets killed the first time he goes to fight type.. Fifth, the pretentiously stupid filming style, unjustified by anything - the shaky camera thing, the slow motion bullet cap dropping.. This is just terrible. Nevertheless, I have to give it 5 out of 10 - it is still much better than Home Alone 4 or Jingle All the Way."
"el_monty_BCN","4","5","12","5 March 2010"," Didn't really work for me, I got a bad vibe from the political undertones
","Given the critics' enthusiasm, I went to see it with high expectations, and I came out frankly disappointed. The atmosphere felt realistic and some scenes (the sniper duel, the man with the explosive vest) made quite an impact; but I really had a problem with the central character, William James. I may be overpoliticized, but I just couldn't help perceiving him as a perfect embodiment of George W. Bush's America: Gung-ho, arrogant, reckless, impulsive, willing to put the lives of his comrades at risk and to abandon a loving family at home in order to pursue personal vendettas and get his adrenalin rushes... and, as I do with Bush, I despised him; I was almost rooting for him to get blown up, to be honest, because I thought he was a complete idiot who did almost everything wrong, and that he had no place in any serious professional army (something confirmed by opinions from war veterans I have read later). And yet Bigelow seems intent on portraying him as something of a ""misguided hero"", the classic rogue who doesn't go by the book but whose heart is in the right place. Therefore, it felt to me as if the movie, by condoning this man's reckless attitude, was somewhat also condoning the U.S. military campaign as something maybe equally misguided but nevertheless brave and noble. I have no idea where Bigelow stands politically, and I realize this might not be the message she wanted to convey at all; but it's the one I perceived, and it left me quite uncomfortable."
"ltlacey","2","5","12","15 February 2010"," The latest in what I fear is a long-line of Irag war movies
","I wish I could write more about this movie, but the filming style made me nauseated, so I did not last very long. I heard more than I saw, and what I heard made me go, HUH? for a lot of it. Which probably means I needed to see what was going on up on the screen. But what little I did see, and hear, I was not that impressed. I am not a military person, nor am I that fond of war movies, but I wanted to give this one a chance since I had heard a lot of good reviews. My guess, especially after reading the blogs and other reviews, is that like so many ""Hollywood"" movies, this was yet another in a long line of over-hyped mediocrity. That the Oscar for best movie seems to be between this one and Avatar (ZZZzzz, though is visually stunning) amazes me, and is probably why I take anything and anyone nominated with a large grain of salt. But back to THL. Since I was just hearing most of it (having left my Dramamine at home) what I have to say is based on dialogue, and what dialogue there was (maybe more of us should watch movies this way!) was lame, and oftentimes I was thinking, No one talks like that, especially with bullets whizzing by."
"juntolm","4","5","12","2 February 2010"," Some Good, Mostly Bad
","This movie came as a huge disappointment to me. After seeing previews, reading reviews, and knowing that I love modern war/combat movies, I was excited to finally have a chance to sit and enjoy this film. That chance was stolen from me about 30 minutes in.<br/><br/>At first what seems to be an intriguing and enticing plot, soon turns to rubble. The movies starts well with a large explosion, lots of suspense and a reckless but lovable character. However, each scene after the first large diffusion (on the cover) is poorly executed in delivery, cinematography, and writing. Jeremy Renner's character, while charming and dangerously likable at first, turns out to be very static, and never feels human.<br/><br/>In fact, that is the largest problem with this movie. None of it feels real. The characters provide lackluster performances while operating in unrealistic situations, spouting poorly written dialogue in a plot that leads ultimately to no where. There is suspense in many scenes, and I did feel myself creeping to the edge of the seat. But there are only so many times that you can watch a guy recklessly diffuse a bomb and get excited about it.<br/><br/>I gained nothing from this film. There is no master insight, no knowledge to be gleaned, no lessons learned... except that maybe this years Oscars are going to suck. If a piece like this is getting nominated for best picture then there is something terribly wrong in Hollywood."

","Every film about a war is very tricky thing, there are always a lot of subtexts and provoking moments, when the director of the movie is originally from one of the country which engaging in war it's always difficult for him to stay neutral due to patriotic feelings. Director who makes film about war should aware that he takes enormous responsibility for what he creates especially when the main aim consists from showing senseless of the war in general. <br/><br/>So let's talk about what we got in ''The Hurt Locker'', well if u seen Bosnian movie of Danis Tanovic ''No Man's Land'' u certainly beheld that every things related with EOD showing heresy of the war more detailed, because you can create a lot of moments where people still alive but it's already impossible to save their lives, they are just walking corpses. Same idea was implemented in Hurt Locker for only one exception, Tanovic reached his ultimate objection to stay neutral and show conflict from both sides, Kathryn Bigelow despite here hard endeavors didn't reach this goal, Americans showed here like a good guys with holy mission and Iraq people just a bunch of barbarians without any possibility to survive without outside aid. Only small boy who peddled movies had something humane in his behavior. Yet I admire the way Bigelow imaged soldiers, no cheap patriotic phrases, completely apolitical attitude just simple people who already got used to war without opinion that they fight for something important for their country.Main character cannot live without a war and fatalistic horror already, he struts through the war and always plays Russian roulette but at least aware that it's all ridiculous stuff. <br/><br/>The only one big disadvantage of the story is literally eloquent dialogs of the soldiers, I expected more slang, swearing and harsh phrases like all military people always use, I don't want to say that it's really necessary but it adds mood and atmosphere. I guess all vets will behold a lot of inaccurate moments in every war movie and I also beheld many unrealistic things here. But I'm not a military servant, I'm civilian like most of viewers and we don't need exact elements of all military equipment. No matter what uniform using in fact, it's a trivial in such case and no need to store on them. General flash must be focused on human being of people who involved in the war. The Hurt Locker doesn't reflect allegory of irrelevance of the war yet it has humanity agenda which would catch your mind and makes you ponder about cruelty without any sense."

","Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker' is is news... it has a buzz, it has an Oscar chance... it's an Incredible film! Really, not for me at least. 'The Hurt Locker' is a weak product with not much going for it.<br/><br/>'The Hurt Locker' has been directed well, no second thoughts on that, but apart from that True fact... nothing works. Bigelow's direction works, but the screenplay by Mark Boal doesn't. It's anti-plotted film, with no-character having an aim. Some films are highly over-rated, which achieve cult status instantly, but over the years, when my review will read many IMDb users they will agree with my comment.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is rustic. Editing by Chris Innis & Bob Murawski is good. Acting wise, Accomplished actors like Ralph Fiennes & Guy Pearce get terribly wasted. Jeremy Renner is okay.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this over-rated flick deserves a watch only for Bigelow's superb direction."

","The idea is great but the execution just fizzles so fast. I love a good cerebral head trip but I need it to hold my attention. One of favorite movies is There Will Be Blood. It has a minimal amount of action yet it is both thrilling & compelling. However Hurt Locker is being marketed as an action war movie in the trailers & a deep anti war movie by critics. It isn't either of these things at all. Were introduced to a group of soldiers whos job it is to diffuse bombs one of them dies & is replaced by a rouge no fear kinda guy(Renner) This is where the movie just plummets! As an actor Renner does not have the chops to carry a movie. Aside from that whole scenes are wasted building up to mini anti climatic moments that are frustrating to watch. The Hurt Locker is one of those rare movies where you start watching one movie & somewhere along the line it becomes a whole different movie. Kind of like Full Metal Jacket. The first 1/2 is amazing the other not so much but still very watchable. Not so for The Hurt Locker. I truly wish & hope somebody rips off this idea & actually makes something good out of it. As it is The Hurt Locker is a dull go nowhere kind of film that for some reason is actually getting a lot of good press & word of mouth. I truly don't get it."
"scacciapinzeri","1","4","9","27 December 2010"," A country with no sense of Shame
","I fail to understand why Kathryn Bigelow chose Iraq as the setting of her latest action film. Because this is what 'The Hurt Locker' is. An action film, solely conceived to give us rushes of adrenaline as we watch a team of US bomb experts risk their lives to de-activate lethal traps set by the local resistance/terrorist groups. In devastated Baghdad everything is a threat, everything hides potential death. In this climate of constant tension we are manipulated to forget who is doing what, who is where and why, and we are simply directed (manipulated?) to feel the tension experienced by the bomb squad, with whom of course we end up identifying. Bigelow's main characters are not regular US Marines (it would have been too hard otherwise to avoid what these people are really doing there). She picks a bomb squad. These are *good guys*, they are in Iraq to do good, and even when they misbehave they end up feeling bad about it, because, in the end, Americans are always SO good, aren't they ? Forget about why these people are there in the first place, forget about the fact that over 100.000 people have died in this war, forget about the millions injured, the devastation of the country, the dissolution of any form of institution (good or bad) that has plunged the country into civil war. War per se is a (generic) destructive addictive drug in which both sides are victims, and who cares if there are direct responsibilities involved (like sending thousands of troops across the globe to do God knows what, other than kill and destroy, and then vote again for the same president who started all this). Of course, for Bigelow war has only victims and no winnersbut guess what? Americans are more victims than everybody elsewho was not disgusted at the site of the dead Iraqi kid with bombs sewed in his stomach? It's about the horrors perpetrated by the *terrorists*. But how about showing us some Abu Ghraib style treatment, Mrs Bigelow ? How about some Iraqis getting water boarded? How about Guanatanamo? How about the thousands killed by US road patrols 'by accident' ? Iraqui women getting raped by Marines anyone ? Too little adrenaline there ? I guess so. The Hurt Locker is the quintessential prove of the fact that Americans have finished processing the Iraq war and have, once again as always in the history of their country, pretty much absolved themselves. to the point of rewarding a director who chooses a contemporary, devastating war scene (with deep American responsibilities involved) as the setting for her action film."

","Everyone loved the Hurt Locker didn't they, it was just so perfect they all said. Well I think differently, personally I found this movie to be extremely over rated. There are definitely some things that worked in this movie, but there are also a lot of things that don't. This movie won best picture, and I'm sorry to say, did not deserve it, there were far better movie that came out in 2009.<br/><br/>One of my big problems in this movie is that I just don't like the main character. William James is just a douchbag, now I like Jeremy Renner, he's shown that he can be a very likable person, but half the time in this movie he is acting like an a$$hole, and most of the times they try to make him look good he comes of as moronic. I am not an expert on combat, but I bet everything that this guy would have been either killed or discharged. Another thing is the camera, it seems it wants to be like a documentary, but it isn't. Most of the movie I could just ignore it, but during the action scenes the camera shook so much and the editing was so bad I couldn't tell what was going on. I'm pretty sure half the stuff in this movie is not how it really works over in Iraq, and that explosion in the beginning? Come on, there is no way he could've been that close, he got a huge head start. And also this movie is boring. I swear a quarter of this movie is just them walking. I guess their trying to build suspense but it didn't work for me, I was bored throughout most of it. Oh, and the whole ""War is a drug"" thing doesn't come in until the last five minutes.<br/><br/>I did like Eldridge and Sanborn though, they were actually funny, likable, and relatable. This movie did win Oscars for sound mixing and sound editing, and I have to agree on that. And it has amazing production value, since they really did shoot it in the middle east. There are a couple of instances of actual suspense, the acting is great, and there are a few good explosions. So overall the direction was good, but weather Kathryn Biggelow deserved the Oscar for best director is debatable.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker at it's best is OK, but certainly not deserving of it's best Picture win. The main character was unlikable, the camera-work sucked during the action scenes, there seems to be some continuity errors and just errors in logic, and worst of all, it's boring. If you love the movie good for you, but I'm just going to be hoping that Zero Dark Thirty is better."

","When I decided to watch this film yesterday after hearing a lot of praise for it and in the light of the Academy Award nomination, I was pretty excited. After the first half hour into this film, I seriously began to doubt all the hype and at the end it was just utter disappointment. Just to let you know where I am coming from: I have been an Army Reserves officer for 20 years and I do like good war movies and I love cinema. But this film was so shallow, the plot flat and acting just average. Is is the eternal infatuation of the US audience with rogue warriors who like do to their own thing without regard for their team that created all this stir? It's like a Schwarzenegger movie plot mixed with Saving Private Ryan. From a military perspective it is exactly the opposite what every Special Forces soldier learns and learns hard: that you only excel as a team. Rogue warrior type of soldiers are weeded out right at the start of the training. A loose cannon who endangers the welfare of his comrades? Give me a break - this is just plain unrealistic. But not even the plot or cinematography were exciting, not to speak about simply mediocre acting. I honestly question the motives behind nominating this film for any award. What is the accomplishment? In my humble opinion, this film will never enter the realm of truly good war movies. Very disappointing."
"ackstasis","7","4","9","3 March 2010"," ""This box is full of stuff that almost killed me""
","Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker (2009)' plays like a modern version of 'The Wages of Fear (1953),' basically a non-stop succession of suspenseful moments. A team of American bomb-defusers (played by three little-known actors: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) go about their duties in Iraq, risking their lives at every turn. SSG William James (Renner) is a bit of an adrenaline junkie, his sincere but somewhat-reckless approach occasionally placing his unit in peril. This episodic film follows a month in the shoes of these soldiers, facing unexpected dangers at every turn. The performances are all very natural, and the unfamiliar main actors and hand-held camera-work inject some documentary-like realism into the film, though equally welcome are some well-handled supporting roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Evangeline Lilly.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most refreshing element of 'The Hurt Locker' is that it isn't recognisably political or ""anti-war"", instead focusing on the soldiers themselves, and how they attempt to deal with the knowledge that each moment may be their last. There's a sense of fatalism about it all. War films have always emphasised how combat turns otherwise-healthy men into shellshocked introverts, but 'The Hurt Locker' suggests that the opposite may also be true: that young men may become addicted to the thrill of conflict, and willingly stride onwards towards an inevitable death. SSG James remarks to his infant son that he will eventually outgrow his jack-in-the-box, when he himself is still enthralled by the idea of mechanical devices that unexpectedly explode. War has allowed (and, indeed, encouraged) this soldier to regress to his basest instincts."
"innersmiff","7","4","9","2 February 2010"," Effective action movie set in the streets if Iraq
","The Hurt Locker is not so much a war film, but an action film, that uses the war to support it's main goal: to thrill you with tense action sequences. It does attempt to convey some message about the war in Iraq but I'm still at odds to figure out what it actually is. I doubt the average movie goer will be any more enlightened to the experiences of soldier's there, so I believe it is only partially successful as a war film. That being said, it is an excellent ride and at no point does it become dull.<br/><br/>Bigelow, a veteran action director, has not let us down here. The set pieces in which our protagonist attempts to disarm the many roadside explosives in Iraq are super suspenseful, leading us in multiple directions and not always letting the bomb go off. This is backed up by entertaining, perhaps not realistic, performances from Renner and Mckie. It also features a very pleasing cameo from Ralph Fiennes, who's always worth watching.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is it's set pieces carry the plot more than the arc of the central character does. James disarms one bomb, goes back to base, disarms another bomb, goes back to base again and so on and so forth. Don't get me wrong, those scenes are genuinely exciting but as the film starts to roll up, I think to myself ""so what?"". I don't believe James goes through any sort of change from his experiences. I enjoyed the ride but was left with a rather empty feeling by the end.<br/><br/>So it's only an action movie? Yes, but a thoroughly competent one. I think those who expect a profound war film will be disappointed."
"blinky1986","7","4","9","7 January 2010"," A suspenseful movie about the addiction to war.
","Hurt Locker opens with the quote 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.' This sentence is the very essence of what this film is about. <br/><br/>Expert bomb disposal unit Bravo Company a month and a half left in their rotation in Iraq, a job of almost unimaginable danger. The unit must enter the very heart of war-torn cities and risk their lives to disable bombs placed by insurgents. It almost beggars belief that people really have this job, I'll steal directly from the film itself here but it can be perfectly summed up as 'every day is a roll of dice with death'. Who knows when the bomb will blow, a sniper could be lurking in any one of the decrepit buildings. How can anyone last more than a day in this job? <br/><br/>SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is the man responsible for walking up to the bomb itself and disarming it. He is wreckless and hopelessly addicted to adrenaline rush his job provides, seemingly going out of his way to make situations more dangerous than they need to be. It's a top performance from Renner, he doesn't have to deliver any challenging dialogue, it's more a case of the audience needing to believe the character they are seeing. A guy addicted to blowing up bombs? Yeah right. But Renners portrayal makes you believe there are people like him in the real world. <br/><br/>Sgt. JT Sanborn and Spc. Own Eldrige are the two other members of Bravo Company. They provide the cover, identifying dangers other than the bomb and advising James on what to do (not that he ever listens during the film). Their characters are more grounded in a reality we can comprehend, especially Eldrige who seems to be the one who completely recognises the danger of his job. He is the opposite to James, fearful of every mission and counting down the days till he can leave.<br/><br/>The film is shot wonderfully, giving the subject matter you know what to expect. It's gritty, raw and almost unbearably tense at times. The first bomb we see Bravo Company tackle sets the tone, every person in view could be the man who put it there, it could detonate at any moment, and the suspense crescendos until it literally explodes. There is also a superb sniper encounter halfway through the film which is probably my favourite of the movie, it's a simple set up of two guys facing each other and firing in single shots separated by an almost insurmountable amount of time, you see the smoke as the gun fires and then the half a second wait before knowing if the bullet has missed you or killed you.<br/><br/>I'll stop running through the scenes now, because almost all of them are great. I'll just say I'm very happy I watched this film, when it comes to war movies the bar is set very high but somehow they rarely disappoint. Maybe it's the subject matter, being such a serious concept it makes sense that it shouldn't be taken on unless it can be done right. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","It had been quite a while since I last encountered a movie with such a great discrepancy between the critics' reviews and my own. I saw this movie last night at the theatre, and I still cannot believe the generosity of some of the grades/reviews this movie's received. <br/><br/>The best way to put it, simply, is that this is just another war movie. It falls flat, it bores, it is about 25 minutes too long, and, to top it off, it is completely unrealistic. (yes, movies in general are fiction, but this one being a war movie, and being so wildly unrealistic, it very much spoils what is supposed to be the effect of the film). It provides next to nothing new that you haven't already seen in other war movies. The scene juxtaposition (not necessarily the editing in general) feels extremely unnatural, even annoying to an aficionado. And, unlike good war movies, it completely fails to move you.<br/><br/>And it is not that I don't like war movies. In fact, I only recently watched Flags Of Our Fathers, as well as Letters From Iwo Jima, and both are excellent war movies (though of very different kind). Not to mention the half-dozen or so war classics that I love. <br/><br/>Actually, if you want to watch an effective version of The Hurt Lucker, watch Metallica's The Day That Never Comes music video - and you'll save about 2 hours and 15 minutes of your time. I'm only half-kidding about the music video."

Rest i will really like the Critics and Oscar Judges to wrote a public apology to James Cameroon for choosing this movie above Avatar. This movie was penned down by critics and film festivals on initial release. It only gained momentum later on due to efforts of some really good PR skills, the sympathy factor because of Katherine Bigelow being the ex-wife of James Cameroon (the victim game), sympathy from being the only movie in Oscar history whose producer was stopped from being able to attend the Oscar ceremony (as he tried to influence the judges) and the sympathy from the fact that it was a really low-budget movie competing against the biggy that is Avatar. I request critics to be rational. IMDb is such a popular site among movie goers that people will not stop watching this movie due to its high ratings and Oscar-tag and at the end they will find them being cheated like me. P.S. - I remember saying so many ""NO's"" only once when I had not prepared for the viva and my teacher was asking me all sorts of tough questions to which I had no answers. Please don't waste your time watching this movie."

","I have no idea why this film is widely regarded as a great piece of work, it's so self congratulatory that it almost made me vomit, no seriously, it's up there with Pearl Harbor. Seeing and hearing this steaming pile made me jealous of Helen keller. The title of the film didn't make sense to me at first, but after it finished i realized it must be the nickname of the DVD case seen as it contains one of the most painful experiences I've ever had. I thought the story was presented in quite a simplistic manner, and i thought that the political aspects of the film were so dumbed down and reduced, the director might as well have been in the corner of the screen explaining the situation with sock puppets. So if you are considering watching this film, don't, a more fun alternative would be pissing in a condom, freezing it, and then f@*king yourself with it."
"KineticSeoul","8","3","6","9 March 2011"," ""War is hell"" to some ""War is a drug"" to others
","This is one of the most original and well crafted war movie I have ever seen, after seeing it once I just had to see it again in theater. This is a war movie with emotion and psychological aspects to it and for the most part everything works really well. The plot revolves around a bomb disposal unit and it's easy to get attached to these characters which makes a lot of the scenes tense and gut-wrenching. I can understand some of the criticisms this movie has been getting, about how it's unrealistic and inaccurate and not really true when it comes to how real soldiers do things in the military. Although I have no military background some aspects of it seemed a bit far-fetched. But I still found this movie to be brilliant, it isn't like most war movies where there is a specific mission. There are some missions, but that is just the surface of this movie. It has some psychological parts to it and it's about the experience of few soldiers and what comes later on. This isn't a complicated or convoluted war movie, but it's a simple and yet there is emotion and I got a bit of the sense of fear and tension these soldiers were facing in the movie. This is Jeremy Renner's big break and his performance in this was outstanding, I enjoyed every scene he was in despite him being the main character and all. But yeah again I can understand the complaint about how this movie sort of tries to sell it like it's a very realistic war movie and some people with real military background can spot out the unrealistic parts about this movie. But some of the general idea of a bomb squad and the emotion and fear they have to face is still intact. Despite some unrealistic aspects of this movie, it's still compelling movie that had my attention all the way through it. This is a different war movie and like what some reviewers are claiming, civilians will praise it and veterans will probably dislike it. Maybe it's because I am a civilian, but I found this movie to be a movie most definitely worth checking out despite some flaws and weaknesses. Never the less it's a very good effort by Kathryn Bigelow.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"koenig07","9","3","6","6 February 2011"," Suspenseful
","The theme of the hurt locker is about war and more specifically about the challenges of one unit during their time in Iraq. Full Metal Jacket is another film that shows the struggles of soldiers, beginning with basic training, and continuing through their tour in Vietnam. The opening scene of The Hurt Locker shows a quote from Chris Hedges. It says, ""The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" The last four words remain as the others fade away. Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant J. T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are a team from the Bravo company of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Sanborn and Eldridge guard James as he works in his bomb suit to disarm IEDs. James's casual attitude causes tension within the team. On more than one occasion James cut off communication with the rest of his team and seemed to have no regard for his own safety or the safety of his team. <br/><br/>The film also shows the emotional side of war. James connects with Beckham, an Iraqi child who sells DVD's. In one scene James is shown playing soccer with the boy. During a raid at a warehouse, James finds the body of a young boy who has had an unexploded bomb implanted in his chest. Believing it to be Beckham, he later leaves the military base seeking revenge but his search gets him nowhere. <br/><br/>The next mission shows an Iraqi man with a bomb strapped to his chest. Believing him to be innocent, James tries to take the bomb off but is unsuccessful and the man is blows up. Following this mission Sanborn confides in James that he is having a hard time coping with the stress of the war and wants to go home and have a son. <br/><br/>The end of the film shows James back in civilian life. It shows him in the cereal aisle of a grocery store and the difficulty he has choosing a box of cereal. His interactions with his wife involve him telling her about his missions but she doesn't seem to be listening and can't relate to his experiences. One night he tells his son there is only one thing he knows that he loves and the final scene shows him returning to Iraq with the Delta company of an EOD unit as they begin their tour.<br/><br/>The use of an unsteady camera shot allows the viewer to feel like they are there with the soldiers. The subjective point of view allowed the viewer to experience the suspense of the situation. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, does a superb job of communicating the struggles of soldiers in Iraq. Having had a close family member serve in the war, they were able to relate to the film and express how accurate Bigelow's details were. Although there were a few inaccurate scenes, overall the film was accurate in the background, vehicles, and weapons used.<br/><br/>Bigelow excluded the politics of the war and focused on the soldiers which helped the viewer sympathize with them. She also showed a small part of the struggles soldier's face when they return home. Civilians do not understand what soldiers endure overseas and soldiers have a hard time connecting with their family members when they return from war. Having been at war for so long, soldiers feel they don't belong in the civilian world and need to return to war to have a purpose. Bigelow chose the perfect quote to begin the film. For James and many other soldiers, war is a drug. A drug they cannot live without."
"trangoblu","2","3","6","7 January 2011"," Very disappointing
","very disappointed by this movie. esp given its plethora of Oscars.. the story is very fluffy, the movie is boring, feels fake, full of clichés. Most of the so called tensed scenes are lacking the tension, fall flat emotionally, the scenery behind the ""action"" is full of bystanders that couldn't care less about those mega bombs. The three-men bomb disposal unit looks amateurish in their dealings with the locals and when patrolling the Arab street or the countryside. If this is the training and level of preparedness of the US troops in Iraq, we are wasting our money and the young lives for clearing a mess in country that couldn't care less about our sacrifice."
"AshokePrabha","5","3","6","31 October 2010"," Brilliant Propaganda.
","This is a war movie that revolves around a small team of a bomb disposal unit which is disarming bombs in Iraq for 30 days. How they diffuse different types of bombs, kills people, get killed and save Iraquies by doing their 'job'.<br/><br/>It is a strange and sad fact that the very first woman director to get an Oscar is Kathryn Bigelow who at the same time did that movie as a US war propaganda. Shame.<br/><br/>Technically as a director Kathryn soars high. She excels many contemporaries by brilliantly captivating the moment of the scenes. Her visualization is perfect. Added with nice photography along with hand-held cam photography to pitch in journalism-editing. Many comments read that 'many technical aspects of bomb disposal unit operation' are inaccurate and flawed.<br/><br/>Politically Kathryn turns bad. But brilliant. The movie pretends that it does not deal about the Iraqi politics at all but at the same time sows its agenda that, US solders are 'servicing' in Iraq for their 'free country'. You want proof? The film is shot in Jordan, the neighbor country of Iraq and they actually used the Iraqi refugees as 'extras'. Hows that ? Compare this attempt with Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11. You'll know what sort of delicate poltics Kathryn Bigelow is playing.<br/><br/>During the movie, the (American)audience would get a feel that Iraq is a Jungle full of animals in which US soldiers are fighting for their as well as their country's life. Lots and lots of scenes, shots placed delicately, dramatically to give one the effect of 'American Nationalism' and their 'Deterrent strikes' all over the world. B.S.<br/><br/>Soldier warning a terrorist who is about to switch the button in his cellphone while few hundred feet away his colleague is disarming a bomb... The car bomb diffusing American soldier (showing his brilliance and dedication over this life threatening condition) in the car bomb diffusion sequence... The Arab Kid who is selling DVDs. His relationship with the 'war thirsty' soldier (football playing friendliness.. wow) and what happens to him... All Iraqui terrorist enemies are faceless, ruthless. They were shown passively. No characters. The faces too gives you a creepy idea of 'you are in a dangerous place'... The enemies are so ruthless that they plant a bomb in a dead body so that it blows during an autopsy by American soldiers. There is also a scene where one guy tied a bomb with his body was rescued by an American soldier where the soldier finds that the bomb was 'locked' with chains and locks so that releasing him from the ticking bomb becomes impossible... The enemies are so cheating that an old man seeking help with loading rocks on to his cart on the roadside is in fact a lethal enemy... The Americans shooting snipers in the desert are so 'job' oriented such that in the event of a 'thirsty break' they do it systematically and drink for the sniper is also 'served' with a procedure because they are doing their 'jobs'... And indeed all these US soldiers do have a 'family home' somewhere in US. A remote place; surrounded by Meadows lawn and beautiful trees and natural surroundings. Having beautiful wives and small babies whom they have left at their 'family home'. And of course they long to go back but their 'call of duty' prevents them somehow...wow..<br/><br/>and so on..<br/><br/>In the Iraq war over 300000 Iraqi people were killed. 600000 Iraqi people left homeless. A few thousands of US soldiers died in Iraq and a 32 thousand got injured. All for what ? To own the oil mines by American companies. After the war everything is done. A pseudo govt setup that inquires Saddam Hussein and hangs him and put thousands of people in Jail. Who is the victim here ? Iraqi people ? or the US soldiers ? Whom would you want to portray in a film. Kathryn chooses the 'winning team', the American team. Find a story (It was found by James Cameron, her ex-husband)that fits into this American Nationalism structure. Make it with visually compelling shots and scenes. And one year later it gets Oscar in the name of an 'anti-war movie'. sure. Why not ?<br/><br/>I used to fall for such American propaganda films (e.g. First Blood.. Rambo) when I was young and only knew American Cinema. Now, I can see more than that and find out what American Cinema is. <br/><br/>I wanted to expose this film's cruelty shot by shot. But stops here as of now."

Replacement Jeremy Renner is a loose cannon who plays by his own rules and disregards safety for either himself and his fellow sergeants, not to mention the rules of the U.S. Army.

What, this films trying to be realistic!?, (throws up). Realistic my ass! this guy'd be thrown out of the Army in a millisecond. Hell! Half the crap these guys pull would get them thrown out. A guy holds a knife up to the neck of his own comrade, and earlier contemplated killing him by blowing him up. One of them wounds the other in the leg, (I like the scene out of making me laugh), and goes out on his own for a personal issue. <br/><br/>And man is it boring. Nearly fell asleep if it weren't for the booming surround sound. Most scenes consist of disarming a bomb, with pointlessly extended suspense thrown in, and hardly any action scenes.<br/><br/>I think iv'e made my point. Overrated does not begin to say it. At first I thought, (did I see a different film?) but no, it was the one praised by critics, and won best picture. My jaw dropped to the ground. Can't say iv'e had this experience, since I enjoy most best picture winners, and if I don't, I don't really hate them. But wow. Just wow! Just goes to show women cannot direct war films. Only reason this was praised was most likely because the director is a woman. I guarantee that's why. All I can say to conclude this is, WOW!"
"ricfal","4","3","6","24 March 2010"," Martyr without a cause
","It's curious to see so many people complaining about inaccuracy in a film such as this. Frist of all that's why it's called fiction and not reality. Directors are free to elaborate their metaphors to convey some sort of feeling through the film. The film in itself is actually not that special but it captures the viewer and builds tension as the whole thing displays. This is actually a film that echoes a lot of what nowadays is our world. It doesn't demonize Iraqis but it also doesn't grants us entry to their world. Maybe there's a point there, you can only fight a war if you have an enemy, otherwise you couldn't ever hold people at gunpoint. I'm not a war expert and certainly don't intend to be. I can understand how some people that have commented here, and have been on Iraq, get disappointed as they don't see what they have been through portrayed. But at the same time, the reality of protocol, the chain of command, the handling of the situations, the details with which you can fill a film feature don't immediately make a film more accurate. How about all other films you praise without making such a claim to ""reality""? Why this one could be any different? I can make an example out of it ... do you think that what you saw in a film as Blood Diamond for example amounts to something about Sierra Leone? Can you check it out? It means only this is closer to your heart, but that's your ""claim"" on the film. It's not compulsory to the film director to ""document"". Now, this film doesn't go down because of these claims, but because the characters are shallow. The character who, still, has something is the main one. Unfortunately he is a ""hero"" and ""heroes"" act on what the French call «fierté», something that could be translated as «bravery». But this bravery where does it lead us? What does he accomplish with this bravery? Going back! He is not stupid. But the world where he comes from has become standardized sufficiently so that he prefers bombs to his wife and son? Or is he supposed to take on some sort of destiny, preferring to be killed instead of others. So he's a martyr, like any suicide bomber. And, in this sense, this appears to be a Christian film about an unaccomplished martyrdom. He's not Jesus that's for sure. In the end, i find it propagandistic, without a cause. IT's not ""rebel without a cause"", it's ""playing martyr without a cause"". But hey, is it not that this epoch is all about people not having causes? Maybe this is actually about cynicism. Not enriching. I could think of much better use for the money spent doing it."

Jeremy Renner(28 Days Later) plays the leader of the EOD team who has to defuse bombs while a full on war is exploding around him and his team.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the film hits like an unexploded bomb, as many of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraqi border, plus all of the Iraqi roles in the film were played by displaced Iraqi war refugees living in Jordan.

Ever since that day I have been thinking about it, and decided to rewatch it because it felt like I missed something. Boy, I missed a lot of things. This is a great film. The attention to detail and tension in the film is so real, so layered. The film offers the first real startling look at the Iraq War, and how dangerous it is. As much as it is a war film, it is also a character study. Jeremy Renner is perfect as SSgt. William James. He creates a fascinating and brave character that is sure to become one of the iconic heroes of this decade. Renner hits every note perfectly, as does his cast members Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. The film has a good amount of humor, thanks a great deal to James. But the film also gives a painful look at lives of real men at Iraq and how hard it must be to cope with the tasks needed to accomplish, like disarming bombs. Kathryn Bigelow deserves an Oscar nomination for her directing, and honestly, at this point I would want her to win. She, and the screenplay writer Mark Boal, have created a devastating, powerful, but ultimately rewarding war/drama that deserves all the praise. One of the five best films of the year"

I viewed it at the VA hospital - half were laughing hysterically, the other half left after about 15 minutes because, well, it is such a stupid movie. Of course, here comes the barrage of ""Well, if it was so bad, why did it win the Oscar? Huh? Answer me that one!""

"Quinoa1984","10","8","24","11 July 2009"," ""In Iraq, you're dead""
","Early in the film, one soldier says this to another who is just starting on the job of being in a particular unit in Iraq. One might think it a lame line, and it's even mentioned as such right after the character says it. But it is, actually, accurate in a way. The characters, both the soldiers and those who engage in the suicide bombings (whether all willing or totally against in some small cases), are like the living dead, living through the dead that is, every day and every second. It wears down minds and souls, and it sets apart personalities. Some have to stay professionals, others get blown to bits at a second's notice for just not hustling ass or, perhaps, just standing around not on constant alert. Kathryn Bigalow's film is most exceptional at a level of pure suspense, but there's this underlying feeling too, of what this kind of combat does to a person, that isn't underestimated.<br/><br/>Her film is lean and mean. I don't know for certain whether or not it's accurate to all of the details on the streets and in the desert. Some others have already complained about the lack of authenticity (just look at the IMDb negative comments to give some perspective on the inundation of critical praise from the press). While I can figure Bigalow and her writer did their homework, that's not even what makes the film so palpable and worthwhile. It's creating a sense of what it is to be there, the tension that is completely unpredictable even when all appears to be going right. It's essentially about a bomb squad, a unit that goes around checking out and (hopefully) disarming bombs that have been laid out. The hand-held camera and jittery zoom isn't done for ill-used effect (this isn't, for example, Public Enemies again); not a shot in these moments are wasted, and it gives a new urgency to the ""ticking time bomb"" scenario that actually means something here as opposed to other sources in TV and movies (24 anyone?) <br/><br/>And it's not without some good dosage of characterization as well. True, Bigalow paints with some broad strokes, at least at first; there's the strong-minded leader Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), who pushes down his fear with his professional sniper eye, the weaker link of the group who tries to hold it together but just can't keep going on with it, Eldridge, (Brian Geraghty), and rounding it up is Jeremy Renner as James, the ""adrenaline junkie."" It would be easy to say James is the antagonist of the group, and I was fully expecting him to be painted as two-dimensional at best. But if anything he's given the most dimension of anyone (compared to him, in fact, Geragthy is given much less to do except to look frightened, not always a bad thing), as we see him break down over little things that turn bigger, like with the 12 year old kid selling DVD's, or his estranged relationship with his ex-wife and little boy. And on top of this, Renner is simply electrifying in the role, going all over the place emotionally but never missing a beat. It's one of those unforgettable characters in recent war movies.<br/><br/>Bigalow also has other tricks up her sleeve casting wise, such as giving ""name"" actors parts that aren't actually on screen for very long (this isn't quite a spoiler exactly, the three big ones are Morse, Fiennes and Pearce). And as far as person-to-person drama goes, there are some startling moments, such as that drunken fight between James and Sanborn. So with that covered, with the characters in these situations given that sense of danger at any moment anyway (stray bullets can fly through the barracks, of course, as mentioned just in passing), it's the big sequences that steal the show. In particular is a sniper-fire scene, where the bomb unit stops to help a British jeep with a spare-tire fix only to come under sudden fire from miles away. Rarely does one jump and feel such itching tension in one's seat in this scene and, oddly enough, that turns into a long scene where characters have to wait, at the ready at their snipers, sometimes having to do things simply as getting enough fluids into the system. One is reminded of the sniper sequence in Full Metal Jacket and, as high praise indeed, this is just as good if not given fuller dimension with its equal intensity and patience.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker isn't always an easy film to take, and it shouldn't be. It's an in-the-zone motion picture where you never are quite sure about the outcome, except that in the end everyone will be more or less f***ed for life even when they get out. They might not even know it, but there may be that moment in a cereal isle, staring down at endless boxes and brands, and the derangement of the senses comes through thick as smoke. Powerful stuff, and one of the director's best in a career of lean/mean (smart) action pictures."

","The Hurt Locker is a very powerful film—in many ways—and I believe it is worthy of the Best Picture Award, which it just received from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; for one reason: It's the most relevant film of our (particular) time.<br/><br/>At the outset of our war with Iraq, which is film's context, I predicted that Americans would have little—if any—concern for our soldiers that would be serving in Iraq. Not that the soldiers' loved ones wouldn't be concerned—this, I think, goes without saying—but that most Americans, who have no vested, personal vested interest in the war, would not give the war in Iraq a second thought. Iraq is a long, long way from America; and our military is, currently, an all volunteer force.<br/><br/>I was actually surprised when, at first, there was a lot of interest in the war; but, as time has gone by, I think my prediction has been proved correct: most Americans, I think, care about our war with Iraq, which is still on-going, nor do they care that much that our soldiers are currently serving over there. After all, our soldiers are volunteers; who are simply doing a job which they have chosen to do.<br/><br/>What Americans with this particular (and pathetic) attitude toward the war and our soldiers in Iraq fail to realize is that our soldiers are doing what they are ordered to do and that THAT is their job: to follow orders. And I think it's high time that all Americans realize that the orders our soldiers were given—to invade and occupy Iraq—were wrong.<br/><br/>It's our job and it's our responsibility—as U. S. citizens—to insure that our soldiers are not misused and put at risk for no good reason and to call our elected officials to account for their wrong-headed decision to invade and occupy Iraq.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a film about a U. S. Army Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) unit that has been deployed, for a one year term service, to Iraq, whose job it is to defuse Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's), car bombs, and, in one case, a very unwilling human bomb. Not the kind of job for the faint-hearted; nor for me.<br/><br/>Explosive devices (or bombs) are notoriously unpredictable. They often go off when they are not supposed to go off and they sometimes fail to go off when they are supposed to go off. I once witnessed an EOD guy get killed by an explosive device, when I was in the Army, just shortly after his EOD partner had taught me the most important EOD maxim: ""There's no such thing as an explosives expert"".<br/><br/>I've never forgotten that maxim.<br/><br/>In The Hurt Locker, what struck me—powerfully—more than anything else was the way in which the film generated within me the intense feelings of anxiety and apprehension—for the entire 131 minutes of the film. The reason for this is that the film deals with a small group of soldiers who are dealing—in incident after incident—with bomb disposal, and, as a viewer of the film, I was constantly on edge—waiting for someone to be killed by an explosion, which I knew was coming.<br/><br/>This, to me, was a most ingenious way for a film-maker to generate, within a film-viewer, the similar—though much greater—feelings of anxiety and apprehension that our soldiers in Iraq (and Afghanistan) feel on a daily basis. (Thank God I only had to endure 131 minutes, and not 365 days!) The film brought out, well, the daily anxiety and apprehension that all of our soldiers, especially those who are assigned to forward rather than rear areas, experience: the tension brought about by the confusion of trying to fill the role of both soldier and policeman in a foreign country where some of the citizens of that country—who appear to be ordinary civilians—are trying to kill you.<br/><br/>This, I think, was the most important aspect of this film's many aspects: our soldiers in Iraq have no business being there, and it's unfair of us to force them into such a misguided role; a role for which they were never intended.<br/><br/>As I was watching this film, I couldn't help but wish that, somehow, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi—and especially all of those chicken hawks who support the war in Iraq—could be out there, along with these guys, walking the streets of Baghdad; instead of living and working in the quiet security of their homes and offices.<br/><br/>I think every American owes a special debt to our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan to watch this film. (Whether you personally desire to watch it or not is irrelevant to me.) We owe them that—and much, much more besides. See for yourself what they have to endure on a daily basis—the confusion, the tension, the death, the destruction—and feel, for yourself, just a small fraction of the anxiety and apprehension they are feeling.<br/><br/>And please—I'm begging you: Open your eyes, open your minds, and work in any way that you can to bring these soldiers home—NOW—where they belong.<br/><br/>Help bring an end to this foolish war."

","When The Hurt Locker won the Oscar for Best Film, Directing and Screenplay, a lot of people were surprised. Not that it wasn't a hot candidate, but certain critics and others in-the-know didn't see it coming anyway. It seemed, a critic wrote somewhere, as if the jury of the Academy suddenly voted from their hearts, giving the Oscar to a low budget (in fact, in Oscar terms, record-breakingly low budget) film instead of what the industry begged for (that is to say Avatar). The choice of The Hurt Locker seemed somewhat more honest, more daring, more true to the quality of cinema.<br/><br/>I'd have to object, your honor. That would have been true if they'd given it to Precious. Or, in another way, even Inglourious Basterds. The Hurt Locker surely is a meager looking winner of 6 Oscars, but there's really more than enough Academy material in it. It's a war movie. It's about an imperfect man trying to do good and facing the confusion when this doesn't properly work out. In continuation, it's about America doing the same thing in Iraq. It doesn't take sides. It asks questions in a moderately wise fashion. It's a little teary and it's a little amusing when it's not serious or Speech Time-ish. I'm not putting this down, though. Just saying.<br/><br/>The main character of the film is Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) who attends Delta Company in Iraq. His job is to defuse bombs, which is something he does, one must assume, better than anybody else. He is very reckless and Gung Ho, and not what you'd call immediately likable. He is so focused on disarming his bombs he doesn't seem to understand or care that there's people around him and that they are all in life threatening danger. His first day on the job earns him a punch in the face from his second sergeant. As the film progresses, we begin to understand that he is one of those self made war machines who cannot function in the real world any longer and thus comes to live for fighting in the frontier. He's not John Rambo, a character with the same problem, but I suspect he might think he is. Some of the best bits of the film involves scenes where he loses his illusions about war heroism. As one might imagine, they have a lot to do with children.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a good film, but I must admit I'm surprised at how easily impressed the critics have been with it. The good things are easy to point out - It is professional and well made, exactly the type of proper job Kathryn Bieglow has been known for in the past, and it is well acted - Jeremy Renner does as much as can be done with this character I believe, and Anthony Mackie balances him with a counter-role as Sanborn, the other sergeant. The best scenes involve them speaking in a realistic fashion. I know nothing of warfare, but as far as I know this is how people talk in real life no matter where. I really liked just about every scene they shared that didn't have any guns in it.<br/><br/>The ""bad"" stuff isn't really bad as much as it's ""not good enough"". Most of the content of the film is old fashioned war clichés - the good man in the bad land, slightly psychotic commanding officers, naive well- educated peacemakers, the hero who befriends the child, the could-be- innocent could-be-evil arab who wanders up when he's told to step back, basically the Cowboys and the Indians. However, I'm pretty sure that Biegelow and screenwriter Mark Boal knows about this too. I could be wrong of course, but the point of our main hero's escapades into the civilian Iraquee crowds to somehow attempting to find the ""bad guys"" vigilante style, seems self-aware, rather than honest. But the film never really gets high enough, though. It has about three or four really good and memorable big moments, but in between there's not a clear focus on what this film really is about. My guess is that Boal and Biegelow didn't want to go over the line of a kind of journalistic line of objectiveness, but it wouldn't have hurt if they did. I find it a pity that a film that's obviously very intelligent won't go even further in it's own questions.<br/><br/>I can understand most of the criticism The Hurt Locker has received, apart from one thing and that's the pointless rants about inaccuracy. This is in general a critique I have never understood, and when it comes to war films I knew from the moment I saw The Deer Hunter and experienced the tremendous impact that film had on me, that it was a completely worthless to question if it was ""accurate"" or not. Accuracy has nothing to do with it. No film is accurate. It's a film. Only our feelings for them are accurate."
"EfcEmb","8","4","10","13 March 2010"," If he wasn't an insurgent before, he sure as hell is now.
","Amongst all the chaos of war, the Hurt Locker manages to keep a steady rhythm and clear narrative thanks to Bigelow and Renner. As any good war film should do, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, leaving you wondering if each actor will make it to the next tense scene alive. One almost experiences each bomb disposal and combat mission as we follow Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) and Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) through the film's extensive camera work, giving every scene multiple angles. War pushes soldiers to the breaking point and this vulnerability is shown very realistically by a trio of actors in peak form. Oscar nominee Renner garners a lot of attention, but Mackie as Sanborn also masters his role as the no frills, by the book foil to team leader James's recklessness. They navigate risky terrain, disarming any found bombs while often suspicious locals watch on, any of whom could possess the detonator. Put yourself in their position and you'd not be able to wait for it all to be over. However, we get a firsthand account of someone (Renner) unable to keep away. Disarming bombs is his calling in life and he feels at home when in the line of duty. As the movie begins, we read ""war is a drug"" and by the end of the film you might even understand why."

And exactly when did you land on earth? Have you actually seen other movies? I'm sorry for being sarcastic but there are films that are based on true stories that are related even less to the actual facts than this movie. And i m sure you can remember films you liked that were really screwed up factually. Movies are not documentaries. I have discovery channel for that. The point here was that there were multiple levels in the characters, i thought that the tensions and the relationships between soldiers, natives, friends, strangers were interesting, intriguing. There was drama. there was power. I m not actually trying to make you agree with me but maybe if you try to look at this movie not as a documentary maybe you ll see it from a different perspective. Finally let me point out that the awards, like a championship, will be given to a film. And the better film in relation to the others will win.

"wikkit27","5","4","10","5 March 2010"," Cool sounding title (however unrelated). Needs better research/writing.
","I will admit that the cinematography in the movie had some cool sequences. I enjoyed that aspect of the movie. The acting was good, but none of it stood out from anything else I've seen this year and I'm not entirely sure Jeremy Renner did well enough to stand out from other actors to earn an Oscar Nomination. This movie does entertain as an Action Thriller, but I cannot take it seriously as a Drama. I know for a fact that whoever wrote the script didn't do much in the sense of research. I'm sure they read a whole lot of first hand experiences from EOD Officers and NCO's, but not much on how operations in Iraq are carried out. It appeared to me that the writer was banking on the US civilian not having any clue on how the military works in a combat zone and then took certain liberties to turn a real world job into a super thriller movie. Yes, this movie is a thriller, but certainly not a drama because the characters don't act like real American soldiers. For the record, ""Specialist"" is a rank in the Army. I've never heard any Officer or Sergeant refer to a Specialist as just ""Specialist"". It's always the Soldiers last name. Here is why I can't consider this movie a Drama and take it seriously: <br/><br/>-Partial Spoiler- <br/><br/>A speeding taxi driver doesn't stop for a road block of two HMMWV's (humvies) with crew served weapons (machine guns) mounted on the turrets and shouting soldiers (the driver almost runs a soldier over) but he does stop for a man in a padded suit standing in an intersection with a 9mm Beretta pointing at him Seriously? The driver and his car would have been Swiss cheese before he got within 20 meters of those HMMWV's. The movie takes numerous liberties like this to produce a thriller affect. I feel if you sacrifice reality for thrill and suspense, then you are making an action thriller, not an action drama. The technical aspect of EOD could be accurate, I know nothing about that, but as far as making an honest representation of the Army and how it operates, the writer came up short, or didn't even try at all. It's a joke to me that this movie was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture (there must not be a lot of good movies to choose from this year). I still think the best theatric representation of how the Army works is Black Hawk Down. Granted, it's a different type of warfare, but it's a good example of what an Action Drama is, and what The Hurt Locker is trying to be, but is not. I would have given this movie a 4, but I gave it a 5 because the cinematography is that good. <br/><br/>SFCs don't sneak off base at night and hold people at gunpoint, then walk back on base without any kind of punishment or investigation.<br/><br/>NCOs don't punch their superiors in the face without and article 15, loss of rank or a general court marshal, not to mention what James did to deserve it. <br/><br/>The movie portrays these actions as if they would be common place in the Army.<br/><br/>-End Spoiler- <br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people like this movie for the affects and suspense, but I want them to know that it's very far from real (obviously no one goes to the movies for raw reality, they want to be lied to, at least a little bit) combat zone action. It's okay to like this movie if it entertains you, but it certainly isn't Oscar Worthy. I believe the story and the script sacrifice too much reality and accuracy to even be considered. I'm well aware that movies aren't meant to be perfectly accurate. My point is that there is hardly any reality for me to agree with its nomination. If people think this is a good Drama, it makes me feel like Americans are absolutely clueless as to what a soldier's life is like while deployed. This movie gets them no closer. Actually, this movie probably is a perfect example of how the common person thinks an OIF deployment is like, and that is sad.<br/><br/>I'm certain that if you ask any soldier who's been to Iraq (or any other deployment for that matter) if this movie is an honest representation of what they've done for their country, they would quickly tell you that it's a worthless army movie (I'm cleaning that up for you.) The fact that it received the positive reviews that it did is an insult to the real EOD soldiers and the soldiers who have to wait for them to show up on scene."
"meeza","9","4","10","5 September 2009"," This movie is the bomb!
","I promise you this will not hurt (maybe a little) meaning my following punsightful review of the explosive Iraq war film ""The Hurt Locker"". There has been buzz circulating stating that other presumed Best Picture Oscar contenders do not stand a chance in diffusing ""The Hurt Locker"" from reaching the golden statuette. I would not personally go that far, but undoubtedly the film is a worthy contender in the Camp Oscar battle. Director Kathryn Bigelow has orchestrated in ""The Hurt Locker"" the best Iraq War film assembled so far. Bigelow's authentic picturesque display of an Army Bomb Squad's courageous tasks in diffusing bombs is a totally suspenseful tour-de-force. Jeremy Renner stars as Sgt. William James, the main bomber of the squad, whose passion for the risqué of diffusing bombs and war battle confrontations demonstrates not all soldiers have a mentality that ""war is hell""; some live for it as King James here. Anthony Mackie co-stars as J.T. Sanborn, the more by-the-book or bomb for that matter sergeant in the squad who constantly conflicts with James' fiery bombastic nature. Brian Geraghty plays Specialist Owen Eldridge, the internally conflicted of the bunch who has his own psychological time bomb ticking in his continuous fixated anxious mind. All three of these actors give solid performances, but its Renner who goes further outside the acting box in delivering the apex acting of the film. Bigelow's expert craftsmanship or should I say craftswomanship is displayed with the detail-oriented vision of the fervor, passion, anxiety, and embodiment of the risk-taking physical atrocities and adrenaline mental rushes of war which have helmed Kathryn with a five-star General Director status for her efforts here. This Bigelow is no Dunce Bigelow and her name will be included in the Best Director Oscar list for this year! ""The Hurt Locker"" also should garner ""sure lock"" Oscar nominations for its stellar Cinematography and Art Direction. Mark Boal's captivating screenplay bowled me over, even though a few times I got somewhat lost in the garrulous crossfire of war terminology. I would not insert ""The Hurt Locker"" in the pedestals of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" of war films, but its not too far off. Hopefully, I have provided enough of affirmative cinematic combinations for you to unlock ""The Hurt Locker"" before it explodes away from your local theatre. **** Excellent"
"mm-39","8","4","10","29 July 2009"," Best movie of the year so far!
","Best movie of the year so far! The Hurtlocker is about war, and the effects on the individual. Some people experience fear, while others experience a rush. Adrenaline has a the fight or flight effect on people. You can see this effect on the various characters in the movie, and the lead protagonist is hooked on adrenaline. I can see why the movie's protagonist he went back for another tour. The the Hurtlocker's pace is one of heart pounding adrenaline. One gains the feel of combat and bomb defusing from the Hurtlocker. I will give the Hurtlocker an eight out of ten. The Hurtlocker should win a couple of awards. A good movie to buy."
"pgtmatrix","8","7","22","8 March 2010"," Inaccuracies aside, this is an excellent film
","With this film having such a limited release, I had never heard of it or had any interest in it until it started winning awards. And obviously with a Best Picture Oscar under it's belt I had to break down and actually see it for myself.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a quote stating that war is a drug. To me, this encompasses the entire point of the movie. Just like people get addicted to heroin and cocaine, people can get addicted to a lifestyle, the lifestyle here obviously being the military. But as I said, that quote encompasses the entire film, so you won't necessarily understand it until the end credits roll.<br/><br/>Iraq War inaccuracies aside, the movie was incredibly intense and well shot. It had a ""realistic"" feel to it even though it may not be the most accurate war movie ever made. But it never claims to be. The gritty, almost documentary-style camera work and spot-on directing made it feel like these were real men going through real-life situations.<br/><br/>There is a subtle depth to each character that builds throughout, so you must pay attention to understand their reasoning for doing certain things. The plot of the movie is very hard to explain because of the way the story unfolds, it's hard to give a general synopsis without divulging key points to the story and or writing up another two or three paragraphs. But the beauty of it is that the story is so well told, in the end, it makes sense. Pretty much all you need to know is that the main characters are a bomb squad in the army and they have about a month until they get to go home. What happens throughout the film is what happens over the course of that month.<br/><br/>Excellent performances from all the actors(especially Renner) ensure that there isn't a dull moment in the film's entirety. It also boasts an extremely fitting original score which helps set the tone for certain scenes.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain the film because it's a movie that must be seen to be understood. But from sniping in the desert, to disarming bombs in street cars, the movie is masterfully crafted in every scene. It's a film that will resonate even after repeated viewings and it will go down in history as Kathryn Bigelow's crowning achievement.<br/><br/>An overall excellent film as long as you put the war inaccuracies aside. It showcases the ugliness of war, but yet depicts how the lifestyle can become addicting. Everybody loves something. People love what they're good at. And some people... are good at war.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","3","7","13 April 2012"," ""War's dirty little secret is that some men love it. I'm trying to unpack why, to look at what it means to be a hero in the context of 21st-century combat."" Kathryn Bigelow
","The Hurt Locker (2008) - was one of the best movies released in 2009 and for me the second most deserving nominee for Best Picture of the year of eight that I have seen so far. The director, Kathryn Bigelow who is known for making dazzling, dynamic, intelligent and intense action movies (The Loveless (1982), Point Break (1991), Blue Steel (1989), Strange Days (1995), K-19: The Widowmaker (2002)) feels absolutely at home in the very manly world of directing a war film. The Hurt Locker has been universally praised by the critics and many viewers since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 and made a history when Bigelow won the Best Directing Oscar on March 7th, 2010 during the Oscar ceremony. Even if it had not happened, The Hurt Locker has already won its place in history as the remarkable and to the date the best film about the war in Iraq. The most accurate description of the film belongs to the critic Roger Ebert who rated The Hurt Locker the best movie of the year and one of the best of the decade: ""The Hurt Locker is a great film, an intelligent film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they're doing and why."" The film does not explore why we were there and who was responsible for the war. It just places us ""inside"", along with three main characters, the members of a bomb squad as they go about their daily business, doing their most dangerous and unforgiving job imaginable, trying to survive the last 39 days of their rotation. The intense effect of the total immersion was achieved by Bigelow and Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer (United 93) by using multiple S16mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq where he would go with the members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks very closely. Based on his experiences, his screen play the fictional retelling of the real events He said of the film's goal that the creators wanted to show the experiences of the soldiers that we'd never see on the daily news. I believe that director and screenwriter, as well as everyone involved in the making of The Hurt Locker have achieved their goals. The result is an unforgettable film.<br/><br/>It is remarkable that the film's more famous actors (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse) only show up for a short cameo leaving Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty to carry movie on their own. All three do an amazing job. Jeremy Renner, relatively unknown becomes a real center of the film and turns a star making performance. With the face far from a typical cinema hero, he becomes a true hero of the film, the guy who by the words of his younger comrade is not good with people but a great warrior, confident, cool, good at his deadly job, always having it done. It is about him, the epigraph to the film says, war is drug for he is addicted to the rush that only combat can give him.<br/><br/>I found the film absolutely riveting, gripping, and intense. It is amazingly shot, the pace is perfect, and the action scenes executed masterfully. It also works as the characters study of the men at war and how the war affects them."

"Mustang92","2","3","7","10 January 2011"," Unrealistic and not believable piece of filmed trash
","The Problems with ""The Hurt Locker"":<br/><br/>1) Not realistic: It appears as though the writer, and subsequently the director, did NOT research the men who conduct these types of missions. There are so many ""film stunts"" and unrealities, solely to heighten the tension of this movie, than one must suspend their disbelief way too many times, to go with the ride being told. Examples to follow....<br/><br/>2) Explosives must be handled with care, right? That's established in the very first scene of the movie. So why does Renner's character, when he encounters the Secondary that has 6 or so bombs attached (the one in the movie's poster), do this? He pulls the red wire up, that is attached to all the bombs (...that's OK, perhaps), but then he continues to pull the wire, lifting the bombs out of the ground. What???? What bomb expert would ever do this? And what bomb expert COULD ever behave this way in a ""career"" of deactivating 800+ bombs, and still be alive? I'll tell you: None. Extremely unreal. <br/><br/>Perhaps the director wanted to heighten the tension of this scene? But then why blow the reality? Any person in their right mind would say, ""Are you kidding me??"" Bombs can go off any second, even if timed. That was set up in dialogue the very FIRST sequence in the movie!<br/><br/>3) Backtracking in the story just a bit, how was the Thompson character actually killed in the opening sequence? He's at least 20 yards away from the explosion, and we see NO debris or shrapnel hitting him. All we see is he's knocked to the ground by the explosion's shockwave. If shrapnel penetrated his bomb suit, we should have seen this. Or it should have been explained. For a movie that had a $15 Million budget, this is quite lame.<br/><br/>4) In opening sequence, the Army is clearing people from the area where the bomb is. One Iraqi shopkeeper argues as he's pushed away from his shop area, and the second or third time we come back to the soldiers pushing/shooing people from the area, we see him get by one of the soldiers, who couldn't stop him. So... you're telling me, this soldier just lets it go? He doesn't chase after him? He doesn't ""call it in"" to his superior on the scene? NOT REALISTIC. They would keep the scene clear, particularly if they're worried about devices being set off by remote control. (Which they should be, as by 2004 -- the date shown on screen at beginning of film, IEDs were being set off by remote control.)<br/><br/>Then, somehow, no one knows this guy is there -- despite all the soldiers all over the place keeping a perimeter -- until he attempts to set off the bomb with his cell phone. Puulllleease!<br/><br/>5) Renner's reaction to the kid being dead with a bomb sewn inside his body was NOT believable. He had 2 very brief interactions with this kid up to this point; how could he be so emotionally wrought over this? He's a veteran and see lots of death. Now, suddenly, he's distraught about the kid being dead and about to be used as a ""body bomb""? Gimme a frickin' break. <br/><br/>This phony ""character motivation"" is so that he will decide not to blow up the building (and dead kid), but instead, disarm this bomb. Can I just say, ""gimme a frickin' break"" again? And then be ""motivated"" to go on a ""mission"" of tracking down the possible perpetrators behind this, putting himself and his team at great risk. Oh yeah, VERY believable.<br/><br/>6) He carjacks a guy he thinks is involved (or who might know is involved) by himself, and travels into the heart of Baghdad. (Would never happen.) He then exits the car, telling the guy don't leave. LOLOL. Riiight. But then doesn't take the guy's car keys. So as he walks toward a house, the guy drives off. (Very convenient for stranding him.) He goes into the house, finds an older guy who clearly appears not to be a terrorist, but then his wife (also older) starts haranguing & accosting him, when he's holding/pointing a gun. What??? What Iraqi woman is going to do this, in an occupied country? NOT realistic.<br/><br/>7) On a bomb disarming mission after this, he decides that the perpetrators might be in one of the buildings on one of the blocks nearby. And it's night. He decides he's going to go after them, with or without his 2 team members. OK, he's crazy, maybe that would happen (although extremely unlikely, as this would not be following protocols in Iraqi engagement, and would likely result in disciplinary measures). But he's going, and his 2 team members go as well. Sorry, this is extreme BS and would not happen. One loose cannon, OK, but now the other 2 reasonable guys, WITHOUT BACKUP? Without full teams for block by block clearing? Would NEVER happen.<br/><br/>But hey, we gotta keep the tension in the story going, 'cause that's all there is to this movie!<br/><br/>I wonder how many soldiers who've served in Iraq, can appreciate such a flawed story about what it's like there, and how there is no chain of command of ""oversight"" of the bomb disarming units.<br/><br/>There are more BS things about this story, but if you've read this review, just do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Or, grab some beers, get buzzed, and have a good laugh at this total piece of sh*t."

","I know two things about director Kathryn Bigelow.<br/><br/>1/ She made Near Dark, a vampire classic that has unfortunately dated just a wee bit since it's 80s release.<br/><br/>2/ She made Point Break, a fact I only was reminded of with the passing of star Patrick Swayze. Point Break was a bizarrely over the top yet entertaining 80s movie.<br/><br/>That's it, two films both made in the 80s.

You actually care about the soldiers, even when they are being d*cks, and feel real concern as they go about their business.<br/><br/>You don't want them to die. But being a film about real life people in conflict, you always know that there is the chance that they will. If that is what Ms Bigelow set out to achieve then she succeeded.<br/><br/>If nothing else you get far more appreciation of what soldiers go through daily in what is largely thought of as a ""kiddie's war"" than you would in 100 Arnie or Stallone shoot-em-ups.<br/><br/>Not a happy film, not a big action film, just one that deserves to be watched by a far wider audience.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8.5 / 10.

","I watched this film because I had read that it made an honest anti-war statement. I was disappointed. It's a cowboy film, just set in Iraq rather than in the wild west. The narrative revolves within a very self-contained world of three US soldiers. Everything around that world is full of sorts of traps -- bombs and Iraqi insurgents, utterly inhuman, of course. For me, the summary of what the film actually tries to say is given by the scene with the 'suicide bomber': our hero tried his best, really, but he's so sorry, so sorry that he can't help. How agonising it must have been for our valiant sergeant! And how brutal of the heartless Iraqis, to have strapped so many bombs around the waist of a father of four children! John Wayne would have been proud. In addition, the film is full to the brim of Hollywood clichés. Very, very disappointing."
"colinrgeorge","6","3","7","6 April 2010"," ""The Hurt Locker""
","""War is a drug."" So reads the quotation by American journalist Chris Hedges that precedes Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker."" The film has a clear thesis, but offers little of substance to extrapolate or back it up. The movie is remarkably effective on the gut level of provoking an emotional response, but relies on a few disappointing action clichés that prevent it from truly being the masterpiece others have been so quick to hail it as.<br/><br/>The aforementioned quote refers to the bomb-diffusing, adrenaline-addled protagonist of the film, Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who deals so intimately with death in his day job, that everything else starts to feel a little bit dull by comparison. Or at least that's the idea. In execution, James comes off more as your prototypical action hero than the fascinating subject of a character study. He behaves like every other Bourne/Bond/Bay superman to grace the screen in recent memory, and the film declines to comment on this condition until the last thirty minutes or so, making what should be the core of the piece feel more like an afterthought.<br/><br/>The pacing is unhelpful as well, broken up as the story is into isolated encounters that neither build in the traditional narrative sense nor offer more than a diverting peripheral glimpse into the lives of the characters. The sequences are so arbitrarily episodic that their order could seemingly be shuffled with little to no detriment to the comprehensibility of the story arc. Ostensibly, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a film with a clearly defined beginning and end and enough style to keep what's in between from feeling stagnant.<br/><br/>Sure, the bomb diffusion sequences are great. Through the use of ambient sound effects and hand-held camera work (a testament to its correct usage) with an almost Hitchcockian suspense-building prowess, Bigelow is able to masterfully pluck the audience's heartstrings like so many delicate red wires. It's a shame these refreshing, interesting, entertaining pieces of the film are undercut by its vacuous, nearly non-existent story.<br/><br/>And though I'll champion the style in a general sense, the film's pleasing documentary aesthetic is blatantly violated in two auspicious moments, and as far as I can remember, only two. One is a Matrix-esquire dancing bullet shell that meets the sand in super-slow motion, and the other, a bomb exploding at an equally fast shutter-speed from multiple angles, letting the audience pause to consider the visual significance of watching the paint peel from the skeleton of a car or a dust cloud rippling in the blast. The moments are pure Hollywood and feel completely removed from the intention of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most profound moment comes toward the end, when James is confronted with the one, and really only, consequence of his actions, leading to the serious injury of a squad member. However, the implications are decidedly secondary to the film's conclusion, which has all the subtlety and self-aware military chic of an Army recruitment spot, which sabotages James' only meaningful character change and will likely send you out of the theater with a razz between your lips.<br/><br/>So ignore the hype and the nonsensical title. If you approach ""Hurt Locker"" looking for a little summer fun, the ingredients are assuredly there. Just don't let the art house fool you into thinking Kathryn Bigelow's latest offers much more than a few cheap thrills.<br/><br/>If war is a drug, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a placebo."
"Samiam3","6","3","7","2 April 2010"," Intelligent, but awkward and emotionally dead
","With its choppy story telling, hand-held camera work, and low production values, The Hurt Locker resembles the style of last years Oscar nominee, The Wrestler, but emotionally, there is no comparison. This film is a dud. It is a tricky war story to be sympathetic with, because it never hits you in a visceral way. Certain scenes rise to a fair level of tension and potency, but like the result of a bomb explosion, The Hurt Locker is very much in pieces.<br/><br/>We follow a trio of bomb disposal specialists in a small Iraq town during the war. When the movie begins, they have thirty days left in their tour. <br/><br/>A premise as simple as this is good for being realistic and subjective. It allows the film to zoom in close with the subject. (often quite literally). Simplicity is a good thing, but the hurt locker gets a little clumsy. It starts off strong and it maintains a gritty realism, but it never comes alive. When the film is over you realize that it hasn't really taken you anywhere."
"DerekTheCritic","6","3","7","6 March 2010"," As gripping as it is pointless
","After hearing all the good reviews and positive feedback from friends and family, my girlfriend and I decided to finally check out ""The Hurt Locker"" the Friday before Oscar weekend. As I write this, the Oscars are still two days away, and Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" is poised to win big.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't quite understand where all the hype is coming from for this often suspenseful, more often dull and meandering war drama. Let's get down to brass tax - the main character, SSG William James (played by Jeremy Renner) has absolutely zero character development. He starts out tough-as-nails and cynical...and that's where he stays for the remainder of the movie. Scenes involving the soldiers in combat and during James's defusing of bombs - be they in the middle of the road, or in flaming vehicles - go from gripping and intense to dull and boring within minutes. With a few cuts, this movie could have easily shed 20 to 30 full minutes and lost nothing in the end. And in the end, without giving away anything...I just didn't care. It didn't feel real anymore. SSG James was TOO over-the-top, too much of the same thing, for 2+ hrs. <br/><br/>Sorry, folks. Aside from some decent cinematography, this was another hallow and pointless Iraq War movie. You'd get more kicks and learn more about yourself and the world by watching a documentary on it on the Nat Geo Channel."
"twosoberdance","4","3","7","27 February 2010"," A lot of hype, but no explosions!
","I was very aware that I was watching a film. I couldn't buy into the things that were happening, it all seemed a bit too ""Hollywood"" for me, especially the scene involving the British troops. Why were they so disorganised and useless under fire compared to the mighty US? They weren't even wearing uniforms!!! They had drank all the water and seemed to do absolutely nothing while the shoot-out took place. I was glad to hear REAL soldiers slate this film as my suspicions were vindicated. The idea that there are guys recklessly disarming bombs when they can be safely detonated is a joke. I think my criticisms were summed up by another review that praised the film for its ""realistic story"", they proceeded to say ""I felt like I was actually in Irak""...yes, ""Irak""...maybe this film is exactly like Irak, but it shares little resemblance with Iraq."
"imdbbl","Null","3","7","14 December 2009"," One of the year's best
","When SSgt William James joins Bravo Company in Iraq, they have a month or so left in their tour of duty. He's a bomb disposal expert and he is replacing Sgt Matt Thompson, a long-standing member of the team who was recently killed disposing of an improvised explosive device. To say that James loves what he does doesn't quite capture the emotional high he experiences when he gets to do what he does best. For his fellow squad members however, including Sgt JT Sanborn and Spc Owen Eldridge, they just want to survive the few days of duty they have left... The Hurt Locker is great, and possibly, the best war movie to come out in years. I'm not in the army and I have never been to war but I have the feeling that this is one of the most realistic and accurate depictions of what actually goes on in the field. Every scene feels extremely authentic. The films focus on a bomb squad, a unit that goes around checking out and disarming bombs and all sorts of exposing devices, that have either been planted, or just abandoned, but either way are dangerous. The 3 main characters are Will (Jeremy Renner), an adrenaline junkie who as I mentioned above is replacing a member of the team that was recently killed, the strong-minded leader Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) who is desperately counting the days to get the hell out of Iraq and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who's having a hard time holding it together. A lot of the film is this unit simply trying to disarm dangerous devices and the pace is kinda slow, but the atmosphere is so tense and this sequences have so much suspense (because the soldiers never know who to trust and everyone seems suspect) that I couldn't take my eyes of the screen and was constantly on the edge of my seat. The acting is top-notch, although the ""less known"" actors like Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are the ones who truly shine and the well established actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce have minor roles and very little screen time. The only flaw I can think of, is the fact that the story could use a little more development. In the end Will comes trough as a man who only feels alive when experiencing danger and facing death, and that, was one of the most interesting parts of the film and maybe could have been explored a little more. The Hurt Locker seems to be the major Oscar contender of 2009 and while I think the film it's far from being a masterpiece, I'm sure it is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"freemantle_uk","7","3","7","3 September 2009"," War is Hell
","Films about the War of Terrorism and the Iraq War have often been critical and commercial poison for many filmmakers. There is a list of films such as Lions for Lambs and In the Valley of Elah. The Hurt Locker is the first film to break this trend.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker tells the story about Bravo Company, 3 soldiers who specialise in disarming improvised explosive device (IED). They are about to enter into their last month of duty when their team leader is killed and a new one takes his place. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) proves himself to be a highly reckless soldier, but gets praised by his commanders. He ends up in conflict with Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), a more conservative soldier who wants to do his duty and get out of the war alive. The company do grow together, working as a team, and have do to a number of missions together. But both sergeants still differ about their methods and the war has affect everyone involved.<br/><br/>There is no grant plot about stopping evil terrorists or a grant battle; the focus of the film is on the small company, how they interact and how the work affects them. The three main character are very different views on the war, one is a danger junkie, the other a conservative, more natural leader who wants to do his duty and protect the lives of his men and a nervous young kid. The film shows that the Iraq war was a tough urban war where American soldiers do not know who the enemy is. The enemy uses IEDs. The Americans are fighting an invisible enemy and don't know who to truth. The Iraqs/Arabs/Muslims are not portrayed as villains, most are just trying to lead a normal life. The views of the insurgency and the politics of the war are not looked at. The focus of the film is on normal soldiers trying to do their duty. The Americans are neither heroes or villains, and the films looks at many issues within the US army and the psyche of soldiers.<br/><br/>They is a decent script and shot acting from the three leads. They are excellent supporting characters such as Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. The writer, actors and director make you care about what happens about what happens to them. Kathryn Bigelow shows good and bad elements of her direction. She is about to make a tense film which adds to the atmosphere and the character development. They are shot war scenes and she is a skilled action director. You feel what the war could have been like. But her director also reminded me of the direction of Michael Mann and Paul Greengrass with shaky cam and quick camera panning. She uses a hand-held camera and I'm more of a traditionalist on that front. The film was also like the Bourne Supremacy of war films.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a good film, but it is not 5 out 5 like some reviewers would have you believe."
"Cooosh18","8","3","7","13 July 2009"," A beautiful and modest film...
","What do us movie lovers desire? Well, it depends on your mood, but I find for the most part, the answer is intelligence. We desire films with an interesting story as well as something cool to look at. Katheryn Bigelow's new feature brings together all of these pieces to form an extremely well-presented artistic showcase.<br/><br/>It is the story of the Bravo company in the US Army's Explosives Ordnance Disposal division. They are sent to various parts of Baghdad with a simple mission; find the bomb(s) in the area and deal with them. This can mean disarming them, or in some cases, strategically detonating them. The company leader, Sgt. William James, played by Jeremy Renner (SWAT, Dahmer ), seams to have a death wish. He wanders the explosive-filled streets with no regard for his safety, or the safety of his team members. The story is dictated by the number of days left in the Bravo company's rotation through Iraq. The movie begins with longtime teammates Sgt.Sandborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) just praying to survive the antics of Sgt. James for their last 35 days.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner delivers a raw performance, and it is perfectly complimented by Anthony Mackie's own gem. Mackie finally gets away from the corny teen flicks that seem to have plagued this talented actor's career for a long time (We Are Marshall). With the exception of short-lived cameos from Guy Pearce and Ray Fiennes, the cast of B and C-list actors proves that fame is not what defines a performer's talent.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from most war movies is not only the excellent acting, but it's intangibles as well. A truly artistic display of everlasting images and cinematography only add credibility to the already incredibly realistic feel of the movie. The pace of the film is almost tidal, pushing waves of suspense on the audience time after time. Nearly every bomb scene is original and leaves your heart racing. Sgt. James' cockiness might be perceived as unrealistic, but as the audience comes to find out, it fits the character perfectly, and he nudges this film along with every cigarette he smokes.<br/><br/>What most impresses me with the film, is its modesty. The sign of great film-making is what the director, writers, and actors know what the movie needs to be, and don't try to pound it into something its not. If you are expecting shorthanded raids of Iraqi camps with no-look gunfire while Rage Against The Machine plays in the background and every US soldier doing somersaults followed by kill shots, this film is not for you. If you want to watch a suspenseful display of realistic warfare and lasting imagery with all of the politics filtered out, cough up the $10.50. Two nail-bitten thumbs up from Coosh, and come February 2010, you WILL hear about it again."

","This film has a lot going for it. Mostly the directing which was impressive the whole way through. Unfortunately the characters let it down. Although there are several occasions when the character talk about themselves and about being back home I still feel we never truly get to know the characters. Which means we never really care about them, and the fact that the lieutenant doesn't care about his own life doesn't help things one bit.<br/><br/>As for realism etc, I hear its being praised a lot, though I'm not a soldier so I can't comment. I will say that the boys don't seem to have a lot of backup throughout the film. They seem to do an awful lot themselves. But maybe that's just how it is.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I enjoyed this movie, but its not up there with the classics greats. In a way maybe its too close to the fact, as in I feel like I'm reading the daily newspaper. The story seems so familiar, its being played out right now half way across the world. Don't get me wrong, the story of those soldiers deserves to be told and retold, but in the movie it feels a bit non inventive.<br/><br/>The whole film long I got the feeling that there wouldn't be a satisfactory ending and there wasn't. I mean the war isn't over etc, so they keep going where you left them off. This is the major problem, there's a start middle and more middle but this is a film not real life so where's the ending?"

","**This review contains a few major spoilers, so don't read it if you haven't seen the film. Thank you.** I don't understand why people are so fixated about analysing every single detail about a film and calling out faults. As if there's any movie in the history of film that lacks any sort of imperfection. It can't be the perfect reflection of reality, that's why it's called film-making, it's a director's vision, it's done with limited resources, and the filmmakers can't know everything, and they should be allowed to make mistakes. And a few have claimed the film lacks focus and direction. Tell that to the men and women in the army who do this all the time. They don't think what they're doing lacks focus and direction. This story's not supposed to have a regular plot development, it's what they encounter each day of their missions. A new day, a new story. One day can differ greatly from the next. I also didn't find it boring at all. From the very first explosion, i felt what i suppose the men and women in this sort of situation might feel: that it's a matter of life and death, that it means going out there and getting the job done well, or getting blown up in the spot. These characters are faced with the worry of being on the brink of death with each mission, and the three of them deal with that idea differently. That's why Guy Pearce dies five minutes into the film, and why Ralph Fiennes also dies under five minutes of appearing on screen. Bigelow and the filmmakers are telling us that anything can happen, and it will. They will succeed or they will die. That's all you have to take away from this movie. It's not supposed to change the world, or our vision of war. It's supposed to give us a glimpse of what could possibly be going through the soldiers' minds, what drives them to partake in the war. That's what the quote at the beginning of the film refers to. The pacing of the film was fine, in my opinion. i think it goes to show that people have gotten used to war films being all about running around hunting down the enemy, and massive shootouts and huge explosions. I think the film tries to portray the fact that, when you live on the edge, like these men in EOD, it's not about how fast you can go about doing your job, but how well. In this situation, it's not only your life on the line, but the lives of hundreds. It shows us that the army life can be fast-paced one day and very slow the next. Either way, you're on edge all the time. It makes sense. I believe it's one of the best films i've seen. I don't think it's because it's a war film, but because i enjoyed watching this character, crazy and reckless and very good at his job, and not knowing what to expect each time he suited up. I think that was thrilling, albeit a little scary."
"jdkraus","9","5","15","21 December 2009"," A taste of modern-day Iraq through the eyes of our soldiers
","""The Hurt Locker"" has been one of the hardest movies for me to find. It didn't come out to any theaters in my area. Now that it has been nominated for three golden globes, and has received mostly positive reviews, I just had to see it. I finally watched it today, online, and I have to say it was no disappointment. <br/><br/>I really didn't know what to expect from this movie and I'll not that it isn't the typical war movie that's either pro-war or anti-war, nor is it about honor, duty, respect, or isolation and madness. To sum up ""The Hurt Locker"", it is about the modern-day life in Iraq, shown through the eyes of three members of an EOD team. They are put to the test as they spend the remaining 38 days of their ""rotation"" together as they encounter some impossible odds and try not to lose it both from the horrors of war and the tension between each other. I did not recognize many of the actors, which seems fitting, because if an actor like Mel Gibson or Nicholas Cage starred in it, I would expect a full-blown action flick. ""The Hurt Locker"" is not an action movie, but a drama thriller. The film felt more real because of this. Each actor did an impressive job in their roles, never overacting or just blandly reading the script. Jeremy Renner as SSgt. Will James may portray the typical war hero, cocky, hotheaded, and reckless, but even so, his character is not perfect, and as his service in Iraq continues, he becomes vulnerablerealizing he is just a man. Renner displays this wonderfully. I'm surprised he didn't get a golden globe nom. <br/><br/>In addition to the performances, Barry Ackroyd's cinematography is sweeping. He makes the movie in such a way that it almost feels like a documentary made by someone who was actually there. This includes a little bit of the ""shaky camera syndrome"", quick zoom ins and outs, and occasional focus issues. This may seem like sloppy camera work, but it is intentional, and it helps put the viewer right in the center of Baghdad. <br/><br/>I also give kudos for the film editor and sound designers who add in helping make such an intense and realistic film. On top of that, the music, which is seldom, helps out in adding suspense, and is never overdone. Regarding director Kathryn Bigelow, I've not seen much of her work, but she has talent and balls (specifically for the fact that this movie was shot in Jordan, just miles from Iraq) for making such an intense, suspenseful, and gripping war film that is not preachy nor is about a moral lesson. She shows the war as it is in Iraq, which includes the chaos of gun battles, the paranoia and racial tensions between the U.S. soldiers and the innocent Iraqi civilians. <br/><br/>Though I thoroughly enjoy ""The Hurt Locker"", I have to say that it has become a common trend that some director has to do a film about the war in Iraq every single year such as: ""Jarhead"", ""In the valley of Elah"", and ""Stoploss"" to name a few. This movie really isn't anything new. I will honestly not remember this movie for years to come like ""Avatar"" or even ""Inglourious Basterds"". But because this film is so well done in acting, film-making, and pace, I won't damage it's score. 4/4"
"Gordon-11","Null","5","15","9 July 2009"," Lacks suspense and commotion
","This film is about a troop of American army that defuses bombs on the streets of Iraq.<br/><br/>For a war and action drama, the pacing is terribly slow. Watching them defuse a bomb for five minutes, or watching them drink orange juice in the desert for two minutes is just far too long. Poor character development makes me not care about the soldiers. Even though the soldiers are working in extremely dangerous conditions, the film fails to convey the adrenaline rush. They are watched by suspected terrorists, and the bombs might explode any second. However, there is no suspense, no tension and no commotion around these normally adrenaline fueled events. To make it worse, there is no background music to enhance the drama, every scene is silent other than characters talking. I simply felt bored by the static and silence around the characters."
"Tweekums","8","4","11","21 April 2010"," Gripping but not quite what I expected
","I suspect my hopes for this film were raised a little too much by the fact that it had recently won the Oscar against apparently strong competition; as I've yet to see the other films I can't comment on whether that win was deserved though. I did enjoy it although it wasn't quite the realistic depiction of life in a bomb disposal team I was expecting. It grabbed me from the first scene where the character I thought was being set up to be star of the film was killed in an explosion. It turned out the main character was going to be his replacement Sergeant William James; a bomb disposal expert who appears to enjoy the danger of his work a little too much. I could believe it when he was depicted as he seemed to relish his work trying to defuse various bombs but later on when he went out of his base alone and dressed in civvies looking for the person responsible for death of a local boy he had befriended seemed unbelievable as did the scene where he and the other two members of his team split up to search the alleyways near a bomb blast rather than waiting for regular infantry to arrive. Ignoring these faults the film does manage to tell an exciting story where there was a sense that anybody could die.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow did a great job directing and I'm not surprised that she won many awards for this film, she certainly proves that you don't need to be a man to make a very macho film. The cast of mostly unknown (to me) main characters did a fine job, especially Jeremy Renner who played Sgt. James. There are a few star names to be seen but don't expect them to be on screen for long most of them only appear in one scene. While I did enjoy the film I feel it would have been better if it had stuck to looking at Sgt. James addiction to the danger of his job rather than having him seek out situations which would almost certainly not be tolerated in real life."

I would like to see a movie that actually tries to put our military in a positive light...but that will never come out of Hollywood. The closest thing I have seen of late was 'Blackhawk Down' - too bad all the actors had to be Australian. I guess they couldn't find any USA actors who would back our military.

"diac228","8","4","11","5 March 2010"," The Hurt Locker: War Movie + Quality + Tension + Excellent Direction - Accuracy
","Good war movies are hard to come by. Whether it's the political agenda, the abundance of clichés, or just the overkill of violence without consequence, its very hard to truly feel for a war movie. Saving Private Ryan didn't help either by raising the bar to a level that has yet to be even challenged. Spielberg's amazing masterpiece combines uncut violence with heart-thrashing tension, groundbreaking cinematography, and an intense amount of heart and undeniable evidence that war is absolute hell. Since 1998, there hasn't been a single war movie to come even close in terms of quality. However, in 2009 we were dangerously close. <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker was a quiet wartime film that swept away the hearts of critics and quietly became the Oscar favorite in the summertime. Instead of World War 2, the setting was the Iraqi war, which has its share of film clunkers. Instead of focusing on the battlefield, The Hurt Locker focused instead of a group of soldiers hired to prevent bombs from going off and killing innocent civilians. What we have is a decent script, nearly flawlessly directed by an underrated director, with a superb cast of actors involved. While the movie misses the masterpiece ranks by not digging deeper into the human psyche and providing clichés it had avoided in the first two acts, it's a great film that mixes suspense, action, and unbearable tension. <br/><br/>This movie, like previously stated, focuses on a small group of soldiers who are part of the bomb squad. They are in charge of making sure no civilians get hurt with any of the bombs that are sprinkled throughout the country. While the accuracy of the content within the film has been heavily contested and criticized, the movie focuses much less towards the big picture (The war itself) and instead focuses on several smaller incidents that are usually little blurbs in American newspapers everywhere. While you loosely read about a suicide bombing, The Hurt Locker throws you right in the middle of the scenario at hand. This Mark Boal script is a page-turner because of the immense suspense and tension involved, and because it allows you to see just how violence and death affects your average soldier. Boal obviously didn't have experience in the battlefield, but knows how to tell a good story.<br/><br/>Accuracy takes a sidetrip, because this film's strong point is the quiet, unnerving action that slowly ruins the psyche of everyone involved, even if they rise victorious. The acting and directing allows the anxiety to spew its way into the viewers. Jeremy Renner provides an Oscar-worthy performance of a soldier that seems to show no fears of death, but at the same time show signs of pure panic. Renner behaves a certain way with a bomb involved, and behaves another way when in a situation that is not his usual calling. But Anthony Mackie is just as effective as a tough-as-nails soldier that shows his true colors when death stares right back. Oddity of this movie is that the bigger names took the smaller roles, including David Morse and Ralph Fieness. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's film career spans many decades, but had only one hit with Point Break. In The Hurt Locker however, she directs her finest work by stretching many scenes far longer than most directors would dare, turning little situations into extended moments of emotional torture. The sniper scene is the most controversial amongst the critics because of its length and spaghetti western-like pacing. But this scene (like the other troublesome scene involving the main character seeking vengeance) perfectly describes the feelings of the soldiers involved and remains constant with the harsh theme attached: you cannot trust anyone. Every situation has the soldiers pitted in an environment they don't fully know, containing people they know nothing about, as they desperately try to figure out who is a bystander and who is a potential terrorist. The directing is what propels this movie into such high acclaim. If there is someone to thank for the Best Picture nomination, its Bigelow. <br/><br/>Sadly, The Hurt Locker misses the mark because of the final act. The final act has a few of the clichés that it had avoided for so long. If the movie had run a bit less, than it would be amongst the great war classics like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket. While mentioning which ones specifically would lead to potential spoilers, just know that it throws the film off and leads to a rather quick ending. The writing was great, but one would have hoped for a deeper analysis into the minds of the emotionally drained men. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't let that bring you down though, because The Hurt Locker is a superb film with great writing and even better directing. Becoming the second-most tense movie of 2009 (Inglorious Basterds takes the cake) The Hurt Locker combines thrills, emotional chills, and enough suspense to make Hitchcock and Spielberg very proud. It dwells away from the average wartime movie by giving us a look into another type of wartime combat, the one that involves bomb detonating and trying to see who is on your side and who isn't. This is the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and is one of the best flicks of 2009."

","Movie feels a bit like a documentary or made for TV. In Die Hard you may see Bruce Willis trying to avoid or defuse bombs with some action. Here it feels much more like reality, not so much action - more the daytime job of defusing bombs.<br/><br/>Not so much change of scenery, feels like a low budget movie. I felt a bit bored watching it, and wouldn't recommend it unless you like winning Oscar material that doesn't have so much of a story. The movie is a bit like how you could maybe expect life as bomb defuser to be while being stationed in Iraq.<br/><br/>I had no idea it was such a big Oscar candidate when I watched it, the movie seemed a bit ""anonymous"" at the time. Maybe some of point is to feel what the main character feels in the movie, but didn't quite do it for me."
"warthogjump","8","4","11","27 December 2009"," Realistic. Intense. Gut-wrenching!
","The Hurt Locker: a phenomenal war movie depicting the harrowing life of soldiers.<br/><br/>Filled with intense battle sequences which really provides viewers with the 'feel like you're there' perception, jaw dropping moments which build up so much tension and suddenly release it, and with some rather well thought out dialogue, The Hurt Locker is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat while illustrating how dangerous the line of battle is physically and mentally both in a direct and indirect manner.<br/><br/>The lead actor, Jeremy Renner has been receiving some great support for his acting and I must say it is well deserved. Furthermore, Lost's Evangeline Lilly makes a small appearance as the wife who suffers at home inherently due to her husband's 'sickness' of war, which is foreshadowed in the small quote provided at the beginning the film. However, the affects on wives and children are not focused on; rather, the lives of the men at war are given primary attention.<br/><br/>Another neat touch in this fantastic piece of movie-making, I thought, was the use of some decent actors from Hollywood: Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and David Morse each make a minor, albeit a strong appearance throughout the aggressively passionate 2 hours of this movie.<br/><br/>This film has much to offer and I would not be surprised if it got mention at the Oscars as the Golden Globes have recognised it already. I gave this movie an 8, and not higher, because I am naturally biased and this is simply not my 'type of film.' I prefer movies of a different genre; however, I gave this a look because of the good reviews and recognition it was given with some awards. I dare say I am pleased and do agree with the good feedback on The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>I recommend a good viewing of this film unless you are easily disturbed by war and the horrendous side affects of it."

","In the post-invasion of Iraq, three American soldiers from the anti-bomb squad live the tension of the chaotic Baghdad disarming bombs. Their lives are affected by the daily duty, facing the hostility of the invaded people in a devastated country.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is a good drama of war disclosed through the eyes of three American soldiers, living far from their families and country, in a hostile environment. It is so sad to see the cradle of civilization destructed by bombardments and the population oppressed by invaders that have to follow orders and jeopardize their lives and sanity in a foreign country. If their personal lives are so affected having the power, imagine the humiliated Iraqi population living in such unhealthy condition. There are witty lines, like the American soldiers telling that they are friends or James telling that the taxi drive would become an insurgent after the treatment of the soldiers. The contrast in the end, with the lead character Sergeant William James going peacefully with his wife and son to a supermarket while the population of Baghdad lives in the chaos is heartbreaking. The corny scene of the American soldier trying to disarm the bomb is ridiculous. The nomination of this movie, which was released straight-to-video in Brazil, to the Oscar is another joke of the Academy.

","The Hurt Locker is an engrossing tour de force that manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen for its 131 minute run time. The pacing and story, in particular, are fantastic (as supported by the several academy awards it amassed including best picture and best film editing). I would have to consider it up there with cinematic, war-based giants like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>This in-depth look into the lives of members of a bomb-disposal unit in Baghdad is a viscerally exciting and enthralling experience. Unlike many movies nowadays that succumb to the 'repetitive formula' of grand explosions and special effects that many of us have come to expect, The Hurt Locker almost feels more like individual character studies than a war film. The soldiers and their emotions are the central focus amid each battle sequence, with the action used to develop further their characterization rather than trivialize it.<br/><br/>To keep it short, director Kathryn Bigelow effectively immerses the audience with masterful work from cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. Together, they manage to create an atmospheric concoction of perpetual suspense, fear and exhilaration. Masterful performances delivered by Mackie, Renner and Geraghty (as well as some awesome, albeit short-lived performances from Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce). A definite must-see film, one that transcends the norm of the action-driven genre. Absolutely deserved of Best Picture Winner at the 82 Academy Awards (even though, funnily enough, it was actually made in 2008, two years before winning best picture in 2010)."
"sam_smithreview","9","2","4","8 June 2016"," In the year where it was money vs story, story won
","The year where Cameron's Avatar went up against his ex-wife's Hurt locker, was the showdown of Hollywood. Is Big Budget special effects more precious then great story?<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action thriller at once.<br/><br/>The subject matter itself - the work of a bomb expert, possibly one of the most nerve-racking jobs on the planet - yields most of the suspense but Bigelow manages to squeeze out every bit of tension of the premise.<br/><br/>This film to me was very apolitical - though set in Iraq, it is distinguished from most of the Iraq-themed war films in that it concentrates much more on the job itself than the political environment. Iraq seemed more like a backdrop - any other war would do, The Hurt Locker does not preach about this one specifically.<br/><br/>The story is deeply emotional, depicting a thoroughly disturbed individual's life in hell. Jeremy Renner gives an incredibly powerful performance as an EOD officer completely hooked on adrenaline stemming from his everyday close shaves with death.<br/><br/>All aspects of film-making are top-notch, from the brilliantly subversive screenplay through vivid cinematography, masterful directing and perfectly paced editing.<br/><br/>In its storytelling the filmmakers wisely break with traditional Hollywood narrative techniques. There is no clear antagonist, no rising action, no obvious character development and no climax. And yet the film manages to be more interesting, tense and suspenseful than any Hollywood action thriller I've seen in years while making a powerful, yet subtle statement about the insane addiction that is war. Kudos for everyone involved for making this film without compromising."
"john_seater","2","2","4","8 March 2016"," Garbage from beginning to end
","Terrible movie. Essentially a Middle Eastern War Movie on the level of the Dirty Harry series but pretending to depict reality.<br/><br/>The hero is an unlikable rogue member of an Army bomb unit in Iraq. He does nothing by the book. His team members don't trust him. It turns out they have good reason because later he takes them on a wild goose chase and gets one of them seriously wounded and almost captured.<br/><br/>In the middle of the show, we have a long sniper vs. sniper scene, in which the bomb squad is out in the desert disposing of collected IUDs and meets up with some Britishers. They come under fire of some Arab snipers who knock off two of the Britishers. Our heroes have their own telescopic rifle and spotting scope. They casually become snipers themselves and engage the bad guys. Both sets of snipers are really good - a bunch of untrained rag heads and a couple of bomb squad guys. No sniper training in either group. Being a sniper is really easy, right? Just pick up a rifle with a telescope and you can hit anything without knowing anything about adjusting for distance and wind. But what is this scene doing in this movie, which is about the bomb squad's exploits in defusing bombs? I guess the script writers needed some filler.<br/><br/>The bomb defusing scenes are mildly interesting, which is why I gave this show a rating of 2 instead of 1."
"lujani","3","2","4","10 December 2015"," As a feast for the eyes it's amazing not so for our intellect...
","Hollywood likes to glorify war and those that participate in them. Especially those in which the U.S.A has a central role. Recently they have started to produce war movies that are more realistic and that show exactly how ugly and terrible war is for everyone involved. But they are still prone to portray soldiers idealistically and although they do show that these soldiers are imperfect and human, they still portray them as some kind of heroes. <br/><br/>The movie ""The Hurt Locker"" portrays its main character, Sergeant James, as such flawed hero. He personifies all the character attributes and ideas embraced and encouraged by most in the American culture and so the film make known to the spectators that such qualities are the stuff heroes are made of. Such a view is unsafe in that encourages the philosophy that the United States' involvement in these wars is vital and heroic when in most cases the opposite is true.<br/><br/>In the nascence of the movie, Sergeant James is depicted as a brave and a self sufficient man who goes the extra mile in doing his job. These characteristics are highly acknowledge and cultivated in Western culture. For instance in the scene where he first disarms a bomb with his new team, he confronts a haji (insurgent) in a taxi boldly with his gun. Everyone is in an uproar but he gets the taxi to back off when he admonish him. He also uses smoke bombs (without telling his team first) to formulate a diversion and also comes out successful. His teammate, Sanborn, lectures him about how they have to work as a team but James does not listen and does things his way. And again, he has success. This communicates to the audience that James' ""fearlessness"" brings about victory and reinforces the idea that things are done best individually. His team is there with him and help him but the film conveys the feeling that it's really James' individual actions where our focus must be on. <br/><br/>It's no accordance that individualism is subtly (and sometimes not so) shown as something that influences a positive outcome in the counter plot. When there is a second bomb to disarm (a car bomb) James changes the compelling of the crowd once again without consulting them. When he can't find the bomb, Sanborn advises him that they should get out. But James obstinately stays and looks for the bomb. He even turns off communication with his team and for the second time he successfully disarms the bomb. His teammates are miserable with his actions but somehow they do not sound like the voice of reason they should sound like. Instead they come off as not as brave as James. Even if in theory their actions are reasonable and responsible, James is the one who comes off as the hero. When they encounter one of their superiors (Reed) he shows great interest in James and his individual accomplishments. He glorify him as a ""wild man"" and says it as if that's a great thing to be. He does not presents any interest in the other two team members. James' status as a ""wild man"" is portrayed throughout the film as something that brings about positive results and therefore a desirable character trait.<br/><br/>At the termination of the movie, during a suicide bombing, James decides to go off and look for the bombers himself. Sanborn tries to reason with him, saying not to go and that that's not their job, but James does not listen so the team goes haji hunting. James' continuous overlook of team work, of not following rules or protocol, is shown to bring about heroic results. This continues until the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, its James' individual choices that ultimately bring some kind of reward. There is a scene where Sanborn tells him that he does not want to die and admits that he wants a little son. Someone that will really care if he dies. He then asks James if he minds that they can die anytime and James tells him to not think about it. During this emotional talk, there are Iraqi boys throwing stones at them as they pass by in their tank. With this the film cleverly appeals to the audience to feel for these soldiers. We love heroes, fighting for worthy causes and justice. We get the sense that James' and the rest of the soldiers are exactly that and are battling for that.<br/><br/>In the end, where he is talking to his little son, he says that there are very few things that a man loves and that with him it's really one. Cut to him going back to disarming bombs. In that final shot, the camera focuses on his U.S. Army badge and poignant music is played. There he is clearly portrayed as a hero. This ending is clearly aiming towards eliciting a positive emotional response from the audience towards James. He is a hero, who dismiss rules, follows his gut and is fearless. He takes risks and wins (even at the expense of his teammates). He is flawed, yes, but inspiring. <br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" does not really focus on the struggle(the war with Iraq) but on the soldiers. We are not shown the other side's point of view and therefore makes it hard for the audience to really ponder about James' character and his actions. Instead we get another movie where the ""flawed war hero"" almost singlehandedly saves the day. We do not get to feel conflicted about the U.S presence in Iraq but get presented with insurgents and extremists that serve to justify it. ""The Hurt Locker"" fails to be what an exceptional war movie should be: unbiased and able to show both sides of the conflict."
"rakkasanian","2","2","4","10 April 2014"," Complete dreck
","This movie is complete fantasy. It does incredible injustice to any veterans who have actually served in iraq and even more so to any EOD personnel. Jeremy Renner's character was a complete pompous a**, who would've never been put in charge of kitchen patrol, much less a highly trained EOD team. This movie has all the markings of a Hollywood wet dream. A three man team that rides around alone in a Humvee without informing anyone of their status? Pure non-sense. I get that they have to use creative license, but whoever made this obviously has never been there or on any patrols. And of course they portray Jeremy Renner as some sort of war junky that loves putting himself in danger all the time. News flash Hollywood! Veterans aren't all messed up like you want and portray them to be. The worst was the sniper scene. Good God that was terrible. Ralph Fiennes' character, who is a seasoned merc, is killed quickly by snipers while the ""hero"" is somehow able to get a headshot on a rifle that he has probably never used in his life at over 700 meters. Of course most people who reviewed this will probably think this is what it was like over there. Like stupid seals clapping at this ""Action packed"" drivel that wasn't even entertaining, inaccuracies aside. How this movie is rated so high is beyond me. It might entertain the uneducated masses, but it's a slap in the face to anyone who's actually served. Avoid at all costs."
"barnabyrudge","10","2","4","13 January 2014"," Immersive, exhilarating war movie - truly terrific stuff.
","A stunning war film which reflects on the 'drug of war' – that is, the addiction that some soldiers develop towards living on the edge in a combat situation – The Hurt Locker is intense, dynamic and brilliantly handled. Scripter Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski aim for a 'high-anxiety' approach, making virtually every moment of the film raw and visceral. The potential for one of the characters to be blown to smithereens at any given moment hangs over the story throughout, generating non-stop tension. Shot in Jordan, sometimes on locations less than three miles from the Iraq border, the film creates a very immersive and authentic view of the situation in Iraq. Barry Ackroyd's cinematography has a documentary-like feel, using multiple angles to capture the immediacy of the moment. The boiling tension, the paranoia and fear of imminent death, the irrational suspicion that everyone around might be a potential enemy – it's all here, perfectly captured and tapped into with relentless skill for maximum suspense.<br/><br/>The story opens with Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson (Guy Pearce) attempting to defuse an explosive device in a busy Baghdad street. His attempt fails and he is killed when the bomb is triggered by remote control. We then learn that Bravo Company have 38 days left in Iraq before they can go home. Thompson's surviving team members – Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) – are given a new team leader to work alongside for the remainder of their rotation. The new man is experienced battle veteran and bomb disposal expert Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner). The story occasionally 'catches up' with James, Sanborn and Eldridge during selected days of their remaining time in Iraq. It is immediately obvious that there is tension within the team, since James is incredibly reckless as an individual, and frequently risks the life of his comrades in his pursuit of a combat situation 'rush'. Their experiences include defusing several bombs; running into a team of private mercenaries and assisting them in a lengthy gun battle; discovering a warehouse where a child has been mutilated and had a bomb surgically implanted in his chest; and trying to save an Iraqi civilian who has multiple timed explosives padlocked all over his body.<br/><br/>By casting several then-unknown actors as the main characters, Bigelow generates huge tension. We see early on the expected 'stars' of the film (like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes) being killed off relatively soon into their roles, so it becomes very hard to anticipate how, if at all, the more unfamiliar faces will make it to the end of the movie. Renner is especially fine in his role as the maverick life-gambler for whom war is everything – he's far from likable, and can be a real a-hole at times, but seems a remarkably real character one that is genuinely multi-dimensional and true to his own inner workings. What The Hurt Locker achieves above all else is that rarest of combinations in modern- day cinema – intense action and brains. You come away from The Hurt Locker caring, feeling and thinking about what you've seen very much indeed. What must it be like as a soldier serving in such a hostile, alien environment? What must it be like being native to a country and having foreign soldiers armed to the teeth walking down your street? How can you trust anyone when the stakes are so high? Yet how could you live with a mistake if you failed to trust someone you should have? How would you handle being so near to potential death day in, day out? Does the film make you long for the 'drug of war' or desperately afraid of it? Put simply, The Hurt Locker is a masterpiece."

"ProfessorFate","4","2","4","26 November 2011"," Underwhelming and confusing
","WARNING======THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS===== <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker"" is about a US Army bomb disposal crew in Iraq. There's the expectedly tense opening scene in which a crew member gets killed while trying to defuse a bomb. This leads to a new crew member coming on board, Sgt James (Jeremy Renner). Unlike the previous guy, Sgt James is a rebel, a cowboy, a risk taker. He doesn't like to use the robot to first check out potential bomb sites. He prefers to put on the big anti-bomb suit and stroll down there himself and check things out in person. This annoys and scares his crew members.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't provide a lot of structure. The plot is very episodic, with the camera drifting from one situation to another without much exposition. This lack of plot might itself be a plot point – showing how life during war is episodic and unstructured. There's a lot of shaky camera work and the film seems to be trying very hard to look realistic and documentary-like.<br/><br/>The main set pieces of the film are the bomb disarming sequences. They go out in their hum-vee, James finds the bombs, and everybody holds their breath while he assesses the situation and snips a few wires. He finds a bunch of bombs in the trunk of a car, finds one inside a dead body, and even encounters an Iraqi man who is just walking down the street with a bunch of explosives strapped to his body. Iraqi citizens are constantly hanging around, but it's difficult to tell if they're the enemy or just bystanders. Again this might be on purpose, letting the audience experience the uncertainty the soldiers feel every day.<br/><br/>I guess these scenes are tense and unnerving . . . well, maybe for people who don't follow the news from Iraq, or people who have not seen many war films. They didn't do a lot for me.<br/><br/>James and his crew argue. They get drunk and smack each other around when they're off duty. We get the typical scenes of emotional breakdown, how they don't understand why they're fighting, and how civilians can't understand what they're going through.<br/><br/>There's a puzzling scene when they run into a character played by actor Ralph Fiennes and a crew of guys in the desert. Are they soldiers? What are they doing out there? A sniper starts firing at them. Very little is explained.<br/><br/>At one point Renner's character kidnaps an Iraqi man and makes him drive into Bagdad, where he breaks into someone's house while searching for a boy who sold him DVDs. Why did he commit this obvious breach of military etiquette? What does he want from the boy? Who was the guy in the house? Again, very little is explained.<br/><br/>OK, I get it, I get it - soldiers often don't know what's happening during war. Confusion and paranoia reigns. Honestly, I'm not the kind of guy who needs everything spelled out, but this whole movie seems to be a study in ""fill in the blanks for yourself"".<br/><br/>So, this is the Best Picture winner? Really? Personally I'd have chosen ""Precious"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Up In The Air"", or ""Avatar"" over this. It's not a bad movie, it's just not very compelling, or even that interesting. We've seen most of this before, done better, with a bit more flair and clarity. I guess it won because of the ""Bigelow Factor"": the fact that it's a gritty war film directed by a woman. I guess that was Hollywood's ""cause de jour"" in 2008. ""We gotta give an Oscar to a female director!"". She did a pretty good job of directing, I guess, but it's nothing special. ""The Hurt Locker"" left me with one question: ""What's all the fuss?""."
"Eternality","8","2","4","18 May 2011"," The Hurt Locker builds upon the principle of suspense filmmaking and nothing else.
","The action woman is back with The Hurt Locker. Kathryn Bigelow, the director of Point Break (1991) and Strange Days (1995), returns to top form with this critically-acclaimed war picture after the flop of K19: The Widowmaker (2002). Filmed in Jordan, The Hurt Locker is set in Iraq during its recent American invasion a few years back. It follows a team of three U.S soldiers whose daily job is to defuse unexploded bombs or to tackle bomb threats. In this team, there is one specialist who suits up in protective gear and goes right up to the bomb to nullify its threat while his buddies provide defensive cover for him from a distance.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker builds upon the principle of suspense filmmaking and nothing else. The fear of a bomb exploding remains to be one of the most surefire ways to induce queasiness in cinema-goers. Here, Bigelow employs an array of film techniques (some excellent, some flawed) to intensify that fear, cranking the tension to at times unbearable levels. In the opening scene, she shows her action credentials in perhaps the film's most outstanding set-piece – a slow build-up of suspense which accumulates in a massive, heart-thumping explosion.<br/><br/>With such an impressive introduction, it takes a great director to follow-up and maintain the interest of his viewers. Bigelow, however good she is, is not a great filmmaker. She manages to sustain the suspense for most parts, but because of the lack of a driving plot and the overuse of the 'shaky' camera approach, her film becomes less interesting over the course of two hours. Unlike most war films, The Hurt Locker has no story but only a series of chronological accounts of men in endless bomb-threat scenarios. Perhaps the only form of 'narrative sense' that could be observed is that the film intends to show the futility of war through its unpredictability.<br/><br/>How does one preserve his sanity in such a vocation? ""Don't think about it,"" says the lead character James (Jeremy Renner) who has defused more than eight hundred bombs in his career. In a fairly ironic scene late on, James, having had to choose a box cereal for his family, becomes overwhelmed by the sheer number of different brands available on the shelves of the supermarket. For once, he is stunned because he has ample time to make a decision and that he 'thinks about it'. ""Is my decision the best? Did I choose correctly? Hell, I'd rather defuse a bomb than choose a box of cereal!"" his blank stare seems to suggest.<br/><br/>Bigelow's overuse of the 'shaky' camera becomes nauseating after a while, even though it is essential to a certain extent in creating the docu-realism feel which plays a part in the heightening of the suspense. And then there is the use of slow-motion in a couple of shots which look out of place in a film emphasizing on the rules of time and reality. Nevertheless, The Hurt Locker remains to be one of the better action pictures of the year. I foresee possible Oscar nominations for sound mixing and sound editing. Despite its flaws, this is a film to be experienced (however just once) in the theaters.<br/><br/>GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

The scene where our lead character who replaces the bomb guy who was killed in the explosion before almost gets hit by a car is clearly an incident that could've been avoided, because you could see the car clearly speeding down the road and the soldiers who were there didn't even try to stop it because they just popped out after the car drove past even though they had enough time to react when the car came down the road, so our bomb guy is pretty much an open target every time he leaves he's team because all the soldiers are slow, lucky for him having a gun.<br/><br/>3. The sniper scene everyone talks about, the fact that bomb experts suddenly became trained snipers was actually a load of bull, I didn't buy that for a second because I know that snipers and bomb experts are given different training.<br/><br/>After all that the film was an absolute snooze fest, the plot didn't really go anywhere it just floated around and made 2 hours feel like 2 years, the only good things were the explosions and the acting was okay but for something that got the best picture award it was really not that good and is severely over hyped, it also doesn't hold a candle to your classic war films.<br/><br/>With all due respect to Kathryn Bigelow, I thought that NEAR DARK, POINT BREAK and STRANGE DAYS were all good films but this one honestly wasn't."

","The ""hurt locker"" of the title refers presumably both to the painful memories the men will carry around with them for the rest of their lives and to the plastic crate that the first sergeant (Renner) keeps under his bunk, filled with souvenirs of explosive devices he's disarmed over he year's tour of duty in Iraq.<br/><br/>Renner is proud of them. He's disarmed more than 700 IEDs. One of his prize items is a little snap button that blows up the man who pushes it. That takes will power.<br/><br/>The other two men of Bravo Company we get to know are the sergeant next in command of the detail (Mackie) who detests Renner's enthusiasm and bravery as a matter of errant impulse and who has thoughts about killing him. The third member is a grunt (Geraghty) who only wants to stay out of trouble.<br/><br/>The taut script is by Mark Boal and it's quite good. It avoids most of the war-movie clichés. Or, when it uses them, as during a friendly drunken punch out contest between Renner and Mackie, the laughter and grab ass gradually turn purposeful because, after all, Mackie dislikes Renner's reckless spiritedness.<br/><br/>There are few shots of home life. After his tour is finished, Renner goes home to his lovely wife and baby and chops carrots for dinner. Bored, he volunteers for another tour. But nobody dreams of home or talks about it. As far as Sergeant Mackie is concerned, after a piece of shrapnel has missed his neck by an inch, he remarks that ""if I die out here nobody will give a **** except my mother and father but that don't count."" Nobody dies slowly, gasping out a few last words, ""Tell Prudence it was her all the time, ya big lug."" <br/><br/>You know the impression of battle you take away from this film? Not that of soldiers at war, but of police officers in an extremely hostile neighborhood. A soldier is in the center of an empty public square working on a dangerous IED. He's covered by half a dozen men at a distance of about fifty yard, on the streets and on rooftops. But this is the middle of a city. The apartment houses and the tower of a mosque overlook the scene. And, after a few moments of quiet, curious civilians slowly appear on the roofs and balconies. Not many. And not threatening. Or are they? One man is pointing or aiming an object at a soldier. It looks like a video camera and probably is. But then why are the three men on the mosque tower signaling to the camera man, or are they only waving to a friend? Shouldn't you shoot them? Clearly there are enemies. Somebody planted the IEDs. But how do you tell the enemies from the innocent civilians who are waving to friends? <br/><br/>Even outside the city, in the middle of an arid nowhere, the detail exchanges fire at a distance with only four or five insurgents -- or ""hajes"", as the soldiers call them. The pitched battle is small and inconclusive. The only way of telling who ""won"" is by how many men walked away from it.<br/><br/>Nice script. Kathryn Bigelow's direction has some neat touches as well, as when a dust devil casually insinuates itself into a pause in the battle.<br/><br/>But I had a problem with her direction too, and it's getting to be a big one, at least for me. The camera wobbles. It skims and pans and zooms in and out pointlessly. The action is usually confusing enough. For what reason should it be compounded? But Bigelow, while no artist, has an eye for what sells and, the drunken camera work aside, she does a good job. The lens practically caresses the jumbo .50 caliber sniper's rifle. And she lingers over the clumsy task of cleaning bullets of blood from the magazine to prevent jamming.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd call it a gripping movie. For all the time spent with the three principals, we don't really get to know them except for their cardinal traits. Yet it's a decently done film, and instructive as well. It deserves to be seen."
"charlessmith702210","9","2","4","27 December 2010"," A defuser of improvised explosives takes up the difficult challenge
","What had introduced me to ""The Hurt Locker"" was the scene in a former Michael Moore movie, ""Fahrenheit 9-11"", where 2 army personnel inside Iraq try to probe sand to check for an improvised explosive device under a tree, or IED, until suddenly...the device explodes with the two guys being hit by it at near point-blank range! They survive.<br/><br/>And that brave director, Kathryn Bigelow, who got a least one Oscar for ""The Hurt Locker,"" helped to imagine us going deeper into war-torn Iraq, where a step on any bump in the sand or any anomaly in the sand, or if a military vehicle like a Humvee passes under them, means that they could fall into the deadly trap of the newest type of land mines since World War II.<br/><br/>Trailers for ""The Hurt Locker"" focused on a bomb tech (the main character of the film) wearing a designed suit whose job is to defuse those newest and tricky explosives that still make news in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. In ""Armageddon"", we hear the word ""remote detonation"", which literally means you detonate a bomb by remote control (in ""The Hurt Locker"", the bomb tech calls this ""remote det"" for short) and this correlates with the first explosion of ""The Hurt Locker"" when the bomb tech cuts several detonation cords (which in the movie he calls ""det cord"") in a suspected improvised explosive, and then, 100 meters away, a guy holds the remote control in a form of a cell phone in his hand. 3 of the watch-outs who protected the bomb tech quickly realize that he is the initiating system for the bomb. They say to the bad guy, ""Drop the phone! Drop the phone!"", but the guy refuses. The tech hears those audibles and realizes that he has to get out fast...with his gear as heavy as carrying a large backpack already filled up. You probably know that the bomb will blow up and it did....The tech runs, runs, and then, the bad guy presses the button and remote-detonates the bomb and then, Kathryn focuses on the photo speed as the sandy geyser from the detonation ensues....starting at slow speed (probably 4 times), and then to regular speed as the bomb tech gets engulfed by the blast wave and smoke from the explosion. I am wondering why Kathryn keeps slow photo speeds in the film to a minimum.<br/><br/>The scene where a bomb tech tries to defuse a suicide bomber reminds me of a quote from the movie ""Speed."" The suicide bomber, I guess, according to that past movie, has ""enough dynamite in his chest to blow a building in half."" The bomber did not want to set off his explosives and did not wish to die, but he warned the tech...he had a timer. The bomb tech warned his lookouts to set a 75-meter perimeter away from the bomber. The tech saw the timer and regrettably had about 3 minutes to defuse the bombs. He used a bolt cutter to cut some of the locks but because of the case-hardened steel, he could could only cut only one of the locks, and it was too late for the tech. The tech had to let him go and run and let him, regrettably, blow himself up, and he did. I learned a lesson at that point...that sometimes, in defusing bombs, in a few cases, you have to make a tough choice of not defusing when the situation warrants.<br/><br/>The only miss is that the finale--the scene involving the tech and the suicide bomber--had no gradual buildup towards the finale, but I can accept it gracefully, because Iraq can still become a pretty unpredictable place. Overall, I give the movie 3 1/2 stars if I were Roger Ebert."

","Watched the first five minutes: if I ever watch more, I'll add to this. I stopped because of the implausibility of the action. In the opening scene, (a) how did whoever exploded the bomb know that the ""bot"" wagon would break a wheel? (b) why not simply fix the wheel and sent the bot, rather than sending a man who dies (c) when the bomb exploded, why remain standing? dive, prone, with feet facing bomb. Second scene: why don't the soldiers in the apartment simply call or radio the bomb squad? Why do they remain silent until the new Sergeant sticks his head in the door? An overall question: why bother with a bot? Simply shoot at the bags of explosives until they explode."

","When new bomb disposal expert and team leader James shows up, his reckless abandon to his task garners the respect and awe of his comrades, while instilling others with fear and repugnance. James, we realise, is in it for the kicks, regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>If you can come to The Hurt Locker unencumbered by the hype the film carries around like so much over-stuffed baggage, you will enjoy a tense, rambunctious action movie about male bonding in extreme circumstances. There is no polemic here in the style of Green Zone: Iraq just happens to be the war of the moment, but you could just as easily take the theme of male addiction to thrill-seeking and set it in any combat zone. Yes, there is the usual Uncle Sam machismo shamelessly on parade, and the collateral characterisation of Arab characters. This reaches its zenith when one unfortunate local finds himself strapped with a bomb that looks beyond defusing. ""He is a family man with four children"" plead his compatriots. Why is this appeal always favoured by filmmakers? Are single, childless Arab men really so disposable? Still, the patriotic zeal does not smother the film the way it does others (e.g. Black Hawk Down), and the pacing and interpersonal conflicts are enough to keep you hooked from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There are some nice little touches, especially in James ill-fated attachment to a local street kid. Ralph Fiennes and David Morse contribute excellent cameos, and there is a sequence involving cat-and-mouse with a sniper that is as powerful as it is understated.<br/><br/>""War is a Drug"" states the opening title, and the rest of the narrative does little more than elaborate on that theme. Good Hollywood style entertainment, but nothing more."

Don't even try telling me there wasn't some vengeful politicing going on in Bigelow's favor. I didn't see Avatar, because I will not watch that special effects nonsense.

","I usually give 'Academy Award' winning movies a wide birth, just to let the dust settle and the hype to die down. The usual red flag reviews on IMDb of either 1 or 10 out of 10, makes it even more difficult to get your head around. For a start Kathryn Bigelow is a highly accomplished film maker who tends to get very good performances out of her actors. As an action director, you know she is going to deliver some pretty tight, tense scenes (which there are many). Another point (but neither good or bad), is it's neither an 'Anti War Movie' or more importantly anti military; It just depicts the chaos of war and the mayhem it causes. Bomb disposal units throughout history are made up of fearless, heroic men and 'The Hurt Locker' reflects this. On the negative side, military personal (serving in E.O.D squads) say it's completely unrealistic. Personally Iv'e only seen three other pictures, concerning this highly contentious conflict and they (for one reason or another) are all superior. The entertaining 'Three Kings' (1999), The dramatic 'In the Valley of Elah' (2007) and the best of the lot 'Redacted' (of the same year). The latter makes you really question, What the hell were we doing there in the first place!?"

"kaylabibbs","8","0","0","12 September 2019"," Hurt Locker : logos & Ethos
","The Hurt Locker was made in 2008, the director of the film is Kathryn Bigelow. The Hurt Locker is about the war in Iraq, and a new Sergeant is assigned to an army bomb squad. The new Sergeant assigned was put at odds with his crew because he was thinking in a very unique way that did not always agree with everyone on his team.
To begin with, I would say that the stance that this film takes on war is very unique and sends a great message across to the audience. I think that the Hurt Locker is not pro war or anti war, it is something else entirely due to the nature of the film and how it is made. I believe that the film does not show a certain side wither it be pro or anti war. The film creates an atmosphere when watching it of the idea of it being something else entirely. So in a way it showcases and displays what war is and all of the aspects of war. By using the story of a Sergeant who is assigned to the army bomb squad and loves what he does and does it in an eccentric way displays what war does to a person. He displays that everyone has that certain something that makes them special. By using his story the director is showcasing that war is a part of life that cannot be ignored and affects everyone, wither they are in the field or at home. Being able to understand what war is and inform the audience is enough to understand that war has pros and cons that cannot be ignored.
In addition, the film had a lot of words, phrases, language structures, language references, visual rhetoric and cinematography that created a lasting statement of the film and how it is more then just a anti or pro war film. Some words that were used throughout the film that seemed to have meaning were victory, justice, trust, missions, fatal, control, terror, respect, die, reckless, live and specialist. Each of these words have meaning because they were used multiple times so that created an area of interest due to the amount of times that these words were used. These words have meaning because they are devices that are being used to tell a story about war. Such as the words missions, fatal and specialist because they have the most meaning to better help understand war and see that missions are key to making the team survive when the specialist is going in and trying to disarm the bomb. Each time that they use those words they were showcasing their stance on war which is neither pro or anti but it means to display how difficult war is and necessary it is to keep people safe from harm.
Furthermore, some phrases that were used were blaster one, meters, good to go, roger, unknown territory, and Bravo Company. Each of these phrases where used in a unique way that helped tell the story through the directors eyes. They have intense meaning due to the nature of the phrases themselves, since they are all army jargon that cannot be understood by the regular civilian. Such as the meaning behind blaster one, is understood that he is in charge of the blast sight and it also shows his importance to the 'mission'. All of these phrases give us a look into what war is like and how they must fall into command in order to be successful. The language structure is very clear and understanding due to repetition within the film. The language is very structured due to it being a war film and showing the side of the army by using terms that only they know. A lot of the language structure that is used makes the war statements more prominent to the audience. All of the language references are related to patriotism and have relation to the war rhetoric used throughout the film. The references are all army terms such as delta, bravo, roger, unknown territory, blaster one. Some other references that made throughout the film are more relatable to the strength and control of the army.
Therefore, some visual rhetoric that is seen throughout the film is mainly logos and ethos. Logos is seen throughout the film through their mission when disarming the bombs that help the audience better understand both sides of war. The logos is displayed throughout both sides showing the overall meaning by displaying the importance of war and how it can seem to be unavoidable at times. Ethos is present when dealing with the tortured minds of people who deal with war and what seems ethical to them may not seem ethical to normal civilians. This film shows that war can change a person's perception on what is right and what is wrong. Ethos has meaning throughout this film because it shows that pro or anti war, due to the ethics being questioned throughout war itself.
Moreover, the cinematography in the film was very important because it sets up the scenes in a way to better understand them in the audience. It gives the scenes more meaning and worth then others to show the essence of war and how it can effect certain individuals. There are a few prominent shots throughout the film that make it more persuasive toward the idea of war being anti and pro. The main shots used are long shots, medium shots, close up and deep focus. An example of a long shot used was when the film started they used long shots to show the desolate atmosphere and the environment in which the army men live and work. The medium shots displays the men talking together and showing the brotherhood of the army and how they all have to work together to create a cohesive unit. The close ups were used to show the complexities of the bombs that the main character was disabling and the intensity of it. The deep focus was used when the characters were waiting for something to happen and it showed their eyes and nonverbal communication compelling their determination to complete their tasks. It embodied their fatigue that it created on their bodies and minds through this lense. This means and showed that the war aspect can be altered through different cinematography to highlight the more important aspect of war for the audience.
There are a lot of themes that come throughout the film, but the most important themes seemed to be war, friendship, brotherhood, life and death and individual versus the group. The main theme that I think has the most value in this film is individual versus the group due to the nature of war itself. Throughout the film the individual versus the group is displayed visually and verbally. It is shown verbally through the film when the new 'specialist' decided to do things his own way the first time and not really informing the group of how he disarms the bombs and his methods. His individuality was going against the group because the longer he took to disarm the bomb the more time his team was exposed to possible attacks. Visually the 'specialist' makes himself and individual versus the group when he throws off his head set when he is disarming a car bomb because it was distracting to him. While his team was very exposed to a possible attack happening , they see a civilian with a camera and they start making motions toward the team.
Overall, I believe that director is trying to tell the audience that war is very complex and cannot be put into two separate categories of being a pro war film or an anti war film. I believe that she makes it quite clear that she is trying to show a certain side of war to showcase what war is and how if affects the mind and body. Displaying the aspects of war makes it more relatable to civilians because I can see that although war is grueling at times, sometimes it is the only place that certain people feel comfortable. Some economic trends that this film shows is that some people go to war because they do not have a good home life and do not have any other skill set. Others go to war because that is where their skill set is and they know they can contribute more to society at war then at home.
In conclusion, I chose this film because I heard it had great cinematography and is not the same as every other war film and I am inclined to agree. Most war films have a stance wither it he pro war or anti war, and I believe that this film was more about choice and skill set. I think The Hurt Locker is very unique because the main character James, knows that he is meant to help society by disarming bombs and him being at home is no help to anyone. The ending is not your typical war ending because he decided to go back instead of staying home because he knew that he could be of more use at war. This is a great film and I believe that it is neither a pro or anti war, but a display of choice and how war can affect the choices wither it be to stay at war or go home."

I want a war movie to rattle me. The Hurt Locker did just that.<br/><br/>Need I also forget to mention that the film stars Hawkeye and Falcon? Saving the day for the first time.

","Tense and scenario-driven, it's a collection of war stories with loose threads laid between them, much like a military-themed game that pays little attention to the quiet time between set pieces. It's superbly suspenseful; I think that each day in Bravo's rotation builds on the last in satisfying ways, further straining the EOD squad in new ways. I wouldn't call it realistic per se, as the story takes a couple fantasy turns (though not entirely out of the realm of possibility) in the interest of raising the stakes, but there never really seem to be meaningful consequences that follow. None of these guys ever really face condemnation from anyone but each other, and whether or not that's a comment on the lawlessness of foreign military outposts is unclear.<br/><br/>I think it also falters in its emotional beats, as it's presenting a war psychology 101 viewpoint on its impact on the soldier, stating its conclusion before the movie even starts, almost undercutting anything that happens in the next two hours. It's a very enjoyable two hours, but Jeremy Renner's character is an enigma that's already solved. I don't know what I would have preferred in these minimal scenes of downtime, but none of them made me scoff and go, ""War is hell"", because, well, duh.<br/><br/>Bigelow's camerawork is the secret star of the show here, the same style she would go on to use in the equally-intense Detroit. It's all a bit shaky for my taste, but it excels in the meat of this movie. It sells the paranoia and confusion the characters experience in middle of these city squares, as a silent chorus of onlookers watch the before, perhaps expecting the after, as if they're protected by an impervious sheet of plexiglass. At times it almost feels like a horror movie, and every second that goes by without any new information takes a visible toll on the squad, put in a near-impossible position of battling an unseen (or seen?) enemy."

","Overall a good movie but not worthy of winning best picture in my opinion.

","Technically this is a brilliantly made movie, but on a personal level, I don't understand the accolades thrown it's way, especially the Best Picture win at the Oscars. The film is more a string of related vignettes that could have been presented in any chronological order and you'd have the same movie. Maybe that's the point, as day after day, real life soldiers in a combat situation must face either mind numbing, nerve shattering stress or sheer boredom during down time.<br/><br/>The 'war is a drug' theme is what's eventually conceded when Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) is shown home on leave, dutifully cleaning out the gutters of his home and playing with his toddler son. For warriors, the lack of an adrenaline rush is what propels these individuals back into a combat zone leaving loved ones behind to wonder what drives their other half. A similar theme comes through in 2014's ""American Sniper"", although in this one, the destructive effects of James' war service on his marriage is only hinted at, though there is that one scene in which he questions whether he's married or not.<br/><br/>The one scene that threw me was when Sgt. James wound up seeing the young Iraqi 'Beckham' (Christopher Sayegh) after being certain that the boy was already dead. One of the FAQ's on this site answers the question definitively, but I'm sure most viewers would prefer their own interpretation. What would have been interesting at some point might have had Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) confess his demon thoughts about killing James during one of their early missions together. That scene kept intruding on my mind for the rest of the picture, and it might have offered some further insight into how these soldiers approached their impossible jobs."

","'The Hurt Locker' is an engrossing, tense war film focusing on the daily lives and duties of a bomb disposal squad during the Iraq war. This is easily one of the most engaging and suspenseful war films of recent years, down mainly to the high risk tasks the soldiers are undertaking, but also due to the skillful way in which their story is told on screen.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from others in the war genre is its focus on the characters, the personalities and relationship with one another. This has been attempted in some war films before, with varying levels of success, but I thought 'The Hurt Locker' did it as well as any other in the genre. The excellent character development makes the viewing experience even more tense, creating a strong connection between the audience and the characters on screen and making us actually care for what happens to them in the end."

I had such high hopes, but every war movie I've seen has drafted young men, Here, they are all recruited or volunteers and the sympathetic viewer is automatically disarmed from real war cruelty of harm or worse to those who want no part of the war.

For a movie that appears to be going for ""realism"", there were clearly some things that even a non- military person could tell were not believable (the single bullet that ignites a car on fire - as another reviewer mentioned). But the bigger problem with the movie is the story - or lack thereof. I kept waiting to learn more about the characters and why they acted the way they did - never explained. I kept waiting for it all to lead up to a revealing scene to tell me why I spent two hours watching - it never came. This movie has no journey and as far as I could tell no point besides ""war sucks"".

","Director Kathryn Bigelow tried to sell The Hurt Locker as a raw, gritty and above all else realistic look at the war in Iraq. In watching the film the problem with that becomes glaringly obvious. The film is not realistic at all. Bigelow strove for authenticity and missed the mark by a considerable distance. The characters in her story act in ways they simply could not and would not in the real world. Things are presented to us in this film which quite simply could not happen. By the time the main character is taking a solo nighttime sojourn through the streets of Baghdad the film has gone completely off the rails. It's ludicrous. And yet it manages to get even more ludicrous from there. Honestly, this deadly serious war movie ends up being somewhat laughable.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a bomb disposal unit. The danger of their work is made quite clear to us right from the start. Coming in to lead the three-man team is William James and here the movie begins to lose its way. James is a gung-ho, yahoo cowboy type who ignores the rules, unnecessarily putting himself and his team in danger. The kind of guy who, in the real world, would never be given this job. Rightly frustrated to no end by James is his by-the-book comrade JT Sanborn. The third member of the team is the young, impressionable Owen Eldridge who just wants to get out of Iraq alive. The interactions between James, Sanborn and Eldridge are at the heart of the movie. The conflicts which arise between James and Sanborn are quite powerful and compelling. But there's the nagging sense that none of it rings true. No bomb disposal unit would actually operate in the way this team does. No way.<br/><br/>This is a story which you would think would be fraught with tension, a bomb ready to explode at any moment. But you never really feel that. The film moves from one bomb to the next, the tension slowly draining away. It becomes rather repetitive and not particularly entertaining. Once the film really gets going you never get the sense it's going to shock you. And it's a film which could really use a good jolt. Some of the ""action"" sequences are frankly interminable. The film's better moments are really spent away from the ticking bombs, getting to know something about the key characters and what drives them to be the men that they are. Jeremy Renner performs the role of James wonderfully and is ably matched by Anthony Mackie playing Sanborn. And Brian Geraghty, playing Eldridge, has his moments too. These three actors are probably the best thing the film has going for it. The actors are better than the story. The story just isn't believable, by the end downright farcical. The central character of James is a fascinating one. Just not a believable one. With a character it is impossible to buy into at its heart the film was never going to be able to truly succeed. It is a decent film, but one with serious flaws. A film which does not live up to its acclaim."

Taut, suspenseful, and deeply emotional, this authentic war saga vividly depicts the atmosphere of danger, hostility, and complete unpredictability of war, in addition to the bravery, heroism, and camaraderie of soldiers who balance the weight of the task with the pressure to keep their sanity.

"katz009-1","3","3","8","16 March 2010"," really?
","Having seen this film I must say that the only reason it won the top two Academy Awards is very simple, the Academy traditionally does not like to give Best Picture and Best Director to science fiction films and their directors. And the other nominees just didn't cut it so Hurt Locker and Kathryn Bigelow respectively won. The movie doesn't grab you as Kathryn claims it does, I was insanely bored from the very first second. The only reason I gave this movie a 3/10 is for the cinematography. So maybe Bigelow deserves some credit for that, but really, how much?? Jeremy Renner was fine, not great, not terrible, fine. Some people say that this is a very fair and realistic depiction of war versus, say, the dramatized Saving Private Ryan. Don't get me wrong, I love Saving Private Ryan, but the actual storyline is one that would never actually take place. And maybe that's why people love The Hurt Locker, because it seems like it's so true to life. This isn't something I can accurately comment on having never served in the armed forces; just throwing my thoughts out. While on that topic, however, what is happening with that soldier who said the reporter who wrote the screenplay stole his life experiences, his story, about his time in Iraq? I'm interested to see what happens with that. At any rate though, this movie was not deserving of any Academy Awards, and certain not Best Picture and Best Director. And if you've ever seen Kathryn Bigelow in interviews, she has this very cocky attitude, an undeserved sense of accomplishment. Now she has two Oscars that were given to her because she and her film were the lesser of two evils to make her even more obnoxious. All in all, don't see this film, don't waste your money or your time."

","Kathryn Bigelow and Mr. Boal have done a fine job of creating cinematic suspense in their story of 3 members of a bomb squad in the mean streets of war-torn Iraq a year into the US occupation. The scenes involving the defusing of improvised explosive devices are well organized and acted so that you are on the edge of your seat as to whether the protagonists will emerge alive or at least unscathed. You do get the sense of alienation between the US invaders and the native Iraqi population. The Iraqis are depicted as ubiquitous but mysterious onlookers, annoyances interfering with the soldiers' duty, or downright threats. Twice we witness the insolence of individual insurgents who dare to taunt the US soldiers to their faces. We do get the feeling for the chaos, brutality and downright filth of war, and some sense of the toll that war takes on the mental state of the soldiers who are more or less constantly hurling themselves into crazy, life-threatening situations. Sometimes this craziness gets to be too much, leaving the audience wondering what is going on as the lead characters run around dark alleyways screaming frantically at each other. These dark and confusing stretches slow the film's pace and distance the viewer. But one cannot see this film and come out of it thinking that war is glorious, or something to look forward to, and if the filmmakers are to be believed, that was the whole point of their efforts."
"Doddi","7","3","8","9 February 2010"," Good film but very overrated!
","In my opinion, the best two films of 2009 were Inglourious Basterds and Avatar. I saw The Hurt Locker with an open mind, and although I don't like Iraq war movies that much now ... I felt as a film enthusiast that I should see it of course.<br/><br/>I was hugely disappointed because of all the praise and accolades, and it didn't live up to the hype. Clearly this is a much more of a critics movie than public movie, I mean the general movie goer (see ratings on IMDb) prefers films like Avatar or Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>That doesn't say anything about quality, because quality and quantity don't have to go together, even though they sometimes do. I simply couldn't watch The Hurt Locker and be amazed. This was a story of guys defusing bombs, few scenes put together along with one non-defusing bomb seen in the desert. And yeah... the main character's relationship with a young Iraq boy. That relationship was never fully explained or thorough enough for me to care.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is a good actor, but being nominated so much for this role ... beyond my understanding. I couldn't emotionally connect with the story. I felt more excitement in Bigelow's Strange Days, which I also found as a better film.<br/><br/>The film appears to have reached the status of Brokeback Mountain or L.A. Confidential where nobody dared publicly saying: Hey, these are good movies but they aren't that good. (By the way, L.A. Confidential is by far the best movie of those three). And I don't like such statuses ... they put the film on too high pedestal and the fall will be high. Is there something groundbreaking about The Hurt Locker? No. The subject may be a bit different side to the war in Iraq, but still (to me) this is good film about something I'm so tired of.<br/><br/>I can accept that the film has so and so many nominations, and for too many pretentious critics, this is supposed to be the film of the year. But Oscar nominations for Renner and for the music are fantastically strange. And if the film wins (which is very likely) I would dare say that I haven't been so disappointed with the Academy for its choice in a long time."
"Skeptic-8","6","3","8","2 February 2010"," From One Female's Perspective, Tooth-Grindingly Dull
","The Hurt Locker is one of those testosterone-driven movies that seems to have fallen over the sharp edge of the Great Male-Female Divide, landing firmly in man-land. Despite having been directed by a woman, the film offers virtually nothing that women tend to seek in movies: characterization, story, back-story, beauty, visual interest, irony, hope, subtlety, redemption, etc. I'm sure some women will disagree with me, but it is inescapable that nearly all the mainstream, OTT praise has come from male critics. <br/><br/>Instead, IMHO, The Hurt Locker offers unremittingly tense - and eventually tedious - expositions of attempted and successful bomb defusions filmed largely (and nauseatingly) with shaky, hand-held cameras. That's it. That's the whole thing. The characters react to the bomb defusion efforts and each others' reactions to those efforts, and occasionally worry about Iraqi insurgents that may be targeting them. To blow off steam, the soldiers beat each other up. (Really? Perhaps men understand that sort of thing, but women mostly don't get it, and certainly don't think it's entertaining.) All in all, I would never have guessed that a film about exploding ordnance could be so tooth-grindingly dull.<br/><br/>I read that director Kathryn Bigelow based the story on the accounts of a freelance journalist who was embedded in a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, so perhaps what resonates with male viewers is a certain ""authenticity"" of the war experience that is offered by this fictional re- telling. But ""authentic"" does not always equal ""interesting,"" and so it was here. <br/><br/>But that's OK - nothing in the film was entertaining. While the acting was sound and dedicated, the actors were given very little to work with. The high point of actorly expression was a scene in which the two leads had to let flies crawl into their mouths, eyes and noses while lying motionlessly in ambush. That must have taken some grim dedication to the craft.<br/><br/>Had this been a documentary, it might have had resonance based on the unscripted and often chaotic nature of efforts to film reality as it is happening, particularly in a war context. But in case anyone has lost track of this fact, the director set up, shot and approved every scene in this film, and then edited them together. So although it may include kernels of real events, those kernels have been processed as extensively as corn kernels are processed for breakfast cereal, and with the same sub-nutritious result. <br/><br/>And of course, neither the movie nor its characters ever ask the ultimate question, ""What the heck are we doing in Iraq defusing bombs, anyway?"""

","I was expecting to watch this movie and it was going to be littered with tons of cheap thrills and phony sound effects or something to that effect. Because it seems like quite a bit of the war movies I've seen try to take that route, and seeing as this is a movie about an army bomb squad, I was definitely expecting some cheesy moments. This film did not have any! ( of course you will see the arguments on here, of the soldiers uniforms or patches not being a correct match as in reality, but even then....who cares? It's a movie, not an actual documentary.)<br/><br/>The only unrealistic moments I noticed were when the main characters went rogue and stuck their noses where they didn't belong, I mean it could happen, but eh...I don't know. Because the main character in this movie is a loose cannon, and his fellow buddies are trying to keep him in line and they do it very realistically. Although I think the continuous ""wild man"" moves would get him suspended or thrown out. ( but hey, it's the desert and they are at war, people will lose it sometimes, not to mention their group is very small and usually aren't monitored heavily.)<br/><br/>But it's sort of a double edged sword, I think the whole ""loose cannon"" part of the main character makes this movie VERY funny at moments, I mean I was busting out laughing at how he seems to have a death wish several times in the movie! ( like while checking out a car bomb, he goes from dead serious, to out of nowhere just taking off his bomb suit, and just starts kicking at the car and getting physical when the thing is loaded with TONS of explosives, haha.)<br/><br/>It kind of reminded me of my buddy that was in Iraq and some of the crazy things he did like that(without the explosives), so there IS some reality to it per say. I think we all know people that sort of have a death wish in some way, shape or form.<br/><br/>This movie is LOADED with moments of suspense, and it really feels like time is moving slowly during these moments. It's not rushed or ruined by cheap thrills or stupid outcomes what so ever. I think it accurately gets one point across VERY well. In that, it depicts that deep fear or nervousness of sitting next to a bomb trying to remove the charge without being vaporized. Yet you see the main character being extremely calm like a bomb! (no phun intended, ha) It's sort of stressful yet funny how cocky he is during moments like those.<br/><br/>Then later on they may be caught in a small fire fight or something to that extent, so the movie isn't JUST about a bomb squad.<br/><br/>For instance, the sniper firefight scene, that was pretty neat. I won't go into details about it, but I sort of had a problem with how an AK-47 is a match for a Barrett .50 cal at long range. Obviously the 7.62x39 is fairly limited on accuracy and distance. Unless I mistook the AK for a Dragunov?<br/><br/>But other than that, no problems.<br/><br/>It's a great movie, not your typical war movie, this one is slower paced YET suspenseful the entire time just about. They pretty much just go on-call to bomb sites most of the movie, and there is action along the way or in between.<br/><br/>Good movie, 9 out of 10 for realisticness and originality and a different directing style for once!"

The actors are so into their characters that you don't realize they're only playing.<br/><br/>The tension is high and I guess one of the few things you could criticize, is the fact, that the movie is pretty neutral and has not a big Anti-Iraq message. But that would be besides the point. Why does every war movie have to carry a social message like a stamp? This movie has finer, subtler attempts, while trying to convince you, what war is like. And therefor a lot better, than if it were trying hard to be preachy. A movie that has messages, but is more an examination of human behavior under certain circumstances, than anything else."

","The Hurt Locker has a lot going against it. One, it's a modern day war film and if the record shows, these films don't do well at this point in time. Two, it has a no name cast, full of those guys from that movie. Three, how entertaining can a movie be about a guy who disarms bombs. The Hurt Locker is a film that will surprise you on every level.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is the bomb expert, who doesn't like to play by the rules. If course, there is always one of them right? Instead of following orders, he likes to play games, take off his communication device and disrobe of his bomb safety gear. Why? Well, if he is going to die, he wants to die comfortable. His team consists of two men, Anthony Mackie, a by the book soldier who doesn't get along with Renner and Brian Geraghty, a young blood who is afraid of dying. They all seem to get on each others nerves, but to survive they must pull together and act as a team.<br/><br/>The film is intense and gritty. Shot hand held for a lot of the scenes, it puts you right beside the bomb. You feel the sweat and hear the ticking. The scenes themselves are done without music, relying more on the drama at hand told straight. Nothing to help build the emotion and this film doesn't need it. There is impending doom music, which to me sounded a bit like The Joker theme from The Dark Knight, but once we get to the disarming stage, it's just us and the bomb.<br/><br/>At first the film feels like it's going to be repetitive. We disarm a bomb, then we are back at base and chit chat, then we go back out there another day to disarm another bomb. Just when it feels like it becomes predictable, they pull the rug from under our feet. We are given scene of emotional depth and action round-up. Don't think for a second all the intense scenes involve bombs.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed Renner is everything he's done and it's nice to see him front and centre here. He plays the 'wild man' part perfectly. Mackie plays the straight man yearning for more. Both these guys have played men in uniform before. Renner with both Swat and 28 weeks later, Mackie in Eagle Eye. There are a few small roles filled out by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Guy Pearce. Lost fans can see Evangeline Lilly, as Renner's wife. She is given next to nothing in this film and is merely there for more backstory to Renner.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this flick, Bigelow has a hit here. My only complaint is the run time. It's a bit long. There are scenes here and there that could be a lot shorter and seem almost totally out of place, along with some sub-plots that don't always work out. On a whole, this film works and is one of the best of this year."

This film provides a glimpse into the lives of three soldiers that dismantle bombs for a living, a dangerous job inside an already dangerous job. Everything feels real - from the landscape to the way the soldiers talk and the weapons they carry. Consider the way one soldier breathes when wearing a several-pound mask. We, the viewers, have been transported to Iraq yet, unlike the real-life soldiers, we get the opportunity to experience it all from the safety of our own home or our hometown theater.<br/><br/>The you-are-there realism of the movie must be, in large part, contributed to director Kathryn Bigelow, who must surely be up for an Oscar nomination for her work here. She manages to sustain the tension and audience's interest throughout a movie where the same thing essentially happens over and over, albeit with small complications arising each time. While there are some stylized moments, they are far and few in between and she never hesitated to show a scene in its grittiest, most realistic state. Nothing is glossed over and every moment is raw and intense. Much of this is enhanced by the work of Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer that also worked on Paul Greengrass's terrific United 93, and by the music, which is used sparingly throughout the film but is always effective when it does crop up.<br/><br/>Credit must also go to Mark Boal, who co-produced and wrote the screenplay. Boal drew from his own experiences as a journalist in Iraq for the script, and his knowledge of the Iraq War as it is in reality greatly enhances the movie. There is one particular scene that jumps to mind where one of the soldiers is forced to clean blood off ammunition with his own spit so that the blood does not jam the bullets in the gun. It also shows in his portrayal of the soldiers themselves, in the dialogue and the very psychological state of their minds. He depicts them as complex individuals and chooses to focus solely on the way they look at the war, as a lifestyle, never letting politics or ideologies interfere.<br/><br/>Said soldiers would never have been quite as convincing without a talented cast to portray them. According to rumors, Colin Farrell, William Dafoe and Charlize Theron were originally set to star. Kathryn Bigelow later dismissed those rumors, insisting that she had always intended to cast unknowns. While I think the above actors are talented, Bigelow made the right move in using little-known actors. Because we do not see their faces on magazines by the check-out counters in every grocery store, it is easy to believe that these men are actually soldiers; they look like soldiers. As the central protagonist, team leader and adrenaline addict Staff Sergeant William James, Jeremy Renner does a brilliant job and should get, at the very least, Oscar consideration for his performance. He plays James with reckless bravado but just enough sensitivity to allow the audience to feel his character's inner turmoil and struggles. Renner has - justly - garnered magnificent praise for his performance, yet it occasionally overshadows his costars. Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie as Specialist Owen Eldridge and Sergeant JT Sanborn, respectively, both deliver convincing, engaging and often touching performances. While the central characters are all portrayed by unknowns, Bigelow got a couple of more famous actors for cameos. Guy Pearce is Sergeant Matt Thompson, an EOD team leader and James's predecessor, in the opening sequence, and Ralph Fiennes appears as the leader of a team of contracted, British mercenaries. Evangeline Lilly, who is most well-known for her skillful, heartrending portrayal as Kate in ABC's phenomenal, hit-show Lost, shows up in a few short scenes as Will James's wife, Connie. All three do solid jobs, managing to inject their characters with distinctive personalities in the short screen time they are allotted yet never stealing the scene from the main actors as A-listers in cameos often do.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker, visually striking in addition to its expert direction, writing and acting, is arguably the best war movie of this decade. The movie delves in the psyche of the soldiers with unapologetic yet insightful intensity, and the result is best summed up by a phrase in the quote that opens the movie: ""War is a drug."" This is demonstrated most powerfully in the quietest scene of the movie: Staff Sergeant Will James, home from combat, surveys a vast aisle of cereal while at the supermarket with his wife and child. Without any dialogue, Jeremy Renner and Kathryn Bigelow somehow convey the soldier's exact thoughts and feelings to the audience, his sense of ennui with the mundane comforts and simplicity of civilian life after the exhilaration of disarming bombs in Iraq. We feel this with him, and suddenly, we understand. The men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces do not necessarily return to combat because of their patriotism or ideals, but because they cannot figure out how to transition back to normal life, because they are addicted to war - or, perhaps more specifically, the rush that comes with putting your life on the line every day.<br/><br/>In one scene, Specialist Eldridge has a one-on-one conversation with Colonel John Cambridge (played by Christian Camargo), who tries to counsel the younger soldier. Eldridge argues that Cambridge should not be trying to tell him how to feel or how to cope with the stresses of EOD work because you cannot understand what he and his fellow team members go through unless you experience it yourself. Perhaps he is right, that we cannot understand what soldiers do and why unless we physically enter the field of combat. But, with The Hurt Locker, we are at least a step closer."
"PWNYCNY","8","3","8","17 July 2009"," Not light entertainment.
","If you enjoy light entertainment or want something to uplift your spirits, then AVOID this movie. Disarming live unexploded bombs in combat situations is a dangerous, dirty and harrowing experience that calls for iron discipline, nerves of steel and a bravery that is practically limitless, a point that this movie successfully drives home. The problem is that the main soldier assigned to do this risky job in the movie is a loose cannon, someone who is reckless, puts his unit at risk, doesn't follow orders and therefore is someone that the military would not want diffusing bombs. This does not mean that this movie is not good or compelling, because it does offer a riveting story, but it must be watched with the understanding that the military does not allow for mavericks who knowingly place their entire unit at risk, like the main character does in this movie. For instance, if a soldier deliberately cuts himself off from communication with his platoon leader, that soldier would soon hear about it, loud and clear. Also, the action is not placed within a larger context, that is, the action takes place in Iraq but that's about all the audience is told, which may cause one to wonder why soldiers are there in the first place. This would be like watching the B-25s dropping their bombs in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo without knowing why the the United States was at war with Japan or watching Saving Private Ryan without knowing why American soldiers were storming the beach at Normandy. Nevertheless the movie does effectively convey the harrowing and dangerous nature of war and should be shown to persons who are contemplating joining the military."
"Michael Fargo","10","5","17","10 July 2009"," We don't need another hero
","This film rises to the level of ""The Red Badge of Courage"" less in aspiration than in the accumulation of detail. And those details are intricate yet laid before us effortlessly by Kathryn Bigelow. In the blink of an eye we understand the mission of this group of men, what's at risk and the chaos whirling around them. And within 10 minutes the key character enters, and Jeremy Renner grabs the audience by the throat as effortlessly as Bigelow. Renner plays a hot dog who is so hooked on the adrenalin of war, his performance pushes each harrowing sequence by squeezing the audience to one of the most agonizingly suspenseful films of the last decade.<br/><br/>And while the kinetic energy of the film is marked, it's not the film's purpose. Bigelow has bigger fish to fry, and they're not either political nor pacifist. This isn't—by a long shot—an anti-war film. But it even rises above, I think, the director's intentions. War turns out not to even be for the victors. It destroys those on both sides. It kills everything but one: the need to survive and even that is put on the table for debate. Over and over, this small group of men (three superb actors) are called to defuse some type of explosive. We barely see ""the enemy."" We see their weapons which lie in wait for whoever happens to be near when they detonate. It's like something out of Kafka. And we watch these men brought near mental, physical and spiritual breakdown, only to get up and do the same thing again.<br/><br/>The dialog flows so naturally, that while we may have never even heard most of the vocabulary here yet we immediately understand what's going on. Visually, I can't remember a film that is both beautiful, a mise-en-scène that is so complete, beautifully composed but never is either self-conscious or without purpose. Midway, there's an extended sequence with three British soldiers that could be used to teach a master class in film schools: We're thrust into an unknown landscape (as the characters are) and what develops is told with such clarity, it's as if we've been given a map prior to seeing the film.<br/><br/>Since this is fiction, I did worry that some plot device would become too clever, and while that doesn't happen, the end of the film doesn't add to what we've learned long before the conclusion. It wasn't a let down, but I felt the film had achieved its point so successfully, that the director was unaware she had achieved her goal long before the final sequences.<br/><br/>Shot in Jordan, the Middle East looks like Mars. Everything is so alien and no one can communicate with one another because of language barriers. While this isn't any particular political point about our involvement in Iraq, it does point out the grave differences that can exist on two sides of a conflict and how misunderstandings—casual and significant—can perpetuate violence and hatred.<br/><br/>Special mention should be made of the soundtrack, which is very close to the one used in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" It adds an unnerving edge that jibes perfectly with documentary look of the film, combining brilliantly with the sounds of war."

","Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) became the first woman in history to finally win the Academy Award for Best Direction, and a deserved win it was with this traditionally male-dominated genre. Basically, set in the last thirty-eight days of the post-invasion of Iraq in 2004, Sergeant First Class William James (28 Weeks Later's Oscar and BAFTA nominated Jeremy Renner) has become the new leader of the U.S. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team. After the opening sequence with original leader Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (Memento's Guy Pearce), he joins Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) in the Bravo Company in Baghdad. It becomes apparent quite quickly that James doesn't stick to the usual bomb disposal rules, he is a renegade who has thrills himself on both war and danger, regardless for his or others' safety. Sanborn is by the books and trusts others to do as well as him, and Eldridge is insecure constantly worried about making errors that will lead to innocent peoples' deaths, and they can't always see eye to eye with James. Throughout the film James doesn't always think about which wires to cut, he takes off his protection gear, and he helps Sanborn and Edridge kill some enemy soldiers after they killed one or two British soldiers led by Contractor Team Leader (Ralph Fiennes). There are the low moments though, such as finding child Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) dead and with bombs inside him, and James fails to save a man with bombs strapped to him, and he explodes. Eventually the thirty-eight days have passed, Eldridge goes home after being shot in the leg by James, and Sanborn confesses he can't deal with explosive devices disposal anymore, and after a quick reunion with wife Connie (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) and his son, James is back in the war zone for the Delta Company still in bomb disposal. Also starring The Green Mile's David Morse as Colonel Reed and Christian Camargo as Colonel John Cambridge. Bigelow is a perfect director for this film, she has often succeeded in creating the equivalent of a male-driven film in her career. With good casting, even brief appearances by Pearce and Fiennes, and good tense moments without going into red wire/blue wire clichés and political preaching, this is a much more realistic and fantastic wartime action thriller drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Music for Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"C-Younkin","6","6","22","21 June 2009"," Lack of character and story hurt it
","Iraq War films have proved to be box office poison in the past and most have met with varying degrees of critical success. Watching ""The Hurt Locker"", I doubt that there is enough here to warrant much of a commotion. If you're looking for a comparison, much of it will remind you of the second half of ""Full Metal Jacket"". Yes, that's the half that most people call the lackluster one. We're invited to a birds-eye view of what its like on the ground, right in the middle of a war zone, but the limited amount of character development and story hurts it.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty star as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team. Renner is the leader, a cowboy who likes to do things his own way and the other two are his more conservative underlings. As they struggle to reign in the wild man, the men must contend with danger and urban combat at every turn if they want to make it out alive and get home to their families. Guy Pearce (Memento), David Morse (16 Blocks), and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) make brief cameos as superior officers.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow has proved she's the real deal before with ""Point Break"" and ""Strange Days."" She's a good action director who knows how to up the suspense. Action is not this movie's problem. It utilizes an effective use of quiet and Barry Ackroyd's frenzied hand-held cinematography gives the movie a documentary-style approach and feeling that a threat could be just around the corner, on top of a roof, or a couple miles away. And there are lots of gun battles and bomb defussions, something that serves the movie well at first but not as they keep going on and on. Repetition of straight action and not enough scenes where we get to know the characters are the real hurt on Mark Boal's screenplay. The movie clocks in at over 2 hours and staying with it for that long is not the easiest thing to do.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Renner is the one stand-out..Playing a cocky adrenaline junkie who doesn't really fit anywhere but on the battlefield, the actor known for roles in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" and ""SWAT"", hits the performance out of the park. He's very effective, especially in a scene where he stands fully clothed washing off other people's blood. It has the kind of power that the rest of the movie just doesn't have. Had it gone with more scenes like this, ""Hurt Locker"" would have been a much stronger recommendation. As it is, it's hard to see this movie making much of a splash."

","""The Hurt Locker"" lives up to its title. It is all about HURT as we follow a reckless Army Sergeant during a tour of duty in Iraq where he defuses enemy bombs. Director Kathryn Bigelow, whose movies include the superlative vampire movie ""Near Dark"" (1987), the action-packed crime thriller ""Point Break"" (1991), and the unusual sci-fi thriller ""Stranger Days"" (1995), does a bang-up job capturing the atmosphere and characters caught up in Iraq. ""The Hurt Locker"" isn't a beer & pizza movie that will make you laugh. Instead, it is a riveting drama that may make you cry, especially if you have served overseas in the military in the Middle East. At two hours and ten minutes, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a lengthy movie, but Bigelow doesn't squander a second and there is nothing that could have been deleted. Some familiar faces show up for cameo appearance, like Ralph Fiennes as a British contractor sent to defuse bombs.<br/><br/>SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner of ""28 Days Later"") replaces Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce of ""L.A. Confidential"") after he dies trying to neutralize an I.E.D., improvised explosive device, in an Iraq town. Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie of ""Notorious"") does not get along with SSgt. James at first because James likes his job too much and derives an adrenaline thrill from being in dangerous predicaments. Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty of ""Bobby"") does not like the insane risks that James takes. In one scene, after he discovers that a parked car outside the UN building has been booby-trapped with enough explosives to kill everybody within a block, James shucks his 80 pounds of bomb disposal uniform gear and sets out disarming the home-made but ingenious explosives. Colonel Reed (David Morse of ""The Rock"") personally congratulates James for a job well-done and learns that James has disable over 800 bombs. The picture that Bigelow paints about the war in Iraq and the problems that the bomb disposal teams encounter is powerful stuff. At another point, James and company find a human bomb--i.e., a corpse with explosives concealed in its stomach--and James defuses it.<br/><br/>Lead actor Jeremy Renner is a revelation. He has a Steve McQueen presence about him and you believe everything that he does because he does it so well. Writer Mark Boal was an embedded journalist and he wrote the screenplay that pulls no punches and you will no blink if you get engrossed in this taunt melodrama. This independent production was lensed on location in the Middle-Eastern country of Jordan but an American distributor picked it up for an American theatrical release. The closet movie to this that I know about is the 1959 Robert Aldritch helmed saga ""Ten Seconds to Hell"" about defusing bombs in war-torn Germany."

","I was listening to a Dominican radio show about the 2010 Oscars, and the guy was saying that this amazing movie was coming to Dominican Republic (where I was living at the moment); it was a new movie about a Bomb Squad set in Iraq during the U.S. invasion, and blah blah blah...<br/><br/>And I was like: ""wait a minute, I saw that crappy movie on T.V., yeah, I saw it on Cable T.V., I think it was the MGM Channel... is not a new movie, and is completely boring; so I call the Radio Station and the guy gave me the reason, the movie was old, but he kept saying it was a Great movie.<br/><br/>Great what?!!! they must be nuts! What is this movie about? no action, no thriller, no fun stuff... Drama? you're asking me to see drama in a War Movie, in a place where everybody is supposed to be freaked out!!! Another Jar Head piece of crap? C'mon!!! IF you want drama, make a documentary about the impact of the invasion, and why Iraqi people will hate United States people for dozens of generations.<br/><br/>If you are to entertain me, I love the old style good War Action Movie, pure adrenaline, lots of dead bodies, explosions, etc...

Don't get confused, I loved Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Rambo 1 & 2 and 4, The Expendables, Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, Commando, Delta Force, even old stuff like The Battle of Midway, Dirty Dozen, Bridge Over The River Kwai, and others (tens of war/war-situation movies I liked). But this is nothing like those great war flicks; it shares nothing with them, so it is pure crap!"
"ajs-10","9","3","9","30 March 2010"," A really compelling film...
","This film won 6 Oscars, including Best Director for Kathryn Bigelow and Best Film. It has also picked up a further 72 Awards around the world and had 46 nominations. Given that kind of attention, there must be something really good about it, either that, or everything else was really bad. I decided it must be the first option, so I decided to get the DVD and give it a spin. I wasn't disappointed; it's a really good, well made film about the Iraq war. But more of my thoughts later, here's a short summary.<br/><br/>The leader of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit with the U.S. Army's Bravo Company, Staff Sergeant Thompson is killed in the line of duty. With just over a month of their tour to go, the Sergeant is replaced by Sergeant First Class William James. The rest of the team, Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge are not put at ease by their new CO's cavalier attitude to his work. It seems that James, although a very talented explosives expert, is also addicted to the danger. This puts his team on edge and arguments inevitably ensue. Things calm down when they come across a group of men from British private military company in the desert. They have just captured two wanted Iraqis but their vehicle has broken down. Just as the EOD team offer to help they come under fire from insurgents. Three of the British team are killed before the EOD team get it together and manage to neutralise the threat. This brings them closer and back at base they celebrate before the reality of the war hits them again the next day. I won't say any more, don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>I found it a really compelling film to watch. Some great cinematography, the explosions, in particular, looked really impressive. Some great performances too, in particular, Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge. Honourable mentions go to the supporting cast, including, Guy Pearce as Sergeant Matt Thompson, Ralph Fiennes as Contractor Team Leader, David Morse as Colonel Reed and Evangeline Lilly as Connie James.<br/><br/>I'm quite surprised this film didn't do as well at the box office as its critical acclaim might suggest, however I do remember it coming to a local multiplex and only being on show for a week. But over all I really enjoyed this film, it kept you guessing where it was going next but also allowed you to engage with the characters. The, kind of, documentary style put you right in the centre of the action which made it a more exciting experience. Definitely one of the films of 2009 and I recommend it very highly.<br/><br/>My score: 8.7/10"
"EminemLove24","9","3","9","29 March 2010"," ""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortable""
","The Hurt Locker begins with a quote, ""The Rush of Battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" It then carries us through a world not very well known to most Americans. Unlike the average Iraq War film, The Hurt Locker follows men in the EOD Unit. They specialize in bombs and disarming them. The film follows three men, our lead and protagonist, Staff Sergeant William James (played by a magnificent Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn( played by Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). The film quickly catches the audiences undivided attention. With not just the built up suspense and hair raising score, but by our protagonist. The moment we are introduced to Staff Sergeant James, is the moment we like him. A chain smoking, adrenaline junkie, James tends to take the unsafe routes in his missions. Why? Because he can, and most importantly because he is the best at what he does. The film's credit and awards are well worth. Bigelow's camera work is something like Alfred Hitchcock. The suspense within each moment builds, subtly, slowly, almost creeping up on the viewer until you find yourself sitting at the edge of your seat. Like all films it does have subtle flaws. Although we are supposed to feel a connection and liking to all three characters. One cannot help but feel completely annoyed with Eldridge. Throughout the film he complains, moans, and is basically taken care of like an infant by James and Sanborn. Also the film drags on here and there, but for the most part the audience is so engaged, it is hardly noticeable. The most notable aspect of the film, which most would agree, is the outstanding performance by Renner. Unlike most actors who earn nominations and wins for over-dramatic freak out scenes and monologues, Renner's performance captivates in his eyes and subtle ways of saying things. His cocky yet, endearing James is quite frankly one of the best performances put out by an actor in years. By the end of the film, you want him to live and hope to god they don't decide to blow him up, just to get a good cry out of the audience. The Hurt Locker is something of a masterpiece, in a world like now today where films and there plots are unoriginal and dull, The Hurt Locker stands on its own and outshines in aspects that go full circle."

","Is everyone crazy? I think The Hurt Locker was a phenomenal movie. Sure the movie didn't' really have strong story line, and the camera was shaky. But you're all missing the point.<br/><br/>When I watch a movie, the thing I usually look for is emotion. And this movie didn't' fail to capture the real life human emotion of warfare. The shaking camera only made it make me feel like I was there even more. The fact is that I am not one to easily be swayed by a movie. But this movie delivered. The action scenes were full of suspense, the bomb disarming was just intense, and the sadness was, for the first time I've seen in a while, life-like.<br/><br/>Everyone is bagging on this movie because it won six academy awards and Avatar should have won, and I agree on some points. For instance, I don't think for one second that Katherine Biggalow should have won best director, that should have been all Cameron's. But giving it best picture wasn't a bad choice either. When I say this, I feel like I'm alone. But I am willing to stand by what I say.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a perfect movie (because it's not) because there are flaws. But just such a great performance by the actors was all I needed to give this movie what I gave it. 8.5/10"
"Hitchcoc","9","3","9","23 February 2010"," An Amazingly Intense Two Hours!
","I think that some of the critics are missing the point in this film. Many Iraqi vets have responded negatively. I'm sure there are some serious inaccuracies in military protocol and day to day activity. However, take any movie that involves a particular profession or walk of life, analyze it, and it will fall apart. Take police films, for instance. I have a police officer friend who has been on the force for 20 years. He's never had to fire his gun. Most police officers seldom use their weapons. That's why it's so hard on them when they need to face a gunman. Still, the police in many of our best movies use their guns like they use their flashlights. If Dirty Harry were real, he would have lasted about a week on the police force. Does that diminish the effect of the film? We suspend the disbelief for films. This is more than a movie about Iraq. It's a movie about a man who is devoted to the adrenaline rush, a man for whom pure danger rules his life. He is wired for violence and the need to face death at every turn. The people around him are frightened to death because this guy has no sense of order. He is loose cannon and those around him should have run for the hills, but the honor code keeps them there. <br/><br/>This movie has tense scene after tense scene, centered around the next explosive device. It also has a character who can't relate to other people except in the most violent way. He pulls it back every so often, but eventually returns to his own demons. It also has a surreal element like ""Apocalypse Now."" At times there is a dreamy sense that hovers in the heat of the desert. There is a scene where he has gone to the home of a boy whose body was booby trapped with explosives. When he runs through the streets, we can see that he is out of place with time and space. It has those same eerie qualities. As for the aforementioned ""Apocalypse Now,"" it was not a realistic movie either, but it was great because it drew from the fear and terror of war. For people who have seen this war, you have been through things that we civilians can't imagine, but remember that despite certain details being out of joint, it still portrays the horrors of war. The main character is almost metaphysical in a sense as he walks in that suit toward another potential death scene."
"dromasca","8","3","9","8 February 2010"," playing dices with fate
","William James (acted by Oscar candidate for best lead role Jeremy Renner) is a character that is hard to forget. He is a soldier whose expertise is to defuse bombs. He played dices with fate more than 800 times and won each time. When he enters a bomb threat scene he walks directly to the target, with the sure straight walk of an American hero. His enthusiastic commander officers believe that he does 'hot sh.t' and congratulate him. His soldier fellows think that he is crazy and that he endangers himself and the other carelessly. When asked how he does it he shrugs and just says 'I try to be careful and stay alive'.<br/><br/>William James is different from his fellow soldiers. Those are not heroes. They are just normal people, young men doing their tour of duty in Iraq, counting back the days to the end of the tour, and hoping that they will survive it. They are professional, well trained, but not heroes, and they work in a hostile and paranoiac reality, facing a country and a culture that they do not understand. Every civilian can be a terrorist, shooting can start from behind any sand dune or from around street corner, any bag, any car, any corpse can hide a bomb, any situation can escalate into violence.<br/><br/>The situations in the film are not totally new for those who have seen previous films about the Middle East conflict, and especially the Israeli films 'Beaufort' and 'Lebanon'. As in 'Beaufort' the soldiers are equipped with all possible armors and technical gadgets that make them superior militarily, but their superiority is apparent, as victory is not at hand because the reality around does not allow for military victory. They look as aliens in a hostile world. Same as in 'Lebanon' most of the soldiers are disoriented, cannot find the familiar milestones in a reality that speaks and behaves differently than the logic of their human experience.'Hurt Locker' is 'Beaufort' and 'Lebanon' re-written and directed with the skills of a Hollywood professional.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in director Kathryn Bigelow's film puts the hero in the situation of trying to find the parents or relative of an Iraqi teenager killed by rebels, and whose body was bobby-trapped with explosives. In a typical Hollywood movie hero gesture he tries to find ways to tell the story of his death. Iraq does not behave however according to the classic film rules, the tentative turns into misunderstanding and almost ends in tragedy, and only a hysterical escape of the armed soldier hero saves his life. Dialog seems impossible, human relations are poisoned by the hate and mistrust injected by the political situation.<br/><br/>Do we get to understand the motivation of the character? Actually never. The invincible hero has a family and a life that expects him after the tour of duty. When he is back home his wife does not understand his war stories and would rather have him slice the vegetables and fix the roof, and his kid does not really know him. His only thrill has become the war, actually an addiction, the addiction of playing dices with fate. We never get an explanation of the hero's personal evolution in this strong and subtle anti-war movie . His tragedy started long before the action of the film starts. He is a victim of war as all the other.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for the Best Film Oscar. If there was any cinema justice on Earth 'Hurt Locker' should win rather than 'Avatar'. Yet, I do not think that it holds any chance in the competition with a film that made maybe one hundred times the money."

That made parts of the movie drag, I know I did check my watch at least twice and wondered when it would be over. It seemed like your typical war movie storyline (those for some reason don't change much) and I didn't feel like, as the viewer, I got enough background on our characters to really care about what they were doing.

","There is a misunderstanding than having a message is 3/4 of the entire product. In most situations, engaged and intelligent audiences expect some type of emotional link to the theme in the movie. Most of us love recommendations, and many a film has benefited from incredible word of mouth when it had been previously dismissed or ignored by either critics or studios, and many classics were born. In fact, this is a situation that occurs more often than one realizes. Movies like ""The Breakfast Club"" are proof of that. The problem is when the opposite occurs and suddenly the hype is so intense that one can't help but feeling confused as to what could be missing from what the screen shows.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locket"" has some impressive scenes, some camera-work that a few would believe resembles cinema verite, more documentary style than feature presentation. There is also a very impressive performance by the lead actor, who should be credited with doing wonders with his limited screenplay, one that demands too much from an audience, who seems to be disconnected from the drama in the screen, full of shocking situations, but so devoid of emotion and drama. For a while, I was wondering if it was because there is so little depiction of non military faces; most of the times the camera was focused on the soldiers, and true, most of the perspective should be theirs, but it is like having a good piece of steak without any good seasoning.<br/><br/>We're literally bombarded with horrifying situation after situation, but we never leave our state of numbness. Here is selfishly addicted human being who seeks instant highs from a job that many would rather die than perform. In fact, I think in the end that might be the message of the film, that it is all irrational, and that people like the central figure of the film is what perpetuates the tragic conflicts.<br/><br/>We have suicide sacrifices, night holocausts, one of the dullest chases in history, a face off with a mysterious taxi driver. All of these intense moments fail, and one is only disturbed when the camera strays from the soldiers and takes a quick glance at those people who might be the most dangerous element of all. This is where the movie flounders, when there is so little emphasis on showing the two sides of the mix. One just doesn't work without the other.<br/><br/>There are some very effective moments, one of them has our antihero facing a DVD salesman, and it is an opportunity that is not fully utilized because once again because we really never know what his involvement might have been. In fact, as he departs the story, we get into a household, and tension skyrockets because we finally have a potential exchange of points of view, and it all degenerates into a comical escape from an upset housewife.<br/><br/>This is a film so out of kilter that it is the quiet moments that impact the most and will probably be the ones we will remember. We know war is irrational, that it might lead to even worse outcomes than most believe, but we have seen enough of the violence, the hardware, the testosterone moments before. This is like having a perfectly good musical piece ruined because someone believes that having every possible instrument play simultaneously will make a bigger impact. It is not the case. There has to be a balance, and the only thing hurting at the end of this film is the fact our intelligence has been insulted again by a group of people who can't see beyond the fog, the dust, or hear anything beyond the noise. Go back and see what the best moments were in war films, those when the noise disappeared and we looked straight into the eyes of those who were in hell. Screaming never made anyone feel, it just made us look."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","9","27 July 2009"," The first great film to address the perils of modern war
","Though there have been a few attempts to quickly turn over a good film about the Iraq War or a similar conflict (""The Lucky Ones,"" ""In the Valley of Elah,"" ""Jarhead,"" ""The Kingdom""), none achieve on so many levels and try to capture the true experience of today's soldiers like ""The Hurt Locker.""<br/><br/>Former embedded journalist Mark Boal (who wrote the story for ""Elah"") captures the spirit of this particular war with his story about a team of bomb diffusers who work with IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). The story mainly focuses on one bomb specialist, Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner), who enters the picture after the team's beloved Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce) dies on the job. James is highly skilled, but also totes an action junkie attitude that creates tension between him and his fellow squad members.<br/><br/>What will unfortunately surprise a lot of people watching this film is its director, Kathryn Bigelow. If you have any doubts of a woman's ability to make a Grade A action film than throw them out the window. Bigelow, who also directed action cult favorite ""Point Break"" and the okay film ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" paves the way for women action directors with this excellent film. She sets a precedent for what today's war film should look like with the raw, camcorder style that gives ""Hurt Locker"" its realistic, documentary feel. Screw the awing cinematography of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the Iraq War is not to be glorified by the camera in any way, especially considering it's still going on.<br/><br/>Other war films dabble in the glory of war, the traumatic effects it has on its soldiers and its many other evils, but ""Hurt Locker"" dares to consider the temptations, the allure of war despite its disastrous affects. Its main character, James, is certainly troubled, but not because of seeing death or risking it every time he tries to diffuse a homemade C4 bomb -- it's because he needs the adrenaline rush of feeling like he's doing something dangerous and important.<br/><br/>To Bigelow, that is the defining characteristic of this war and James embodies it. He alone at times is the sole cause of action and tension in the film. We think to ourselves that he's in a dangerous situation with a bomb threat -- then he takes his protective suit off and the intensity is magnified. In that way, Bigelow plays off our own desire to see action and suspense. It would be a whole lot nicer if the guys stayed out of trouble considering they're set to be sent home in less than a month's time, but it wouldn't be exciting. James mirrors our own action fetishism in that way, and herein lies the film's true excellence.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is an interesting film and the first originally poignant piece of cinema to be attached to the Iraq War in a way that makes a statement that films embodying Vietnam or World War II haven't already made. It's unknown cast is talented and helps keep the film much more realistic. There's something about seeing actors that are too well known in war films that instantly glamorizes it and detracts from its impact. <br/><br/>To boot, there's a lot of great suspense and action. Scenes where nothing ultimately happens put us on the edge of our seats because they're well set-up. The soldiers' paranoia among other things translates well to an audience unaware of the true dangers of the Iraq War and highlights what makes this time significant in our history compared to any other. This is the kind of movie that could be used as a means of understanding the Iraq War years and years from now, especially in terms of grasping the perspective we had before it was even over."
"Superunknovvn","7","3","9","29 June 2009"," The ""SAW"" of war movies
","Please bear with me, when I say that this is the ""SAW"" of the anti war movie genre. It doesn't mean that ""The Hurt Locker"" has a lot of explicit violence (only some), but that it constantly attacks your nerves. There is almost no moment of peace in the entire two hour movie. Accordingly you leave the theatre exhausted or you just snap out of the story halfway through because it is just too much. At the showing that I just came home from a guy in the front row fell asleep and started snoring so loudly, the whole theatre could hear him. Two guys next to me left the cinema saying that they found the movie boring. I don't think it is boring. It's just relentless, never allowing the story to calm down now and then.<br/><br/>Mark Boal, the screenwriter, is a journalist who supposedly took a pretty neutral stance in his articles about the Iraq war. (This information was given to the audience by the guy who introduced the movie). Now, I find that a bit surprising, because ""The Hurt Locker"" isn't really that neutral in its outlook. Sure, it probably strives to be a realistic depiction of the constant physical and emotional pressure of being in the U.S. Army's bomb squad, but we only ever see the American side of things. The American soldiers, all of whom are the best of people with the best intentions - the lead character fulfilling the old John Wayne-cliché again (and having him ""break down"" once or twice doesn't change a thing about that). Whenever an Iraqi shows up, he's a terrorist or at least a threat. I am aware that this, too, is a reality for an American soldier, but STILL... for a depiction of reality, this movie relies too much on theatrical moments, some out-of-place one liners and clichés. <br/><br/>Still, ""The Hurt Locker"" is properly unsettling. It makes you feel the constant paranoia of being in the war zone. The cast is good (especially Jeremy Renner in the lead) and so is the score. Whereas the pictures and the pacing are ""in your face"" (quite literally actually, we mostly see the characters in extreme close-up, which adds to the tense atmosphere), the score is almost play-like. That makes for a nice contrast. If the action on screen is about the here and now, the apocalyptic score transmutes certain moments into scenes that show the eternal madness of man killing his own.<br/><br/>Those are the moments when ""The Hurt Locker"" works best. However, it hurts the movie that we're only shown the American side of things. We only see the American soldiers who try their best, but are broken by the war. That may be one aspect of this horrible situation, but it's either blue-eyed or ignorant to make this the only point of your film."
"3xHCCH","6","3","9","24 June 2009"," Gritty and Realistic
","I got interested in this movie because of rave reviews I read in the Internet. It is a story of an American bomb disposal unit on tour of duty in Iraq. The film just follows their day to day activities and missions there. You see the squalor and violence of life in Iraq after the American occupation. You see the thanklessness and the uselessness of this war for the citizens of Iraq and the American troops stationed over there. You see everything as if it was real thing, as if this was a documentary. Everything was very gritty and realistic.<br/><br/>There were many suspenseful situations of bomb disposal. You do not know which ones will be successful and which one won't, leading to very intense moments. The soundtrack music and the rough camera work contribute immensely to the tension and drama. We the audience are transported there with the soldiers in Iraq, it seems to be.<br/><br/>The unknown lead actors contribute to the realism. They looked and acted like real soldiers. This is most specially true with Jeremy Renner (whom I have never seen before), who played the bomb specialist James with so much immersion you would think he is the real thing. I do not really know why they decided to interrupt the realism with occasional star cameos (from Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly). <br/><br/>I do not really know what a ""hurt locker"" is, and I still do not exactly. But I guess it means how the hurtful experiences of war will forever be locked into the very beings of the people caught up in it. A final surprise for me came at the end as I found out that this very macho film was assuredly directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow. Fans of war movies will definitely want to watch this film."
"steinertorscot","7","3","9","6 April 2009"," a vivid portrayal of... war-like situations
","Hurt Locker comes storming out of the gates, portrayed by its trailer as a hard-hitting, rock music fueled, action packed war flick about men and bombs. Unfortunately, like many films that don't fit neatly into a specific genre, Hurt Locker will leave many perplexed and disappointed, thanks to the inflexibility of movie marketing. It's time that film creators be given full control of their promo reels.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Hurt Locker is indeed a war movie, with nearly the entirety of the footage taking place within theatre (of war). Shot in Jordan, the scenery and environments are spot on, from barren desert-scape's to dense adobe urban settings. The camera work is varied, distance, stability, speed, motion, and focus are all played with at different times in the film to better and worse effect. The soundtrack is sparse, with mostly on-screen music heard, which adds to the viewer's sense of immersion into the character's colorless, sun bleached world.<br/><br/>Noteworthy is that the Jordanian military provided security during the filming of the movie. Jeremy Renner was quoted describing ""two by fours with nails being dropped from two-story buildings that hit me in the helmet and they were throwing rocks... we got shot at a few times while we were filming"". On this evidence, I wouldn't be surprised if the seemingly inept Jordanian soldiers were also contracted as military advisor's based on some of the scenes in the movie (more on that later).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Hurt Locker gets on my bad side immediately by killing off Guy Pearce, which had me hoping that the rest of the film would be told in a past tense narrative. No luck. Replacing Pierce is Renner's easy going, thrill seeking Sgt James. Renner does a good job in the role portraying the character's depth and inner turmoil... but for some reason stops smoking mid way through the film, which really bugged me, that post bomb diffusing ""I'm not dead yet"" cigarette looked epically enjoyable. The observant reader will notice that I am in the midst of quitting.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a mixed bag, the black Sergeant goes through a lot of transitions in the film, some of which come out of nowhere (pondering blowing up Sgt James), and we are denied a view of how the knowledge gained in Iraq affects him later, but the part is acted very well. Ralph Fiennes shows up to get shot (almost as frustrating as Pearce's death). The annoyingly reliant specialist and his doting medical colonel left me wondering if there were even one testicle between the two characters. Opinions on the characters aside, the acting was solid.<br/><br/>One factor that will divide many viewers is the way in which the war fighting/bomb dealings are depicted in the film. Those with military knowledge will scoff, those not focused on such details will (hopefully) not be distracted by many of the sometimes inexplicable lapses in logic and physics. The mercenary/sniper scene stands out as being particularly frustrating.<br/><br/>On that point, I really wish I could turn off that part of my brain that just can't get into a scene once the technical military/firearm stuff begins making no sense. I know that many similarly affected miss the simple pleasure of unquestionably cheering the hero and their 30-round magazine that supplies a seemingly endless hail of fire, or believing in the enemy that manages 3 one-shot kills in quick succession and then... knocks the scope off of their rifle? Looses their vision? Decided to take a nap? Was is tea time? Oh wait, nope, bad writing/lack of advisory... that's it. Pity the soldier for this bizarre cinematic handicap.<br/><br/>All in all a very solid film, it will test the patience of some as the pacing varies, and also is much stronger at the beginning and ending then in the middle. Good acting performances, some weak peripheral characters, and satisfyingly not preachy or opinionated on the war. See it for Jeremy Renner's performance, a solid showing.<br/><br/>That's a wrap on my first IMDb review! Happy viewing!"

A few American soldiers are in the middle east fighting the Iraq war or some crap, one guy is a bomb disarmer and the rest are just foot soldiers.

","I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. I am often one for being irritated by inaccuracies and inconsistencies in films and television. Yes this film wasn't 100% viable or accurate to military protocol and yes there wasn't a big exciting Hollywood storyline, or whatever people are slating it for. But I think a lot of people are forgetting that fundamentally it is a film. It made me feel very tense, excited, empathetic, saddened and angry. Very rarely does a film make me feel such a wide variety of strong emotions. All of my (opposing) political views were put to one side and I felt a genuine, human connection with the characters. I find this film reminiscent of Jarhead but different enough to stand on it's own merits. As I said in the title of this review, don't let other peoples opinions stop you from watching this.

","I bought this film thinking it would be a reasonably balanced view of what it might be like to be out in Iraq fighting a guerilla war.

I was appalled at the insensitivity in this film. I have travelled in the Middle East and I find it quite insulting that the Muslims are portrayed as murdering barbarians who cannot be trusted, have no morality, and are only self-satisfying merchants of death. It is well known amongst independent travellers to the region of the Middle East that the peoples of that land are amongst the most generous, honest, sensitive and loving cultures, and I as a white British man (of 38 years of age) would like to say that this film is typical of the the unthinking victim of the politics of fear.<br/><br/>This makes me sad."

","At the time I am posting this review America is in the middle of a war in Iraq. Despite it being a very large subject there have not been many war movies about Iraq. Now a film has stepped up to the plate to hit a homerun. This movie deserves to have its name attached to classic war films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". Years into the future I imagine that this will be excepted as a classic. First off the cinematography is gorgeous. My favorite scene is when they go to an area where a bomb went off. The cinematography is simply breathtaking in those moments. Then we have some very well written dialogue. You'll also find yourself laughing every once in a while too. Then there is some great characters. Character development is very strong here. You really like these characters, and you don't want to see them get hurt. The best thing about the movie though is the powerful emotion of how war can be addicting. That is what makes this film so great.

"mnpollio","5","2","5","20 September 2010"," Underwhelming and empty exercise
","Despite the critical accolades showered on this film, it seems hard to take its Best Picture Oscar seriously in light of its amazing competition - pretty much all of which succeeded far better in their respective goals. I had the pleasure (or displeasure) to watch the film with my cousin - an Afghanistan and Iraq War veteran. He was already picking apart the film's much-heralded ""authenticity"" before the first 30 minutes were up and stalked out in a huff after 1.25 hour never to return. Some of the errors I would not have noted without him; others were so glaring that the viewer would need to be headless to overlook the illogic. Given that this film's ""realism"" was one of the trumps critics and fans were citing, it was a bit of a surprise that such could be so easily dismissed. The story - such as it is - focuses on an EOD team in Iraq having to contend with reckless loose cannon Jeremy Renner. Renner is quite good in the role - the writing and the film itself are not up his level. Much ink has been spilled about Kathryn Bigelow becoming the first Oscar-winning female director. I think this moment should have come sooner, but not with Bigelow. From the start, critics have invented superlatives to describe Bigelow's resume, but I thought she was a hack when she made the cult film Near Dark and her subsequent entries like Strange Days, Point Break, K-19:The Widowmaker, etc., have not changed my opinion. She combines all of the worst aspects of macho-man male directors without any mitigating factors. It is not a compliment to say that any of Bigelow's films - including this one - could have been made by a run-of-the-mill male action director. Bigelow consistently sacrifices logic and coherence for the next big bang or money shot. Arguably, my biggest annoyance is what is missing from the film. Agree or disagree on the Iraq War, but no one can dispute that it is one of the most controversial political events in U.S. history. A pre-emptive war initiated by the U.S. on trumped up evidence against a country that posed no legitimate threat and which repercussions are still thundering throughout the U.S. and the Mid-East. A really amazing film could (and should) be made on exploring such fall-out. How ironic then that the first award-winning film to set itself during the war has absolutely no view on it whatsoever. The characters we meet have little to contribute on what or who they are fighting. It is little more than a glorified testosterone-fueled action film with nothing to say about much of anything. Unless, of course, one takes a cynical approach and assumes that Bigelow and company's point is that we should thank goodness for endless warfare or else what would men like Renner's character - who are ill-suited for either family life or contributing to peaceful society on a daily basis - possibly have to do with themselves. Strangely that does seem to be the theme of her film and it is as disheartening and wearisome as her direction. One also trembles to think that now that Bigelow has made such an uncontroversial film on such a controversial subject and given the approach such cache, how many directors will now inundate us with films set in the Iraq War (a la Vietnam) that will also have absolutely nothing of interest to say?"
"mcw2112","5","2","5","26 April 2010"," This thing beat Avatar? Not in my book!
","I truly wanted to love this film, but alas, 'twas not to be. Not to get off on a tangent, but the fact that this film beat James Cameron's Avatar simply boggles the mind. It had to be some kind of political force to make that happen.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a tedious, unrealistic and plodding film about an EOD (bomb squad) team in Iraq. According to this film, these squads work completely independent of the rest of the military, make up their own missions and don't really answer to anyone for foolhardy, illogical actions in the field. Simple common sense was thrown out the window at nearly every turn in this movie and the characters did the stupidest, most irrational things that defied explanation. This was not a true testament to the men and women who serve the United States in a military capacity.<br/><br/>The story, if you can call it that, revolves around three members of the EOD team: Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), an adrenalin junkie cowboy, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), a by-the-book man that keeps his emotions in check at all times, and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) a rookie who constantly looks to his superiors for guidance and is obsessed with death. We follow these three men on mission after mission, trying to discern what the hell is going as we look on through the myopic lens of the almighty shaky-cam, a little cinematic trick to try to make things look edgier and more realistic; this is a trick I grew tired of long ago. There was just too damn much camera movement and too many nauseating close-ups for my taste. I felt like I was watching Hancock all over again - but without the entertainment value. The loose excuse for a plot leaves us meandering through one tense little situation after another until the tension was non-existent and I just didn't care anymore - not that I cared to begin with. The characters are all stock cliché's and the development of those cardboard cutouts was practically nowhere to be seen. They just were.<br/><br/>The entire film boiled down to the main character, Sergeant James, being ridiculously foolish and being completely dismissive of the guidelines for his job. He had no problem putting his team into unnecessarily dangerous situations just to fuel his own needs for...whatever his need were. His was uncharacteristically nonmilitary in his thinking and seemed to care only about himself. Military men do not think that way, and if they did, wars would be a lot shorter and much more bloodier.<br/><br/>There were some glaring inaccuracies regarding the way in which the military functions and these guys would have been court-martialed on a daily basis. Other reviewers have covered the worst problems with this film but I'll just repeat that there didn't really seem to be any direction to their missions and things just seemed to happen. The actors all did fine jobs, but I implore anyone who wants to watch this film to not think that this is how the military really is. 'Cause it just ain't so. My grade: D"

","For a film that has won 6 Oscars, 73 other awards and had 47 other nominations for its realistic portrayal of an EOD team stationed in Iraq, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is the most outrageously hypocritical Hollywood Hokum produced in the past decade. <br/><br/>Not only does The Hurt Locker frequently insult the intelligence of the viewer with its extreme sensationalism, but also insults the intelligence of GI's and even – somehow - terrorists. <br/><br/>The insult to Iraqi civilians is more complex. For the majority of the movie the civilians are totally ignored, until only one character in the entire film even bothers to talk to one, purely because the civilian was selling him porn. <br/><br/>Sure the film had a dash of tension, but in a world where each critically acclaimed movie has to have in-depth plot twists, stunning cinematography and character exposes, the film gets you wondering: How the hell did it win so many awards??<br/><br/>The answer is simple: The Hurt Locker is Pro-American. In a time when the Iraq war is criticised, the Global recession has hit and America is losing what it values most, and when there's a perceived stereotype from the rest of the world that most Americans are far less intelligent than anyone on the planet, The Hurt Locker provides only one clear message: ""America, You're Doing a Good Job"". <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow accomplishes in ignoring all chances she had to make the film intellectual and engaging on any level by not mentioning any of the issues surrounding the war, looking only at neurotic, alcoholic Staff Sergeant William James' (Renner) and his EOD team's experience in Iraq. <br/><br/>How the team never even thought about why they were there or have any interaction with Iraqi civilians outside of those trying to blow them up – with the exception of a 10 year old boy who sells the team leader porn - is beyond comprehension. <br/><br/>The responses posted on the internet have been incredibly diverse; on the one hand, there's the general American population, who's elated – in the wake of movies such as The Green Zone, We Three Kings and Body of Lies - to see an Iraq war movie where they're not perceived as screwing everything up, but on the other hand is the response given by genuine American soldiers and veterans. <br/><br/>The film, which Hollywood has praised for its 'realistic' portrayal of an 'authentic' Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team stationed in Iraq, has been shunned by a large number of American troops for its blatant inaccuracies.<br/><br/>One soldier stated in an online interview ""It was terribly fake and I couldn't stand how stupid it made the army look. I didn't like it. I thought it was just so inaccurate and fake... I'm just very judgmental when it comes to military movies because it's my job.""<br/><br/>Private Sean Hartley, who served in Baghdad between the years of 2004 and 2006, was equally appalled by the film's inaccuracies. ""It was incredibly disrespectful to EOD soldiers, who are portrayed as adrenaline-addicted crazies, but in real life are extremely qualified professionals doing an insanely difficult job."" <br/><br/>Another soldier, Sgt. Eric Gordon, was less offended by the movie, but still views the films attempted realism as ludicrous. ""I would watch it with other EOD people, and we would laugh"" <br/><br/>He especially found a scene where a bomb was defused with wire cutters ridiculous, likening it to ""a fire-fighter going into a building with a squirt bottle"".<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker itself is intended to be an expose on the effect of the delirium of war and the addicting head-rush that being in an EOD team can have on the male psyche. However, it fails to achieve its purpose as the characters are so dull, emotionally thin and unrealistic they might as well have been cast straight from 'Twilight'. In fact, even 'Twilight' had better character development. <br/><br/>James' team-members, hard-nosed Sanborn (Mackie) and green, anxiety- prone Eldridge (Geraghty) offer no psychological or emotional support for James as they're too stereotypical to develop themselves, leading to an anti-climatic ending where everyone is where they started out - minus a leg for Eldridge. <br/><br/>So if you know absolutely nothing about how modern warfare or the military works, then you might find The Hurt Locker bearable. If not, the dull characters and their ludicrously un-GI actions brought on by this hideous Hollywood Hokum will leave you awestruck as to how the film has received any awards at all - just as it has for countless American troops."

I am not being judgmental but it seems to me that some great lobbying went behind its academy wins. <br/><br/>:-("

","Another 'American-way' film. The only difference with all the others that have been released in the past, is the less American flags waving. The main theme of the film is still the good American soldiers that try to save the poor Iraqi from the bombs. Another 'epic' story of the young brave American soldiers. Oscar academy, once more, blessed native American patriots! It is not at all a film against the war. On the contrary, it's a film excusing and giving clues for war continuing. Another story with bad bad Iraqi bomb planters. (since they have not the ability to plant flowers, they plant bombs for fun). But, thanks God, the Americans are there to save the situation and kill some bad guys!(once more)"
"alfredsmith","8","2","5","28 February 2010"," Yeah it's good but it's no classic.
","The consensus here regarding the greatness of this film has changed considerably over the last few months. When it first appeared it was regarded as a so-so Iraqi war drama but over time the hype has raised the film to iconic status. Recent BAFTA awards (what were they thinking?) confirm that thinking. I saw the movie several months ago and I still believe it is a good movie, well worth watching as it has some tense moments that really are ""edge of the seat"" stuff but the biggest miss with this film is the main character. Me, I like to like the main character(s). The film starts off impressively due entirely to Guy Pearce's performance as SSG Matt Thompson but then he gets killed! I couldn't possibly like his replacement SSG William James. He is one stupid yet incredibly lucky soldier who risks his own life and the life of his colleagues. He is certainly no hero. If I had liked him this film could have been a 10/10 not a 8/10. Further, I discovered this too early into the story and my impression doesn't change when the DVD kid goes missing and is presumably found very dead. <br/><br/>The real highlight for me was the encounter with the British and subsequent sniper scenario. I thought it was brilliant, but either side was a just too much Hollywood cliché. Going home to his loving family, a family, by the way that James finds droll and boring and his subsequent return to service was just the nail in the coffin. If it was up to me, Pearce would have been cast in the lead role, he would have been killed right near the end and the film would have been sensational. District 9 will be getting my vote for the standout pic of the year."
"The Sheen","8","2","5","16 February 2010"," Decent film getting a lot of flack for inaccuracies
","This movie was not bad at all. I guess what helped is that I didn't go into it expecting an accurate depiction of life as an EOD tech. There were definitely scenes that seemed unbelievable. The one that stands out the most was the 'car on fire' scene. And there were others that left you asking 'is this really how things are done?' Specifically... why disarm vs. blow an IED up in place? And there's the minute specifics which nobody outside the military, myself included, would ever notice. Badges, hardware, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Seems most of the criticism on IMDb is rightfully coming from vets of the Iraq/Afgan wars. But I don't think the filmmakers intended on everyone focusing so much and on the factual inaccuracies of the movie. I believe their intent was to follow what was going on in the main character's head. They began the film with the 'war is a drug' quote. Just about everything that James did in the entire movie revolved around that quote. If the filmmakers had depicted exact military protocol in the film, they would not have succeeded in doing what they wanted to do. They portrayed James as a loose canon who was very good at what he wanted to do, which they would have had much trouble doing if they didn't take the liberties they did. Had they done otherwise, he would have been discharged about 20 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled.<br/><br/>The impressions I first got about James was that he was either so desensitized to everything around him that he foolishly believed he was invincible, or that he was genuinely nihilistic and didn't care if he died. The nihilist feeling never left. He did what he did well, but didn't seem to care if his next move killed him. Another sense I got was the video game aspect of the whole thing. It's as if he was playing things out in real life as if it were a game. He didn't recognize any potential personal loss, and rarely looked at the effects his behavior had on others in his group, hence his willingness to do whatever he wanted. The only time he seemed emotionally distressed was when he found the body of the young boy. As if he had a momentary pause where he realized it wasn't a game and people suffered. But he eventually snapped out of it and was back to his normal self. When he was trying to get the bomb jacket off of the man and couldn't, he offered a few apologies and started to run once he realized he couldn't win this phase of the game. He didn't seem too emotionally distraught immediately afterward.<br/><br/>And there's the final scenes of the movie where he pretty much admits in front of his very young son that he doesn't love anything but the game itself. Not his wife or even his son. And the scene that followed with him marching down a road in his bomb suit reinforced the whole video game thing. It looked perfectly like a video game scene with him centered in the road and a horde of soldiers and their vehicles slowly following.<br/><br/>All said and done, it was a good movie despite it's shortcomings in the accuracy dept. And let's not forget it was an indie flick that was initially released to DVD abroad. Not bad at all."
"Blecston","8","2","5","26 January 2010"," Oscar nomination worthy, but not Oscar winning worthy
","To appreciate the value of ""The Hurt Locker"" you must overlook the military inaccuracies (do you think it's that easy for a movie crew to get access to the details regarding US Army logistics, armament and others?) and judge it by its artistic value as a movie. Its main focus isn't depicting the exact details of a EOD unit in Baghdad, but more of creating 3 relatively different characters that have the role of pretty much illustrating certain situations that a presumed military would go through.<br/><br/>The movie is not very abundant of pure action scenes, but it still keeps you connected due to a tension build-up. The very best examples are the stand-off and the attempt of disarming the bomb on the Iraqi civilian. Good editing and cinematographics contribute to that tension and ""The Hurt Locker"" could be a winning bet for the Oscar in those categories. Not to be overlooked is also the sound, frequently adding more tension and suspense to the scene. Acting is good tending to very good especially the performance of Anthony Mackie. Jeremy Renner has, of course, been the critics favorite, but certainly not undeserved. It took him several years to get a leading mainstream role, but from now on I'm sure we'll be hearing of him more often (his next movie is Ben Affleck's ""The Town""). A downfall regarding the film is the weak plot. Although it is to appreciate the intention of just depicting the 2004 army-invaded Baghdad through the perspective of a EOD team, I feel that more substance could have been added to the storyline, maybe more development of Renner's character. Nevertheless, during the movie you will almost for sure overlook this slight flaw and enjoy the picture.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a good film, not as a drama war movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor as a action war movie like ""Rambo"", but it's still worth the money. Generally good directing make it a candidate for the title of ""best movie of the year"" but it still has several bad features that should prevent it from winning that title. So it all comes down to subjectivism and taste, as well as competition."

","THL is a good movie, make no mistake about that. It's just not a great movie. Perhaps I was just expecting more, since so many people have talked excitedly about the accuracy of the movie. (Check the forums if you want to learn more about this.) Overall, while I enjoyed the storyline and got the point of the movie, the lack of realism in the movie spoiled it quite a bit.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not talking about whether or not chevrons, patches and insignia were shown properly on the uniforms. I'm talking about the lack of security when the EOD team goes out on a mission, the stupid things they do, how they end up in completely unrealistic situations and (quite frankly) the bogus explosions that are used too often. These are NOT trivial problems, as the director and writer use them to emphasize the loneliness of the EOD techs and the rush they get. To me it's a cheap way to show something that could have been shown more accurately and , therefore, more realistically. I mean, I've never been in the military, but even I know that you don't send a three-man EOD out by themselves to wander around, or hold your squad in one place without any perimeter security.<br/><br/>This exceeds the usual degree of make-believe in movies (e.g., having all the sprinkler heads in a building go off if you activate a single one)and reaches the level of bad cop shows, where investigators NEVER call for back-up or take uniformed officers along with them in dangerous situations.<br/><br/>In short, definitely worth a look, but not award-worthy."

","War and Holocaust movies bore me to death. These genres have been one-sided mindless drudgery and not really balanced, mostly in favor of countries where the movies are produced from since those World War II Hollywood movies. This movie has gritty sequences of bomb-squad keeping their life on the line. Well acted, but only looked from eyes of bomb squad. Human decision errors (stupidity of what if it is not a suicide bomber? looking for a family of dead kid, personal relationships, contrast of abundance (cereals) in America and poor kids selling pirated dvds in Baghdad etc.), frustrations are well depicted. It is still a one point of view of looking at war that will give you day to day life of bomb-squad (EOD). But there are so many stupid decisions been taken in/pre/post Iraq War. 'Green Zone' (Matt Damon) depicts that another point of view. There are several other books/movies/documentaries on such war topic that is beaten to death - Body of Lies,Saving Jessica Lynch,The Lucky Ones, Stoploss etc. We already lost last decade in this.

","... you should enjoy it while you can!"" is how one of the councillors puts it to one of the soldiers. The man's patronising comment is a mirror to the reality of the state of mind of the soldiers that have to fight, and ""The Hurt Locker"" is a vivid depiction of the mentality that can help some through.<br/><br/>The story centres mainly round two men involved in bomb disarmament and disposal, James & Sanborn. James is a maverick whilst Sanborn is more straight down the line, and their aim is to survive the many bomb traps that are laid down by insurgents (the film is based in occupied Iraq). The whole film is very original and you see the soldier's method and madness in just being able to survive their tour of duty, but also the uncomfortable truth that there are those who feed off of it and need the action. ""War is a drug"" we are told at the start of the film, and the adrenalin rush from the action is an addiction for some men.<br/><br/>The action is well paced and the tension frightening at moments, the acting is just superb and the dialogue is believable. The camera work is shaky but this is just to give an uncomfortable aspect to the viewer to make us feel more what those on screen are going through.<br/><br/>It's one of the best war movies in many a year, and in some ways is much more aligned towards ""Jarhead"" than ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend it to many people. A very interesting film which at times uncomfortable to watch yet still keeps you glued to your seat."

I watch and say to myself ""it isn't like that in real life, these filmmakers don't know what they're doing"". I saw The Hurt Locker tonight at my base theater and want to salute a great filmmaker named Kathryn Bigalow and I sing her praises with fervor. She should join the ranks of Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket), Oliver Stone (Platoon) and Francis Ford Coppola (Apocolypse Now) as a director who made one of the greatest war films ever. I have never seen a film that so realistically captured the horror of combat and the endless hell Soldiers in combat experience. Sergeant James and his fellow Soldiers aren't Rambo or Sergeant Stryker. They are just human beings who want to stay alive and go home. You feel their fear and smell their sweat, Bigalow makes it that real. I served in Operation Desert Storm as a young National Guardsman and this film brought back memories and had me on the edge of my seat more then once. This film has won excellent reviews and raves from audiences and there is truth in advertising. I am so glad I made the decision to see it. I had never heard of any of the actors in the film, but they all do outstanding work. The only thing is that Sergeant James attitude at first got on my nerves. I was thinking that I wouldn't feel safe with him in combat. He grew on me though. SPOILER ALERT I felt so sorry for that young Specialist that had his leg shot up in the end. He had every right to chew out Sergeant James. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT. Sergeant James couldn't save that man rigged with the bomb in the end and I know that hurt him, but he made it home to his wife and child and then decided to go back to Iraq? What was he thinking. No happy ending here. Well like they said in Platoon, innocence is the real casualty of war."

Sure Keanu Reeves made it look like fun while drooling over Sandra Bullock, but here director Kathryn Bigelow shows us a closer look at what really goes on with these guys - deep inside the war.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is stunning as the ""show no fear"" bomb tech who understands his job, thrives on his job, and ultimately needs his job. Renner's talent was obvious when he played the sleazy rapist in North Country, but here you just can't take your eyes off of him.<br/><br/>Bigelow (yes, the same who directed Keanu and Swayze in Point Break) delivers excruciatingly intense drama. There were times I wanted to look away, but I couldn't blink. I was frozen and glued to the action.<br/><br/>Not many movies kill off the likes of Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes, but duty is the star of the film. And while that is the strength, it is also the film's weakness. Character development and story lines are pretty much non-existent other than the obvious thrill seeker, dedicated soldier, dumb white trash, etc. Those are more stereotypes than characters, but it doesn't prevent this from being a very intense film to watch."

I went with a friend to see The Hurt Locker in hopes that it might be along the lines of In The Valley Of Elah, which was an insightful and emotional look at how a single event ripples out to affect many people, changing the courses of their lives. There were only a few moments in The Hurt Locker that achieved any sense of this type of insight or emotion.<br/><br/>Instead this film seems mainly to say that it takes a kind of mania to survive the experiences of wartime, especially in the focused role of the main character. He was relentless in his pursuits, but we barely get to know him, what motivates him.<br/><br/>One tense scene after another, after another, until I was basically numb to it, and really just wanted to tune it out, like the sound of a jackhammer.<br/><br/>I have to wonder at the high ratings other reviewers give this film.

The two films are not in the same realm with each other, but they do share a certain preference of intensity-over-story that I just don't need to live through.

","I walked into The Hurt Locker completely blind. I was visiting the big city, had the opportunity to see movies we would never get in my small town and rushed headfirst into The Hurt Locker. This could have been a dangerous undertaking going in with zero expectations and not knowing virtually anything about the film. As it turned out it was more or less exactly what you would expect from hearing a brief rundown of the plot.<br/><br/>""Forced to play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in the chaos of war, an elite Army bomb squad unit must come together in a city where everyone is a potential enemy and every object could be a deadly bomb.""<br/><br/>That's it, in a nutshell, no more, no less. The film is another why the current war on terror is bad and messes people up but is somehow so crucial to the humanitarian side of things. However I sound like I am being sarcastic towards the film and I don't mean to be. The cast is great, the suspense is truly top notch and the filming of the movie puts you literally dead center of the terrifying action in Iraq.<br/><br/>Character actor Jeremy Renner plays Staff Sergeant William James, a talented soldier with some emotional problems that leaves him a thrill seeking, danger hunting man that often puts other lives in danger. Renner leads the cast well but he just falls short of truly shining. He doesn't seem to quite have the guts to really take control of the film or the cast. Anthony Mackie also has a great role as Sergeant JT Sanborn who is the more level headed of the team and has to hold everyone together. Mackie also shows some great potential but much like Renner falls just short of really shining in the film. Brian Geraghty has the opportunity to really knock an incredible emotional character out of the park playing Specialist Owen Eldridge who is emotionally distraught over losing their original team leader and all the spoils of war. Whether it is the way the characters are written or perhaps the lack of depth to them every character in the film seems to just reach a cliff of potential but never quite goes over the cliff. I noticed one a poster going into the theater than much bigger named actor Ralph Fiennes is listed on the poster which is ludicrous considering he shows up in the film for literally minutes and makes no difference to the plot one way or another.<br/><br/>So with a solid but not enlightened cast we turn to the plot and the action. The film is truly brilliantly shot by Kathryn Bigelow (remember the early nineties Patrick Swayze/Keanu Reeves classic Point Break...yah her) which, as I said before, literally drops you into the Iraq war in a way I have yet to have seen on film. The tension and suspense is incredible considering these guys uncover bombs hidden inside everything from cars to garbage piles to bodies to live people. You won't get any higher sense of urgency then watching these guys putting their life in their hands again and again. You could describe The Hurt Locker as having a weak plot considering the only real idea in the film is pure survival BUT that only means that the film feels all the more real. It does entertain in a morbid sort of way but it definitely has a powerful message behind it as well. Absolutely worth checking out for fans of war films or just for someone looking for something serious and thought provoking and see some potential in hopefully future big name actors. 8/10"
"wolftab-1","8","2","5","9 August 2009"," A Worthy Depiction of Being on the Front Lines in Iraq
","There have been more then several films concerning the Iraq War and most of them are forgettable. But Kathryn Bigelow has given us a worthwhile film about an elite bomb squad in Baghdad in 2004. After their team leader is killed trying to defuse a roadside bomb, the men of Bravo Company must learn to deal with their new charming, but reckless team leader Sergeant James, who instantly becomes an irritation to Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge as he shows his new team a different kind of urban combat.<br/><br/>Miss Bigelow takes us into the lives of these men who risk their lives every day in a hostile environment where you don't know who you can trust and all you have is each other, regardless of your differences. This is not your typical all testosterone driven war film that glorifies war, nor is it a heavy anti war message film. Although, there is a scene where there clearly is alpha male competition going on which looked truthful and had the right amount of comedy that wasn't over the top. The film simply is an effective depiction of life on the front lines, forming a tenuous camaraderie, trying to connect with your humanity and what happens when your rotation is over to some of these brave soldiers.<br/><br/>There is very good acting in the film and some interesting choices for cameos. Guy Pearce has a small but important scene as the first team leader, Sergeant Thompson and his scene makes a point of showing the difference in his leadership style and bomb disposal method as opposed to James. David Morse has a brief but charismatic stint as a Colonel Reed, who's confrontation with James leaves you guessing. Ralph Fiennes even shows up as a no nonsense military contractor in the field. But the 3 main actors, Anthony Mackie as Sanborn, Jeremy Renner as James and Brian Geraghty as Eldridge form a distinct trio. Renner is an atypical squad leader with a subtle intensity. His bit of business about the souvenirs he picks up along the way gives his character clarity. Mackie plays Sanborn as a tough, by the book sergeant who has a lot going on under the surface and his frustration and even his envy is quite clear. His underlying question of does he have what it takes is a driving force in his characterization and his heartfelt speech about the state of things is well done. Geraghty as Eldridge is not as strong as his compadres but his characterization as the emotionally fragile, unsure of himself specialist is decent enough and it works with the story.<br/><br/>With the Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow's realistic depiction of the lives of Iraqi soldiers is poignant and harrowing. She keeps the action flowing, even during the ""down"" time periods. I wish she would've shown a little more of the guys after their deployment ends, except for just a brief albeit telling scene with James. But, that didn't take away from the effectiveness of her spot on direction. I predict she will be recognized come Awards season."

A new squad leader poses some problems for the group, but this review is concerned about the plot.<br/><br/>This movie does two things as good or better than any war movie I've seen. One, it gets you into the mind-space of going to work each day in an environment where a single misunderstood detail can end your life.<br/><br/>The second great accomplishment of this movie is that it shows how impossible it is to live in this environment and not be changed by it.

"anhedonia","8","2","5","29 July 2009"," Taut, exciting, thrilling - one of the year's best
","I can now forgive Kathryn Bigelow for making ""Strange Days"" (1995). Legions love that sci-fi film, but I found it to be an unpleasant experience.<br/><br/>She certainly has redeemed herself with ""The Hurt Locker,"" a taut, thrilling, at times suspenseful film about a group of soldiers who risk their lives trying to defuse Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Iraq. This is a thinking man's action film.<br/><br/>I believe the reason ""The Hurt Locker"" will do better than the other Iraq War films - 2006's ""Home of the Brave"" and 2007's ""Redacted,"" ""In the Valley of Elah,"" ""The Situation,"" ""Grace Is Gone,"" ""Lions for Lambs"" and ""Battle for Haditha"" - is because you can't quite pinpoint the film's politics. And that tends to go over better with American audiences, who apparently cared not that their government leaders lied to them or didn't wish to be reminded that they were lied to or felt there was too much war saturation on cable news. Also, many of the films so far about the Iraq War haven't been very good, though I do believe ""Battle for Haditha"" is superb. It's just that next to no one saw Nick Broomfield's wonderful film.<br/><br/>The thing about Bigelow's terrific film is that it really doesn't need to display its politics. I don't have the foggiest idea whether Bigelow supported or disagreed with George W. Bush's invasion and occupation of Iraq, but the filmmaker's take on the war is not needed here. Because this is a film about soldiers who like to stop things from going ""Boom!"" and you get the feeling that Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) would be just as happy defusing these things in Los Angeles, Des Moines or anywhere else. It just so happens that Iraq is where action is, where he gets his adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is a nerve-wracking thriller, held together by a brilliant performance by Renner - he truly deserves a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for this - and some sensationally choreographed sequences. Mark Boal's tight and lean script - he also wrote ""In the Valley of Elah,"" which was a bit more on the preachy side - helps immensely, but Bigelow and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski know exactly how to wring the most suspense out of small moments. (Of course, Innis and Murawski had plenty of footage to choose from given that Bigelow chose to shoot four hand-held cameras simultaneously, a strategy that certainly helps actors and works perfectly for this film.)<br/><br/>The best of these moments is a lengthy sequence in the desert involving snipers. I had problems with some moments in this sequence - the gun jamming, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) being unable to hit a stationary target, but then nails the target when the Iraqi is running - but Bigelow turns the screws so slowly that you being feeling as antsy as the soldiers as we see flies land on James and Sanborn as they wait patiently. What makes this scene work is that Bigelow refrains from using any overblown musical score to heighten the tension. Instead, she is smart enough to know - and I wish other action and suspense directors will take a cue from her - that the situation is tense enough and that she can draw the viewer in by calmly prolonging the sequence and preying on our anxiousness to ratchet up the suspense. There's another moment involving an impetuous taxi driver and, here again, Bigelow squeezes every drop of suspense.<br/><br/>Renner's James is at the core of this film. He's cocky, brash and even arrogant, though not in the same way that made some of John Wayne's characters unbelievable. Renner's James has the same sort of bravado Wayne's characters sometimes did, but there's something beautifully authentic about Renner's performance.<br/><br/>He's a terrific actor - thank you ABC for proving you know nothing about good TV and canceling the series, ""The Unusuals,"" in which Renner was awfully good - and you can sense the wheels turning in his head as he balances James' action junkie with the cool precision of a fine craftsman disassembling bombs. There is something creepy about Renner's coolness here. He gets fine supporting performances from Mackie and Brian Geraghty, both of whom try to make sense of this man James as the film is told through their eyes.<br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws. A vigilante moment in a subplot involving a young Iraqi boy who befriends James seemed a superfluous attempt to make him seem more heroic, and there were times I seriously questioned the bombers' motivations or rationale for why they did or didn't do certain things.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" could be viewed by some as a paean to America's derring do spirit. I am not entirely sure that is Bigelow's aim. She and Boal do raise some interesting questions: Yes, these chaps are courageous, but at what price? What is this addiction to this action and what are its consequences?<br/><br/>If you are expecting a wham-bam action film, you will be disappointed. ""The Hurt Locker"" is essentially a character study set in a war zone. It just happens to be a damn fine character study of obsessive people.<br/><br/>The film opens with Chris Hedges' assertion that war is a drug, an addiction, and then Bigelow goes to prove that point with James. This is his job. Then again, for James, it's not just a job, it is an adventure and watching Renner bring James to life makes you understand his character, though you might not quite appreciate some of the decisions he makes."

","Predictability is necessary even in a suspense - paradoxical, but ... predictable. In a handful of episodes depicting the diffusion of bombs and explosions, the palpable anxiety and tediousness of the process does make sense. A couple of these episodes are somewhat contrived, but still, the character of Sergeant William James fits in them perfectly.<br/><br/>(Some 'urban legend' types of 'macho' statements are made usually along the lines of a ""Real man has to live like he is not afraid to die any moment"". For that there is a come back 'ninja' type: ""The REAL man should act without fear as if he is already dead"". Neither of them have anything in common with real life.)<br/><br/>People usually can't explain their behaviour - they just do whatever they 'gotta do'. How to show it in a concise and simple way? Kathryn Bigelow does it rather well. Three main characters illustrate the bell curve of an average. In the middle there is Sergeant JT Sanborn and on either side of him there is Sergeant William James, (the 'ninja' type) and Specialist Owen Eldridge on the other. He shows more fear than Sanborn, who is too proud to give in to the natural sense of self-preservation - although he reacts 'normally' and appeals to common sense when James behaves in a manner which can be perceived by others as bravado. Yet, having eight hundred and thirty seven bombs diffused in his (we don't know how many) tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, what other attitude can we expect from him? In his predictably short stay at home with his 'family' (a masterful stroke of the writer - divorced wife living with their son in his house - ""So - what does it make her?"") he utterly doesn't fit in to any other environment but the one in which he has grown into like a toenail: the road side bombs environment.<br/><br/>It is an important film and, although not perfect (definitely not 'the best film of the year' as the leading comment suggests), it brings home some of the realities of this and any other war. Adrenaline and other hormones pump on both sides and they find themselves in a choreography of circumstances, relational obligations and attraction. Yes, the attraction of war.

","""Not another Iraq movie"". Far from the customarily glowing advance notice that would normally grace films bestowed with even a fraction of its accolades, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker instead struggled to secure a cinema release, beset by the seemingly damning alignment with the genre of contemporary war films nearly universally bestowed with as much audience indifference as poor quality. With this in mind, one could find a particular poetic justice in watching life imitate art as Bigelow's film scraped by each set of obstacles, fighting to keep itself alive and becoming internationally celebrated with the same quiet, tenacious efficiency as its protagonists - a real life success story as moving and cinematic as any told by the industry. One could find such a poetic justice, that is, if such a romanticized telling didn't run exactly contrary to the very spirit and thematic core of the picture in question. For The Hurt Locker offers no easy emotional closure, no tidy narrative arcs, no subscription to convention and certainly no traditional happy ending. Furthermore, it might just happen to be one of the strongest motion pictures to cross screens in decades.<br/><br/>Just as the film goes about its business in a fashion completely unlike nearly any other contemporaries, so is the viewing experience fundamentally transformed. Fatalism and stoicism barely serve to do the tone justice, as, becoming instantly immersed in an atmosphere so perpetually tense and fraught with unexpected peril, the audience cannot help but immediately adapt the same dispassionate detachedness as the American military bomb disposal protagonists, barely registering more than a numb grunt when characters are introduced, given the chance to develop meaningful emotional attachments, then abruptly killed off over and over again. This is not to say that the viewer does not grow to care about the characters, but rather the tragic opposite: they care so much about the characters that they are forced to 'turn off', as the consistent, visceral threat of losing them becomes too unbearable. Like the bomb-squad, the viewer is painfully conditioned into simply keeping going, in what is unquestionably one of the most painfully impactive participatory viewing experiences seen in ages, potentially ever. One lives as one of the characters, and if the film is a traumatic, exhausting watch, it is poignant testament to how hellish the actual experience of bomb disposal would be. <br/><br/>Rather than traditionally milking the genre as a vehicle for political rallying, Bigelow dwells on the sheer sensory experience of war, the fragmentary plot whittled into a bludgeoning series of episodes, each one pulsating with legitimate threat that it could be the end. Gone is the familiarity of linear narrative and emotional progression; the film's dramatic confrontations happen without any regard for crescendo or reason, much like the actual experience of combat. Bigelow's jittery cameras and mise-en-scene often draw more attention to inane, incidental details than the key dramatic apparatus of each scene, uncannily recreating the non sequitur focus of a soldier knowingly facing potential death. And yet, it is all the more disturbing for a film so tense to feel so excruciatingly calm, with the serene, near silent spectacle of an operative clad in a cumbersome bomb-suit (an image oddly evoking the absurdism of sci-fi) trudging across stark, hazy whitewashed sandy cities towards potential detonation almost unbearable through its matter-of-fact eschewing of any traditional ploys for emotion. <br/><br/>The irony that a film predicated on dismantling traditional emotional attachment to its characters should yield one of the most credible, fully inhabited performances in years makes the experience all the more sumptuous, and Jeremy Renner's work alone would already make the film essential viewing. His Staff Sgt. William James is a character for the ages, torn between a desperate yearning for any sort of fundamental connection and his inability to make sense of anything in life beyond bomb disposal, and registering the dissonance through a repulsively cocky, near suicidal addiction to risk and adrenaline as surrogate purpose. Most performers would be tempted to play it loud and large, but Renner's genius lies in his understatedness, playing James as a real person and thus making his rare eruptions of constantly bottled anguish all the more devastating, and seating his performance infuriatingly under the skin - a struggle to like, harder still not to understand, and impossible to forget. Supporting Renner, Anthony Mackie is similarly magnificent, carefully masking surges of deep seated terror and existentialism with brisk professionalism and brisk bravado, and Brian Geraghty consistently simmers to tremendous effect, a continual powder keg of a performance always at risk of erupting. Bigelow can also be commended for restricting A-list actors to almost incidental and horrifically brief supporting roles, further amplifying the unbalanced chaos of the experience. <br/><br/>Few packages fit together with such grim efficiency and unassuming genius, yielding a stylistic feel with simultaneous gruesome realism, a crushingly immersive experience made all the stronger through desperate attempts to sever any emotional ties, all the while managing to find new ground to tread on the subject of war bereft of any loaded political baggage (its perversely genius ending recalling Easy Rider of all things). The Hurt Locker addresses the validation of human existence through the continual threat of its removal, and plunges its audience into a genuinely disturbing and moving ride, all the more through its blunt refusal to beg for any obvious sentiment. Those sneering that the Academy Awards never properly award the best picture of the year should begin removing their feet (which are bound to feel encrusted in Baghdad sand and explosive soot after watching) from their mouths now. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","The Hurt Locker does not attempt to make a statement on the United States' condition in Iraq, nor does it try to explain the technological aspects of how to diffuse a bomb. All of this is assumed as the first thing we see on screen is a title card reading, ""war is a drug."" Of course this only applies to some people, but it definitely applies to Sergeant William James, the new leader of an EOD squad in Iraq.<br/><br/>For James, the ability to put on a large suit and walk up to a detonator and try to stop it from going off is a pleasure; he revels where most men would refuse to go once, much less hundreds of times, which James claims to have done. This attitude towards his work isolates many of the people around him, more specifically the two men he is to work in close proximity with, Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Both think he's crazy to want to be that close to the action that much, but what can they do but cover for him and hope he doesn't die? Director Kathryn Bigleow is a name many may not know real well or at least associate with top-notch suspense. She will almost certainly get the attention she deserves now. With every scene, she builds to a climax you know is coming, just not when. She affirms herself the old Hitchcockian rule of suspense: a bomb under a table goes off is action, a bomb under a table not going off is suspense. In this case, a bomb actually applies. Story-wise, there doesn't seem to be much of one, which could be one of the few quirks people have about it. But, as I said before, this film is not trying to make a statement about the war nor give us hardly any insight into what entails the jobs of these men. Even still, there is a slight thread of the Sgt. James character, who is essentially addicted to the adrenaline rush of gambling with his life while trying to take apart a bomb.<br/><br/>As for James, it is with the complete performance by Jeremy Renner that totally sucks you into this movie. You know he isn't like other soldiers; he has a more sadistic sense of humor, he goofs off quite a bit and takes his job and himself way too loosely. Yet, perhaps for these reasons we like him and follow every step of the way he moves, tensely wondering what will happen next.<br/><br/>As the Oscars approach, the race for Best Picture almost certainly comes down to two films of the most ironic of senses. The Hurt Locker, made for $11 million and barely getting a theatrical release and directed with sheer intensity by Kathryn Bigelow goes up against Avatar, that monumental giant of a 3D blockbuster, made for over $230 million and grossing over $2 billion worldwide, directed by none other than Bigelow's ex-husband, James Cameron. For my money, The Hurt Locker deserves the big prize more if only because it goes deep to penetrate to some of the most human conditions: fear of death, fear of life, fear of what might happen to us in the next moment. Bigelow should almost certainly win the Best Director Oscar, and how deserving she will be. For it takes great skill and bravery to give us a war film that talks so little about the war, we start to forget what this guy is doing this for; his country or himself?"
"xtian_durden","10","4","14","4 January 2010"," Best Picture?
","An incredible experience, I have found what I'm looking for this year. One of the few great films this year and maybe the best. The short participation of Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes was a little unusual but the three key characters really stood up in the film. A documentary style full with emotion and breathtaking shots which show us how truly dangerous are the tasks that the elite soldiers are performing in the hot country of Iraq, disarming very dangerous bombs. You can feel every character of every person in the film. The new leader James, a wild man taking every risk possible in the combat changes the whole situation in his two men in the team. Doc is the only friendly soldier you can see, likely to an adviser like him, and the sudden explosion of the bomb next to him is bizarre, he joined them only to grant the request of Specialist Eldridge, whom he felt he need to see what fear Eldridge is experiencing in the action. This powerful film evokes a lot of emotion to the viewers, the fear of ending your life so quickly like breaking a toothpick every time you go and act upon your duty is clearly stated. Near the ending, James tells us that the only thing he loves is the job that he's doing with his fellow soldiers, risking his life with dangerous bombs and saving other lives. After his days with the Bravo team, he joined another year of hell with Delta. It's not a big surprise if I'm counting for this film to win the best picture."
"taifunu","9","3","10","13 May 2010"," for once I agree with the Academy... and it scares me ;)
","Finally managed to watch 'The Hurt Locker'. And I say finally because I had to watch it in two 'sessions'. Taking a break of two days between the first hour and the second. Can't explain why. Maybe it was just too much. Too much of what? Sheer film, I suppose. There's something haunting and intense about Bigelow's minimalism - as opposed to you-know-who's pretentiousness and grandeur and megalomania. With Bigelow it's all about details. The bullet shell. The wind blowing the dirt. The hungry, dirty, three-legged cats. The Iraqi boys speaking rap slang. And then there's the mix of shaky camera images, documentary-style, and the 'classic film' shots... I also liked the way Ms.Bigelow teased us, bringing in Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes only to kill them 5 minutes after... ;) XD <br/><br/>There's probably a lot more to be said about this film, but I can't do it. Can't write about films I really like. Can't find my words. That's why I'll never be a film critic ( thank gods !) <br/><br/>Haven't watched the other nominees for 'best movie' , except for 'Avatar' and 'Inglorious Basterds', but I dare say that for once I happen to agree with the Academy. <br/><br/>And for those who said this film won the awards it did because it sort of glorifies war - opposed to what Cameron's extravaganza did ; WATCH both films, then think again. Most of Bigelow's films are about a certain part of the human psyche. About the need for the adrenaline fix. The way I see it, that's what 'The Hurt Locker' is about, not war per se."
"fordfan_18","10","3","10","23 April 2010"," Best Picture of 2009
","This movie is phenomenal! And what makes it so great? Let's recap the facts. This movie is set in one of the most unsupported wars since Vietnam, so it would be easy just to make another movie about some random nobody that just wants to get out of the war alive and make viewers even more mad about the war. But instead, the Hurt Locker takes another approach, one which the viewer can appreciate the story and performances and not end up upset at the government. Then you have the main character who is actually in Iraq because believe it or not, some people in the army actually love there job. Rarely is such passion been seen in any recent movies about Iraq which makes this movie is more special. Then there are people who say that Kathryn Bigelow shouldn't have won Best Director because of the shaky camera angles. This movie is being called one of the most realistic war movies ever made and you wanna know why? It's because the angles that Kathryn takes makes the movie more realistic because it gives you that documentary feeling without the low quality camera footage. So yes I can believe that Kathryn got Best Director and I also believe Renner should have gotten Best Actor. So if you choose to watch this movie, make sure you do so with an open mind and not with this negative view on Iraq that other movies had led you to believe.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, this movie was voted Best Picture by a board of movie critics who have each watched thousands of movies for decades so I think they knew what they were doing when they made this decision."
"Bunuel1976","8","3","10","13 March 2010"," THE HURT LOCKER (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008) ***1/2
","Presciently, I caught up with this on the same day as it emerged victorious at the Oscars. I had watched a few films about America's latest conflicts – BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001), JARHEAD (2005) and REDACTED (2007) – but, in spite of the little-known cast (apart from nice cameos by Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce), it is easily the best of the lot. Incidentally, I was familiar with only a few of Bigelow's previous efforts but I plan to make amends throughout this week: it is ironic, however, that for a woman to win an Oscar it took her making a man's kind of film! Anyway, echoing the feeling of some others here, I approached this with some trepidation believing it had nothing new to offer; to be sure, the idea of a reckless boffin was not really original (in fact, it has been a good 60 years since The Archers dealt with this very subject within a WWII context in THE SMALL BACK ROOM!) but, for a modern film, I admit it is well above average – while I am at it, I also intend to catch up with several titles of recent vintage I missed out on for whatever reason. I still need to check out AVATAR (2009), by the way – it is also scheduled for this week, hopefully along with James Cameron's Extended Version of THE ABYSS (1988) – but I was glad that the subtle, if all-important, work performed by the sound department on THE HURT LOCKER was recognized at the expense of the more bombastic{sic} aural experience that AVATAR is bound to be. To get back to the film under review, Jeremy Renner's showy role notwithstanding, it was also atypical – thus highly commendable – for the leading actor from a war film to elicit this kind of attentionbut, then, Christoph Waltz from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) had it even better since he did win the Supporting award! The film's episodic nature results in many a tense situation (not least because the bomb-disposal unit's delicate job is forever being observed by the obviously disapproving and vaguely menacing locals) but also a few smaller moments (including Renner's relationship with a native boy) – all of which, however, are vital to the characterization (smoothing over some of its more predictable aspects) which, as already intimated, is what has singled this one out for praise (hence, the Best Original Screenplay Oscar win was just as deserving as the technical side of production). Finally, I found it highly refreshing that THE HURT LOCKER refrains from really taking sides in the conflict or become a blatantly anti-war film; on the contrary, it acknowledges the adrenalin rush that hardened war veterans get addicted to over time and are willing to sacrifice their lives (and sanity) to attain!"

","With about one month left in Iraq, a group of American soldiers is tasked with finding and neutralizing explosives. This, of course, has some obvious hazards and side effects. Who will survive until the end of their tour? <br/><br/>As I type this, we're less than a month away from the Oscars. ""Hurt Locker"" is seen as the leading contender to the unstoppable juggernaut that is ""Avatar"". And this puts me in a quandary. I really take issue with ""Avatar"" getting so much praise for such an old plot, but then I see ""Hurt Locker"" and as great as it is... not really what I'd think of as a best picture.<br/><br/>It's a good war film, and has some political messages (as all war films inevitably do), but I don't know. Compare it to ""Stop Loss"" or ""Body of Lies""... and it's not even nearly on the level of ""Syriana"". Kathryn Bigelow has made a fine film, and a good departure from her horror/sci-fi history, but I don't know if this is the big Iraq film we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Guy Pearce back in the spotlight, though."
"zetes","9","3","10","12 July 2009"," The suspense sequences are awesome
","War/action drama about an American bomb squad in the Iraq war. The film is extremely apolitical - the Iraq setting is almost incidental. The themes and incidents could, except for the technology involved and some of the elements of the suspense (notably that the fact that the enemy is made up of Iraqi insurgents, and it's difficult to tell the enemy apart from anyone else), this could just as easily have been about a police bomb squad or one in any other war. What makes The Hurt Locker special is its suspense sequences. God, it's been a long time since any Hollywood action director got suspense right. Bigelow takes the old Hitchcock maxim about the ticking of the bomb being more exciting than the explosion to its logical extremes. There are a handful of bomb diffusion sequences in the film, and they are all very tense (there's also a sequence where the group, along with some British allies, are pinned down by snipers, that is reminiscent of Ford's The Lost Patrol). It can be a very impressive film, and in a summer overrun by idiotic movies like X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, it's not at all surprising that so many critics have declared this a masterpiece. It's not, though. The main problem is that the human story surrounding the action/suspense setpieces is nothing special. Jeremy Renner plays the new leader of this squad, with his two veteran assistants, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. They lost their previous Sergeant through carelessness, and they are eager to protect the new guy. But Renner is an adrenaline junkie. He dares what no one else will (screw robots! I'll march right up to that bomb without a second thought!). There is a lot of tension between the three men because of this. Meanwhile, Renner wonders how he can ever return to normal life with his wife (Evangeline Lily) and young son without the excitement of the field. There's also a subplot about a young Iraqi boy Renner befriends who disappears. The stuff around the setpieces isn't necessarily bad, it's just not exceptional. I could also complain a little about the action sequences themselves. They are definitely exciting, but, if you think them through, they don't seem too realistic. For instance, in the opening sequence, when the first Sergeant is approaching a bomb, Geraghty sees a butcher across the street pull out his cell phone. Geraghty yells at him to put it down, but hesitates in taking a shot. Yeah right. This guy would be dead the second he pulled out that phone (and he should be; there's no room for mistakes in this kind of situation). You would really hope the real guys in this situation would be much more careful than Renner is. If these exceptionally trained individuals weren't that trained, you'd think they'd all be dead by now. And in the sniper sequence, when one British sniper gets waxed, Mackie grabs his gun and seemingly goes to the exact same spot to snipe. What? I won't at all be surprised to see a ton of technical debunkings of this film as it becomes more popular. I've already seen a few on the film's IMDb board. Technical problems don't bother me too much, though, and I still quite enjoyed the movie."
"EUyeshima","9","3","11","31 January 2010"," Bigelow Viscerally Captures the Intense Effects of Wartime Anguish and Ambiguity
","Director Kathryn Bigelow (""Point Break"") has an uncanny ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this propulsive 2009 battlefield drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).<br/><br/>Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of film-making bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.<br/><br/>That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. Barry Ackroyd (""United 93"") is responsible for the vivid, burnished cinematography. The extras on the 2010 DVD are sparse but quite good. The most informative feature is the commentary track from Bigelow and Boal, who both discuss production details and historical context to allow for a greater appreciation of the story being told. There is also a twelve-minute making-of featurette, which is pretty standard as these extras go. Lastly, an image gallery accompanies a 23-minute Q&A session with Boal and Bigelow recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London."

","""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug"" – Chris Hedges <br/><br/>Imagine the feeling you get when you are waiting for something to happen. The anticipation building up in the pit of your stomach. Your hands in tight fists showing white knuckles. The Hurt Locker is 131 minutes of that feeling. An intense and real war film that keeps the viewer in a constant state of worry and stress. You might be thinking ""Why would I watch that?"" Because it is a profoundly moving film. That's why. This movie is outstanding and the message being conveyed is so clearly communicated. This movie takes a subject that makes people uncomfortable and shoves it in our faces. We are forced to see the ugliness of war. With tremendous performances by all involved, this movie is believable to an unsettling degree. Director Kathryn Bigelow took home the first Oscar for best director ever to be given to a woman in history. This makes perfect sense if you've seen the film, even though it is a shame that she was the first female to win best director when so many other impressive women came before her. But I digress<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker follows the story of an elite Army bomb squad. Sergeant First Class William James (Renner) makes disarming giant bombs look like a day at the park. His confident – sometimes overconfident – personality gets him in trouble one or two times, but he always manages to get the job done.<br/><br/>Working with him are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Sanborn and Eldridge question the manner in which James conducts himself. Doing reckless things like removing his headset and bomb suit when disarming a car with a trunk full of bombs. James says ""There's enough bang in there to blow us all to Jesus. If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable."" as he's removing his bomb suit. With quips like this one and a few others, there is just enough lighthearted banter to keep the audience themselves from exploding.<br/><br/>I really cannot say enough good about this movie. It is gritty and mean and completely disregards the ideological standards that Hollywood typically sets for films of this nature. The editing and cinematography are enough to get me to watch this over and over again. Not mention the explosive – no pun intended – performances from the actors.<br/><br/>Though it is a difficult film to watch, The Hurt Locker makes a point and drives it home so well. War is ugly. This movie doesn't paint a pretty picture of the situation and it is clear that Hollywood didn't get its pandering hands all over it. You may want to cover your eyes, but definitely watch The Hurt Locker and try to keep your eyes open as much as possible.

This is understandable, as with all movies, if your disbelief is not suspended, you're probably not going to like the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I found this movie highly thought provoking and exhilarating. It is pretty much neutral on the war, it shows the true horrors of war but in the end the main character decides he wants to go back for more, because defusing bomb's is the only thing he really loves. I thought that scene at the end with his kid was spectacular and gave a very interesting perspective on things, one of if not the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is like an effective pitcher, it throws you whatever you aren't expecting. This is one of the movie's best qualities, along with having brilliant sound, editing, and camera work. The plot is practically unpredictable, which makes the most dramatic scenes inside the ""hurt locker"" even more dramatic. This movie should have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker also provides many interesting perspectives and insights on the war, despite being unbiased. Character development is surprisingly well done. When I think back on the movie, at first you hate the main character, then love him, then feel sorry for him when he becomes psychologically affected by the perceived loss of the Iraqi kid. The mentally traumatized soldier also gives good perspective on what war is really like.<br/><br/>Overall the Hurt Locker is definitely worth watching, a true ""rebel"" of a movie that is brilliantly put together with a surprisingly terrific plot in a controversial subject matter"

Jeremy Renner's character is seemingly meant to be heroic. But he just doesn't come across in that way a lot of the time. He discards his kit saying he'd prefer to 'die comfy' (not that having a cloud of shrapnel in the face would increase any feel good factor). To add to that, the Iraqis are watching their friends in a way that suggests an attack is about to happen, but Renner's character ignores them and gets on with disarming a bomb that could be dealt with by someone else.<br/><br/>The British contractors are stupid beyond belief in not changing position after firing a sniper rifle (and this is coming from a civilian who has only read about combat), resulting in two being killed and the others seemingly running away.<br/><br/>The next bit that comes as a bit of an oddity is his attempt to catch a man who murdered an Iraqi boy by having the good idea of running around the streets in a hooded top and American combat fatigues, something that is simply asking for trouble.<br/><br/>Having said all this, the setting and the cinematography is great, but the story meanders and eventually falls flat on its face. It's interesting, and there are some expectedly tense moments, and there are some good actors here (especially the ones making their bit part appearances) but it's definitely not exciting.<br/><br/>Now Sniper One, that would make a brilliant film!"

I have read many reviews about how the director draws the viewer into the picture and how shredded my nerves would be after watching it. What I actually found was that once again the studio has employed a camera operator suffering with severe Parkinsons disease! Why this method of camera work is now the norm is completely beyond me. As a consequence, I just found myself distracted from the story by the frustration of shaky images. I have to ask why it's necessary, when the actors are moving down an alleyway toward the camera, to zoom in then out then in again? If this is to give a sense of realism, I'm missing the point. My eyes don't work like that when I'm walking about, so why have it in the film? <br/><br/>I can't believe that I'm the only one that gets wound up by this utterly pointless, and seemingly amateurish, camera work.

The dialog is well written and believable. The cinematography and ""visual fabric"" of the film are well done.<br/><br/>The story is conventional. The message is cliché and heavy handed. To be fair, I saw The Red Badge of Courage in high school, and every war movie I have seen since, with the possible exception of Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, have been some version of that movie. War is bad, and incredibly wasteful on every level. I get it. Perhaps my view is skewed because I didn't experience war until later in life; but I find this movie makes the same mistakes about trivializing that which is truly distasteful to Soldiers (the mundane and random), and greatly exaggerates that which is tolerable (the horrible).<br/><br/>I did enjoy the scene in the stateside supermarket. It's probably the closest the story gets to making a point, though I'm not sure if that was done on purpose or if the writer simply observed a phenomena and the Director got lucky shooting it right .<br/><br/>It is enjoyable, but not quite as good as you would hope; or it could have been.<br/><br/>I preferred ""Up""..."
"phd_travel","6","2","6","6 February 2010"," Good not great - not best picture by far.
","Simply put this movie is good but no great.<br/><br/>The direction is precise and the actors never distract from the plot and realism. There is no very obvious message or preaching. Also the way big stars like Fiennes and Pearce are killed off unexpectedly is quite good.<br/><br/>The story about bomb disposal is just not that interesting. Some incidents like diffusing the car bomb etc are tense the first time you watch it but I wouldn't want to watch it again.<br/><br/>Compared to other war movies it is unique in that it is very intimate and does not aim for a grand scope. But this is also its fault. It is just rather boring.<br/><br/>Some rather painful moments like the punching each other for fun among the soldiers could have been left out.<br/><br/>Renner is a good actor but his face is rather unpleasantly ugly. His heroism and self sacrifice is quite moving to watch though.

"eastbergholt2002","8","2","6","3 February 2010"," War is Horrible
","The Hurt Locker covers about 3 months in the life of a bomb disposal team operating in Iraq during 2004. The acting is convincing and the film is beautifully directed. The film graphically shows the brutality and hostility that American soldiers faced during the early stages of the occupation. Iraq was in chaos and the bomb disposal teams helped clear Baghdad of IEDs. Watching this movie can be an uncomfortable experience, you feel like an extra member of the team. I am basically a philistine so when I go to the movies I usually prefer to forget my troubles and like to be entertained. For me the film's realism made watching a harrowing and depressing experience. This is not a movie for the faint of heart. <br/><br/>The camera follows the team from one incident to another and shows the everyday experiences the soldiers faced. The three team members react differently to the horrors they confront. Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) hate Iraq. They want to go home and try to avoid taking any unnecessary risks. Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner)the team leader is calm and seems to enjoy the war. James is described by a colonel as an ""animal."" The soldiers are not the frightened kids, high on drugs that we saw in many Vietnam movies. These men are mature,professionals who interact like grown-ups but there is tension amongst the team members because Sanborn believes that James takes too many risks.<br/><br/>The movie is well made and gives you a better understanding of what the soldiers went through. It shows how war can change people forever and Bigelow doesn't sweeten the pill."
"blanbrn","7","2","6","1 February 2010"," Explosive war film that's not really political, yet more directly personal and situational.
","Finally watched ""The Hurt Locker"" after hearing about all the buzz the film has caused. And you can see why the picture has caused a stir for one it's an explosive and thrilling war film of very dangerous situations. It's themes though centered around war stays away from political influence as it's focus was the direct and gritty action of bomb explosives in war. And most scenes shot were harrowing and explosive to the eye as the direction and camera work from director Kathryn Bigelow was top notch.<br/><br/>Set in 2004 in Iraq it centers around the lives and everyday happenings of an elite and highly trained bomb disarming unit. And the viewer is always treated to the bomb disarming during the extreme heat of combat. Right from the get go you can see this is a highly stressful and nerve rattling job, only the strong survive as the margin for error is little to zero. You see this so well displayed by the tough and gritty staff Sergeant James(Jeremy Renner in a good performance) who leads the unit learning each what it means to keep both your body and soul intact.<br/><br/>What more can I say ""The Hurt Locker"" is powerful and realistic in showing very intense and action packed scenes. As it will keep you the viewer on the edge of your seat each time that another bomb is about to be disarmed. In the end it proves that war is like an addictive drug and that many were meant to be war warriors, as this is one memorable war film that doesn't have a big political theme yet it's situations of direct brutal and heart stopping reality clearly shows the true and real memorable nature of war time to be gritty and heart pounding."

","I recently watched this on DVD. I saw the nominations, I saw the reviews, and this was from the talented female director of Point Break, a film I'm very fond of. So my excitement at watching this was very high. Unfortunately, in what seems to be a constant tread at the moment, this film for me doesn't quite justify the hype. Damn those over eager critics who refer to this as a ""nerve shredding masterpiece"". It's not by the way.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a good film. It reminded me of ""Tigerland"", the 2000 film which starred Colin Farrell. In that film Colin played a character who's a bit of a rebel, a bit of a risk taker, a guy who doesn't seem to give a damn, and the lead actor here displays similar characteristics. He is played with confidence by Jeremy Renner and he is one to watch in the future. He was apparently very close to being offered Mad Max 4 based on his performance in this.<br/><br/>The style of this film is down and dirty gritty, all shaky cam to give that documentary style to proceedings. The story if you're not familiar is very simple. A bomb disposal team stationed in Iraq defuse bombs, and each one becomes riskier than the last. There is some combat in between each bomb threat and some character development within the team. We see how the new leader to the bomb disposal group goes about his job, which surprises the rest due to his almost reckless attitude and daring personality. He doesn't think, he just does and this causes some conflict within the group. It also makes for some tense moments and some interesting character conflicts.<br/><br/>On a more disappointing level, there are parts of this film where not a lot happens, and although this may be true to life, it doesn't exactly make for riveting entertainment. Talky interludes between the action made me lose interest from time to time. Scenes that you think are leading somewhere don't really lead anywhere. A subplot for example involving our lead going on a quest to find the killer of a young local boy takes him to a house and a confrontation with a suspect, only for our lead to run out of the house again and back to base camp. That was a bit pointless mate! Did you just need a jog? As i've said, this is a good film. at best it's tense and gritty, and it's shot in a documentary style, and it has a good cast doing a good job. Just don't expect a ... what was it ... a ""nerve shredding masterpiece"". If you want that, go watch ""Eden Lake"" or ""Inside"""

","As some of the other reviewers, I was quite let down by the almost countless flaws about the EOD team's routines and military discipline shown in this film. They are not making a film about some mercenaries here, this film is about ELITE teams of the US military.<br/><br/>For those who are determined to watch the movie, I will try not to write any spoilers, but one thing I can say, if you are in the military, please DON'T pay for this, wait for somebody to lend it to you on DVD if you are curious. <br/><br/>For instance, not being an expert in the military, I can see clearly that these extraordinarily skilled professionals (EODs) are not gonna risk their lives, and subsequently, their team's, in order to quench their adrenaline needs. And if there would be one like our 'hero' here, he would probably have been put out of his misery after the first display of super-cool cowboy attitude.<br/><br/>The reason why I gave it 5 stars is no other than the fact that I actually really enjoyed the quality of all the technical aspects (sound, visual, etc), and that the actors also did a good job, since it is not their fault that the ones in charge of the script didn't mind to care about how some things work in real life: such as military ranks, discipline, X-Boxes and Ipod Touch in 2004 brought to Irak by time travel, and so on. <br/><br/>I am just not too sure what they wanted to do here, it does not seem like criticism to the military, perhaps more like the opposite, like they tried to give a tribute to them. But OMG, in order to do that, do not portray them like the 'hero' here.<br/><br/>That's all I will say without giving out any spoiler. Useful?<br/><br/>I wish you all the best!"
"Bruce-49","6","2","6","5 January 2010"," All Shook Up
","I very likely would have given THE HURT LOCKER a 9 if I had been able to see the work that Kathryn Bigelow's production team had done. Unfortunately, the decision to go with the ""realism"" of a hand-held camera throughout, often involving abrupt pans and focus shifts (even when filming two stationary people conversing) resulted in some of the most self-consciously awful cinematography I've ever seen. What is constructed to be a high stakes chase scene, consists entirely of characters, or what we presume to be characters, making blurry light smudges across the screen. It's really a shame because Bigelow, whose innovative take on the vampire genre NEAR DARK and turn of the millennium sci-fi STRANGE DAYS made her a director to watch, has once again led the pack by turning the day-to-day work of a bomb disposal unit into a nail-biting evocation of asymmetrical warfare. To say THE HURT LOCKER has a documentary feel gives documentary cinematography a bad name. Steadicam anyone?"

","Like Enemy at the Gates (snipers), The Hurt Locker focuses on a single war-zone (Iraq, circa today) and one category of soldier (bomb detection squads). Unlike the morality tales like Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom and Body of Lies, there is no lesson purported to be delivered herein. This is about the intensity, and the role of each of the members of an elite bomb detection squad, in the heat of combat. Unavoidably, the groups gets embroiled in other aspects of war that is strictly not their domain, such as sniping across vast expanses of desert, or giving chase to bombers across dark urban alleyways in the dead of the night. The spirit of the group is epitomized by one Marine – who returns injured and cussing from the epicenter of battle to home and family, and then in an epiphanic moment in a supermarket, decides to return to the Bravo Company for another 365 day stint at what he really loves doing. Great ""action"" sequences delivered with a deliberate lack of melodrama"
"clivechristy","5","2","6","2 January 2010"," Things that make you go hmmm....
","I should start off by saying I am a huge Kathryn Bigelow fan, and she has certainly taken on a task with this film. I am not an army person, so I cannot speak to authenticity, but from a film-going perspective, it is an intriguing film. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it, so that might be a condemnation of the film, but it isn't meant to be. It is an interesting movie that veers between the quietly personal and the physically challenging. The relationship between the men is the anchor to the film and it certainly doesn't glorify war, as some people have stated in previous comments.<br/><br/>There is nothing about this film that makes you walk away thinking ""Yes war is good"". There is something dark about this film that you may or may not enjoy watching, but there is a larger message in the film. I got the feeling that Bigelow was trying to tell us that most people in the face of potential and very real death, need a certain amount of bravado and a certain amount of bravery to get through the days left.<br/><br/>Bravo Company is not a place I would want to be, and the movie opens with death just so we are sure. On the down side, I find the characters are not really well developed and they are developed in a haphazard way. Jeremy Renner is dancing with death, and seems to careen between substance and style as the character demands. He is the stand-out in the film, but Anthony Mackie is no slouch either and brings a real human compassion to the role. I can't help but wish his character well, and that he returns safely home.<br/><br/>Sadly it is the cavalcade of other characters that appear and whose roles are undeveloped that weaken the intensity of the film. The cinematography is outstanding, and captures the harsh beauty of the landscape. What the film lacks in tightness it makes up for in bathos. It's not a movie for the family and it won't be a movie you will want to see again and again, but there is something here worth seeing...even just once."

","Largely character-driven war movie - showing the lives of a bomb squad. Realistic yet poetic. The story is deeply emotional, depicting a thoroughly disturbed individual's life in hell. Jeremy Renner gives an incredibly powerful performance. Kathryn Bigelow deserves every award she won for this movie. What separates this film from the bulk of mainstream cinema that has tackled the Iraqi situation is that it doesn't simply exist as a political polemic, or even a reminder of the humanitarian horrors that plague the Iraqi people."

I'm even baffled as to how Hollywood didn't manage to squeeze Bruce Willis into the Churchill Role 2 years ago... . So it fails me when the same people point out minor inaccuracies.... Lol...
The fact of the matter is that this is a brilliant film that encapsulates the fear and uncertainty around being a bomb desposal unit... It doesn't glorify it in anyway, it actually makes people sit up and realise just how much we undervalue such brave men and women, who were sent to do a job... Whether they believed in the political reasons or not?.... It also depicts how social and personal relationships can be put fully to the test by the trauma and the sights of war endured...

"CubsandCulture","6","1","2","18 February 2019"," Making an ""apolitical"" film is a political statement...
","Bigelow and Boal manage to convey the intensity (if not the accuracy) of the street level fighting of the the Iraq war. In terms of placing the viewer in the mindset of war this is one of the truly great war films. Even after re-watching it several times the tension and dread are palatable. The sniper battle is especially hair raising. Likewise, their exploration of what being a bomb tech does to a person on a psychological level is engaging and Sgt. James' recklessness aside rather plausible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they set their meditation on the psychology of war in Iraq. It is partially because of the happenstance of when the film was made and partially because of the nature of the Iraq war. They, however, are not interested in the larger geopolitical questions of that war and structure the action to avoid them. They also try to be ""fair"" by showing a few moments of US soldiers behaving unlawfully and foolishly. Any critique or indeed support of the Iraq war that is remotely introduced in the film is routinely undermined by the script later on. It is ""just the facts"" neutrality.<br/><br/>Except the film is not neutral ultimately. By ignoring the larger geopolitical questions-should the US invaded Iraq to begin with?-the film implicitly affirms the war. Even Sgt. James' junkie act doesn't really function of a critique of the US military adventurism. James is shown repeatedly as atypical of the military and thus he can't stand in for the policies of the US as a whole. It comes across as filmmakers who is interested in the wrong things; their treatment of the Iraqi's as quasi-zombies (subtextually) is them worryig to much about how bomb techs tic and not enough about if there should be bomb techs.<br/><br/>This is an extremely weak Best Picture."

Those who only gave it one star are either members of a fan club of someone who did not get an academy award, or their prefer their war movies fast action,with the hero running up a ramp behind a tank to appear that he cleared the tank in one jump, assault weapon blazing away in all directions, and being American of course, he wins the battle. The action fans just didin't get it. This was not a full on gung ho action movie, but a suspenseful account of the daily grind of bomb disposal, where the men know that any second could be their last, and after a tense morning disarming an explosive, they have to go out and do it again. The people whose streets are being made safe hate their guts and don't want them there, and you get the feeling that many of the watchers just want to see the Yanks get blown up. I did keep asking myself why were the Americans there anyway - it's not their war. <br/><br/>There were many criticisms, too many to tackle every one, but I will address a few. One was that the insurgents would not kidnap a business man and use him as a suicide bomber. Wrong! They do this and also with children. It is also used to extort money. Another gripe was that the bomb disposal unit would not have had a sniper with them. I disagree. As the several of the men were providing back up coverage, they would have been trained to shoot accurately as well as blasting away with all they had got. Another poster claimed that no Iraqi would be able to shoot so accurately from a distance. Perhaps that kind of thinking is what gets people killed! Never, never assume the enemy is inferior. Those who felt the new war junkie unit leader would have been disciplined or even thrown out of the unit may be right. In a perfect world he would, but in a world where results are all that matter, his callous recklessness would be seen as bravery. <br/><br/>Whether or not there were inaccuracies doesn't really bother me. It is fiction. Even real life events are gussied up to sell papers. How many man shot down the Red Baron? How many Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden alone? There is hardly a film based on a true story which did not take liberty with the facts in order to make it more interesting. As long as the film conveys what it is trying to do, I am happy with it, and The Hurt Locker was a different kind of film which kept me glued to the screen for two hours. I took one star off because of the irritating boy selling fake DVD's. There always seems to be one hanging around in war movies. I was not sorry to see the back of him."

I have tried to find other titles that could top it off, but I still think The Hurt Locker is still on top. I loved Kathryn Bigelow's direction, Mark Boal's script, the intensity within the movie, the realistic approaches of a Bomb Squad, and Barry Ackroyd's heart-pounding cinematography.

"ericventura","3","1","2","19 June 2017"," An Adrenaline Junkie's Film about an Adrenaline Junkie
","Bigelow attempts to weave an intense character study of interconnected parts during the Iraqi War in The Hurt Locker, but fails completely. In a well-made film technically, every aspect fails to come together to complete a whole. What ends up being produced is a visual masterpiece of well set up nothingness. It's a movie about nothing, but in a bad way, unlike The Big Lebowski (1998).<br/><br/>This is an adrenaline junkie's movie about an adrenaline junkie in war. Each war scene seems like another way to get the adrenaline pumping and the thrills going. While the first two or three are well-made and set up the rest of the film, the viewer becomes tired of the redundant scenarios and the movie accomplishes nothing. In essence, there is a thematic quote displayed across the screen to open the film, ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug,"" – and the movie takes two hours to simply say that ""war is a drug."" Two hours could have been saved for a film of more artistic value than this one by simply showing us that quote for ten seconds.<br/><br/>Renner's performance is limited to the bounds of the film. He is fantastic in his role, but the role is nothing special. The supporting actors of his team, Mackie and Geraghty, shine in their sole scenes, but can do nothing but fade away when Renner is in the limelight – again thanks to the frame of the film as an action-filled fiasco.<br/><br/>In the end, we have discombobulation. A spattering of scenes stitched together in similar scenarios to deliver a message. The message is delivered well with an apt vehicle. Yet there is no provided depth. What Bigelow tries to add with scenes of empathetic importance, fails to come across. Thus, the supermarket scenes depicting the normal life of Staff Sergeant William James, Renner's character, were more involving and engaging. The character fits with more context into the supermarket than the battlefield. This movie fits with more context in a locker rather than on the screen."
"filipemanuelneto","7","1","2","11 March 2017"," Excellent.
","This film shows the danger to the anti-bomb crews in Iraq, where bomb attacks are a daily reality. The film focuses a lot on the relationships between team's soldiers and their new leader, who everyone thinks is too reckless. From there, it invites us into the mind of this man and the way he faces his own work. The film also tries not to make judgments about war and violence. They don't appear to be criticized. The film accepts reality as it is and tells a story set in this reality. It's not a violent movie, but it's quite realistic and tough. It has punctual scenes with dead and some graphic hardness, as well as dialogues full of profanity and heavy slang, but this has fit perfectly in this type of film. It has several intense scenes full of suspense, able to leave the public with difficulty to breathe, where they gather almost all the ingredients common to other war movies, but what makes this film more valuable and different is and psychological load that it has, combined to its ideological neutrality. Kathryn Bigelow has done a great job directing and has responsibility for the final product's quality. Of the cast I highlight Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie, who were excellent apart and brilliant when they split the screen. Ralph Fiennes also appears but is almost a cameo. I also liked cinematography, full of warm colors and a somewhat misty and very subtle effect, as if there were constant dust in the air. It contributes a lot, in conjunction with the sets, environment and costumes, to take public to the Middle East."
"zkonedog","6","1","2","11 March 2017"," Incredible Tension, But Sparse Plot
","As a fan of war-esque cinema, I have seen the greats: Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, First Blood, etc. Recently, however, after watching such films as Jarhead and Brothers, I have begun to notice a phenomena in modern-day war films (primarily about the Middle East, accordingly) in which, while the action may be tremendous, the plot is very sparse and understated. I was hoping for something different in ""Hurt Locker"", but was once again disappointed.<br/><br/>For a quick plot summary, the events of ""Hurt Locker"" take place in Iraq and center on an elite bomb-defusing squad. Time and time again the unit (led by an enigmatic Sergeant played by Jeremy Renner) shows up on the scene of pressure-packed situations and must work fast in order to minimize casualties and general destruction. The effects of that constant tension are also touched on in scenes during the rare ""down time"" of the unit.<br/><br/>Disregarding the overall message of the film for a moment, the movie created great tension and wartime experiences that I had not yet seen on screen. You will literally feel your pulse rising and may have to remind yourself to breathe as ""Renner's"" unit goes about their pressure-cooker situations. This is an aspect of war so crucial to the Middle East conflict that it was about time it got its ""due"" on the big screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the entire message of the film didn't come anywhere near to living up to that battlefield suspense. Instead of presenting any riveting emotional dilemmas or character studies, director Kathryn Bigelow paints Renner (easily who was supposed to be the emotional background of the film) as such a stark portrait that it was difficult for me to feel anything towards him, whether good or bad. Now, this isn't to say that the film is stark for any sort of lack of effort, as I truly believe that Bigelow believed she was creating high drama with Renner's character. However, in trying to create what she believed to be an accurate portrayal of an Iraq War soldier, she didn't manufacture enough drama to really allow me to identify with the lead character.<br/><br/>Thus, your ranking of this film will likely be determined by your feelings about the amount of ""contrived"" drama that needs to be concocted in war films. If you like to stick with the very basics, ""The Hurt Locker"" will be right up your alley. If however, like me, you need a little external character drama to jump-start your emotions, than you may feel a bit wanting when the end credits roll."

"Tarx309","8","1","2","20 April 2016"," Might be a slow burn for some, but from a film making perspective The Hurt Locker is a masterpiece
","There is a lot to admire about this six Oscar and best picture winning movie. The movie ultimately takes three fairly normal soldiers to tell a story that explains the opening line of the movie: ""War is a drug"". The story is about two soldiers in a bomb disposal unit as they receive a new captain (Jeremy Renner), who is very reckless and also quite self-centred. The movie is two hours and ten minutes long (not including the credits) and is suspenseful from start to finish. There are many edge of seat scenes involving life or death scenarios where Jeremy Renner's character tries to shut down bombs before they go off, that can be very suspenseful as we, like the other soldiers, can only watch in anticipation as we wonder whether or not he will make it. This is slightly undermined later on in the movie when we find out that the same person is some sort of record breaking bomb disposal captain, and has previously disposed of 867 bombs. This took away the suspense for me as it assures you that he will almost definitely survive every time, just as he always has. There are a couple of war action sequences which are very prolonged and entertaining, partly because of the realism depicted in these scenes and partly because of Kathryn Bigalow's suspenseful directing and cinematography. She does an unforgettably good job at the directing which is consistent throughout the movie; and she thoroughly deserved to be the first ever woman to win best director at the Oscars.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie is curious, as big actors like Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly and Guy Pearce were all in the movie, but either died within five minutes of their opening scene or only appeared for a couple of minutes anyway. They felt that cameos that had appeared completely out of nowhere. The casting for the rest of the characters was great, with Anthony Mackie delivering what I believe was the best performance of his career; and Jeremy Renner's Oscar nominated performance also hitting all the right notes. All of the characters, but these two especially, were boasted with a fantastic and very convincing script.<br/><br/>Looking at it from a film making perspective, this movie is a masterpiece. Every detail is on point and the costume design, sound and effects are all done spotlessly. However this movie is bound not to resonate with everyone, as the characters are very unlikable at times and some may find it dull also, as some of the scenes do little to advance and plot.<br/><br/>In the end this is a very respectable movie that you will not forget, even if it may not work for everyone.<br/><br/>+Directing & Writing<br/><br/>+Well rounded performances <br/><br/>+Consistently suspenseful <br/><br/>-Unlikable characters<br/><br/>8/10"

","The Hurt Locker follows a bomb disposal unit through the last couple of months through their last tour.

The tension is made possible through great performances, decent writing and good direction by Kathryn Bigalow. What I think makes this movie so great is the theme behind the film, I won't spoil it, but the theme is something to reflect on and apply into your own life. This movie goes for a realistic, gritty approach. Which I think is it's biggest flaw. The military inaccuracies were blatant for me, and took me out of the movie.

Sergeant First Class William James arrives in Iraq to replace a member of a three man team that finds and disables bombs that has become a major threat to Untied States troops in the warzone. James displays a lack of concern for safety and leads the team into dangerous situations. This causes problems between James and the two other team members Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge. Sanborn and Eldridge and causes after going through the loss of their other team member and want James to change how he is handling the situations they are placed in. <br/><br/>The theme of The Hurt Locker is how service members can become addicted to war. During the film James seems to feed off the adrenalin given to him by the dangers they encounter in a warzone. He is not understood by his teammates Sanborn and Eldridge because they don't understand his addiction to the danger. This film also demonstrates how complex relationships can be when lives are on the line and a person's decisions could have a grave impact on others. The theme of being addicted to war relates to the film American Sniper which displays another service member that has a hard time leaving the war. <br/><br/>The angles taken during this film have a major impact on the feeling viewers can. When the team gets called out to bomb sights the angles give the viewers a whole picture of the situation. When bombs are discovered the close up angles show how challenging bomb disposal is. During the arguments between team members the camera goes back and forth to assist viewers follow the heated moments. Each scene uses angles to enhance the viewer's awareness of the situation and helps give the full picture of the circumstances. <br/><br/>An area of the techniques that really adds to the story is the sound effects used during this film. Warzones are loud and sounds help reinforce the chaos to the viewers. When the bomb explodes on James the sound effects show how powerful the explosive was. In a war movie sounds are needed to make the film realistic and this film uses every sound possible to help relay the situation to the viewers."

","Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman to win an Academy Award for Best Director for this film. The film is s testament about war and how it affects soldiers and civilians too. This film stars Jeremy Renner as William James, a military professional who defuses bombs. Renner does a brilliant job in his performance. He gives a gut wrenching performance. The cast is a superb ensemble. Bigelow doesn't shy away from the horrors of war and brutality of it. Bigelow doesn't sugarcoat the life of war in Iraq. There are heart wrenching scenes like being unable to defuse a bomb to save a man's life or the loss of a friend and local DVD seller Beckham, a young boy. It is hard watching the images of children living in a war zone. Bigelow deserved the award for showing the cruel brutality of war. There are no winners in war but only losers on both sides."

","In war, the people you try to make connections with could die at any time. The people you should connect with at home become remote anecdotes in your life. Your bloody job is all that's left. Thus is Kathryn Bigelow's lesson.<br/><br/>I have never been in the military, so those who have seen it first-hand must comment on the accuracy of ""The Hurt Locker."" Yet this film feels direct and close to the truth. There are not many adornments, besides what a changing constellation of three men in a bomb squad encounters week after week. The simplicity of reality is powerful in this film.<br/><br/>Yet it is not a documentary. Take the music, for example. A blend of natural sounds from crowd murmur to wind, the chop of helicopters, echoing mid-eastern music, and undertones of menacing deep sounds. It is not a conventional score, but it supports the emotions that arise while viewing this film quite well. It's not easy to find alternatives to the power of a full symphony orchestra when it comes to controlling viewer emotion, but the soundtrack by Jorgensen/Ministry provides such an alternative.<br/><br/>The story itself is linear, as the days in the field roll by in Humvees, and Sargeant James (Jeremy Renner), who loves his job more than anything else left in the world, pushes his squad to the limit. He will abandon the mission disabling a device locked to an Iraqi family man just before detonation, but nothing short of that will deter him. His own child is a total stranger, while an Iraqi teen who plays soccer with him is killed so a body bomb can be sown into his belly.<br/><br/>Paranoia is constant even if 99% of the strangers whose language you don't speak are actually friendly, just trying to get on with their lives. But 99% is not good enough. Could you take a 1% chance of death every day of your life? It's hard for someone who has never seen this up close to imagine what it might be like, but this film is about as good a jog for the imagination as you are going to find. It ranks high among war films because it refrains from glorifying or accusing, judging or preaching. It just lets its soldiers be. All you can be."

"xorayyrayyxo","8","1","2","10 September 2015"," The Hurt Locker
","The ""Hurt Locker"" is an American war film about a three-man bomb disposal team during the Iraq War. This movie specifically stuck in my head for various reasons. To start, I had to see this movie twice to fully comprehend the concept. The first time I watched the movie I was mainly paying attention to what the war scene looked like. Once I watched the movie for the second time I noticed the underlying concept being portrayed. I realized that this movie is about a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Sergeant William James believes he is solely meant to disable bombs and enjoys feeling that he has a purpose in life. Once his rotation ends and he returns home from war, James resumes living with his ex-wife and their infant son who both still live with him in his house. However, he is bored and disconnected from routine civilian life. One night, James confesses to his son that there is only one thing that he knows he loves. Thereafter, he starts another tour of duty as they are starting their 365-day rotation.<br/><br/>Finally realizing this very serious matter in the movie I was shocked to discover that most war veterans suffer from this disorder. This hit me hard and made me very upset. Once I discovered this I began to get very emotion at the end of the movie, yet it is not necessarily a sad ending. Sergeant James is happy to be getting back into service and disabling bombs. He does not feel pain or remorse returning war because he feels that it is his purpose in life. Therefore, I was a tad bit confused by the end of the movie. In my opinion, this is a movie that needs to be watched more than once to fully comprehend. I was shocked by the ending, yet moved in a way I have never felt before. It really opened my eyes to what veterans go through once returning home from war. I took this into consideration and view this topic in a whole different light. Overall, this movie had a very significant impact on me."

Sanborn shoots the enemy in a long distance battle. The men struggle as various random violence take a toll on them.<br/><br/>This is the big coming out party for director Kathryn Bigelow. She shows that woman directors can be simply directors and do a great intense war film. There is a randomness to the whole situation. Jeremy Renner brings a devastating simple intensity to his performance. He doesn't give the American hero version. It's more matter-of-fact. The situations and the places are dripping with a sense of paranoia. Danger lurks at every corner. The confused world never lets go. This is a visceral experience more than a plot driven story."

","Nothing that I write here is any kind of comment on the actual military operation in Iraq, nor on those involved: it's purely reflections on the movie.<br/><br/>I don't know what I was expecting except that the film was to do with IOD management in a war zone. It does, to my limited understanding of the subject, a reasonable job in that respect.<br/><br/>What spoiled it for me was the almost comedic gung-ho attitude displayed by most of the soldiers and in particular the over-use of the hand held camera.<br/><br/>The latter is a hobby horse of mine, but almost all the modern directors seem to be enthralled with this clichéd technique, usually in totally inappropriate movies.<br/><br/>Hand held camera-work has its place - and that place is when the story is being told as if from the viewpoint of, for example, a news cameraman in a firefight. It gives authenticity to the sequences. All too often it is used indiscriminately in films that have absolutely no use for it, and is merely irritating.<br/><br/>(I was going to see Captain Phillips last week, until I saw a review that mentioned the director's signature hand held camera-work - I decided to give it a miss.)<br/><br/>The ironic thing about the Hurt Locker is that it is just the sort of story that IS appropriate for the technique. The trouble is that it is completely over the top: the shots are often so deliberately jerky that I was thinking more of my irritation than following the storyline.<br/><br/>It's a valid technique that is so often got wrong, in so many ways.

"lee_eisenberg","9","1","2","22 January 2013"," sad irony
","""The Hurt Locker"" was best known as the first Best Picture winner directed by a woman, but it deserves more analysis than that. The movie chillingly focuses on an EOD team in Iraq. The hand-held cinematography masterfully heightens the tension throughout the movie. If the movie has any real problem, it's that it doesn't directly criticize the US presence in Iraq. It focuses more on the the situation in which the EOD team constantly finds itself as it goes about its business. There are some really unpleasant scenes.<br/><br/>A sad irony is that Kathryn Bigelow went on to direct ""Zero Dark Thirty"", which apparently justifies torture by incorrectly depicting that torture led to the capture and execution of Osama bin Laden. We all agree that the world is better off without Osama bin Laden, but knowingly lying about what happened weakens your case, especially since torture produced some of the false evidence that Colin Powell used in his infamous speech at the UN ten years ago.<br/><br/>But on its own, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a very good movie. It was a real treat that Bigelow won Best Director over her former husband James Cameron (whose ""Avatar"" was apparently an excuse for nonstop CGI)."
"christophe92300","7","1","2","18 January 2013"," Lacked a real plot
","Kathryn Bigelow chose to base her movie on a bomb disposal team which is quite an original choice compared to other war features. She managed to film the mission of those soldiers with great realism: the photography is very good and emphasize perfectly the narration.<br/><br/>Overall, the scenario is a bit uneven: some scenes are ultra captivating whereas others are a bit heavy or too telegraphed. But the biggest problem is the lack of a real thread that greatly penalizes the movie. There is no real connexion between the scenes and the repetitiveness of the script becomes a bit weighty but also a bit tedious towards the end.<br/><br/>One can also deplore the lack of depth regarding the characters' psychology, when Jarhead for example managed to arouse a real empathy towards the soldiers.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it is tough to judge because although the actors' performances were solid, they were also very academic, in relation to the lack of depth of their characters."

Why are they taking such a sweet time in the desert waiting for more targets to come out? What is the point of the taxi driver wasting his time? Any logical reason for the main character taking his sweet time detonating bombs (i.e. taking out his gears for dumb reasons/talking/throwing his radio etc), won't the bomb possibly have timers installed? The terrorists must be either too rich or pretty stupid to leave TOO MANY bomb supplies and other 'valuables' behind in a building, facing only a troop with numbers you can count with your fingers... How did the main character came out unnoticed by security in the merchant's truck and return to camp the same way??

"matt-710-428307","7","1","2","22 August 2010"," Civilians praise it... Veterans hate it... why?
","It's interesting how this movie has received so much praise from civilians and almost universally bad reviews from Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. Most of those bad reviews from vets are hung up on the film's inaccuracies regarding military procedures and soldier behavior. Not being a veteran, I can't really affirm those criticisms, but I tend to believe them. Much of the film's depiction of the ""maverick"" Sgt. James character rang false to me, specifically the way he routinely put himself and his team in danger by disregarding procedure. He struck me less like a hero, and more like a psycho.<br/><br/>As I watched, though, it became clear the film also came to that conclusion. It wasn't trying to paint him as a hero or -- and this is what some vets miss, I think -- even a typical soldier. (e.g., note the portrayal of the two others in his team). Whether he was an adrenaline junkie addicted to combat, or simply so psychologically ravaged by it, Sgt. James was one messed- up dude. The fact he got the job done was in spite of, not because of, his recklessness. This is made patently obvious time and again. Sgt. James is an unstable man who happens to be really good and, thus far, really lucky at disarming improvised explosive devices.<br/><br/>War, like all intense human experiences, transforms those who endure it. Outsiders will never have the understanding of those who lived through it. Conversely, those who have experienced war firsthand often have difficulty looking at it from a broader perspective. The fact so many veterans who see this movie spot a list of things wrong with it certainly indicates that it is flawed. A film like this needs to do its homework and get the details right out of respect for those who actually served. However, as a speculation on how the intensity of combat -- particularly the twisted guerrilla-insurgency of Afghanistan and Iraq -- might warp a man's mental state in a self-destructiveness that could be mistaken for heroism, ""The Hurt Locker"" makes some interesting points. <br/><br/>I wonder how all those veterans bothered by its inaccuracies would have received this movie were it based not on a real, current conflict theater but some other hypothetical urban war zone. If this weren't Iraq in 2004, but, say, the West Bank in 2015, I think the underlying themes of the film might come through with less interference. <br/><br/>-- mm"

","Kathryn Bigelow's opening sequence is, in every sense of the word, mesmerizing. If you want to know how to create tension and atmosphere then you could learn a thing or two from the first 15 minutes on offer here. Unfortunately the next two hours can't quite replicate its success, falling just short of capturing the same exhilarating levels that set the film in motion. It is still a tightly wound and uncompromising look at life as a bomb technician mind you; the depth afforded to the story drags us into SFC James' unfamiliar and peculiar world – but what an intriguing world it is – and we come out the other end with an understanding of what it takes, mentally and physically, for someone to do such a dangerous and meticulous job. It helps that Marco Beltrami's thumping and pulsating score reverberates through your body with every note and essentially acts as another character.<br/><br/>When Bigelow sticks with the things that go boom, Locker shows why many critics have scored it a chance to the win the big prize at the Academy Awards this year. Gripping is an understatement when describing the numerous tasks undertaken by our risky protagonist, however, there are a few subplots that Bigelow should have left on the cutting room floor, like an unnecessary search and kill assignment at the end of the middle act. It's these small narrative excesses that stop Locker from being an instant classic, instead you'll just have to settle for bloody fantastic.<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for Jeremy Renner in the future. You may recognize him as the bad guy from S.W.A.T. or seen glimpses of his talent as a supporting player in The Assassination of Jesse James and North Country, but this is his first bona fide chance to show his acting chops. A BAFTA and SAG nomination (and eight wins on the smaller awards circuit) later, Renner doesn't disappoint. His enigmatic and charismatic portrayal of a man forever on the edge, yet always with a casual attitude, is tremendous to witness; the intensity he possesses is electric on screen. Anthony Mackie deserves a mention too as he is impressive in the far less flashy role of the by-the-book SGT Sanborn; arguably providing the only constant throughout the picture which is easily identifiable and relatable.<br/><br/>A powerhouse performance by leading man Renner and assured direction from Bigelow make this an absolute must-see on the big screen.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

We see the war in Iraq through the eyes of a bomb disposal crew. It is a micro view of a massive tragedy scarring the current generation of young American and British men who have been put ""in harm's way"", to use that awful euphemism for those who risk their lives for the dreams of silver haired politicians, many of whom made sure they were never in a place of greater harm than the golf course. <br/><br/>We learn in the first minute of the film that ""war is a drug"".

But those who get high on that particular drug, the 'wild men' who know they are alive when their lives are in great peril, lose something very precious. This is touched on seemingly in passing in the film, but is perhaps the main motif. <br/><br/>The three key actors are excellent in portraying that mix of despair and elation, courage and abject fear that perhaps have been the soldiers' lot since time immemorial. In particular the acting of Jeremy Renner, as staff sergeant William James, is powerfully convincing. <br/><br/>Some moments in this film create a tension as high as that of the most eloquent work of Hitchcock or Michael Mann. The enemy are ever present because any ordinary citizen of Iraq could be that enemy. Yet Bigelow avoids making these enemies super villains; they are just the other side in a life destroying endeavour that the film does not seek to explain, because for the troops on the ground, such explanation is virtually futile. <br/><br/>For me this film is a perfect example of its genre, the intelligent war movie, and deserves to be seen widely and thought about deeply."

This must surely go down in history as the most undeserving best picture EVER. I have never served in the military but even I could see all the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in this film. Dear Kathryn if you are going to make a wildly inaccurate war film make something along the lines of 'Inglorious Basterds' don't put it in such a contemporary and closely scrutinized setting. There must have been technical experts working on this film? I can only think they sabotaged this film intentionally. This film is about on par with TV episodes of 'Combat' or 'McHales Navy' except they were entertaining. I'm probably overstating this films short comings but my expectations were so high it really was disappointing how little entertainment factor there was.<br/><br/>Just read some more of the other negative reviews here and I now wonder if a petition can be made to have the Oscar stripped from this embarrassment.

"darashiko-1","Null","2","7","12 May 2010"," The bomb to crush the invader's mind-shells
","The Hurt locker is a war movie. The story is set on Iraq. However, perhaps it's not like the other Hollywood war films showing the heroism of the Americans in the war field in the midst of insurgents and terrorists. But it couldn't avoid the influence of Hollywood completely and the film is criticized by none but the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan War. Mark Boal is the writer of the film who was embedded as a freelance journalist with US Army in Iraq in 2004 and based on his gained experience, he wrote the story. Kathryn was familiar with Mark and both the two planned to produce a film since then. The story of the hurt locker is also set on 2004 but the thing that makes it distinctive from the other war movies, especially from the other Iraq and Afghanistan war movies is that the story is about the activities and uncertainties of a military bomb squad known as Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Perhaps it's the only film that deals with bomb squads in war deployed areas. James Renner is the protagonist here who is the leader of a bomb squad consisting of three members. The two others are Sergeant Sanborn and specialist Eldridge whose responsibility is to communicate with radio and cover with rifle respectively. Disarming bombs are not easy since a single mistake can cause hundreds of deaths. It's not easy detecting the detonator hiding in a big car, nor a civilian containing a hidden bomb. James is replaced with Sergeant Thompson who was killed by a bomb blast while disarming. But James is experienced, he worked in Afghanistan too, he is somewhat reckless. His method of disarming bombs makes the members anxious, he doesn't answer to the radio while working, and he takes risk very easily. During a raid in a warehouse, James found a dead body of a teenage boy, aged 13-14 who has been surgically implanted a bomb in his belly. According to James, it was the boy Beckham who sells DVDs to the US soldiers and played soccer with him. James became emotional; he tried to find the killers forcing another civilian finding Beckham's house but failed. Later, James with his team members pursued two insurgents responsible for a recent explosion. In this mission, Eldridge got shot in his leg but James and Sanborn were successful to kill the insurgents. James joined the team 38 days before the leave. In a mission of disarming the unexploded time-bomb strapped to an Iraqi civilian, James failed and this makes Sanborn emotional to confess that he is not ready to die now and he wishes to have a son. The Hurt locker is a low budget indie film. Indie films, short for independent films, are financed by a single firm or person, Kathryn financed the movie. This low budget didn't hinder achieving its success rather it proves again that big budget movies are not always successful by keeping Avatar behind. The hurt locker is a successful movie, no doubt, but perhaps not successful in earning general moviegoer's recognition. It's the second most positively reviewed movie in 2009 and almost all critics praised highly. However, the veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq didn't go with them. It's another war movie like Platoon, Apocalypse Now with a newer dimension. ""It is disrespectful"", said Rieckhoff, the director and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). His points are important revealing that the story lacks less research. Although the movie tried to show the psychological situation of the soldiers working in Iraq, it failed to portray accurately. It's another Hollywood version of the war. The writer Mark Boal worked hard writing and combining information to make a good story but he failed to identify the right uniform although he was working there in 2004. This is a simple mistake but the team of three did everything – raiding warehouses, shooting the insurgents with sniper, pursuing the insurgents as well as disarming the bombs. Thus, James became nothing but a war junky, sniper, commando hero who relied on no one. Less than one percent of the total population is working in Iraq and the other 99 percent population are dependent on the movies to get the real picture. If it is the Hollywood version of the Iraq war, like any other 'American-Heroism-Hollywood' movies, then who would reveal the real picture? Question may arise that why the movie is selected for Oscar? Its IMDb rating is only 7.1 containing 65 thousand votes of the viewers. US government has been facing fierce protest against the aggression on Iraq and Afghanistan in the name of 'war against terrorism'. It can be like that awarding a movie on Iraq war will keep the demonstrators quiet for some time. But we don't want to think like that. We believe the film connoisseurs, like the artists and writers around the world, are also against all types of invasion in any corner of the world. This movie is nothing but a major weapon to hit the decision makers who are unable to understand the feelings of the soldiers who are in the battle field. James returned home, to his wife and little child in the leave. But it was not his place; he could not love his little baby, or his pretty wife. He confessed to his little child that he was in love with war, so he returned Iraq again in a 365-day mission as an EOD team member with Delta group. The film began with a quotation adapted from the best seller book 'War is a Force that gives us Meaning' saying, ""The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for WAR IS A DRUG"", perhaps best suited for the US government who sends the soldiers to the place of ultimate pain, to the hurt locker."
"dfle3","8","2","7","30 April 2010"," Good 'fly on the wall' type treatment of bomb disposal in Iraq...
","Many years ago I remember being a fan of the English TV series ""Danger: UXB"". It was about a unit in World War II who dismantled bombs dropped in raids by German planes on English soil.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker has a similar premise, except this time the unit is in enemy territory. It depicts a close unit who have to deal with a new bomb disposal expert...the new guy is taken to be a maverick.<br/><br/>Found this to be a good movie, but I'm not as big a convert to it as many critics, who give it full marks.<br/><br/>Generally the action seems quite realistic, but one sequence seemed improbable to me...when the maverick (Sergeant First Class William James, played by Jeremy Renner) takes his unit on a mission which wasn't part of their duties). Not sure if stuff like that really happens.<br/><br/>Otherwise a tense drama about the possibility of death at any moment. Unlike ""Green zone"", which was released around the same time as this movie in Australia, ""The hurt locker"" does not delve into the motivation for America's invasion of Iraq. Both movies have the same setting (Iraq) and are of the same time-frame. Green Zone is also a good movie...it's just more political."
"leslieyaggi","9","2","7","27 April 2010"," Adrenaline-filled movie with fantastic acting skills
","Kathryn Bigelow, director of The Hurt Locker, has a peculiar ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this compelling front line drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely abstains from the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unpopular job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who are assigned to communicate with James through a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IED's).<br/><br/>Sanborn and Eldridge are still disturbed from the sudden fatality of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce), when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his unusual antics. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original fearless indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a sequence of events, although in this case, her own singular sense of film-making boldness overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is an amazing actor when it comes to playing the part of James because he manages to deepen the character's assured attitude with every traumatizing episode, not requiring the commendation some desire. This is because he conveys both the adamant attentiveness and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the nervousness of a free-for-all combat zone.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully, exemplifying their characters' inner conflict in other ways. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more relatable angle, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially effective in his climactic declaration scene. It's like the 1986's ""Platoon"" in regards to how morally ambiguous the characters are. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. The most attractive parts of this movie are the different selections of high-tension scenes where director combines the outstanding performances, camera angles and movements with the cinematography and a crafted sound production. Barry Ackroyd caught the vivid, gleaming cinematography. This film effectively captures great action-packed scenes, skilled actors and actresses, and encapsulates the audience in this realistic combat setting."
"diane-34","9","2","7","12 March 2010"," More Iraq War than I ever want to see.
","I found this to be a very disturbing film because there were many references to the fact that some of the soldiers felt they should not be there and that it wasn't their war; the morale of the soldiers were at odds. I have no interest in the debacle of the Bush/Cheney war fostered on the American people so the question is legitimately asked, Why then did you go? The film, if it did not explore, at least it approached these questions. I found The Hurt Locker to be a memorable film in that there were scenes that will last a long time in the recesses of my poor mind; even now, some days after we attended, I can still see some of the hard scenes that composed much of the film. The ending where the explosives soldier knew that he had to return to Iraq, not because of patriotism but simply that his dangerous bomb disposal work had turned him into a danger junkie, like people that participate in dangerous sports. As I wrote at the beginning of this comment, ""a very disturbing film"". The Hurt Locker was an interestingly constructed film in that it was composed of pieces with, to me, little holding those pieces together. I saw numbingly dangerous incidents with little connective tissue; the film was very episodic, with those episodes of danger the substance of the film. I guess I ultimately found that manner of film making disturbing in that I wanted to see more of a film constructed like An Education, also up for Best Picture. But I did not make the film and I get mad at commentators who criticize a film because the film is not the way they think that it should have been made. The Hurt Locker throws light on an aspect of war that few of us would consider and yet, arguably, hidden bombs are the devices that cause the most hurt to western forces in Iraq and we, the observers, know little about this terrible aspect of modern warfare."

And that is worth an Oscar nomination? 'Give me a break', as you American fellows like to say.

However terribly worn out theme about heroic adventures of the American soldiers on a way of democratization of the world. I'm sorry, i'm not trying to offend anyone's feelings, but not all soldiers in modern conflict zones are such a heroes. Comparing to 'Redacted' in describing the soldiers' day-to-day routine, this movie almost shows us that war is actually not a worst thing that could happen to people, no matter if you're occupied or you are the occupier.

","The Hurt Locker is intense from the instant the curtain rises. The first scene primes you with energy that's explosive for the duration. Magnificently directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the movie never really sinks into those ""War Is Hell"" clichés, at least not very often, and also stays away from the politics of the Iraq conflict. The acting is as realistic as the action, so i guess the only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a lack of direction.<br/><br/>You know how you go to the bar and drink until something happens 'cause if you drink long enough something surely will? Not here. The flick begins full throttle so has nowhere to go from there and i eventually got bored of the bomb disarming scenes. If that's the story's point, that war is repetitive, the characters should have been more blasé than they were at the the end.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, despite this solitary dud, Kathryn Bigelow's obvious talent as a director makes The Hurt Locker a blast."

Focusing on the EOD team, the movie shows that through them.<br/><br/>Though i find some elements of the movie were strange. Apart from what I read from other comments. Don't EOD get any support? what is the point of having security forces there when all they do is sit there and wait. They could have helped secure the scenes (for instance: Body bomb scene where the army colonel psychologist got blown up). And don't EOD travel with security forces in a convoy rather than alone.

Bigelow's a visionary no doubt about it, she perfectly captures the emotional trauma and strain that soldiers are put through while keeping it tense enough to create an atmosphere that is stereotypical of most horrors.<br/><br/>The perfectly cast actors, constant sense of unending and foreboding tension and inter-twisted conflicts of loyalty in the characters, with one of the best female directors of this time make this an absolute war epic that really will highlight the impact of some not so everyday soldiers in brutal fashion."

","My first instinct when watching a movie about the U.S. Army is to join the crowd of checkers mentally noting all the things that don't agree with my experience. I have gradually learned to stifle this, realizing that even the most devoted filmmaker has to make some concessions to the understand of civilians. There's a language within the military that doesn't filter out very well to something as brief as a typical feature. I also know that a movie like ""The Hurt Locker"" isn't intended to be documentary.<br/><br/>However, as I watch ""The Hurt Locker"" barely a day after its win at the Oscars, I am interested to see how the movie weaves several vignettes in a cohesive story, and it manages to show several different types of experiences that soldiers have in the cities in Iraq - the uncertainty of each moment, the complacency that one has to fight during the last days in country. More, it shows a lot of different approaches to dealing with the potential threats - some good, some bad, but mostly just mediocre in varied ways.<br/><br/>The main characters, the three members of the explosive ordnance team, are believable. One is bravado with a layer or two underneath, another the strict rulebook soldier and the third just looking for some direction and the plane headed south.<br/><br/>In its essence, the images and the filming of this movie are refreshingly and disturbingly accurate. In its details, it brings together very rare experiences into a very small team of soldiers, which makes it seem as if every soldier has days like these - rolling through the city of Baghdad in a single truck, coming home to some whiskey, occasionally alluding to trips to brothels. I can say some of these things happen more often than others, but rarely to the same person in such close succession.<br/><br/>But again, this is Hollywood, capturing the most interesting possibilities of the place and the characters, and creating a mood and setting that supports it.

I won't delve into the Military accuracy and realistic values of this as i am no expert, but i think people who are picking up this film to watch after hearing about the Oscars still need to keep an open mind and not hold such soaring high expectations. It may also be the fact that some viewers and fans of the war genre (like myself) are a little too used to the World War 2 large, epic scenes of battle, for example the masterpiece that is Saving Private Ryan. The Hurt Locker is a war movie set in the present day, and this is modern war...very different to past times and therefore having no massive battles or thousands of men in one scene which is commonly associated with 'war movies'. Instead, it delivers in different more compact but still adrenaline pumping ways, and it works exactly how it was made to do so.

","Blessed with an insightful script by journalist Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has finally found superior material to apply her talents, and the result is a seminal war film set in Iraq. This is not the spectacle of war in broad strokes but rather an intimate point of view. As such, it provides a very personal, visceral experience.<br/><br/>In the middle of the Iraq War, Sgt. J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) welcomes a replacement for a fallen comrade. The new soldier, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), is a quirky soul whose specialty is disarming bombs. 38 days are left for Bravo Company as the group sets out to diffuse a bomb. While an automated robot might be appropriate, James insists on doing the job himself and finds a booby trap in the city streets. After a tense period and an unexpected surprise, he is successful but not before spooking Sanborn and the other soldiers nearby. His boldness and gambling has serious consequences for his comrades.<br/><br/>James is a loose cannon, but does he have a death wish? He has the emotional and physical scars from war, and he lives and breathes bombs to the point of keeping bomb parts as souvenirs. He is addicted to the job, and war gives his life meaning. He is the perfect war junkie. It's a high stress existence and the only person a soldier can rely on is his fellow soldier. These men bond amid difficult life and death situations while there is barely a shot fired. This is most definitely not Audie Murphy's kind of war.<br/><br/>The risks escalate when a car loaded with explosives is set afire and as James tries to disarm the device, the soldiers attract a lot of attention from the locals who may or may not be innocent observers. It becomes a precarious situation by the minute as James' expertise is tested to the limit. We witness the risks of guerilla warfare as threats come from around any street corner.<br/><br/>As days melt down to hours, the tension becomes almost unbearable, and you can feel the anxiety and fear in these men. There is an arduous sequence as the group gets pinned down by deadly sniper fire amid an oppressive sun. Later, a heartbreaking scene has James attempting to defuse a bomb strapped to an innocent civilian pleading for his life. It's a desperate task as the seconds tick away. The emotions and the impossibility of the situation make for a compelling moment.<br/><br/>James has a wife and son back home where he discovers some truths about himself. Finding civilian life difficult to adjust to, he realizes the one thing makes him feel alive, and that is a tour of duty.<br/><br/>Some notable actors like Ralph Feinnes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly appear in what are essentially throwaway cameos. Mackie is good as a soldier whose priorities in life change dramatically through his deployment, and Brian Geraghty registers as a young soldier who cannot wait to return safely to the states. But it is Renner who excels in the difficult role of a gifted, but troubled soldier.<br/><br/>Bigelow has always been adept at films (Point Break, Blue Steel) with lead characters under extreme duress, and she milks each bomb sequence with measured, tightly edited cuts to agonizingly prolong and heighten the suspense. She is schooling the public with pure cinematic technique. We feel a bit detached from these men not because they are not well drawn but because the film tries to show events in a semi-documentary way especially in its generous use of hand-held cameras that give the feel of news footage.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film. It feels episodic at times, and perhaps that is the point: that war can be a series of moments of danger and uncertainty. Also, we never fully realize or understand what makes James tick. We know he is drawn to his job and is very good at what he does. But we never see into his psyche's attraction to this profession beyond the adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>While the film may not accurately portray military tactics or protocal, it does capture the human emotions of impossibly difficult tasks amid a hostile environment. Credit the filmmakers for exploring a fascinating aspect of warfare. In terms of driving home the fear and effects of war on the common soldier, few films have ever been better."
"siderite","9","2","8","27 September 2009"," A Really cool film
","It is not often I stumble upon a movie that is so well thought out as this one. Initially I thought I would not watch it, being about Iraq I had expected a lot of bull, even joked about how cool it would be to make a movie about a German squad having to live amongst the French, not knowing whether they are foe or not. However, this movie was great, following the lives of people in a bomb squad in Iraq, as they are worming their way through the 40 days of company rotation left.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good things in this film. One of them is the casting. At least three well known actors that have accepted playing in the movie, but their roles are only a few minutes long, more like cameos. This solves the problem of knowing exactly who lives and who dies just by looking up their IMDb rating. Another is that the characters in the film are all flawed in some way. They are not the perfect good guys, so boringly unrealistic in many movies of the genre.<br/><br/>But what I thought was most important of all, is the capturing of the feeling of the place, without gluing the audience to a single character to which to identify. It is the same thing that made me love Strange Days, also directed by Kathryn Bigelow. This movie is great because it feels like a book and a precious few films manage to achieve this feat."
"pbrinnel","6","2","8","28 July 2009"," Style With Little Substance
","With no explanation The Hurt Locker starts off amidst a moment of extraordinary anxiety. A U.S. bomb-squad task force is in the midst of weighing their options. Just a few hundred yards ahead of them on an abandoned Iraqi street lies potential instantaneous death. It is their job to approach it, disarm it, and return to base unscathed. This fear of death looms over the scene. Little noise is heard aside from light dialogue. Although the set is simple, the visuals are a complex blend of real and imagined anxiety. The camera, to great effect, is tremendously shaky. It helps to transport us inside these men's minds. The barren landscapes all appear to be minefields, ridden with a million ways to die, and no expectation of forewarning. Visually, this is without a doubt one of the most immersive war films ever made.<br/><br/>After this first scene we get to meet the characters. After being made to feel each and every nuance of perturbation from their perspective, you'd think that there would be something equally engaging going on under the hood. Unfortunately, with lines of dialogue like, ""Every time we go out it's life or death; we roll the dice,"" the characters we are made to care so much about quickly devolve into shallow stereotypes.<br/><br/>You can read the full review I wrote on The Hurt Locker at http://cfilmc.com/the-hurt-locker/"

"smoky_circles","10","3","16","18 March 2010"," Excellent movie but is it misunderstood?
","I saw this movie when it first came out, and absolutely loved it -- that is, my opinion, expressed below, is not swayed by hype, awards, etc. That said, I'm surprised that this movie is getting so much flack in the comments here. Many are complaining that this movie is not realistic: very few movies/ war movies/ movies about war are, but since many of us are actually living through the Iraq war, it is easy to point out inaccurate details. Still, it's a movie, it should NOT be taken as a documentary. (Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket: which of these is at all realistic?). And if one ignores the inaccuracies, this movie is absolutely amazing. For me, although it remained silent politically and morally, it really bluntly addressed the question that almost 99% of all action movies avoid to answer honestly: it answered the question, ""why do they do it?"" Countless (hollywood) movies are devoted ONLY to the depiction of the conquest of a powerful male over an equally powerful enemy. Their motivation can be anything from altruism to saving a loved one. Hurt Locker answered this question in a rather original way (ie, they do it because they like it -- war is a drug). For the people who say it is boring -- I can only imagine that they thought ice cream was boring when they were children. The scene where James pulls up a wire-- and five bombs, connected to it, surface...and then he says ""interesting"" -- that scene is amusing, hilarious and cutting in how tense it is. It is a great scene among many other great scenes. Take the famous slow motion explosion as well. When you look at a mediocre movie like Sherlock Holmes, where a massive explosion makes you feel nothing visceral or mental, and when you look at the showering and ripples of gravel in the explosion in the hurt locker, you know which movie towers over the other. I am also very surprised by the subjectivity of judgment this movie is inducing in people. Comments are either complaining about the movie depicting soldiers as loathsome and brutal, or as overly cool and virtuous. To me, the characters were neither truly good nor evil, and very much built around the idea of an action movie (in fact, one can say that Hurt Locker is more about the idea of an action movie than it is about the Iraq war). They do not express tender emotions, and their morals are largely the morals of someone built for war and conflict: they do not shrink from fighting and killing. Sure, these are the traits of psychopaths, but they are really the hallmarks of most action movies, except most action movies also have another thing to balance out the bloodlust: the people being killed are ""evil."" Hurt Locker is not a contemplative movie, it is not uplifting, and it not the depiction of a fight between good and evil. It is a depiction of pure conflict and violence, from an arbitrary side and of a more or less arbitrary individual. My best guess is that this movie annoyed people because there was no one really to root for or comfortably identify with. Greenzone (which is a darn good movie) might be better for them, I guess."
"orionhi","1","2","9","21 March 2019"," What a bomb!
","First of all, why did the director feel it necessary to show injured animals? I found that totally disturbing and was inclined to turn the movie off after seeing cats hurt and limping in the first five minutes. That had nothing to do with the plot or the events of the moment. It was the opening credits! That actually angered me, it's obvious that it's a desperate situation there and people are being hurt and killed. There was no reason at all to show animals being hurt and killed also!
I found so much of the movie totally unbelievable. Right from the start James acts with impunity, no communication with his team, a rogue warrior. What a crock! Then he takes off on his private mission to avenge some kid he bought a dvd from? And another private mission and gets his little buddy shot and still no consequence.
I cannot imagine how this won an award for anything. The academy awards has no credibility, this was an ""empowering woman director "" moment. Nothing more"
"manicman84","8","2","9","25 March 2010"," a suspenseful war movie riddled with sadness and desperation
","The Hurt Locker is something of a rarity, feature war movie set in Iraq that actually works, even though it doesn't tell anything new. Director Kathryn Beigelow (Strange Days) conters on a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst violent conflict. Scriptwriter Mark Boal was a member of such a team and although the story is said to be entirely fictional, one can't stop wondering if there are any autobiographical elements. Boal's script is unpredictable and challenging offering many unexpected twists and turns. It doesn't try to tell the story, but presents us only with daily routines of the squad entirely doomed with tragic unpredictability. I've always considered Bigelow as a splendid director. In The Hurt Locker her direction is flawlessly detached when she examines the conflicts between the soldiers and effectively polished when she deals with suspense-ridden sequences. The acting is another highlight. Jeremy Renner as indifferent to death, yet vulnerable Staff Sergeant James gives a complex performance, perhaps the best in his career. Anthony Mackie and Brian Garaghty are totally believable as well. The movie quite effectively shows how the relations between these three soldiers change in the course of time. To conclude, The Hurt Locker is a suspenseful war movie riddled with sadness and desperation. It deserves to be seen."
"judiekaynorris","10","1","3","19 March 2017"," To be a soldier of war... can you imagine what it's like?
","To be a soldier of war... Can you imagine what it's like? Sergeant William James, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn, and Specialist Owen Eldridge are not just soldiers, but are the leading members of a bomb- disposal unit in Baghdad. These courageous men, alongside a team of others, fearlessly work together to defeat all obstacles set by a team of insurgents seeking to destroy the city with explosives. Despite the risks, they work towards disarming their enemies to protect the innocent lives of those living in Baghdad. Can you imagine what it must be like to look death in the face and wink?<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is an enthralling war film that is directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Kathryn Bigelow is a popular filmmaker known for her incredible visuals and heart-pounding action sequences; In 2009, Kathryn became the first woman to win an Academy Award for best director for The Hurt Locker (Bigelow, 2014). The main characters of The Hurt Locker are Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who are joined by four men in combat, Colonel John Cambridge (Christian Camargo), Contractor Team Leader (Ralph Fiennes), Colonel Reed (David Morse), and Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce).<br/><br/>The film depicts an action-packed journey of a battle between the soldiers of Iraq and the United States. Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), an experienced bomb disposer, is called to take the place of the bomb squad's former leader, who tragically lost his life on duty. Unlike the bomb squad's former leader, Sgt. William James soon earns himself a reckless and wild reputation; his reckless actions soon push his subordinates, Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge against him. In efforts of saving both the bomb squad and a desperate country, the team must put aside their differences to fight the grueling war that is ahead of them. <br/><br/>Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are the main soldiers who assist Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) with bomb disposal missions. Though they differ greatly in personality, the two work exceptionally well together in assisting James with each mission. Sanborn, ""the professional"" of the group, can be seen constantly scanning the area for snares and enemies; he can also be seen helping equip James for bomb defusing missions. Sanborn acts as an aggressor in the group, and is quick in making judgments. Eldridge is different; he is insecure and timid in nature. He acts more as a leader than a follower. Unlike James, Eldridge does exactly what he is told; fear paralyzes him from doing anything else. <br/><br/>Like the movie, Saving Private Ryan, The Hurt Locker portrays the overall devotion that a soldier has in serving the country, as well as the communication barriers that soldiers face when working on a team. For instance, in the movie Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers working to save Private Ryan could not advance as a team until they agreed together as a group. Likewise, in The Hurt Locker, Sanborn was responsible for setting aside his differences with James to win the war. Both films depict the patriotism of such soldiers and show the struggles they may face with communication.<br/><br/>Two filming techniques that were used to enhance the quality of The Hurt Locker are shot angles and lighting. Because each scene took place in a different location, Establishing shots were taken from high perspectives and were used to show an area that action was taking place; Point of View shots were used by showing events through a rifle's scope. In using lighting technique, there was minimal use of artificial light used to display night scenes. Because there was minimal use of artificial light, it helped create a more realistic atmosphere for the scenery of the film.<br/><br/>Can you imagine what it's like to be a solider of war? As stated by website article, The Hurt Locker, by Roger Ebert, ""Bigelow uses no phony suspense-generating mechanisms in this film. No false alarms. No gunge ho. It is about personalities in terrible danger. The suspense is real, and it is earned. Hitchcock said when there's a bomb under a table, and it explodes, that's action. When we know the bomb is there, and the people at the table play cards, and it doesn't explode, that's suspense"" (2009). The Hurt Locker does an effective job of depicting the patriotism of soldiers and showing the struggles they face with communication.<br/><br/>References Kathryn Bigelow. (April, 02, 2014).

"winopaul","3","1","3","28 February 2016"," Pointless and implausible
","The Hurt Locker is to war what Interstellar is to space, totally divorced from reality. I can forgive technical inaccuracy. I just watched Company of Heroes and thought it was half-decent even though it was full of mistakes. And its cinematography was far better, bless their Red One and a tripod.<br/><br/>The shaky-cam might look OK on a field monitor while you shoot, or on a 27-inch TV, but I was getting dizzy looking at it on my 70-incher. I would be nauseous watching it in a theater. Newbie mistake, like setting up 4 cameras because the director lacks the self-confidence to plan the scene like Hitchcock did. I pity the editor-- 200 hours of film to wade through to try and stitch together a movie.<br/><br/>The movie is pointless, with no coherent plot. That some reviewers think it is pro-war when Bigelow intended it to be anti-war evinces her incompetence. Maybe its abstract film, where the viewer supplies the meaning because the director can't be bothered to. Like Interstellar, this move is drama porn. Regular porn is sex scenes tied together with a weak or laughable plot. Drama porn is dramatic scenes tied together with a weak or laughable plot. As many soldiers have commented, nothing the characters do makes any sense. Why the hell would a bomb disposal crew be out riding alone in the high desert? Its so they can have the wildly implausible sniper scene. Why are they called out to suicide bomber that is still alive? To add to the drama. In reality, that clown would have been shot the second he was perceived to be a threat. I thought that Hollywood had passed its cocaine phase. This flick was like ""chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah and let's have them pinned down by a sniper!"" ""chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah dude, rad, and lets have them help a suicide bomber!"" ""chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Whoa dude, so awesome, and lets have them chase some bad guys into an alley!"" ""chop chop chop.... snoooorrrt.... Yeah dude, oh man, and lets have him go into a local's house with no backup!"" Totally, I am sure the room was electric.<br/><br/>This film is implausible. That suicide scene. What idiot enemy would go to that trouble and waste that much explosives when they know its likely to only kill one guy? What sniper hides in a shed with no escape route? And do effete Hollywood writers really believe a little fresh blood will jam a Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle?"
"SquigglyCrunch","10","1","3","30 December 2015"," Incredible
","I went into the movie a little worried. Having watched it when I was younger and falling asleep maybe twenty minutes in I wondered if it would actually be worth it. I'm happy to say that it was absolutely fantastic. <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a different kind of war movie. It's not completely focused on the fighting, it's focused on a lot of the behind-the- scenes stuff, primarily disarming bombs. Although there is still shooting and the such, bombs are the primary focus. Already the idea is something that we don't see a lot in war movies, which is always a good thing. <br/><br/>The characters are fantastic. With there only being three major characters and an over 2 hour run-time, you certainly get to the know them. They all feel human, which isn't something we see in movies a lot these days. During the beginning of the movie I was just hoping that they wouldn't pull the whole 'kill all the main characters off at the end' gimmick that is far too common in war movies, but as the movie progressed I could certainly see some potential major deaths coming, and I was much more willing to accept it than I would be in other war movies. <br/><br/>The movie, surprisingly, manages to be funny. One of the characters in particular is like this, and it adds to the whole feel of them being human. In other movies like this it seems like everyone's dead serious all the time, but I know that if I were in some of these situations I'd try to crack a joke here and there, and that's what the characters did. <br/><br/>My only complaint was that my blu-ray copy was somehow slightly scratched so it skipped about a 30 seconds of the movie twice. That's no fault of the content though, just of those who used it before me. <br/><br/>Overall The Hurt Locker is fantastic. It's rare to come across movies like this, where the greatness just completely catches us off guard. There's barely anything that I didn't like about this movie, and in the end I would recommend it to everyone. It's absolutely fantastic."

"bakerr03","10","1","3","9 February 2014"," War Affects Everyone Differently
","""The Hurt Locker"" is an action packed war film that follows an Army bomb squad that is called in to detonate IEDs in the Iraqi War. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, you see just how dangerous their job is. After losing their ""expert"" bomb detonator on a mission, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are left to cope with losing one of their closest friends and be prepared to have a completely different leader. Specialist Eldridge and Sergeant Sanborn were in for a rude awakening when they met their new leader, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) that has taken over as the lead detonator since the passing of their previous leader. Upon their first mission, the two see just how different their new ""bomb expert"" is. It's quickly noticed that Sergeant First Class James is the best of the best and very arrogant in the way he does things. The film has a very common theme that proves how war has different affects on those involved. Some will thrive off of the action; others will feel guilty being alive, while others will want to change their life for the better when they finally land home. <br/><br/>As the film progresses, you follow the soldiers from scene to scene where they are required to investigate and detonate any bombs. You can quickly see throughout the entire film how Specialist Eldridge and Sgt. Sanborn do not approve of Sergeant First Class James approach to disarming the bombs. To Sgt. First Class James, disarming bombs was almost like a game. He would do it carelessly and many times put his teammates at risk. As you can imagine, tension is high while in a war zone but even more intense when dealing with detonating bombs and having your life put at risk by a crewmember. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, does a great job of making the audience feel like they are apart of the action. The filmmaker does an outstanding job with different angles and point of views with seamless editing. Throughout the movie you are literally on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. The angles rotate between the views of the solider looking around to what the solider is actually seeing. Along with the angles and seamless editing between the shots, the sound is unreal. You can literally hear everything going on as if you were on the battlefield yourself. You can hear everything from the soldiers walking, to the guns being shot off, to the squeaking of a cars trunk, you can literally hear it all around you at all times which makes you feel like you are part of the action and give you a perspective as to why these soldiers feel the way they do about war. <br/><br/>The film is just like many other movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" where those on the battlefield can take the job so differently. In ""The Hurt Locker"" you follow a solider who feels guilty that his leader was killed in combat and feels like he could have prevented that from happening; constantly asking himself why is he still alive, he should be the one dead. To another solider who has realized through this experience that he is ready to go home and have a family and live the ""American Dream."" To someone who thrives off the suspense and challenge of being a bomb detonator and is something he always wants to do even if that means leaving his wife and kid behind. War isn't for everyone but for some it's a ""drug"" that they cant get away from. While wars are never a good thing, sometimes its what keeps certain individuals sane. The film is very insightful and action packed from start to finish. It is definitely a film I would recommend to all moviegoers that love and action packed, suspense thriller."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","3","18 October 2013"," One two hour long adrenaline rush
","The quote at the beginning of this movie defines pretty much what this movie is about and that is that war is a drug. There have been a number of books and films that have explored this theme, and The Hurt Locker is not necessarily the best (though it is one wild adrenaline rush anyway) and it will not necessarily be the last. Which reminds me that I really should put Apocalypse Now on my to watch list because that film has a very similar theme to this one.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is not necessarily a pro or anti Iraq War film, but rather it is a film that simply looks at what is. In fact the only reason that it is set in Iraq is because that is the war that we are most familiar with, and it is also the war in which we will encounter a number of veterans. However, there is little difference in nature between this war any the countless of other wars that have been raged over the Earth. The sad fact is is that soldiers who fight in wars have great difficulty readjusting from war to be able to settle back into civilian life.<br/><br/>The film follows the exploits of an elite bomb disposal squad in Iraq, and it is filmed in such a way that the film feels a lot more real than not. The camera shakes, the sounds of Bagdad are heard in the background, and the actors are able to play their roles as if they were real people as opposed to an actor simply playing some imaginary character for some big screen movie. The other thing is that the explosions came across as a lot more realistic as well."

We'll start at the beginning, from the start of the film to the end, it was suspenseful and at the very least Bigelow kept us at the edge of our seats. With each bomb diffusion that was shown, you couldn't leave because you never knew when bombs were going to go off and how. The acting and directing was excellent with the highlights coming from Jeremy Renner who had a career changing performance (remember how his highlight was the turncoat in S.W.A.T. before this film). Anthony Mackie and the other guy did a hell of a job as the team who has to deal with Renner along with them coming to terms with a loss (to avoid spoilers I won't tell you who and when it takes place). The only flaw that can be pointed out is some of the realism that could be missing in regards to how soldiers handle themselves in war time locations and the procedures that they follow regarding situations like this. Saying that, until I contact my cousin (served two tours in Iraq and was wounded twice, one was ironically from a car bomb. By the way, God bless him and all who serve to allow us to write about things we love), my opinion of this film will not change."

Better yet the movie follows a character that is willing to do whatever it takes to disarm a bomb regardless of whether or not his own life is put in danger.<br/><br/>Emotion- This movie follows 3 EOD officers during their tour in Iraq. It looks at the struggles they face, including but not limited to the deaths of a commanding officer, a friend, a young boy, and a helpless civilian. It also focuses on each characters individual struggles and fears. Such as Owen's fear of dying, Will's fear and confusion in life outside of a war zone, and Sanborn's fear that he will never get the chance to start a family or move on from his life in the war.<br/><br/>This film accomplished action and emotion during a time of war without being biased. Bigelow and Boal do not show support for war in Iraq nor do they advocate against it. I think that is a feat within itself simply because it is such a politically and culturally charged topic."
"estreet-eva","6","1","3","5 December 2011"," A movie-making accomplishment but more immersive than compelling.
","""The Hurt Locker"" may take the Best Movie Oscar but it will be more for being a well-made simulacrum of the murderous tension of disarming ?IEDs? in a hostile combat situation rather than for the riveting series of plot development. Following the reckless anti-hero William James, played with a convincing dead-behind-the-eyes zealotry by Jeremy Renner, into a series of bomb disarming and other combat scenarios makes initially for engrossing viewing. However, after you accept that he isn?t wildly concerned if he, or his fellow soldiers, get killed they do tend to be less riveting as the film goes on. The remainder of the plot largely deals with his unreasonable need to avenge an Iraqi street kids who he knows only briefly. All-in-all a well made film but not somewhat overrated."
"pfgpowell-1","Null","1","3","7 September 2011"," Neither fish nor fowl, and that is the essence of a very real problem with this film
","I watch a film and then, for better or worse, look through several reviews here on IMDb. I like to think that none influences me. First, I look at the 'I hated it' category because, oddly, it gives you some perspective on the criteria of how a film is being judged. Then I look at the 'I loved it' category. This, too, is helpful, though not quite as one might initially imagine. Haters and lovers seem both to be at the extremes and, as a general rule, their views can be taken with a pinch of salt. Finally, I look at the most recent reviews, in the assumption that the dust has settled somewhat and that passions, either way, will have cooled. Usually that strategy is quite helpful in clarifying one's thoughts. But in the case of The Hurt Locker none of the reviews, or rather none I read, came anywhere close to touching upon my criticisms. And these are quite complex and touch upon the very essence of film-making (and, believe me, I really hope this doesn't sound pretentious). There are documentaries and then there are films, and once upon a time it was, usually, stylistically easy to distinguish the one from the other. Films, once, were stagy. Documentaries were, once, immediate. And the essence of both, both visually and aurally, was reflected in the style of film-making. But with technologically advance, in filming and sound recording, the obvious distinction between the two has become very blurred. Hand-held cameras and radio recording have allowed the film-maker making the 'commercial' film to produce what is essentially fiction and make it look pretty realistic. And that is the problem. And The Hurt Locker is a very good case in point. It has long been argued that 'dramatic fiction' can get pretty close to the truth. Well, I'm sure it can. But your average punter, sitting in the cinema or watching a DVD has no way of knowing what exactly is what. He is perfectly entitled to ask him or herself: just how truthful is what I am watching? And the pertinent point is that he or she has absolutely no way of knowing. Complete cobblers can look pretty realistic, and satirists have made good use of the fact. So in The Hurt Locker, what is what? Is this fiction? Is this 'dramatic fiction'? Is this more or less en par with documentary. I don't know. And neither do you. One criticism levelled at the film by several of the 'haters' underlines the dilemma: where (the haters ask) is the story? What's the plot? Ms Bigelow might well respond that she was more interested in portraying 'dramatic truth'. Fair enough. But how are we, the punter munching popcorn in the Mid-West or watching the film on a laptop, able to pass judgement? Are we judging another piece of entertainment? Are we just 'enjoying a film'? Are we, on the other hand, seeing what it was like to be an American or Brit soldier serving in Iraq after the war? We just don't know. But your average punter being your average punter, he or she (but given the subject matter far more likely he) will draw quite a few conclusions about 'the war in Iraq' which could well be true and, equally, could well be complete cobblers. The vital point is that we don't know and never will be in a position to know. And that is the problem Ms Bigelow faces. There are further, more profound, problems. The producers weren't, I should think, financing a truthful portrayal of the work the 'Allies' were doing in Iraq. They were, whatever Ms Bigelow managed to portray, financing what, at the end of the day, was intended to turn a buck or two, or three, or four. If, in the process, Ms Bigelow as managed to portray an honest and accurate account of the Western forces' work in Iraq, all well and good. So long as the dollars roll in. And if, on the other hand, she has, despite her work's documentary appearance, simply produced just another gung-ho war film, fair enough. So long as the dollars roll in. The point is that we, the viewer have no way of knowing. And it is that, the viewer's dilemma, which really does count. The Hurt Locker is immensely watchable. But that, at the end of the day, says pretty much nothing at all."
"neil-476","8","1","3","8 May 2011"," Pretty good, but not easy
","I was late getting to The Hurt Locker - I'd wanted to see it at the cinema, but eventually caught up with it on DVD.<br/><br/>It's a good film - of course it is, films don't win best film Oscars without being pretty good. I couldn't help comparing it with Jarhead - both films are windows into the war experiences of two individuals and more more character studies rather than action films (although both have action elements). The Hurt Locker was much more successful at engaging me with its characters than Jarhead was.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see that the only well-known names played no more than short cameos. Jeremy Renner is going to go on to become a big name because of this, of course - I'm referring to Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse.<br/><br/>I won't repeat praise of the performances, direction, sense of being in danger etc., but I will say that it very successfully conveyed two things to me - one, the queasy sense of an occupied country with foreign soldiers everywhere who are on a hair trigger and, two, the way that the experience of being in this situation creates a bond of camaraderie even between people who don't easily get on well together."
"gator1110","5","1","3","27 April 2011"," OK but Overrated
","I was exited to see this movie. It won an Academy Award for Best Picture and everyone was telling me how great it was. I watched the movie and it was an OK movie but extremely overrated. I honestly think that because we are currently in war people gravitated towards it and gave it praise it didn't deserve.Although I commend our troops a movie and real life are two different things. There have been so many war movies made, that you must come with a different angle to engage people. This movie seems very similar to Full Metal Jacket but not as good.<br/><br/>The acting was not even that great in my opinion. It was more adrenaline than acting. It's almost like taking some men who play football and putting them in a movie about war.<br/><br/>Honestly, Inglourious Basterds should of won Best Picture hands down. Tarantino was robbed. Inglourious Basterds was a type of movie that I have never seen before. From the plot to the acting were all superb. Tarantino went as far as to have actors speak in foreign languages to give the movie real authenticity. The Academy Awards are gonna have to vote with their heads and not their hearts. Pick the movie that's the best. But Hurt Locker was an good movie that can be watched once."
"eonbluedan-1","8","1","3","6 April 2011"," The masterpiece they say it is? No. Great film? Yes!
","Jeremy Renner is the man! I thought I would get that out there to start with, just to emphasise how much he brings to ""The Hurt Locker"". If Sgt William James had been played by somebody with less presence of character, the film would not have worked anywhere near as well, despite what other praise one could give it.<br/><br/>Sgt First Class William James steps in to lead a bomb disposal team in Iraq; they have only a month left on their rotation, but the loss of their previous leader, Sgt Thompson, has left them shaken, with a gap that seems hard to fill. Sgt James's methods and general view of his job seem to Sgt Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge to be irresponsible and dangerous; this does little for Sanborne's requirement for order and discipline, and is especially threatening to the fragile Eldridge, who is already talking regularly with Colonel Cambridge, the group psychiatrist.<br/><br/>Not unlike ""Jarhead"" in its approach, it features very little violence for a war film, and no elements of what one might think of as ""machoism"" whatsoever. The whole thing focuses fully on the psychology of these men who step out every day ready to die, ""rolling the dice"", as Sanborne says in a key scene. Even one moment which does involve them volunteering themselves to each others physical violence is not actually about the macho violence, but about what is going on between the characters, the dynamic shifts occurring within the team, and how they view each other; in this regard, the scene brought to mind ""Fight Club"". There are numerous parts that rely on subtext, or on the audience's ability to read between the lines of what is being said and recognise that this is a character piece, not a ""wham bam"" action movie. One central scene in particular has a lot going on with very little dialogue; this is the nature of the film in general, asking us to recognise what is not being said as well as what is, and to pay close attention to the characters' interaction.<br/><br/>The film does not adhere to conventions very much; it is shot in a way that is suggestive of a documentary, with a feeling of not so much telling a story, but rather following a set of events. That said, it is cinematic, with some scenes where performance and subtle, clever use of sound ratchet up the tension very well. It is an unusual feeling, and it takes the first act of the film for us to get completely comfortable with the groove. Once we are, however, it makes for a notably unique experience, and the fact we are focusing on a group of guys that other war films have never really looked at only adds to the freshness.<br/><br/>As for criticisms, there are people such as David Morse, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes in this movie, but they border on ""blink and you miss them"" roles, which is a shame. It could also be argued that when all is said and done, it does not feel like the film, for all its accolades, is really saying that much beyond its opening quotation; contrary to the hyperbole surrounding it, it is not a film trying to set the world on fire; it does not have any obvious political stance, it is not ""anti-war"", it is simply an exciting look at the psychology of the men we follow. There is a section of the last act of the film where it feels like the whole thing drops a gear, but it picks it back up again for a great ending, in which the look on Renner's face, and the final shot as Bigelow brings in a track by the band Ministry to introduce the credits, perfectly underlines the point of Sgt James's final monologue! <br/><br/>Not the astounding masterpiece some people might have had us think, and certainly not ""the best war movie ever made"", but very, very good."

","This movie is not a typical Hollywood war film. It has some parts that are, but in many ways it was quite grounded in the reality of the deployed soldier.<br/><br/>Having spent some quality time in Afghanistan before seeing this movie, I was curious as to the type of war movie it would be. It was gritty. It was unpleasant at times. It sexed up a few things, but tried to stay grounded.<br/><br/>What it did better than any other war movie I've ever seen is portray the mentality and difficulties of a soldier returning home to his family. His trouble engaging in conversation with his wife because all he's known for the last year is IED's and gunfire. She's not interested in the details when he tries to share. He's overwhelmed by the tasks taken for granted at home, staring at a wall of cereal boxes ad unable to make a choice. Alone, bored and overwhelmed, he does the only thing he can think to. He goes back. The look and expression on his face say it all. <br/><br/>Without that part, this would have been a 6/10 for me. This part, this often overlooked part of soldiering, is what popped it up for me."

Everyone involved with this film EXCEPT the cinematographers should never be allowed to work in the film industry again, it was THAT bad. Others have cited the technical shortcomings of the character portrayals so I wont repeat them, suffice it to say they were glaring.

"BitchGoddess100","5","1","3","8 January 2011"," Renner is the only thing that makes this watchable.
","Having heard from several people that this movie was at best mediocre, and knowing (in my own little mind, not by anything confirmed by anyone involved with the Oscars) that the only reason it won Best Picture was simply because it was about our people in Iraq, I was curious, yet wary, to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed...<br/><br/>The plot, character development, and conflict in this movie could have been shown in sixty minutes or less. Yet we are bogged down with an extra hour of nothing but slow motion shots of shells falling to the ground, silent shots of men walking and/or laying in the dessert, and of course the all important male-bonding scene in which our three main characters wrestle with each other while downing a bottle of liquor. Jeremy Renner - who always amazes me with his depth and understanding of ever character he portrays - is the only one who's character is developed beyond that of a stick figure. He portrays two completely different sides of the same man: the man who loves his job, and the man who loves his family. <br/><br/>The cinematography is breath-taking at times, but there is to much use of the shaky camera, resulting in a lot of confusion during any of the action scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend seeing it once and only once. If only to yet again be in awe of Renner and his wonderful acting abilities."
"DKosty123","8","1","3","1 January 2011"," Taunt Iraq War Drama
","This film did win a best picture Oscar. I think it won because the best film that year was District 9 but since that is Sci-Fi, it could not be the first film of that genre to win the award. As for the over-hyped Avatar, it was too political to win.<br/><br/>This film was perfect for a bunch of reasons. First is that it tells a good story of the danger of being an American soldier in combat. It draws three extremely well placed actors in solid roles and defines them in a well constructed story. The locations look great and the filming is very well done. The situations feel right.<br/><br/>While some folks might feel this film is political, it really is not. Granted it is set in 2004 Iraq but the politics are kept to a minimum and do not get in the way of the story. Thus the film avoids the biggest problem with Avatar. This film sticks with it's knitting.<br/><br/>The only weakness I see in the film has to do with how the troops spend the off hours as the punching amongst themselves seems a little extreme. The other addition is that there are too many people around the bombs being found. I think that civilians would be smarter and stay away from possible blast zones in reality. Here, everybody is a tourist.<br/><br/>While this is the second best I saw in the year it was Best Picture (District 9 is better in my opinion), it is still a very good film. I think too many people thought this film was something beyond what it is. Yes, it tells a very good dramatic story. That really is all it does. For the Academy, that was enough."
"paudie","7","1","3","25 November 2010"," It takes all sorts to make an army
","Kathryn Bigelow has made a well-crafted and interesting film about the day-to-day life of US troops in Iraq. We follow a three-man bomb disposal team. This gives the opportunity for many tense scenes as they deal with various devices left by Iraqi insurgents.<br/><br/>Two of team want to do their job as well as possible but, having recently seen their previous leader blown up, are also anxious to avoid any unnecessary risks. However the new team leader shocks them by seeming to thrive on taking as many risks as possible. This leads to conflict. The leader(played by Jeremy Renner) is disliked by the others but they all know they have to work together in very stressful situations to stay alive. The bomb disposal scenes are very well done as the director gradually builds the tension and keeps us guessing. There are also scenes of more ""normal"" army life.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is that while most soldiers just want to survive, some depend on the adrenalin rush of being in danger and cannot replicate this in life away from the front line.<br/><br/>The excellent cast show the fear in the soldier's eyes as potentially deadly situations take turns for the worse. <br/><br/>I was anxious to see this film as it had won the 2009 Best Film Oscar. I was slightly disappointed with it as it is not as memorable or original as I'd hoped. Perhaps the action sequences had more of an impact in the cinema. However it is certainly a movie worth seeing."

","I am a two-time Iraq veteran. While the scenery and photography of the film were wonderful, the inaccuracies of Army life were just too much to ignore.

Taking off the bomb suit during an operation, EOD guys knowing sniper and infantry tactics, running around doing infantry tactics without commo gear, the showers were too nice on the FOBs, flying in choppers without battle gear on, an Army shrink going off the FOB (be for real!)....the inaccuracies with explosives etc etc etc.... the list goes on ad naseum.....<br/><br/>I liked the film in the beginning, but it kept getting slower and slower and slower. Then the errors of the film regarding Army life were too gross and if the script writers did a little bit of homework, they could have made this film really good.... as it stands, it is mediocre.

"robert-temple-1","8","1","3","27 September 2010"," Suiting Up
","This fascinating and formless film has no story line. It is a film which is wholly uncontaminated by plot. It is a 'fly on the bomb' documentary-style ramble through a year in the lives and deaths of Bravo Company in Iraq, an American Army specialist unit who dismantle and disable bombs. Strangely, the film is directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow, though it could not be more of a 'male film', as battle-ready testosterone positively oozes from every sprocket hole. The soldiers in the film, who face being blown to bits every day, get so keyed up that all they can think to do in their time off is to punch each other in the stomach as hard as they can. The performances are very good, and verisimilitude is maintained at all times. Anthony Mackie is probably the best, as he has the widest range. This is what is called 'a war movie'. I can't believe that I actually liked war movies when I was young. Now I look upon them with horror, as there is too much war really going on all over the globe every day for it to be a suitable subject for entertainment. When one is young, one views war as 'us and them', but when one gets a bit older, one suddenly realizes with a great shock that war is really 'everybody'. This film is not meant to be entertainment, however, it is meant to be an insight. If your life isn't tense enough, this will make up for it. It is guaranteed to dissipate and dispel the most tenacious cases of ennui. The bomb disposal member of the team suits up in something resembling a space suit and walks towards what may be his death. At one point he admits to having defused 873 bombs. Each time we wonder: 'Will he make it?' People who are given to chewing their fingernails won't have any left after seeing this."

And look I don't get all the hate from former military/current military who claim it is remarkably inaccurate. Who cares? Why are you taking this as an insult? At the very least, I think you should be appreciative that someone was interested enough in your lifestyle to create a movie depicting an interpretation of it. It's a movie meaning it's fantasy. And I think this movie was far more about the addiction of war as opposed to the lifestyle presented in modern warfare. Hell, the opening line of the movie states something to the affect of war being a drug.<br/><br/>Now, all that said, it's still just a good movie. Bu,t I think there have been far better war movies made throughout history. To name a few we have Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, A Thin Red Line, or even Schindler's List.

I kept hoping a bomb would go off or an Irqui civilian would go crazy or there would be a suicide bomber. Anything to relieve the monotony.

It certainly left no real impression on me, I practically had forgotten about it 5 minutes after I'd seen it. Really, it doesn't do enough. They employed this shaky ""24"" style hand-held camera movement, rather haphazard and meaningless in so many parts, unnecessary, even, because the emotional impact of a certain scene is killed due to the invasive feeling of this shaky camera in the character's faces, because it feels like a documentary a lot of the times, and it shouldn't.

The story follows the experience of Sargent James (Jeremy Renner), a rebel without a bomb who defuses by his own rules. With his integration into the squad after a terrible death of a previous defuser at the beginning of the film, he meets Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), James' new teammate who hates his guts. The story from there blossoms into pretty much an empty wasteland of ""what is going on."" The story is drifty and bleak without a sense of any real connection or lead besides some character progression by our beloved soldiers.<br/><br/>I must say, the film had its moments that captivated me. Such as Anthony Mackie's wonderful performance in general, as well as the suicide bomber scene at the end of the film. The action sequences felt so vivid and real and the wonderfully done shaky hand held camera work simply made me believe I was stumbling around and scared along with the soldiers.

I must first say, it is easy to critic a movie , but i strictly point out things i know for a fact, unlike some people.<br/><br/>I'll to that that most of the bad things can't be seen or detected by an uninformed public, so that is why Hurt Locker has been so well received. To inform you,the bad things are; EOD are almost VIP's,they go in when it is as secure as it can be possibly made and kept that way as long as it needs to, that car would never had made it that far without being shot at, TriggerMan's hunting is the the QRF's ( Quick Response/Reaction Force)job, not the EOD's ,they are way too valuable to risk getting shot in an ambush, worst for my part is to so badly represent SAS in the sniper firefight, SAS are the best and oldest SF, no way in hell an EOD pair hit a running guy at min 800m upward with mirage effect and wind swirling with no marksmanship badge in sight ...

","In ""The Hurt Locker,"" director Kathryn Bigelow has created the first fictional film about the war in Iraq that has gotten into my head and stayed there. I can't account for how accurate it is in its details, but based on interviews and documentaries I've seen about soldiers' experiences in Iraq and the emotional toll it's taken on them, I believe that this film captures very well the feelings of futility and depressing waste of human life that the Iraqi conflict (or any war, for that matter) sends home with the people who are engaged in fighting it.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner gives an astonishing performance, one of the best of the year, as the explosives expert whose job it is to disarm booby traps. He's one of the most tragic characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He's got so little in his life to care about that putting his life at risk on a daily basis is the only way he can feel anything. Most of the film takes place in Iraq, and the majority of it is tense and brutally suspenseful. But it's a few scenes late in the film showing Renner's character coming back to a domestic life that no longer has any place for him that will break your heart.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"jzappa","8","2","11","4 October 2009"," War Is All-Consuming.
","There is not much about The Hurt Locker that hasn't already been said by nearly unanimous critics and audiences, but being such a feverishly subjective experience, one is bound to have brought one's own relative fears, perceptions and sense of both surprise and inevitability to the experience oneself. Regardless of where those reactions individually come from and the relationship they have with a given scene, that in itself is the experience of the soldier in combat. The actors on screen do not work from prose monologues but through instinctive reckonings of who they are and what they feel. They are not good fighting evil. They see less good and more evil in everyone and everything with each passing day.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow has always been a very skillful director of Hollywood action movies. But this is a whole different beast. She has certainly put her hand to varying themes, settings and subgenres before, but The Hurt Locker is in a class all by itself as the film where she has focused every fiber of her ability into fashioning a unique, unfettered film. Yes, an uber-masculine action film, a film about the Iraq War, but rarely are we so unaware of the distance between ourselves and the screen. It is not just the only film about the war to have been successful thus far, it is an experience she has fought tooth and nail to give us.<br/><br/>There are two name actors in the film. One of them dies in the very first scene and the other appears for a minute or less near the end. Otherwise, we spend the film's protracted duration in the unadulterated presence of actors we may or may not have seen before, unable to comfort ourselves by connecting them with other roles in other films. There are no masks of stardom any more than there are facades of set design or non-diagetic visual effects. We inevitably believe that they are not acting at all, that they are living the very lives and doing the very things on screen.<br/><br/>The film was shot by United 93 cinematographer Barry Ackroyd with hand-held 16mm cameras, usually with four cameras rolling at once. It is gritty, grimy, saturated in sweat, overexposure, underexposure, and the expansion beyond dualism. This is the way we believe the bomb squad's experiences look and feel, because that is the way we undergo our physical day-to-day existence, by looking at the small, representative systems and the entire complex structure at the same time. The eye always has and always will see conflictingly with the lens, though with various focal lengths and an energetic editing approach---indeed you are guaranteed to never feel aware of a cut---the lens gives us that mutual negotiation of opposing perspectives, which inescapably embodies the sense of complete involvement.<br/><br/>It isn't just the self-contained plays depicting the three conflicting sergeants in the bomb unit diffusing improvised explosives that have our hearts in our throats. The building rage and paranoia pervades every moment. One night, the three sergeants, played by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, who never completely like or hate each other, get more wasted than anybody I've ever seen and take turns smashing each other in the stomach. But this is not quite aggressive enough to satisfy one of them, Renner's Sergeant First Class William James, who lives and breathes confrontation with potentially fatal threats the way a drug addict is never satisfied with more than enough of their substance. He is not bad or cruel. He is not easily offended, he is gregarious and honest. But he is like that in the field as well, such as when he insists on approaching a suspected bomb without first sending a bomb disposal robot on his first mission with this company.<br/><br/>Bigelow will never be the same filmmaker she was before. Near Dark, Blue Steel and Strange Days are exciting thrillers, and they demonstrate her flair for atmosphere, but at the helm of The Hurt Locker, she demonstrates an outright mastery and total understanding of the effects of the camera, the mental creation of the third shot when one shot cuts to the next, and the most unequivocally honest application of life's sights and sounds to those of cinema. She has the brass balls to take a subject matter proved to be box office poison and give it her relentless all."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","12","5 March 2010"," Where we find peace...
","I finally saw Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" on DVD. Bigelow's orchestration is masterful. ""The Hurt Locker"" is gritty, stark, pulse pounding, and tense. Jeremy Renner emerges as a star, delivering a tragic heroic performance. Much like Bigelow's direction and Mark Boal's storytelling, ""The Hurt Locker"" brands an inspired authenticity and grace. Mark Boal's screenplay probably depicts the first story of the horror and heroism of the Iraqi War on the big screen. Renner plays Specialist William James, who leads an Army bomb disposal team that diffuses IEDs. James is called a ""wild man"" by gung ho Colonel Reed (always strong and solid David Morse). But there is more to the seemingly fearless or reckless James (Renner). In a poignant arc, James tells nearly shell shocked Eldridge (vulnerable Brian Geraghty), ""Everyone's a coward somewhereÂ…"" <br/><br/>James replaces beloved deceased Specialist Thompson (charismatic Guy Pearce). James admits to his new team mates Sanborn (powerful Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Geraghty) that he can never hope to truly replace Thompson, who was a good man. He is just here to do his job. However, Sanborn and Eldridge soon wonder if maverick James is going to get them all killed, before their tour of duty is over. In a riveting scene, James uncovers a car laced with IEDs in the middle of the street. Presuming that he is totally screwed, he strips off his protective gear to discern the solution. Here Bigelow is so effective in using hand held and close in shots, resulting in a claustrophobic atmosphere. Everything culminates in a suicide bomber, who has a change of heart, with James's prowess in the balance.<br/><br/>The paradox lies not only with the violence and tragedy outside, but also within the characters. Eldridge constantly dreams of his death. Sanborn literally trades blows over James's sanity. Sanborn wonders if they would not better off, if James were dead. Renner balances a cocky heroism with a subdued broken soul in James. Perhaps, James is indeed fearless. But like he told Eldridge that everyone is a coward somewhere; his fear lies perhaps at home. Consequently and ironically, James forms a touching bond with an Iraqi kid Beckham (charming Christopher Sayegh), who sells bootleg DVDs. Tragedy strikes and this trails down the dark path, and insight into James. Here Renner is brilliant. All actions have consequences. In this Bigelow is pitch perfect in her vision, and storytelling. Everyone perhaps forfeits part of their soul in war, and where one finds peace or solace is not necessary what we expect. ""The Hurt Locker"" is thoughtful, thrilling, and one of the best movies of the year."

","The best movie I've watched in years. This isn't about Iraqi people anymore, or about the number of those who get killed everyday in Iraq. This is neither about the abortive democracy the US was supposed to bring to Iraq nor is this about oil, civil war or Saddam's lethal weapons. Hurt Locker, for the first time, did let me have quite a new perspective about Iraq war. This is about a group of American soldiers who are in an everyday battle of life and death disarming bombs in Baghdad. What they get in return though is Iraqi people hurling stones at them, a world ""not giving a sh*t"" if they get killed, an identity which is defined only in the middle of the war and another 365-day mission. 10/10."

The action is absolutely spectacular, the acting is brilliant (why Jeremy Renner isn't a bigger star just shows the faults in Hollywood today), and the direction by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, Near Dark) is exceptional.

","This movie blew me away when i first saw it. One of the best war movies I've seen in a long time, which is why it bothers me when people start analyzing it not as a movie but as more of a documentary. The film was made for entertainment pure and simple, not to show the precise details of the war in Iraq. Who cares if you can't hit a moving target with a sniper from that long of a distance, who cares if the wires used in the bombs wouldn't work in certain situations, or that the characters don't follow proper US army protocol. Take the movie as it is. Enjoy yourself! I understand people in the army will see flaws with the details, but try to look past these and see the Locker as a movie made to entertain people. If you can accept these aspects you realize how great this movie is and you will have a more enjoyable viewing because of it."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","12","17 September 2009"," The Hurt Locker
","The Hurt Locker is set in Iraq during the war and is about the team of soldiers who are sent out to find and deactivate hidden bombs. For me at least, war movies can be a really hit or miss thing, particularly depending on the individual film in question. I feel that a lot of them use the same kind of formula and style in their story and direction, so sometimes it feels like if you have seen one then you have seen them all. What I am talking about in particular is movies with strong leading characters who are portrayed as heroes and end up saving the day, or becoming a hero, whether they end up living, or dying in said film. With this statement I am not saying that I am for, or against war or have anything for, or against soldiers, but when you have so many different films in that genre that follow the same cookie cutter outline, it does get tiresome. At the same time there are some really great war films that break out of that mold and present us with many not a totally historically accurate piece of work, but at least an original way of looking at it and different with it's overall presentation. I had heard a lot of great things about The Hurt Locker and going by these reviews and some impressive trailers, I decided that it really was the type of film that I would like to go see at the theatre. I must say that it was an absolute privilege to see a film this good on the big screen and with an audience. Like the kind of war films I was praising above, The Hurt Locker does deal with a real war and real situations (no, it is not based on a true story) , but it is told with such power and filmed with a gritty realism and a scriptwriter with a knack for getting into the minds of these characters, that makes The Hurt Locker a compelling, tense and fascinating watch. The film does not have a political agenda for the viewers watching it. It does not support the war, or say that it is totally against it. A trait of the film that I admired. It does show soldiers who are completely dedicated to their mission and are willing to die for their principles, but at the same time we see that this war and the tremendous stress and pressure that they are under on a daily basis is obviously really starting to get to them and that it may take years, if not their whole life to get over it. The two main soldiers in the film are brilliantly played by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie who both deliver award worthy performances as men who are brave on the outside and inside, but also have a realistic perspective on the war and the situation they are in and realize that they may not make it out alive and if they do they might not be the same people as they were when and if they make it back home. There are also parts of the film that show us the tender sides of these characters as well such as when Jeremy Renner's character befriends a young Iraqi boy and Anthony Mackie's character who is intent and determined to get himself and his team out of harm's way. I do really enjoy war films with a more human element and perspective to it because even though I have never been to war I can understand and hear on the news the tremendous fear and doubt that must go through these soldiers and this film showcases that as well as their bravery and also what they are like when they are in their quarters and just having a good time with fellow soldiers and friends (another powerful scene in the film). For it's gritty and realistic direction, character driven and fascinating script along with top notch performances, The Hurt Locker is one of the best films of the year, if not the best film I have seen so far this year. Forget all the other films I have given great reviews to, so far this year (yes, I know there are a lot), but forget those and do yourself a favour and see The Hurt Locker if it is playing near you, or when it comes out to rent. It is an unforgettable and brilliant piece of cinema that I was lucky and privileged to see on the big screen. A great achievement in film."

I am totally going to recommend this movie to friends and family. I am going to see it again in theaters whenever it gets to the dollar theater in Birmingham Alabama have already told my mom that i am going to take her to see this movie because it deserves a lot of credit how great this movie is and how you see how people take care of what can happen in bombs. I am a fan of it. I hope the Oscars and Golden Globes give this movie a lot of nominations. The movie it self was fantastic so was the actors and the other soldiers.

"kristy-56","10","2","12","28 August 2009"," A Must See Film!!!!
","I knew from the few minutes of the trailer that I had to see this film. Unfortunately, the cinema gods thought that the film was not ready to be seen in my area and there was a great delay. However, it was well worth the wait and I am contemplating going to see it again. The action is non-stop from the beginning sequence up until about the last 5 minutes of the film. The actors, although not Hollywood big shots, portrayed their characters with such passion and conviction, you were left feeling as though the action were happening to you. It gives you, the viewer, an inside look at what it must be like for our soldiers serving overseas. The ridiculing by the Iraqis and the leering from ever corner and opening was quite frightening and unsettling.<br/><br/>One thing I am uncertain of, is during and throughout the film, the days are counted down until rotation of the company, however, for most of the countdown the days were not viewable on screen. I am not sure if it was just the theater I was at, or if it was intentional by the director. Another thing was the jumpiness of the camera. Almost the entire movie is very shaky but watchable. If you get squeamish, be warned.<br/><br/>Overall, this is by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. Pray for our troops."
"rainlillie","10","2","12","2 August 2009"," I highly recommend this movie.
","Platoon"" was one of the best movies made about the Vietnam war, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was one of the best made about World war two; and ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the best movies made about the Iraq war. I had the privilege of watching a special screening last night. The movie is intense, heartbreaking, and powerful! ""The Hurt Locker"" follows an elite Army bomb squad unit, who has to go around disarming IED's. Every moment that these guys are on the field could be their last one.<br/><br/>The movie shows us, how war and fear can change people. It also shows us just how difficult and horrible this war is; not only for our troops but the Iraqi people as well. The one thing that kept going through my mind while I watched this was... how can anyone live in such a tense situation and return home okay. My hope is that our troops returning home are not denied the help they need in order to return to successful civilian life. I know when my brother in-law returned from Kuwait, he wasn't the same. He never really wanted to talk about his time there and he fell into a deep depression.<br/><br/>Although the movie features a few big name stars like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes, both had minor roles, the real stars are three actors you've probably never heard of; Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. All three do an amazing job. I like the fact the movie wasn't pro or anti-war. It just gave us a peak inside the lives of these three guys and what they had to face on a daily basis."

"gthombos","4","1","4","27 January 2017"," Beware The Desert Bomb
","This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.<br/><br/>This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)<br/><br/>Renner was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances - most notably Mackie's - were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act ""cool"". Oh, so ""cool"". Desert ""cool"". But if looking ""cool"" is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.<br/><br/>The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eaves trough of his house.<br/><br/>Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.<br/><br/>Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys - after getting a little snockered - engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The ""game"" involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, ""Why do men do those kind of things?""<br/><br/>You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, ""You're OK in my book."" And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.<br/><br/>A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camera- work in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look - which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment - and pronto - with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.<br/><br/>If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagine<br/><br/>I once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker - something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it - a lesson.<br/><br/>The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations."
"Tss5078","10","1","4","28 November 2015"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","I have never really enjoyed war films. I am by no means a pacifist, but to me all the stories seem to be the same, and until now, I've been uninterested. It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life. I enjoyed every second of this film and it was truly the best choice the Academy could have made for best picture."

","I must admit that I've been a little skeptic when I decided to watch this movie.I mean,the director was a woman,and no offense but you know,my half-of-century life experience taught me that all that you can expect from lady(look) point of view on war subject is huge bunch of stereotypes,in this case particularly considering general perception on Iraqi war: poor Iraqi people,poor American soldiers etc...On the contrary it turned to be one of the most delightful surprises of my lifetime film-spectator history.First of all basically this is not just war neither anti-war film.I mean,main frame inside which story is taking place is Iraqi territory,main partipiciants are Iraqi people and US soldiers,but...Renner as explosive expert is not just person who is trying to survive 365(or whatever numb of days)till next rotation,he is one of on this earth rare personalities that make things going on,encouraging weak or skeptic,helping them not just to survive but also to gain self confidence.The truth is that he has lost his ability of so called normal civil life,but the truth is also,and this truth is well known to every ex-soldier or any war partcipiant that there never is coming back home after war,simply because the home is burned,sometimes physical(as it was case in my country) sometimes mentally,often both.Crucial scene of this movie is Renner's character conversation with his one year old son,which basically points to the fact that he is in fact talking to himself.Is it not the truth that,even in common life,just simple aging we lose one after another our foothold positions-until there is only one that matters?That is,if even that...So,Renner-James is not coming back to Iraq simply because he is an adrenaline freak even after he barely survived first rotation,but primarily because he is good in what he is doing and as he said to his son-himself:that is the only thing that is keeping him feel alive.Because he is the hurt locker. And one more thing about Kathryn-although she is pretty woman she has more balls than any recent US director,and the proof is Zero Dark Thirty.Both of this movies are real movies about real people,nut just political correct bullshit so easily selling these days.Pesonally I consider The Hurt Locker the best movie made in the last five years,and Bigelow,Mann and Nolan best nowadays directors."
"chrisbonilla95","10","1","4","25 October 2012"," The Hurt Locker Contains A Great Message Within It
","After reading through both positive and negative reviews, here is what I have to say about the quality of the film:<br/><br/>I think that too many people are focusing on what is not important, and by that I mean, the accuracy of everything, the camera job, the fact that it was directed by a woman, how many Oscars it won, etc. You are all missing the main point, a point that is highlighted at the very beginning: ""War is a drug."" A drug is not only addicting, it is, usually, harmful. <br/><br/>The film gives us a summary of the life of a soldier, with the intent of allowing the viewer to get a feel for the life, so that they may then comprehend them better. We see when he is back how he is completely lost, as most veterans are; data from a survey conducted in 2009 shows that only 13% of veterans truly feel reintegrated. James' wife and kid are there to exemplify the inability that most of us have to comprehend veterans. The wife acts as if the man was never in Iraq; as if he had never been close to death or seen many die. And then his son, perfectly innocent and jolly, he will never be able to understand the feelings that run within his father's veins due to his experiences.<br/><br/>Going back to the accuracy of the film, I think that this is a non-issue. The point is to really make a mark on the viewer so that they may take the time to help the veterans or try to be better at helping soldiers when they come back. I think that the inaccuracies allow for some exaggeration, which in turn allows for a greater mark to be left on the viewer. Take for example the scene where he opens up the kid's stomach to take out the bomb: would a soldier really do that? Probably not, but it is through this that one is able to see that soldiers are not emotionless fighting machines, and also, that the terrors they face out there are gruesome, and highly traumatizing.<br/><br/>As to the ""amateur camera skills,"" I am going to say that this was probably a stylistic thing. By having it move around like that, like sort of ""The Office"" style, it further allows the viewer to feel like they are there because it creates the feel that you are the one moving around, watching this all unfold.<br/><br/>Now about the Oscars, who the f*** cares how many it won, you should be watching the film for its content, not how many stars/Oscars it has. I can tell you that many a time, I have enjoyed a lot of films with poor reviews, and I recommend that you give these films a try; sometimes critics are idiots (not in this case though potential troll, this film really deserved it). Now, the director being a women and this being a thing about getting her an Oscar to highlight it or those theories about it being revenge against James Cameron are all baloney. They may be true, but once again, does not matter if you are really watching this film for its overarching message.<br/><br/>Anyways, I highly recommend that you watch the film, the story vividly captures the terrors of war and the effects it has on soldiers. War is addictive and harmful, like a drug; there is a need for the violence instilled by the experience, and this has been exposed from statistics of reported aggression in returning soldiers. <br/><br/>To the veterans b****ing about the films inaccuracy, all I have to say is: 1) Thank you for your service to this great nation 2) I am sorry that this film may not be an accurate portrayal of your experience, but I think this is important so that us civilians can help our great soldiers get back into the life they left.<br/><br/>10/10 Watch it, undistracted. Get the meaning, on your own. Help out a veteran."

","The critics of this movie have a couple things in common. One: They are non-Vets. Two: If it does not have a love scene w/half naked women, or someone shooting 60 rounds out of a 12 round magazine, it ain't no good. It's been 36 years since I was in the U.S. Army. I doubt if it has changed much. These critics have to realize that in war, there is no Chuck Norris-type running around piling up bodies for a 1 year tour. I'm no combat vet, but I estimate in a combat (war) a 1 year tour would consist of maybe a few days or so of actual combat (under fire). Contact w/the enemy is not 24/7, kids. Only in the Norris/Stallone-type movies. This movie, in my opinion, was probably as real as it can get. The soldier who went off base would only be A.W.O.L. if his commanding officer filed charges. It's not automatic. The best thing these critics can do is educate themselves. That can only happen if they serve. My advise is go to your nearest recruiter and join. No use in sitting here at your computer and typing in a bunch of anti-American drivel. Iraq, like Viet Nam does not/did not have the enemy running around with ""enemy"" painted on their foreheads. The enemy can be male or female, from 8 to 80 years old. Go Army! David F. 52B20 14th. Aviation Bttn. and 3/67th. Air Defense Artillery. 1973 to 1976."

","There is still argument over whether Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now is the quintessential Vietnam movie, but unless someone comes along and makes a complete masterpiece, this will be remembered as THE Iraq War movie. This is the kind of movie that you watch and then have to take 10 or 20 minutes to calm yourself down to return to your normal life. It brought out suspense and tension that surpasses Alien. While a lot of war movies just take their characters and plot lines off of a shelf, the characters in this movie have real originality and humanity, and the plot is something you have probably never seen before. Don't go into this movie expecting it to give you some massive insight into the rights and wrongs of the Iraq war. Go into it expecting it to give you a window into the way it affects the people who fight it. I personally thought the side plot involving the psychologist was forced and unnecessary, but that is really a minor complaint about this masterpiece."

","The Hurt Locker is a 2009 drama war film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and starring Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James. James is left to control a group of soldiers trained to disarm bombs after their former leader was K.I.A. The soldiers, however, do not approve of James' orders.<br/><br/>The film was flat out great, it was very entertaining and Renner's performance couldn't have been better. He does a very good job and puts himself inside his character. The film makes it look like you're in the middle of it all, and it's shot very well. If you are in the mood to view a war film, this is one of your best."

","Hurt locker was a documentary kind of movie which tells an interesting story about bomb squad members but was too long and at times was very much dragging. In the year 2004, city of Baghdad is completely dominated by terrorist attacks from every part. The U.S army sets up a patrol on daily rotation to tackle these attacks. The story is about the struggle in life of bomb squad team members. After watching the trailer , I was very excited to watch the film but was a bit let down as it dragged a lot. The editing part of the movie could have been more sharp. The story was good along with the direction, sound effects , cinematography and performances especially by Jeremy Renner. The movie has something new to offer but sometimes it felt as if you are watching a documentary. It could have more convincing and entertaining. Its just worth watching once. 2.5/5"

"rob-911-162983","6","1","4","1 December 2010"," A difficult film to review
","In 2004, three Explosive Ordnance Disposal technicians who are wearing uniforms from two years in the future defuse a serious of fiendishly clever improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in war torn Baghdad. Sergeant James, the new team leader, begins taking increasingly questionable risks. He has become hooked on the adrenaline of matching wits with master bomb makers, and in the end he finds that nothing else in his life matters anymore. He and his two comrades will find themselves forever changed by their experiences.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of director Kathryn Bigelow since 1995, when I first saw her film 'Strange Days.' I later became a fan of 'Near Dark' when it was released on DVD, and I have enjoyed most of her other film and television work. Did she deserve an Oscar for this film? I believe that she did, although her screenwriter didn't. She made a great looking film outside of the studio system on a tiny budget, and she cast unknown actors who delivered star-making performances under her aegis.<br/><br/>Mark Boal's script, as many have noted, is underwhelming and episodic. There really isn't any narrative thrust. Sergeant James is the only person with a complete character arc and some degree of depth. Sanborn reveals that he wants a son at the end, whereas Eldridge's minor arc culminated with him killing an insurgent, but for the most part they're relegated to the background. There are a few touches of verisimilitude (bootleg DVDs, white and orange taxis, the gunner throwing a water bottle at civilian traffic to move it out of the way), but for the most part the scenarios and the actions of the protagonists are extremely unrealistic. I won't go into detail about the technical inaccuracies (in a film that was touted for its realism), but an experienced soldier can find something wrong in nearly every single scene (and why oh why did some characters wear flags on both shoulders? Argh). Mark Boal is no Stanley Kubrick, that much is clear. <br/><br/>'The Hurt Locker' was filmed in Jordan, and although I didn't think that it looked very similar to urban Iraq, Bigelow chose some great and occasionally beautiful locations. As with most war films, the locals are used as set dressing and have very little interaction with the characters. There is no reference to the sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shiites, and no real insight into the political or economic struggles that the country continues to endure. In a two hour movie about the Iraq war, the protagonists only interact briefly with about three Iraqis. This film won't tell foreigners anything about Iraqi culture or how warm and friendly most Iraqis are. It does do a good job of showing and how ruthless and heartless the insurgents are, and hints at how damaging this form of warfare is to the Americans and how it can make them become heartless too.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't want to bash EOD or the dangerous job they do, but this film dramatizes their heroism to mythic proportions. EOD will go out on missions with an escort/security platoon after another unit has found an improvised explosive device. Combat engineers and even regular infantry units are tasked with actually going out to LOOK for IEDs, often and sometimes tragically falling victim to them. To me those men are more heroic and deserving of recognition than the EOD technicians, who operate in a controlled environment and usually use robots to approach the devices.<br/><br/>In summation, I'm glad that Hollywood finally appreciates Kathryn Bigelow's work, but I think this film is quite overrated. I loved Marco Beltrami's morose score, and Barry Ackroyd's camera work and lighting, but technical prowess doesn't make up for sub par writing."

","I tend to avoid films that are hyped. Hurt Locker was in that in category. The problem is a film needs to be seen in a cinema for it to be truly effective and often the gloss can be lost by watching the 'main event' on your TV at home, even with a cinema system.<br/><br/>So, I thought, maybe this why Hurt Locker is, well, hurting. Because I am watching it on my TV screen, of not insignificant size. The audio will not be as 'full on' as in a cinema, it never is. But other 'great' films that I have watched at home have still broken out from their restrictive confines and done the business in terms of entertainment and making me aware of their greatness or similar.<br/><br/>Hurt Locker is a an average film.<br/><br/>In fact, in my view, Hurt Locker is the cinematic re-make of 'HBO's' 'Generation Kill'. Admittedly Generation Kill had three times as long to tell its story, but the main thing was it had a story. Hurt Locker is a cold plot less experience. A story/film should, generally, have a beginning, a middle and an end, unless it a twee art house piece of fluff.<br/><br/>Hurt Locker's main story centres around SFC William James who inherits the role of bomb master when his predecessor gets killed in action. James arrives, drinks, defuses bombs, drinks, has man fights, drinks, goes home to a life he is disenchanted with and returns to Iraq to defuse more bombs. It's as simple as that. It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay !!! And they say there is no jingoism in 'The Academy'.<br/><br/>I might pick Hurt Locker up again in the future and re-assess. Somehow I don't think it will change my view.<br/><br/>6/10."

","Unfortunately, this partially gripping pic isn't quite the sum of its parts. While individual scenes are well-crafted and the difficult situation that American G.I.'s are confronted with in Iraq is made perceptible, the attempts at character drama are rather irresolute, despite Renner's strong performance.<br/><br/>The omittance of stereotypical narrative tropes and cheap combat splatter sequences is to be applauded as well as the expert direction. But something's missing while one effective set-piece after another is served up on a bloody plate. Maybe a political/social contextualization or a deeper look at the Iraqi people.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a well-made war-actioner with half-realized efforts towards more serious issues.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 human bombs"

","If you are looking for this big action heavy war film this is not it. As far as I know(I have no experience of war luckily) it feels like a really believable representation of life in a modern war. The story follows a group of soldiers whose mission is disarming bombs. But the plot is not actually the point in this. Rather it wants to shows you what war life is like and how people may be affected by it. And the film really succeeds. I was quickly drawn in. Many films that attempts to show realistic presentations often become slow moving and even boring. The Hurt Locker brilliantly avoids this, both being a great thrilling war movie and also managing to say something to the viewer. The visuals are great and documentary style that really fits the tone and message. The action is greatly done in a kind of bleak toned down way. Done in with the same feel as the tone of the story is. The acting is really god. For a movie that focuses on the consequence on the soldiers the acting is essential. Sad, exciting, thrilling and always moving. It may be the kind of movie that falls into the category great movies you only watch once but it is a movie you should see once."

","I've read a couple of other reviews which go on about the 'inaccuracies' of Bigelow's army leading this film to be great for people who don't know anything about army life, and others which argue that the reason this film has been getting so many bad reviews is because it beat out Avatar for best film and Avatar lovers are angry...<br/><br/>WHO CARES!! no offense to the vets of war (i have massive respect for your brave sacrifice) but inaccuracies are in every film. The movie 'Troy' shows Patroclus as Achilles' cousin, when in actual fact he was his gay lover. The director changed this to suit his American target audience. Well do you think Bigelow said 'OK this film is going to be JUST for army people' NO! she wanted to make money. for that you need as many viewers as possible. which means focus on MAINSTREAM viewers. mainstream viewers don't know, or care about the difference between a staff Sergeant and a As for the whole avatar lovers thing. how is this even relevant?? no one cares that a woman finally beat her husband (ex) at something :P the film was crap, get over it.<br/><br/>Maybe Kathryn Bigelow did this on purpose to distract viewers from noticing the flatness of the film. It did not have (kind of like the actual war) any visible enemy and no objective There was NO character development (except maybe the 'specialist' who hardens up a bit later on) but the main character starts off as a gun-ho, adrenaline junky jarhead and finishes the same way. This film is cited on IMDb as being a thriller. There was nothing thrilling about it! the 'action scenes' (apart from the cool explosion at the start) are merely time fillers (note the slow-mo dropping bullet)<br/><br/>Even, according to herself, her political position is flat!! I disagree and think it is pro-war, but due to word constraints, will not open that chestnut. According to other critics, hurt locker is a film which doesn't say 'war is good' or 'war is bad' but merely 'war' Thats like writing an essay for English and having NO ARGUMENT. who does that?!<br/><br/>Bad film, not worth best picture (neither is avatar BTW).

Now what was that? And around the end when they just take off into the village to find the person that might have detonated the bomb.

","The multiple Oscar winner - The Hurt Locker finally released in India. Contrary to presumption the movie turned out to be another effort to justify Iraq war by using apolitical tag. Every civilian has been shown as suspicious for unknown reason and every marine has been shown as human. The movie suffers from being too self centric by showing the complexity of war from one side only.<br/><br/>On plus side, the technical aspects are worth mention. The sound effects and slow motion capture of explosive blasts have given real feel of the situation. Guy Pearce is a fine actor and he has been given minor role which disappointed me. I noticed Jeremy Renner in 28 Weeks Later as kind heated soldier where he saves a bunch of people from poisonous gas leaked by American authority to get rid of Zombie mess. The same kindness and grace of him is reflected here.<br/><br/>On Oscar winning - Precious:Based on Novel Push by Sapphire could have been the ideal choice for best film and best direction.

","Now, The Hurt Locker was a good movie... Was it as good as it was hyped to be.... No way. Was it unrealistic? Far too much! The vast chunk of negative reviews are from people agitated over the acclaim and Oscars of this film who tend to rate it far lower than it should be out of disdain.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but in no way is it worthy of all those Oscars and the critical acclaim that accompanied it.<br/><br/>It was good, but not great, not excellent. I can't contain any spoilers, so I will just say it also lacked realism. In many scenes I was shaking my head... There were far too many scenes in this movie that were pure Hollywood for this movie to become a war classic. Many veterans alluded to this; thinking the average Joe would think this is how it is in Iraq. I am not in the military but I could see the glaring mis-representations of reality all to easily.<br/><br/>Take it as a good action flick. We don't hear people complaining about Die Hard being unrealistic do we? The movie is a thumbs up despite the persistent lack of realism.<br/><br/>Also remember, it was far too over rated. Let's face it, Hollywood is out of touch. Oscars and prizes don't mean it has to be great! Look at Obama winning a Nobel peace prize after a few months of nothing but talk, and Al Gore getting an Oscar and a Nobel for Inconvenient Truth.

"RainDogJr","Null","1","4","7 March 2010"," One thing and one thing only
","Last night, the night before the big event of Hollywood, I finally had the chance to watch Kathryn Bigelow's very acclaimed film, The Hurt Locker. It was my introduction to the work of ""king of the world's"" ex wife (a bit about the Oscars: I only watched half of the 10 Best Picture nominees, Up, Inglourious Basterds, Avatar, District 9 and The Hurt Locker. My personal favourite is ""Basterds"", District 9 after but very close both The Hurt Locker and Up all of these are truly great films to enjoy more than a single time, but I'll bet that my least favourite of those 5, certainly the extremely overrated Avatar, will give the ""king of the world"" another reason to think he is the greatest human being alive). I'm mentioning this because I was quite surprised, after watching The Hurt Locker certainly, to find out that Bigelow also directed a film like the 1991 Point Break. I mean, I have yet to watch Point Break (by the way, can't wait to check out Strange Days) but based on what I've heard, I imagine that it is just a great example of a dumb action movie for the male teens (maybe the only reason why I would watch it, aside of to watch another Bigelow film, is because the Chili Peppers, or at least Anthony Kiedis, appear in it!). The tagline of Point Break is ""100% Pure Adrenaline"", pretty much perfect tagline for a Die Hard sort of rip-off (again, I'm just guessing based on what I've heard). The Hurt Locker is a film dealing with the adrenaline (the quote that opens the film: ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug"") subject however it is not a film that should be targeted as a ""100% Pure Adrenaline"" adventure, it's a little too clever and fascinating for that this is, simply, a very tense film. <br/><br/>Because of that fact I think many will find here a slow film. The Hurt Locker doesn't have much of a plot: we have our setting: 30 or so days before the change of the rotation, the EOD unit that we will follow loses one of its members. Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the replacement and quickly he makes us think in the quote that opens the film. Essentially we just watch the EOD working, hence I say the film doesn't have much of a plot, however each work of the EOD is like an universe with many emotions present, with tension, each time we see these guys (James joined Sergeant Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge) we just can't be calm and we just can't get our eyes away of the screen."

","This will easily qualify as one of the best war movies about Iraq. It is excellent. It is thrilling. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Is it deep? Is it worth 9 Oscar nominations? In my opinion no.<br/><br/>The only character I felt was portrayed believable, was James. He is absorbed by the war, and he does something about it. Sanborn is a pro, but cracks in the last explosion. Why? We don't really know. Eldridge turns from being afraid of dying, into a dude with a combat face, into someone mad about surviving the war. Why? We don't really know. What we do know, is, that what drives James, is the adrenaline kick - spoken out loudly by Eldridge for those who didn't see the first hour of the movie.<br/><br/>James is also let down by the script. There is no way this guy has defused 873 bombs, with that attitude. He would have been blown to kingdom come at bomb 3. It is plain silly that he is that irresponsible. The ambush in the desert is a much much better way of displaying how he gets his his kick. However, the ambush leads us to another weak point in the movie. If the Americans are using some serious state of the art tripod sniper hardware, why is it, that they have to fire 3-4 times before they hit their first guy, when on the other hand, the Iraqi snipers can stick the head out a window, and with a hand-held weapon, kills 3 targets with 3 shots? We don't really know, do we?<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is stating the obvious. A 20 second scene in a mall - and with his son? I think most of us got the point by now, and simply showing him pulling on the bomb suit, and saying ""day 365"", would have been enough.<br/><br/>Still an excellent war movie."

","Although I had no plans to see ""The Hurt Locker"" as I tend to shy away from modern war movies especially any with Iraq as the battle front, I did see it recently after hearing buzz about it being the best film of the year. In fact one report had director James Cameron - ex-husband of the film's director Kathryn Bigelow - saying that ""The Hurt Locker"" was the ""Platoon"" of the Iraq war.<br/><br/>I have to disagree. While it's a good movie especially for Bigelow, I don't think it's the best film of 2009.<br/><br/>The reason it's good but not great is that the last third kind of drags and the character arcs aren't done very well. The acting was decent - even above average - but after seeing one bomb disposal scene you've seen them all.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Platoon"" there was little battle action. Watching the unit work was interesting but not much happened with them and a couple of scenes of extended battle action seemed out of place to be honest. There also was a jarring setting at home for one of the characters that showed up all of a sudden.<br/><br/>The film ""Platoon"" also used their scenes to comment on the political and social aspects of the Vietnam conflict through the actions and interactions of the members of the platoon. In ""The Hurt Locker"" there really was none of that.<br/><br/>There have been better Iraq war movies including the recent mini-series on HBO called - ""Generation Kill"" - that had more elements in common with Platoon than this film did.<br/><br/>As I said ""The Hurt Locker"" was a good movie and interesting but not the best of 2009 and certainly not ""The Platoon of the Iraq War..."" unless you think a good war movie just has brooding men and no commentary on the war itself."

When these veterans return home, there is no well deserved homecoming for them. This is due to the fact America has yet again sustained another lost war.

","Kathryn Bigelow, along with journalist screen writer Mark Boal, brings to us a gripping action war drama about a bomb disposal squad in Iraq, Hurt Locker. I have never been a big fan of war movies, especially the ones which celebrate the sacrifice of a soldier for his country and portray him as brain-washed nationalist.<br/><br/>However, that is where Hurt Locker is different from most of the war movies made. It is a story of three soldiers who have different perspective of war. For Sgt. ""Specialist"" Eldridge, war is a killing machine which takes life of a soldier in an instant. For Sgt. Sanborn, war is another of his assignments and he is as professional as a soldier can be, except for one scene. Sgt. William James is the leader of this little team which goes around Iraq in a Hummer disposing bombs. He is without a doubt one of the most compellingly complex characters I have ever seen in a war movie.<br/><br/>He is a cigarette smoking, death metal listening, punk who is a very unprofessional soldier which is the cause of some friction between him and his team. He is also a very friendly, unselfish human who is in the war just because he loves disposing bombs more than his wife and child. Hurt Locker is a series of beautifully shot experiences of this team of soldiers with war ridden streets and buildings of 21st century Iraq as a backdrop. It takes us audience through such an intense and chilling ride, we feel like we are the 4th member of the squad.<br/><br/>Hurt Locker is completely an apolitical movie which does not have any anti or pro-war message and with a documentary feel to it like District 9. It tells the story of a small team of soldiers in Iraq during the last 40 days of their rotation. It is definitely not the best film of the year or the best war movie of this decade. But it will definitely be the war movie which will have redefined the genre of 'war action' movies. I hope it will be 'Silence of the lambs' of all thriller movies, 'The Shining' of all horror movies, 'Chariots of Fire' of sports movies, 'The Dark Knight' of Comic book movies, 'The Toy Story' of animated movies, 'The Inglourious Basterds' of fictional history. Although, there have been better war dramas which portray war from the eyes of a soldier (A Thin Red Line) or plight of the oppressed (Schindler's List), it is refreshing to see an action war movie which does not celebrate jingoism(Saving Private Ryan) or preach hippie anti-war propaganda. I felt the same way about this movie I felt after watching District 9. It has been a long time which I saw a good and different war(sci-fi) movie. Alas, I feel this and Inglourious basterds would be snuffed come night."

","I'm a little undecided about The Hurt Locker. On the one hand, it's undoubtedly a good movie. I might not be into war movies but I can at least recognize them when I see them. Director Kathryn Bigelow keeps the action and suspense scenes tight, replete with the lack of a soundtrack during the particularly tense scenes. The story, which focuses on the soldiers of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, feels plausible and the characters are interesting, though I have to say the focus of movie is definitely its direction. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I have to wonder if this movie is as acclaimed as it is because of its timeliness on two accounts. The first is obviously that it's a good movie about the war in Iraq and that war is still going on, with more US troops dying all the time. Thus the movie does have to resonate with at least the American viewers. The other is that it is past due for a female director to win the Oscar and well, Bigelow is as good a candidate as it gets, what with this well-done movie that not only has the perfect subject but is also a war and action movie - male- dominated genres that she has broken into. <br/><br/>So I don't know if this deserves Best Picture but it sure has got great momentum for it."

Jeremy Renner plays the level-headed bomb defusing expert but we never really understand why he's so cool under pressure. Very few hints about his life at home are given, the story instead focuses on more scenes of action and suspense as he tries to defuse more bombs. The secondary characters are decent but the movie doesn't really move beyond being a movie about the tough guy camaraderie in Iraq.<br/><br/>The Iraqis themselves are background characters except for one kid who is only used as a plot device to show that Jeremy Renner is a good guy whereas everyone else is simply 'bad ass'."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","16 September 2009"," Emotionally draining
","This is an unusual film in a number of respects: an action movie directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow's first work for five years, a war movie that is non-judgmental, and a story with no real narrative arc but instead a series of more-or-less stand-alone sequences. The location is in and around Bagdad (although it was shot in Jordan) in the early part of the US occupation of Iraq (2004) and the focus is entirely on a three-man bomb disposal team: its thrill-seeking leader Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremey Renner), experienced African-American J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and young Specialist Owen Eldridge.<br/><br/>In an interview with the ""Guardian"" newspaper, a former bomb disposal officer with Britain's Royal Engineers commented: ""This film appalled me"" and ""The fundamental stupidity is just staggering"" - so I guess it lacks something in authenticity. But, as a movie, it works incredibly well with from the opening seconds an involved style of cinematography and such sustained tension that at the end one leaves the cinema feeling emotionally drained."

","Shortly after my drafted, eldest brother returned from Vietnam he encouraged me not to go anywhere near the Armed Forces.

She was right – it wasn't just a film it was an experience.<br/><br/>After watching 'The Hurt Locker' I slowly walked out of the theater feeling for the first time I gained a far deeper understanding of what battle is like in current wars. It's an experience so many men and woman should bathe themselves in to better understand words like dedication, honor, liberty and freedom. <br/><br/>'The Hurt Locker' is a film surrounding three men, aged twenty-something, whose job is to disable improvised explosive devices (IEDs), found on roadsides, buildings or anywhere they can kill or immobilize their targets. While other soldiers find shelter this team walks up to the device, finds the trigger and attempts to render it useless. They do all this while knowing the many locals who peer through doorways, windows and rooftops could be holding the trigger. This film puts you dead in the middle of this team as you too count the number of days left before your unit is rotated out of hell. 'The Hurt Locker' is not a violent or graphically difficult film to watch. It's an extremely intense, real-life drama that may stay with you long after you leave the theater. <br/><br/>I encourage everyone to seek out this film.

"gradyharp","10","2","13","14 January 2010"," The Most Powerful Film About Men in Wars
","THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans. It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'. Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful than words. <br/><br/>The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film. Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed. The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children. There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters. What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite. This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe. Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","THE HURT LOCKER is presented in a matter-of-fact, documentary-like fashion that underscores the average, everyday routine of the hardly average, day-to-day routine of disarming bombs in a war zone. Bigelow DOES pick a side, but any side would do in such a scenario; it's not the Right or Wrong of anything but diffusing an explosive situation (which is a play on words, there, of course; forgive). The faces, totally unfamiliar to me (as, I must confess, are the faces of many of those who've gone and fought in that particular Far Off Land, though not all by any means), make the performances less than the usual Hollywood ""given"" performances (and thereby enhances the already heightened suspense). The last shot is absolutely brilliant. See it. But don't forget to keep your head down."

I think the Iraqi are quite thankful that the Americans bombed their cities, killing thousands of innocent people-for a higher good of course. Meanwhile the common American is kept in the dark, away from the reality, now thinking that the military actually has a purpose there. The Us solider freelances as a Private Investigator and of course defuses bombs which wouldn't be there if they weren't there in the first time. So other countries, be thankful that you don't have large amounts of oil, thus keeping the American Gouverment away from 'helping' you get rid of something inexistent.

","THE HURT LOCKER – 75% The hurt locker is an intense film but not a very pointed one. It simply follows 27 days in the life of a quiet matter of fact bomb disposal squad in Iraq.<br/><br/>The squad is led by a reckless but good Sergeant James (an underplaying yet impressive Jeremy Renner) who is as flamboyant in his bomb disposing as maybe James Bond. He is also your regular nice guy who plays football with the local Iraqi kid and kicks ass of his disapproving team mates but then helps them get up.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pretty much one sequence after another of bomb disposals - all seemingly disconnected. The setting is very real and very authentic and so is the bomb disposal but the James style of disposing is a little too Hollywood for comfort. It makes for a good edge of the seat thriller but a thoughtful war movie maybe not.<br/><br/>I would have liked the Hurt locker if it had made me think of Americas strategy of going into Iraq. Or if it was a critique or a supporter of the strategy. I would have also liked it if I felt something for its characters or if it had a point of view on war.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is none of the above. It is a regular and well made war movie with the over done anti war message. So our hero gets emotionally drained and stands with his clothes on in a shower crying. His colleagues start sweating after a couple of close calls and start whining about starting families and his team mates keep getting eliminated.<br/><br/>Throughout you keep wondering why would any one be out there disposing off Electronic bombs in this ultra hero fashion. Wouldn't it be better to just explode it post evacuation. Wouldn't it be better to go after the sources that keep triggering it. Or just use robot devices to dispose them. But trust the Americans to do it cow boy style.<br/><br/>To my common sense the hurt locker tries to paint a picture of how pitiable it is for American soldiers to be doing this but refuses to ask the question of why they should be doing this in the first place. Even if it was asking this question it gets lost in the numb scenario it wallows in.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker would have been recommended if it had been a quite indie movie that figured in the bottom half of everyone's top ten of 2010. But unfortunately the Oscar hype and the critics enthusiasm is going to kill it.<br/><br/>I predict the hurt locker will age poorly just as Patton has or for that matter platoon has. Give me Farenheit 9 / 11 any day to drive home the anti Iraq war message.<br/><br/>Go in expecting a decent war movie and you will like it. Go in expecting a Oscar winner and you will be disappointed. Overall Recommended to hardcore War movie enthusiasts only."
"blackmamba99971","5","1","5","11 April 2010"," Why this movie?
","For all the movies in the world, why make one about the middle east? We have seen every film involved with the Iraqi wars for the past seven years. I think we have been saturated enough with other films like the three kings, the green zone, or the kingdom. Everyone knows that the so called war against terrorism is a farce. For one the US should not be there, neither Canada. But what Katheryn is showing us is the possibility of post traumatic war syndrome. Vets who come home and fall into a despair so bad, that they commit suicide later on because of the horrible nature they remember. I didn't like the way the film moved, it was stodgy, like trying to view through the person's eyes which made it difficult to watch. I know that in real life the picture is not at a stand still to give us clarity. But a little less movement would have been nice to concentrate on other aspects through the film. Bomb disarmament is the most dangerous I can agree with that, but since most of the news these days are about suicide bombers anyway, seeing this film is just another story. Though we are supposed to look at it from their point of view. I think the public has had enough of the Mideast so called war, it's time to move on to other things which do not involve bombs or tanks or GI'S sent out. I am glad Katheryn got an Oscar for her directorial debut, a great achievement, but it would have been nice if she did a whole different film. But then again, she probably would not have won if she did. The white house and other entities probably wouldn't have noticed it then. So sad to see that her work was only watched by war mongers. I cannot give this film ten out of ten stars. People do not need this kind of film in their lives."

But I didn't see that title, either.<br/><br/>Does a viewer need to have first hand knowledge of the true situation in order to properly assess this film? I don't think so.<br/><br/>I am not judging the film by its fidelity to actual situations, because I don't know enough to make that call. However, I think I can judge its quality as cinema.<br/><br/>I actually thought the script was disappointing. Some things were just mystifying. Will's trip to visit the parents of Beckham. Finding a still-burning cigarette. Both of those incidents led to nothing.<br/><br/>And I hate to say it, but I thought Will's character was a bit under-written. Jeremy Renner did a very convincing job, but it would have been nice to have a bit more information on why he could be so fearless, to such an extent that his fellow soldiers could seriously discuss fragging him for their own safety.<br/><br/>A film is not required to provide all the answers, but a few more clues would have been beneficial.

","9.1<br/><br/>What kind of movies do you like, and why do you like them? Why do you like movies at all? Do they offer escape, adrenaline, humor, arousal, self-reflection, or intrigue? Is it an aesthetic pursuit? Which of these does The Hurt Locker offer? If escape, then you would escape into war, which you might expect people would want to escape from. It offers it's fair share of adrenaline. Enough to not dull the effect. It offers a little humor, enough to ease the tension. It offers self-reflection, mostly in men, but not limited to. It also appeals to women who ponder and consider the military, as well as combat-like scenarios, including violence. Now, the last, and most important one: intrigue. Does The Hurt Locker make you feel intrigue? Does it make you feel interested in the settings and scenarios depicted? If the answer is ""yes"", the real question (which is the entire purpose of the film), is ""why""?<br/><br/>This is what The Hurt Locker asks you as a film. Why are you attracted to violent spectacles? To combat? It's a very good question. And the interesting thing is, The Hurt Locker also does a very good job of delivering that adrenaline and intrigue of violence that you (may) crave. It's an almost unavoidable paradox. In order to avoid this, they would have had to have no violence, no action, no explosions in the film. It would have been a commercial failure. But hey, it was pretty indie/""limited"" to begin with. If it was given a wide release in theaters, it would have been commercially successful. I am sure of it. Why? Well, because it seems like a movie where people can pay the ticket price and receive their compensation of adrenaline and action. The very thing that the movie is questioning you about. It's like when fast-food restaurants try to get you to think nutrition and eat healthy.<br/><br/>But The Hurt Locker is not a failure. In the aesthetic sense, it delivers. Its setting and plot require no specifics. No name-dropping. You, as the contemporary audience, know where it takes place, and why. War. That's all you need to know. There is an atmosphere of hostility, with low visibility and a near monotone color scheme. The only standout colors are blue skies and red blood. The shots are paced slow when they need to be, allowing rest from the tenser scenes, but still maintaining suspense at times. The adrenaline packed scenes are much faster, with quick cuts and swinging cameras. The tension builds up like a bomb. Usually, the bomb is defused. But sometimes, it goes off.<br/><br/>The film also does a good job of portraying its characters. The characters being, of course, the young men and women who enlist in the military and experience combat. At one point, a character, stuck in a foxhole like ditch, is drinking some juice. He appears to be sucking on it like a warm bottle of milk, as if delivered straight from mother. The character becomes aware of danger, tosses the juice aside, and grabs his weapon, or rifle, which we can assume his father handed him (metaphorically, of course). The character then beings to defend himself. But not without hesitating and experiencing fear. He did more in conquering that fear than if he would have just simply acted out of the influence of adrenaline. One thing I want to add, is that the pacing in this scene, as well as others of the better moments of the film, are excellent.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a good war film. By that I mean two things. One, it's a good film about war. And two, more importantly, it's a good war film. It makes you question why you are intrigued by war and violent spectacles (if you are). Just as the characters in the film find themselves questioning why they do the things they do, you might find yourself questioning why you wanted to see The Hurt Locker. If you didn't, then your answer is very simple: adrenaline rolled up in action. And just like the beginning quote of the film says, ""...war is a drug."""

The young white guy was, oh I don't know, a bit inconsistent. The war junkie protagonist(?) wasn't likable enough for you to get on board with what he was going through. In short I didn't care enough about how the plot was about to unfold. The character arcs were too subtle and not really arcs - a bit of a dog's breakfast alas.

"kennychaggerty","8","1","5","15 February 2010"," A Unique Character Study of Modern Warfare
","Most of the war films I have seen are meant to demonstrate the mental and physical horrors of warfare such as Paths of Glory, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan. Although Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker shares this characteristic, it also shows how soldiers can become addicted to war. This was surprising to me, in that I was expecting a movie about the faults of the war in Iraq. Instead, The Hurt Locker serves more as a character study about a soldier who feeds off the adrenaline rush during the process of defusing bombs and how his team reacts to his gallant personality.<br/><br/>I get nervous over taking an important test or going to a job interview, so I can't even imagine the state I would be in if I had a job defusing bombs in Iraq. The idea that one wrong move might blow up myself and my team would be much more than I could handle. The Hurt Locker does a fantastic job of showing the kind of personality a soldier must have in order to succeed in dismantling bombs. The story revolves around Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), a bomb diffuser who remains calm during almost any crisis. Though he is certainly the best at what he does, the Sergeant's reckless personality causes the rest of the bomb squad to worry. Understandably the team does not want to die with only a month left in their tour, and it appears that James does not have a care in the world whether they live or die. However, as the squad continues to go on missions, the rest of the team soon discovers that there is more to James' personality than meets the eye. He may be reckless with his own life, but this allows him to put the lives of the rest of his squad over his own.<br/><br/>What separates The Hurt Locker from other war movies is that it demonstrates how fighting for one's country can be appealing to people with certain personality types. Through watching James dismantle bombs throughout the film, I gained more respect for those soldiers who love the thrill of knowing that life could be over at any second. In many ways I wish I was like that. Being unafraid (or at least appearing so) of death is a luxury that most people do not have and in many ways I admire the courage it must take to face death with a big smile on your face.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker feels like a documentary in many ways, partially because it represents an actual war (Iraq). However, I think the main reason why it feels so realistic is the characters are believable. I don't know if The Hurt Locker is based on a true story, but I am almost certain that there are people similar to the characters played by the three leads. Bigelow does a great job of capturing the environment of Iraq. The townspeople look on with confusion, there are destroyed cars along the road, and the buildings all look like they have gone through an earthquake. I almost felt as if I was watching the news, except The Hurt Locker is much more entertaining and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hurt Locker is the best war film I have seen since Black Hawk Down. It is suspenseful, action-packed, thoughtful, and contains one of the best lead characters in recent memory. I believe The Hurt Locker will go down as a modern classic and a film that demonstrates a different side of war."
"rddj05","8","1","5","14 February 2010"," A Refreshing Take on Why Some Soldiers Do What They Do
","Very well done film revolving around a three-man, bomb-defusing EOD team in Iraq circa 2004. It is subtle, honest, and defies cliché at almost every turn. Basically, it is the anti- Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>What is most interesting about the film is that it isn't a hagiography on the war soldier. It shows these 3 men for who they are; men who are good at what they do, and who may have made the choice to do it before knowing exactly what it would involve. The three men include the experienced, competent Sergeant (Anthony Mackie), who wants to fulfill is duty and get out of Iraq, the fearful private who is convinced on his own imminent demise, and the adrenaline junkie, war-addict who would be lost but for the dangerous jobs he intentionally involves himself in (Jeremy Renner). <br/><br/>The screenwriter embedded himself with an American combat unit in Iraq before writing the script, and obviously realized that for some soldiers, it's not as simple as ""defending honor and freedom, and the American way of life"". Like most people who go to work everyday, whether their lives are in danger or not, some soldiers do what they do because they made a commitment, or they're good at, or simply because it's the only thing that has ever given their lives any meaning."
"bournefootball","9","1","5","5 February 2010"," Tension abounds in Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker...
","Gut-wrenching, pulse-pounding, out of this world tension, just mere exterior descriptions of what Kathryn Bigelow's new film, The Hurt Locker is. Written by Mark Boal, The Hurt Locker overflows with intensity, passion, and reverence. In the wake of 9/11, filmmakers have struggled to create a piece that is socially accepted and respected. Only two films have succeeded in this task over the past eight years; Paul Greengrass' beautiful United 93, depicting an open interpretation of the final moments of the doomed plane and now, Bigelow's film will join the short, elite list.<br/><br/>This character-driven tale tells the stories of three army soldiers who are a part of the most dangerous of jobs to offer in the military, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), in plainer terms, they disarm bombs. Staff Sergeant William James played ferociously by Jeremy Renner heads up this story as a soldier facing death every moment of the day. With his wife and child at home and often displaying unorthodox behavior, James seems fit for a war soldier. Sergeant JT Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie is a by-the-book man, living his days at war while incurring losses along the way. Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty is young, bewildered, and thrust into a situation unknowing of the impact it would have. What these three men bring to their respective roles educates the viewer of the horrors of war. Forget what you think you know on CNN and your local news, Bigelow is running the show with Boal out on assignment and Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty as our anchors. <br/><br/>The crews of the picture are the tools in building this powerful vessel. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd uses his four camera use to keep us feeling like a first-person account of the events of the film. The mesh of Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders score and the sound effects team makes for a more suspenseful experience. Filming in Jordan was the choice of Bigelow to give it a more authentic feel. ""If you're going to make a film about the Middle East, make it in the Middle East."" Bigelow said to me after the film. It paid off big time because I always felt like I was there in the battle zone, enduring pain, torment, and dehydration. <br/><br/>With a NY & LA release set for Friday, June 26th, The Hurt Locker's deserves all the praise its been receiving and should be experienced by any movie lover. The Oscar Prospects might look a little grim based on the summer release but with no real first-half of 2009 contenders, Bigelow and her film have strong chances of taking a spot amongst the final five come end of the year. Renner and Mackie will also be strong contenders in their respective categories. The strongest possibility for an Oscar has to be for writer Mark Boal. The research he did for the film alone will keep Boal in the minds of voters. The Hurt Locker's striking cinematography, crisp editing that keeps it at a heart palpating pace, strong performances, directing, and writing is enough to take this film in consideration for your viewing. Brilliant, simply brilliant."
"StrayButlerReturns","9","1","5","4 February 2010"," Apolitical, boots-on-the-ground war picture
","The notion of yet another motion picture concerning the Iraq War is probably about as welcome as a knife in the eye. While it may be a pertinent topic in this day and age, it's a flat cinematic subject, with Hollywood producing generally stodgy movies of bloated self-importance marred by various miscalculations (Rendition, The Kingdom, and so on). Thank heavens, then, for Kathryn Bigelow's superb The Hurt Locker. Among the various reasons that Bigelow's flick works where others have failed is that it never endeavours to be ""about"" the war in Iraq; rather, it accepts the war as a background setting for a fascinating character study regarding the potentially addictive thrills of mortal danger.<br/><br/>Set during the early stages of the post-invasion period in Iraq in 2004, The Hurt Locker follows a group of American soldiers known as Bravo Company who specialise in bomb disposal. With just a few weeks remaining before they are rotated back to the United States, their Sergeant meets with an unfortunate end. This leaves the other soldiers in the unit to serve their final weeks with a new comrade; Staff Sergeant William James (Renner). Much to the chagrin of his fellow soldiers, James is an adrenaline junkie with no qualms about disarming a bomb device manually (and thus breaking protocol). The plot of The Hurt Locker from there is episodic, with the soldiers shifting from conflict to conflict. Tension is a killer during these sequences, because explosive devices aimed at everyone and no-one could be disguised beneath any pile of garbage. Since a bomb would take out anybody and anything within a certain radius, James must approach one of the devices alone to disarm it (with the perimeter maintained by his fellow soldiers). Thus, one of the most repeated images of the film is of the unaccompanied James as he wanders into a strangely deserted space - a fitting visual metaphor for the character's emotional and personal isolation from those around him, both near and far (one even gets the sense his wife and kid back home are never close in his mind).<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker was scripted by Mark Boal; a journalist who based the film's screenplay on his own experiences. Even if you're unaware of this fact before watching the movie, you'll likely suspect it because a clear and unvarnished sense of reality permeates every frame. This is an apolitical, boots-on-the-ground war picture. Not once do the characters stop to discuss why they are there, and they never discuss the wayward politics of the war. In fact, the movie has no political agenda. The filmmakers don't care if the invasion and occupation is right or wrong - all that matters is that the troops are in the country, have a job to do, and are fighting for survival. Much like a number of prior films that have touched on the Iraqi conflict (such as Jarhead), The Hurt Locker portrays a meandering battle that ends up being less about specific offenses and more about maintenance. Unpredictable combat leads to unpredictable schedules, and (particularly for a bomb disposal unit) the call of duty comes when it comes. Right from the opening scene, there's a potent sense that no character is safe, and death can come at any moment. It's this terrifying uncertainty that fuels the story's drama. <br/><br/>Another of the greatest strengths of The Hurt Locker is that it quickly and decisively re-establishes Kathryn Bigelow's position as one of the best action filmmakers in the business. Speaking from a technical standpoint, this film is a stunner from start to finish. Bigelow has always had a knack for directing action in complicated, even abnormal scenarios (like surfers robbing banks in Point Break), and the deserts of Iraq are no different, with the director exhibiting an amazing command for the physical details of film-making while shifting through the various set-pieces. A viewer can viscerally feel the danger the characters are in, as most of the film was shot on location in Jordan using an effective documentary style. Interestingly, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd utilised four hand-held cameras at any one time, capturing a total of about 200 hours of footage. Even with this hand-held disposition, the frame is never rocked too much. However, it must be said that despite this technical competency, the movie fails to resonate as much as something like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.<br/><br/>The film's cast boasts such names as Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and David Morse, but these big-name actors are relegated to minor roles. This is intentional since, although these well-known stars may entice people to watch the movie, they can detract from the reality of the situation. The main players of The Hurt Locker are instead Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, each of whom pulls off their characters with complete assurance and compelling enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is not a film that assumes an ideological stand regarding the Iraq War. Instead, it aspires to present viewers with a war film about the ways in which a unit of soldiers react to the pressures of combat. In fact, if a few details were changed, this could be set during any war. To the credit of the filmmakers, the movie only misfires a few times - a major detractor is when the focus leaves Iraq on a couple of occasions to examine William James' life in America, but neither time is necessary. The second trip home provides an explanation for James' risky behaviour that's a bit too on the nose, especially when combined with the music video-style recruitment commercial that closes the film."
"Lemos","9","1","5","2 February 2010"," Apocalypse Now for this generation?
","Whilst not immediately obvious or comparable, one cannot but remember certain scenes of the Hurt Locker as a modern update to scenes in Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or The Deer Hunter. In many ways all what we view, is an update on new realities of this particular war, the desert barren God-forsaken terrain, the new tactical mindset and mind games and the physical human challenges facing this new type of adversary and war. But most of all I loved not being preached at. The film did not take sides, instead focusing on the brave men who do the dirty job on behalf of what we wrongfully or rightfully interpret as defending our western values, and the other side that feels it has nothing to loose in fighting what they perceive as a invasion of their own value system. Much like the Vietnam War it shows that whilst some of the principles we are fighting for may be in part justified or comprehensible, the means used, certainly confuse the issues at stake and ultimately the ends we are trying to achieve . This film helps us understand what war we are raging, so it is engrossing from beginning to end - all it asks is that we understand each soldier's own incomprehension, confusion and misgivings but ultimately honour their courage and professionalism and those who pay the ultimate price in defence of their work, duty and obligation."
"Cary_Barney","8","1","5","2 February 2010"," Gripping despite inaccuracies
","This film is being taken to task here by Iraq veterans, who point out everything it gets wrong. One of my students, also a vet, did so without having seen it -- he can't stand war movies for that very reason. I've seen enough of them so that even while watching, and despite the authentic-looking hand-held cinematography, I could guess the movie was at some remove from nuts and bolts reality, like most.<br/><br/>Overlook that, however, and it's still a dramatically powerful tale of conflict and bonding between the three men of the crew. All three leads are excellent, with Jeremy Renner standing out as the obsessed bomb defusing expert. The scenes of neutralizing the bombs, while casing the area for anyone ready to remotely detonate them, accurate or not, are fiercely suspenseful exercises in making viewers bite their nails. (Scenes about defusing bombs always work, no matter how hokey. There was even a good one on the old ""M*A*S*H"" series.)<br/><br/>I think the film gets something else right, too, though I realize as a non-vet I'm going out on a limb. From the start, we experience these characters as strangers in a strange and hostile land, aware that they're to some extent engendering hatred and thus more danger. Renner says after one Iraqi is wrestled to the ground: ""If he wasn't an insurgent, he is now."" The sense of fear and panic pervades every scene away from the military compound.<br/><br/>It's a bit overlong; the missions grow repetitive. Perhaps it could have done without the obviously far-fetched subplot in which Renner goes off alone at night on a mission of his own. Yet the brief, non-explosive coda to that adventure, a few scenes later, is stunning, driving home the point that no matter how well-intentioned, Renner's character only thinks he knows and understands the place where he's serving. That makes sense in terms of the film's conclusion, where we see the real reason why he's there.<br/><br/>In sum: see it for the intensity of the acting and the suspense, and as a non-politicized critique of the war. Unless of course you're a vet, in which case you're excused. (More than one of you will hopefully do what Oliver Stone did with ""Platoon"" someday and set the record straight.)"
"doralover","8","1","5","29 January 2010"," Great character study, deals with interesting theme, yet not perfect
","The Hurt Locker follows a group of Bravo soldiers who deal with IED (improvised explosive devices). The film starts off with a devastating sequence in which the leader of the current unit is killed while trying to disarm a bomb, and the survivors of the unit, Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) and Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), are forced to work with the reckless, selfish and arrogant Sgt. William James Ranger (Jeremy Renner) who puts both their lives into danger every time he goes out to diffuse a bomb. Yet Ranger is still the hero, mainly because we get to see how good of a person he really is. The film is filled with tense moments, and the characters of the film know that every second they are out in Baghdad disarming bombs could easily be their last, making this movie one of the more suspenseful war movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>While Renner and Mackie both give incredible and strong performances, the real hero in this film is Kathryn Bingelow. She is not out to state a political message about Iraq (like Home of the brave or Stop-loss), or even a social commentary about adaption, surprisingly it's a raw look at what life in war is really like. The violence is not explicit like in most war movies; the violence comes within each person, as they count down the hours to go home, or simply countdown to their own deaths, and put their lives in danger for each other. The film is a character study in which the quote ""war is a drug"" follows the characters like a shadow, showing us how these soldiers can see war as a thrilling excitement and how they can grow to hate it (like most drug addicts do). While the core of The Hurt Locker lies within its character's motivations, the hand- held camera shots and the focus correction make every second more the squad spends in the scene more daring and confusing. We mainly see through the eyes of the soldiers, but that also means that we see how they are in constant danger of death. In one scene when Ranger has to disarm a bomb in a car, both Sanborn and Eldridge get surrounded by viewers, and as we saw in the first scene, you can never tell the difference between a viewer and someone with a remote explosion device. By letting us see through their eyes, and creating chaos through camera movement and desperation, she creates a tense atmosphere which recalls hell more than Iraq. This technique gets interesting as she repeats it throughout the film and makes us realize that Ranger is putting the two lower ranked soldiers in danger, and we want to hate him but we can't. Renner gives a very charismatic and sometimes even heart-warming performance that shows how even some extremely well-hearted people get corrupted and addicted to war.<br/><br/>The theme of addiction to war is what makes this film unique and one of the best of its kind. Ranger is not a misfit to society (recall Born on fourth of July, or Stop-loss for that matter) who doesn't know what life is like outside war. No, on the contrary, he appreciates life outside war, but simply cannot live it. The struggle for adrenaline and those seconds or minutes when he faces death are the only ones that make sense to him anymore. Most people hate war, but he loves it. And the most unsettling part of it is that we can understand where he is coming from! We felt the tension he did when diffusing those bombs, and even if we were worried about death, we felt the need to grasp to our life as hard as we could. That is the magic about Bingelow's film, she made us appreciate life and at the same time understand why soldiers put theirs in danger to one extent or the other. This could be interpreted as anti- war message, but because of the final sequence we see that she doesn't have an agenda, she is just showing us what true life is like in war. We draw our own conclusions. It's magically terrific to understand these characters, and that's what makes it a great war movie.<br/><br/>So is this movie perfect or what? Unfortunately no. It's hard to believe that one simple squad consisting of three people would do all the things their squad did. It's like watching CSI: Iraq, they do everything, and that is not how war works. Also, there is a sub-plot involving a child that is never fully wrapped, we are left to conclude it ourselves, but explaining the confusion of that plot could have helped us understand Ranger more, although I think that has more to do with script than directing. Apart from that, the cinematography is top-notch, Renner is amazing and I want to see him in more films, and the music is also perfect. This film is a great war movie, and I recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>mariofas.wordpress.com"

","Tipped be the main challenger for Avatar during the awards season, The Hurt Locker is a very different kettle of fish. The movie follows the exploits of a three man bomb disposal squad in Iraq: In particular, the arrival and impact of a new Team Leader in the form of William James (played by Jeremy Renner – who looks like Eminem's evil twin). James replaces the previous leader, played in a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Guy Pearce, who was killed in action. Naturally, he is different to his predecessor and this will take some adjustment from the other men – particularly when one of James's main differences is an inclination to ignore protocol and get the unit into more and more dangerous situations. As would be expected, the characters must have some journey of self discovery to go on, but this is handled with a subtlety and realism that enables it to avoid cliché. The movie, excellently directed by Kathryn Bigelow, carries a documentary feel and the look, feel and sound of the locations provides a real insight into how things must be in Iraq.

You can help but care about each of the main characters and even some of the smaller actors.

Jermey Did a great job getting into his character and I was extremely impressed on all levels. Anthony whom plays JT was the breakout performer in my mind however as he showed a deeper connection with his role and bared the proper anger/emotion to each scene. Brian on the other hand I was displeased with as he used to much emotion at most times and then out of nowhere he would be anrgy and start cussing but I am going to let that slide on that maybe the director/writer was trying to show how unstable he was.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece in its genre, but only its genere.

"tubby1","7","1","5","2 January 2010"," Strong Set-pieces
","The Hurt Locker is a nervy and intrepid story that has strength in its telling but relies heavily on the combat to provide the psychological meaning without the essential conjecture from the characters involved.<br/><br/>There is no denying the intensity and suspense that the Hurt Locker provides through its set pieces, which are skillfully brought to life through the reality of the cinematography. Yet the Hurt Locker consists of these gripping situation which seem to always find the unfortunate three soldiers. There is a lot of action and a number of static shots to convey the psychological torment of the soldiers but it is rather bereft of dialogue to give it a more pronounced emotivity.<br/><br/>The relationship between Sgt Sanborn, Eldridge and Sgt William James the new leader of the elite Bomb Squad Unit is passable but what I found particularly frustrating was the scene where they contemplate killing Sgt James? Was this for real? This scene is acutely bizarre. Naturally the film guides itself to the situation where there is general respect between them, which was rather rudimentary.<br/><br/>I enjoyed a number of cameos in the Hurt Locker, which gave a certain jolt to the proceedings, and Jeremy Renner does a fine job in the lead as Sgt James. Although The Hurt Locker has some very good set pieces and the film is most of the time rather riveting it relies on these moments to capture the audience a little too much."

","The idea of war as men in uniform taking turns firing at each other seems extinct, and Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker paints an uncomfortably realistic picture of what war has become, and what it will continue to be. Biglow proves she can generate suspense as well as any working director, and Jeremy Renner leads a fantastic ensemble cast, in a film rightfully generating major awards buzz as a disappointing year comes to a close.<br/><br/>War movies often try to prove, with extended sequences of graphic violence, that ""war is hell"", but this film tells the story of a man, Sgt. William James, who actually gets his fix on the life and death crises that each day brings. I only wish we had experienced some of that attitude from James' point of view, instead of experiencing it largely through the eyes of his colleagues.

"agmoldham","6","1","5","11 September 2009"," A fine war movie
","I'd heard some good reviews about Hurt Locker, so decided to go and see whether they were accurate. I've got to say that whilst the film isn't flawed, it's certainly well worth seeing. The best aspect of the film is that it makes you consider the current conflicts that Nato are involved in. I will be in the majority when I say that this is largely played out via news headlines reporting the deaths of a handful of national troops. You don't really hear anything about 'opposition' deaths although you always have the impression that they are far greater in number.<br/><br/>The film doesn't dwell on the political aspects of the Iraqi war, but focuses instead on the various responses of the Nato troops. The film follows a group of soldiers who are responsible for defusing bombs. Probably the most striking aspect is how little integration there is between the troops and the local population. I would like to think that this was not the case in reality although I fear the film may have accurately portrayed this. I particularly liked the quote ""if he wasn't an insurgent, he is now"" following some rather harsh treatment of a local.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of plaudits for Kathryn Bigelow, the director, and these are well deserved. The film grips you from start to finish. Jeremy Renner is very good as the fearless Sgt James. The supporting cast are also excellent, so this is one of the better war films."

","Director Kathryn Bigelow is best known for POINT BREAK (1991) but THE HURT LOCKER has exploded, in both a literal and figurative sense, and her star will rise on the back of it, as will those of the new, and mostly unknown, faces that star in it.<br/><br/>THE HURT LOCKER is a riveting, suspenseful portrait of bomb squad technicians' courage under fire. The movie begins with three members of the Army's elite Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squad battling insurgents and one another as they search for and disarm a wave of roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad. While there's no doubting that the protagonists try and make the city a safer place for both Iraqis and Americans alike, the film never once broaches whether Iraq would have been a better place had the Americans stayed at home.<br/><br/>Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) of Bravo Company are at the centre of the war. They're part of a small force specifically trained to handle the homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that are a deathly, daily threat, accounting for more than half of American deaths and countless thousands of Iraqis.<br/><br/>The job is a high-pressure and high-stakes assignment and the team loses its leader on what seems like a routine mission. When Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) cheerfully takes over the team, Sanborn and Eldridge are shocked by what seems like his reckless disregard for military protocol and basic safety measures. As the fiery chaos of Baghdad threatens to engulf them, the men struggle to understand and contain their mercurial new leader long enough for then to make it home alive and in one piece. They have only 38 days left before they get to head home but with each new mission James blurs the line between bravery and bravado, it seems only a matter of time before disaster strikes.<br/><br/>Their mission, as it's presented, is clear – protect and save – but it's anything but easy, as the margin of error is zero. The film is a thrilling and heart pounding look at the psychology of bomb technicians and the effects of risk and danger on the human psyche. THE HURT LOCKER is a fictional tale, but inspired by real events. It was written by journalist and screenwriter Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.<br/><br/>With a visual and emotional intensity that makes the audience feel like it has been transported to the dizzying, 24-hour turmoil of life in the bomb squad, THE HURT LOCKER is both a gripping portrayal of the soldiers' sacrifice and heroism and a layered, probing study of the soul-numbing rigors and potent allure of the modern battlefield. That the movie is a stunningly visceral portrait of modern warfare is undeniable yet its moral ambivalence keeps it from being a truly outstanding film. It's hasn't taken the title of best war film of all time from APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) but maybe we'll have to wait for the end of the Iraqi war before anyone can make a film of such brilliance!"

Film does well to mix the right type of action and humour and still not lose it's way with the story. Performance wise, everyone was great in it. Jeremy Renner plays the mentally tortured soldier role very well. I liked his character from the start, even though he was a bit of reckless maverick, I still liked him. Anthony Mackie just keeps getting better and better, and in my opinion he's definitely one the best black actors out there. I thought he was absolutely great in this. David Morse continues to be reliable, Ralph Fiennes makes a short comedic cameo as a private contractor, and Brian Geraghty impresses as the paranoid Sgt Eldrigde. Kathryn Bigelow is a director who has made some really good movies, Near Dark and Point Break being two of them. She's made a war movie that isn't the usual USA gung ho crap. It's a true tale about what soldiers are facing each day on the frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan. And one that raises the question, what exactly are they fighting to protect? Go see!"

They are some of the bravest men I have ever had the privilege to work with and it is about time a movie was made for them. This film does a fine job of showing the many layers of a soldier or marines mind frame during the hardships of life at war. Great acting and great effects neither obscure or become detrimental to the storytelling.A little snag in the middle with a slightly unrealistic scene but we can forgive. In a perfect world a movie will come out that shows this type of realism of characters combined with the realism of the way we really fight over there. -USMC-"

","This movie gives you exactly what you want. Several episodes of high intensity life-or-death situations involving the military equivalent of a ""bomb squad"" in Iraq. The team is made of 3 men. One who wears a protective suit and deactivates bombs, another who is in communication with him and supervises the area, and a third who is told by the second what to do- which usually means also to be on the lookout for bad guys.<br/><br/>In the intro our bomb deactivator dies when a bad guy detonates a bomb. He is replaced by James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner. This is your typical American movie hero. The cowboy-type who doesn't care about orders, protocols, or the safety of anyone else. He just goes into the action recklessly and takes care of business without much fanfare. He's good at what he does but he is irresponsible- much to the chagrin of Sanborn (team member #2) who is to ensure the safety of the team. That leads to a confrontation between the two. Meanwhile our third guy is traumatized by the death at the beginning and regularly sees a psychologist.<br/><br/>We get various scenes of bomb deactivation that are perfectly shot and conceived. This is very exciting stuff. In between these we get scenes of the boys being boys, drinking, messing around with each other. At some point while driving through the desert they stop to help some unknown foreigners change a tire when they are suddenly shot upon by snipers. This leads our team to play snipers as well. This scene seems somewhat out of place but is fun nonetheless.<br/><br/>The recklessness of James reaches a peak when he leads the team to search for whoever was behind a suicide bombing of a tanker. They run off into a town at night and without backup. In this process one of our guys gets injured.<br/><br/>This movie tries to balance realism with elements that are just not believable. James gets away with things that one can't possibly imagine wouldn't have any serious consequences. At the same time, the settings, the situations, the way it's filmed, everything has a very realistic sense to it- as if you were a witness to these events. The movie looks great: bright, crisp, and colorful. It sounds good, and the language too is very realistic, being reminiscent of a Michael Mann movie, where you are thrown in the midst of a group of specialists who have their own lingo and don't explain themselves to the audience.<br/><br/>But it's also this episodic character of the movie that makes it somewhat unsatisfying. A thread of continuity is missing. An arc of development isn't really there. This is a very minor flaw, but it's there. Fortunately, the movie doesn't fall into the trap of trying to give these people full lives in a cheesy Hollywood way: there are no love interests, no romantic conquests, no extended scenes of what the women back home are up to, which is done to sickening death in shows like The Unit. There is just enough minimal background about these guys. There is also barely any larger context of war, or of other military units. The focus is very narrow on the three guys. Also missing, and this is a weakness, are villains. There are 2 short appearances of bad guys here, but there are just that- appearances that last a couple of seconds. Nothing more is said, we don't know if they are caught or what happens. I would attribute this to the filmmakers intent on being realistic. Our team is deployed to a situation, resolves it, and leaves. That's their job, that's it, no questions asked.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie, however, is perfect. James completes his rotation and goes back home to his wife and son. But can someone who has been dancing on the very edge of the abyss find himself in a world that is filled with choices and mind-boggling variety? A world where things aren't as simple as 'cut this wire and you live or cut the wrong wire and you die'? A world that at the same time completely lacks the urgency and seriousness of war? I won't reveal the final scene but it is probably exactly what would happen with a man like James."

","Before seeing this movie my all time favorite worst movie ever was The Happening (I still regret paying to go see it). Not anymore. Since this was a really bad year for movies I didn't bother watching the Oscars. The day after the Oscars a friend of mine brought the award winning movie to watch. I said what the heck, it won, I can't be that bad. WRONG!! I am glad I did not pay to see this one, it is by far one of the most boring movie I had the ""privilege"" to see. I kept waiting for something to happen, for at least one scene not to end in such a big disappointment. I have seen movies where the action starts in the middle of it, this is not the case at all. This is nothing more than an American propagandist movie that wants to ""explain"" the stupid war in Iraq, portraying them all as bombers and the American soldier as the god sent life savior of what I did not understand. Of course it won an Oscar, it's all political. Because trust me, there is no reason what so ever for rewarding an unrealistic, boring, poorly directed, propagandist movie I would under no circumstance advice anyone to watch. I feel sorry for the actors, Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce did not deserve to have such a meaningless, short appearance in this useless movie. Kudos for Jeremy Renner who does a great job in portraying a mad, over the top soldier with no regards for anyone but his own thrill. I guess they let this one slip, Americans have no concern to anyone but their own interest, no respect for ranks or their own jobs, drinking, fighting, not obeying orders. I see no pride in that. I actually sympathize with the Iraqies in the movie.<br/><br/>6 Oscars won? How stupid do they think we are?"

","Mo'nique's statement about the Academy ""showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics"" was a blatant exception in 2010's Academy Awards ceremony. Acclaiming ""The Hurt Locker"" as a greater film than ""Avatar"" - and, for this matter, the even better sci-fi drama ""District 9"" - is preposterous. It was all about politics, period. The conferred awards were about the United States once again being entangled in a questionable war, and about many young Americans dying in a far country for dubious reasons. It was certainly about the first Oscar winning female director. Ironically, the movie did not need such undeserved appraisal from the Academy members to be respected both for its form and its content. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a very good movie, unarguably very well planned and executed. Nevertheless, it is an American movie for Americans, as the immediate social and political concerns that its creators planned to convey are not easily transferred to other audiences."

","An intense study on how war effects its soldiers, ""Hurt Locker"" is never cheesy or melodramatic (like many war movies tend to be at times), always believable in character and dialog, and unbearably nerve racking most of the time.<br/><br/>I really liked how extremely great and famous world actors show up for a few minutes and then they're gone. In fact, two appearances were so brief that I thought it was only someone who looked like that famous actor. Surely someone of their screen strength would get more time. Not so. That really was Guy Pierce and Ralph Fiennes and David Morse. Look closely, but don't blink, and you'll see them!<br/><br/>The ""newer"" actors in this film were top notch as well.

","well to be fair, this is not my favourite sort of film - war movie, hand-held camera, grainy, almost colourless film. It was certainly suspenseful in parts, but for me it was a little too long... I'd clearly got the message of the addictive nature of the adrenaline-fueled rush of war, long before the movie was over. So I found myself a little bored by it all in the last half hour. Now I am all for women's rights and us being recognized as formidable equals, but I have to confess that I was disappointed that this is the first movie that has got a woman the top award for direction.... because a more blokey film could not have been made! And I too see it as a PRO-WAR film and what's more a PRO-IRAQI-WAR film! There is not a whiff of femininity in this film! Or am I stereo-typing what I think what should be the kind of movies made by women. It's just that I believe that in such a male-dominated industry there are more than enough of these films being made. As I write this though, I reflect, DOES this movie illustrate that Kathryn Bigelow IS a formidable equal in the industry!"
"zofos","7","1","6","11 March 2010"," Defuse It Like Beckham
","Iraq. The present. American bomb disposal units lead by Jeremy Renner's character have the thankless task of defusing sneakily-planted bombs (IEDs or Improvised Explosive Devices) in the deserted streets of Baghdad. They put their lives on the line daily and put themselves through constant stress and danger.<br/><br/>In this movie, Iraq is as disorientating and its people as alien to the Americans as Vietnam and its people were back in the 1960s and 70s during that conflict. The black character Sanborn says at one stage: ""They all look the same to us."" This is a phrase that many GIs said about Asians back in 'Nam.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is loaded with some of the most nerve-wracking scenes of sweat-soaked tension to hit the screen recently. Brilliantly shot and edited, they have a shaky-cam documentary quality with some cutaways to strange images caught on-the-fly (the cat with the injured paw limping away, the kids looking on from balconies and the mini-tornado in the desert).<br/><br/>Some of it doesn't ring true, particularly the boozy, homo-erotic horseplay back at the barracks. There is also an odd scene where a load of (incompetent?) British soldiers (including a cameo by a VERY well-known English actor) get killed by snipers and it's up to the heroic Americans to save their asses.<br/><br/>The second half becomes more predictable and sentimental, particularly the overdone speeches about having kids or the ludicrous lengths Renner's character goes to to try and save one. Renner was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar but he didn't particularly impress me, he's okay, nothing more.<br/><br/>This movie won the Best Picture Oscar recently and, for me, it's a double award for the troops out in Iraq and for the efforts of the filmmakers (just as Sean Penn's Oscar for ""Milk"" was really for the struggles of Harvey Milk and the gay community and for Penn's efforts).<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is certainly a good film, but I don't think it's a great one and I'm not sure people will look back on it as a classic."

"pauljcurley","4","1","6","18 February 2010"," A War Addict Rocks Iraq
","The Hurt Locker opens with the quote: ""war is a drug"".<br/><br/>It is considered a movie about Iraq – specifically, a gritty, realistic movie about a 3-man bomb disposal unit in Iraq. But it is actually a movie about addiction – specifically, a gritty, yet ridiculous movie about one man's addiction to being a hero.<br/><br/>Like many addicts, SSG William James is self-destructive, putting himself and others in unnecessary harm. He is stubborn, violent, and unable to maintain normal human relationships or attachments to anyone, even his own baby son. (With the odd exception of one Iraqi street kid).<br/><br/>I have no problem with this part of the character. My problem is the fact that The Hurt Locker seems to glorify Sgt. James' out-of-control addiction to war. It tries to make it seem cool. Sgt. James is nothing short of a super-hero on a mission -- destroying the enemy and wasting no time with anyone who dares to question his martial instincts. He is the classic maverick who bends the rules, does things his own way, knows more than his superiors, and comes out ahead due to sheer talent and bad-boy bravado.<br/><br/>This would be OK if this film was supposed to be fun and action-packed like Rambo or Die Hard, with a bad-ass dude doing things that are not humanly possible.<br/><br/>But, at it's core, The Hurt Locker is supposed to be an edgy, uber-realistic look at Man's need to be a hero. Many Iraq vets complain about its lack of factual accuracy in terms of the military details. In my view, the problem is even worse than this. The problem is that it gets the story of addiction wrong. It shows all the cool parts about being a war-loving maniac, but virtually none of the downside. Sgt. James never gets injured, and never gets disciplined. Time after time, he risks his life and the lives of other men, and generally acts like a complete jerk. But, in the end, with cool music playing in the background, covered in desert dust, he always saves the day.<br/><br/>We're supposed to think: I may not like this crazy dude, but I gotta respect him. I may not want to be his friend, but I'm damn glad there are tough hombres like Sgt. James over there defending our freedom. Or protecting our women, or whatever we're supposedly doing over there. I think I remember something about weapons of mass destruction? I would compare The Hurt Locker poorly with other movies about addiction (Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, etc.). While those films might have portrayed drug use as cool or fun, in the end things usually end up very, very badly for the drug addict. Apparently, this is not so for the war addict. According to The Hurt Locker, the war addict is an invincible hero."

","Two men (Mackie and Geraghty) question their loyalty to their Army bomb squad when a reckless Sergeant First Class (Renner) takes over in the final five weeks of their tour in Iraq. A gripping story and a talented cast. But you have to wonder where the film is going. There are no memorable characters like Brando's Col. Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" or Emery's Gny. Sgt. Hartman from ""Full Metal Jacket"", which is fine if you have an untold story but even the film fails at that. There's nothing notable about this story or its characters. What this film contains are your average Joes, in everyday war situations. One can argue that there's nothing wrong with that. But you have to wonder, why not just make a documentary instead? In fact, the film may have been perfect had it been a documentary. But it wasn't. Instead, they waste three strong actors by giving them bland characters and (worst of all) pointless cameos from A-list actors that didn't move the story along at all. So what it has come down to is that it's documentary-like except it's actually just another filmmaker's interpretation, which we've all seen before.<br/><br/>**½"
"dfranzen70","9","1","6","4 February 2010"," Your teeth will rattle.
","With bone-jarring explosions and a heartfelt theme of overworked, stressed-out soldiers, The Hurt Locker is easily one of the top movies of the year. It's absolutely overflowing with tension as the selfless members of an elite bomb squad in Iraq are constantly besieged by conflict: from civilians, from unseen enemies, and among each other. Jeremy Renner, as the unit's new leader, is in particular fearless and unswerving, with a gutsy tenacity that shakes you to your core.<br/><br/>The Bravo Company is a bomb-disposal unit operating in Baghdad, Iraq. Sgt. William James arrives to head the group after its former leader, Sgt. Thompson, is killed in action. James quickly proves to be a man who moves to the beat of a different drummer, sometimes ignoring communiques from his fellow squad members, throwing caution to the wind. A freewheeling cowboy, James appears on the surface to be all rebellious bluster, but it soon becomes evident that his cockiness masks due caution and an almost unparalleled ability to remain cool under tremendous pressure.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it. War movies in the past have alternately shown soldiers as gung-ho blocks of wood or somewhat-vulnerable human beings, but few have shown how cool some true leaders can be when things get hot - physically and psychologically.<br/><br/>Picture this: a car is afire in the middle of a town square. A bomb is feared to be inside. A soldier, part of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, dons a heavy-protection suit and ambles to the fire. He extinguishes the fire with foam and then carefully opens the doors. Then methodically goes through every element of the car to find the bomb's triggering mechanism. This sound pressurized to begin with, doesn't it? Now picture that soldier surrounded by unseen assailants. There are only two other men on his team; their job is to provide cover for him, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for any suspicious activity. Could be that the young man on the neighboring rooftop isn't aiming a camera lens at the fire, he's aiming a gun. Or maybe he's signaling someone else, someone who has the actual trigger. And these aren't just people who are actual terrorists, it's also people who just plain don't want the Americans in their towns anymore.<br/><br/>As James' methodical madness saves the day again and again, his actions have varying effects on his mates. Sgt. Sanborn is a straight-arrow soldier who respects the rules of the game (i.e., he has no time for James' shenanigans), while young Spc. Eldridge seems to take a little more of a shine to his superior. In any case, there is also a side plot of a young boy whom James befriends. Is this boy as genuine as he seems (in his cynical exploitation of soldiers' DVD needs), or is he merely a tool in someone else's shed? One of the underlying messages of the movie is that the soldiers have virtually no one they can really trust; every innocent could be a bringer of death, no matter how young and no matter how fragile.<br/><br/>Before this movie, Kathryn Bigelow was probably best known for movies like Strange Days and Point Break. And being married to James Cameron, whose name you might recognize as well. Both of those movies were pretty solid action movies, but they owed a lot more to their stars - Ralph Fiennes and Patrick Swayze - than to their direction. But Bigelow easily trumps herself here, and possibly all of the movies to come out in 2009 (including a little picture by her ex, Cameron). The Hurt Locker is so well shot (by Barry Ackroyd) and directed that you feel as if you are mere yards away from every potential skull-shaking explosion. The movie is shot in almost a verite' style, so you feel like you're right on top of the action, something that's crucial for intense movies like this (and less so for comic-book action movies like Mission:Impossible).<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is simply a masterful movie, filled with compelling drama and roaring action. It's never dull, even as our soldiers employ a bit of introspection among each other. It's sentimental but not overwrought; blink and you'll miss the theme of how all this stress affects the characters mentally. Most importantly, movie is packed with such tension that you'll be sweating in the safety of your living room (or theater), barely able to breathe until Sgt. James can disarm one of the many bombs in the movie. The Hurt Locker juxtaposes brutal violence with elegant, although intermittent, bouts of humanity (and not just by the soldiers). It's utterly compelling, fascinating, and highly entertaining, and it's got a great chance to win Best Picture next month."

","When I logged on to IMDb to check out some specifics about The Hurt Locker, I had no real intention of writing a review. I was shocked by how many people didn't ""get"" the film. I thought the film was a slam-dunk and represented Bigelow finally fulfilling the promise of ""Near Dark"". Admittedly, I never questioned the films accuracy (though I figured it probably wasn't accurate- few films are). To me, it's more important for the film to be good- and this one is. It's the tightest film I've seen in a long time- simple and straightforward- but with enough depth to merit repeat watchings. I just didn't expect it to be a measuring stick for film knowledge- the kind of film that exposes some peoples' lack of film instincts- much in the way Hitchcock's films did when they were first released (remember that he never won the accolades in his day that he deserved). For serious cinephiles- don't miss The Hurt Locker- you won't get another one like this for a long time."

","The Hurt Locker was surprisingly good. I thought it was going to be another war movie, but it was more about humans and their characters.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow scores big with this movie. Tightly written by Mark Boal, the story centers around soldiers doing the ultra-dangerous job of disarming bombs during combat operations. A new commander (a sergeant) is foolish in his approach, as though he couldn't care less about dying. So he puts his team in danger as well. There is a push and pull to keep this new commander from getting everyone killed, while the city falls into chaos with deadly hostility everywhere. The suspense is strong and the ending is surprising.<br/><br/>This is one of those ""war"" movies that doesn't really take a political stand, but focuses on human interaction. Bigelow handles the action and her actors extremely well. The whole cast, including those playing minor characters, gives honest performances. Good to see actors depicting characters in such situations with subtlety."

I haven't seen any film with a 'explosive disarming' thematic, so it makes it very original for me. While watching you'll be on the edge of your seat while disarmings are being done, and things are a matter of life and death. Directing is well done, you are sucked in a movie, almost the whole time, though there are some slow parts.<br/><br/>Always love the films with a war thematic.

Though, it might run more deeper. Acting is nothing special. <br/><br/>It is nice to see a presentation of a person with adrenaline addictive behavior.

"Buddy-51","9","1","9","16 January 2010"," an extraordinary cinematic achievement
","Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, ""The Hurt Locker"" starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given. That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place. Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad. The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.<br/><br/>Before getting to the more ""literary"" aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly ""cinematic"" level, ""The Hurt Locker"" is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term. Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action. Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here. This story is clearly just one of many.<br/><br/>On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield. Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death. Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved. And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so. Yet, thanks to Marc Boal's perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a ""type."" James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men. And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.<br/><br/>Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects. And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from ""Lost"" - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of ""stars"" - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).<br/><br/>The real key to ""The Hurt Locker""'s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories. It is first, last and always a movie about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. It's also unforgettable."

And it probably is so hard to go back and live a 9-5 life with family and kids. When your job is trying to constantly save people by disarming bombs that can take out a city! Oh and to the people who couldn't understand the beginning of the movie with the cell phone. Saying that the guy would have been shot immediately! If people actually watched the movie, the soldier Owen said he couldn't get a shot because the Arab with cellphone. Purposely went between the 2 bars. So he couldn't get shot and J.T. Was too far behind, not to mention how Owen had to see a dr. Afterwards because he felt guilty that he couldn't shoot the Arab! He even said in the movie if I shot I could have kept him alive, he even confessed that he was scared. And almost hesitated shooting the other Arab in the desert. Obviously he's a young solider who is good but also scared of actually having to kill people! He admitted many times though the movie! I didn't even find this movie boring at all and I hate war movies! Some of them put me too sleep! But this was done fantastic! I'm so glad James Cameron's ex wife out did him for that stupid movie Avatar! I could watch the hurt locker over and over again! Jeremy renner's performance really made this movie!"

","The Hurt Locker<br/><br/>This movie directed by Kathryn Bigelow is a stunningly crafted piece of filmmaking.
One that doesn't present a story in the conventional method. More of a character study of a group of men at war.
The camera follows these soldiers around and the audience can witness the strength of character needed to endure the events of day to day life.
Bigelow lets her movie slowly unfold but still
there's some supremely staged action and nail biting tension in many a set piece scattered throughout the movies 2hr 11min runtime.<br/><br/>None of this would work if it wasn't for the masterful performances by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Macklie.
Each of them dealing with their life in the baking hot sun very differently.
Renner plays Sergeant James, a soldier who seems to relish the intensity of his job.
Tasked with disarming bombs on a day to day basis.
Mackie plays Sergeant Sanborn. Both men have seen enough death to change them and as the film progresses it is Sanborn who wishes to return to civilian life.<br/><br/>Bigelow's film is completely engrossing. One that entertains by creeping up on you unexpectedly.
The sublime camera work is unsettled but still coherent.
Editing is punchy and direct.
Cinematography conveys the searing heat very effectively.<br/><br/>On 1080p Blu-ray Image quality has a noticeable amount of grain.
This gives the film a gritty cinematic appearance. It's never distracting, just note that this film isn't digitally slick.
The picture quality has a raw texture.
Abrasive almost. The audience will feel the soldiers discomfort as the dust and dehydration gets the better of them.
Black levels and detail are mightily impressive.
On SDR Blu-ray the colour palette fluctuates.
There are some colourful scenes. Mainly the blinding fireballs and explosions.
Dynamic range is splendid and really accentuates the scorching sun and exploding bombs.
Skin tones look natural, sun baked faces with beads of sweat and dirt clearly visible.
Other scenes appear to be bland allowing the dusty environment to be hyper realistic.<br/><br/>On Blu-ray the DTS HD Master audio sound mix is an absolute belter.
I believe this is a reference quality mix.
LFE is spectacular. Explosions and gunshots have real impact.
You can feel the thud of fifty cal machine gunfire rattle your viewing environment.
Surround sound effects are wide and immersive.
Bullets wizz from speaker to speaker and helicopters soar through the soundstage.
This is fantastic considering it's not object based like a Dolby Atmos or DTS X mix.
All these technical attributes add to an already effective cinematic experience.
If you like your war movies raw, gritty and realistic then this is up there with the best of them.
I'd love to see this movie make its way on to 4K
Blu-ray. HDR will only elevate the already sublime visuals and a Dolby Atmos sound mix could improve on near audio perfection."

","The Hurt Locker directed by Kathryn Bigelow is a film about war, more directly about bomb technicians in war. The movie follows the exploits of Staff Sergeant William James played by Jeremy Renner and his new partners in Iraq played by Anthony Mackie-Sergeant JT Sanborn and Brian Geraghty-Specialist Owen Eldridge. In this film, Sgt. James arrives after the death of the former squad leader. James, an extremely experienced bomb tech, seems to revel in danger and leads his squad into dangerous and sometimes reckless situations. The other two try to reign in Sgt. James, while trying to survive their last 30 days in the war zone. James meanwhile is almost obsessed with disarming the IED's he comes across. Like a knight out to fight a dragon, he throws himself into the task. The character saves untold lives with his heroic efforts but at what cost? We see this soldier as he struggles, dealing with the adrenaline addiction of doing his job while finding himself unable to relate or function in regular society. He all but abandons his girlfriend and child and returns to the war zone as if he was home. He even struggles to interact with his squad members and seems to keep distant from them.<br/><br/>In this film, Director Kathryn Bigelow uses several techniques designed to enhance the drama of the scenes. Slow-motion, for example, is used near the end of the film as Sgt. James is attempting to free a man in a bomb vest. As he runs the explosion is released, and the director allows us to see the shock-wave of the blast move in slow motion as it overtakes and knocks Sgt. James down and unconscious. Then a real-time view of the same explosion, which is accompanied by the sound of the device detonating. The technique increases the viewers own adrenaline and moves you to the edge of your seat. You can also observe the use of sound played from time to time in slow motion. There are sounds of air puffs as a weapon is fired and the projectile leaves the rifle and travels out. The quick transitions from scene to scene seem to change the pace of the film and shows the human toll war takes on soldiers. This film is like the film American Sniper, the 2014 film directed by Clint Eastwood. The similar locations, use of sound, and slow-motion techniques used in both films. In the underlining theme of war, both films show courageous men who take a personal toll after being exposed to extreme violence while in combat. The Hurt Locker is not like every other war movie in that there are few scenes where the ""enemy"" seen in battles are killed. It does, however, expose us to how and maybe even why PTSD is a prevalent problem in the military. The Hurt Locker is worth the time to view, but know you must see the more profound point in this film. War is hard and affects everyone the soldier, their family, their teammates, all carry the burdens of combat. Brave men and woman risk much in the name of freedom."

I didn't emphasize with their situation, no anger and no sadness. I just saw the movement of their ambivalent feelings silently. Having said that, I kept gloomy without their actions like getting angry and crying. So I had no choice but to put this feeling into the real with the common ground. It was ruthless terrorism.

","In the Oscars of 2010, there were big names like James Cameron and Quentin Tarantino. To all the surprise there was a big box office flop movie to compete against the biggest crossing movie ever made, Avatar. It was more interesting to learn that the competition was between Husband and Wife. Yes, James Cameron's ex wife Kathryn Bigelow got her films with 9 Oscar nominations, winning 6 of them. Surprising all the film fans around the world, Avatar lost the Best Picture and Best Director to The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>The movie is about the American military bomb squad in Iraq. With all the cliché of American war films, the struggles of their soldiers against the Iraqi civilians are portrayed in the best convincing way. The candid type of film making gives it more documentary feel, that makes you to believe what's happening on the screen; it is so realistic.

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","10 March 2017"," The Nerve-Wracking Routine of Daily Bomb-Defusing Missions...
","The Height of Suspense is When Any Second Can Turn the Place into Chaos or Not It is quite ironic that the very year the Academy decided to extend the number of Best Picture nominees from five to ten didn't have more than three or four real gems to endorse. It is as if ""The Hurt Locker"" became the embodiment of a weak year and didn't win Oscars but rather stole them from more deserving movies like ""Avatar"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"". Kathryn Bigelow took her former husband's Oscar for Best Directing and the film won the Best Picture while that should have belonged to Tarantino at least, according to IMDb Top 250, not me, anyway.<br/><br/>Less flashy and more powerful than Tarantino's work, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a simple, straightway journey that chronicles the missions of the bomb squad in Iraq during the first years of that infamous war that shouldn't have happened. That this war is deemed as pointless and meaningless is a reality perfectly captured through two of the third leading characters Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Vietnam War wasn't more meaningful and the GI's weren't much loved, but all through ""The Hurt Locker"", the squad deals with a new kind of warfare, one that turned the city into a giant hideout for bombs, of any sorts and any devices trapped in the most banal and sneaky places, such as car trunks, trash bins and even dead bodies.<br/><br/>This is a war where the enemy is invisible because once the bomb is there, whoever put it can be anywhere, he can even be close to the soldiers or staring at them from the top of a mosque or a building, it is a task of Herculean level to spot the bomber, and most of the time, they get away with it, because the staff generally deals with the bombs, the sources of never-ending stress. You can disarm a bomb on Monday, another one will still await you on Tuesday, there's no such thing as calling it a day or taking a break, there's never a routine, each bomb is new, each one can be the last one, and the film opens with a specialist (Guy Pearce) killed in a mission, proving that this job is almost like life, you are only remembered for you final achievements, and no matter how many bombs you defused, you'll be an expert or a hero for as long as you survive.<br/><br/>When the rotation is over, you can get back to life but if someone believes this is a consolation thing, he's got another notion coming to him. This is a day-by day situation, it maintains a state of demented stress among the soldiers and this is the hellish aspect of the Iraqi War. There's not a week now without news about a terrorist attack in Iraq, it became a common practice, and in a way, the Americans who were there had a taste of what the civilians must go through now, and they don't even have a rotation to count on. A war movie can't ignore the state of mind as much as it can't ignore the state of war, and from the editing, the way the camera switches places, go back and forth, flying over a vast place where anything is possible, we can have an<br/><br/>taste of the nervousness the soldiers go through, when any second can turn places into chaos.<br/><br/>But had ""The Hurt Locker"" focused on the danger, it would have been a routine war movie. In ""The Hurt Locker"", danger is brilliantly diluted in reality, it even ceases to exist, except from the way it is anticipated by soldiers, and above them all, the new Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). This is a hero in the sense that he defused more hundreds of s bombs, and developed a sort of instinct, a capacity for observation and understanding that make him take impossible risks, much to the anger of his two companions (Sanborn even contemplated the idea of killing James) but they can't complain because he's competent. The film opens with a quotation about war being a drug, and it's never as palpable as when you see the concentrated eyes on Renner's face, his no-nonsense way to deal with bombs, with his ordinary looks that recall a young Jim Belushi. This is a guy with an attitude but never gratuitous, he earns his cockiness.<br/><br/>The action is repetitive but never redundant, one of the most archetypal action-movie situation is explored to the fullest, repeated as many times as it takes to have the ultimate psychological effect on the trio, pushing their perceptions to the edge, until they start reconsider their own certitudes, and the common thread is always James, a competent man who wanders in hell thanks to the one thing he loves: defusing bombs. And there's nothing more exhilarating than a character who's really good at something. James is one of them, and we love the film for that paradoxical feel, as much as we're happy not to be in his boots, we admire him and wish we could be as expert in any field as he is, this is guy who found what he loves and acts accordingly too, it's a job full of adrenaline or risks.<br/><br/>See, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a complex movies with a relative visual simplicity, at a first stance, it is about soldiers assigned the same mission in a hostile place, when you dig deeper, it's about men doing their job, not out of love of patriotism, but because that's what they feel they're meant to do, or what they're meant to do. There's no escape, they can only count on luck, and let time do the job, their life is like a ticking bomb, and they all hope for the explosion to come as late as possible, or at least, to expect it when it comes."

","Finally I watched it on Netflix. I have to admit I am not really interested in Iraqi war movies. I mean it is too cruel what we get to see in the newspapers and TV every day.

I was never bored and I was very quick connected in the following dramatic bomb scenes. They were differently done with high suspense. The explosions were executed with great special effects I have never seen before. The cinematography picture was superb. Jeremy Renner did a respectable job and I am happy he won the Oscar. Congratulations to Kathryn Bigelow who directed this action movie very clear with high precision for what she got an Oscar too. There were non stop messages about the sense of this lost war.

","This excellent look at the life of a bomb disposal expert serving in Iraq acts as an eye-opening exploration of war on the front line. Deservedly winning many Oscars for its taut realism and focused screenplay, I found myself caught up in an endless world of pain as genuine guys find themselves up against terrorists who'll do anything to see them dead. Provocative and shocking, it sees Bigelow on top form as director, exploring the themes thrown up by the screenplay while at the same time making a satisfying viewing experience.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, who played a similarly heroic role in 28 WEEKS LATER, is very well cast as the slightly crazy munitions expert who leads his team into many nail-biting showdowns with highly explosive devices. Decent cameos are handed out to Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse, and meaty character parts are given to the likes of Anthony Mackie who helps humanise the story. Essentially this is a series of set-pieces, with the shoot-out with the snipers a particular highlight for me. The open ending is spot on and I liked the way that politics never get in the way of good storytelling. A genuinely mature film dealing with modern warfare in an intelligent, suspenseful way."

"Mobithailand","9","0","1","5 May 2016"," I can certainly recommend The Hurt Locker to anyone who appreciates a well-produced, above-average, dramatic, soul-searching piece of filmmaking.
","The Hurt Locker, about an American bomb disposal squad operating in Iraq, has more than its fair share of blood-thirsty action, but ultimately, it is about the members of the squad and how their dangerous jobs affected them.<br/><br/>There have been many criticisms levelled at this movie concerning factual inaccuracies within the 'nuts and bolts' of the story. It has been said that such bomb squads did not operate in the manner depicted in the movie and certain events could never have happened in the way portrayed. I have some sympathy for this criticism, for if you are making a deadly serious movie about a recent historical event that is still burning in the hearts and consciousness of many, then I do feel the producers have a duty not to deliberately misrepresent the truth. However, in general, I doubt whether the so-called inaccuracies had any serious impact on the film, as the story is about the people, not about the correctness of the technical operations. Indeed, many within the military have praised it as a work of 'admitted fiction' that does much to illustrate the horrors of war and the effect on brave soldiers in the front line – whatever their nationalities happen to be.<br/><br/>I can certainly recommend The Hurt Locker to anyone who appreciates a well-produced, above-average, dramatic, soul-searching piece of filmmaking.These days, most of us have become desensitized to the mass killings that are shown 24/7 in TV news reports from conflicts around the world. If this isn't enough, we are also assailed on every side by fictional violence that is stuffed down our throats by Hollywood and the TV producers, looking to improve ratings. But despite this regular gluttony of death and violence, The Hurt Locker really gets through to us movie-goers - we are there with them - as is evidenced by a rich haul of six Oscars, including best film, best director, and best screenplay."
"ndaubert","6","0","2","10 February 2016"," Theme
","The Hurt Locker (2008) is an American war film based on events witness and was released in 2008, directed and produced by Kathryn Bigelow and screenplay writing by Mark Boal who was a journalist attached to a United States Army Special Operations Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq. This American war film depicts a three-man EOD team during the Iraq War in Baghdad. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, Anthony Mackie as Sergeant J.T. Sanborn, and Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge. The overall theme for this film was being able to overcome adversity, not only with your own surroundings but from within yourself as well. One scene in particular comes to mind and that is when the team of three is drinking alcohol while deployed into a combat zone to help overcome stress of the work environment. It starts to show the true demeanor of each solider as they punch and hit each other. I looked at it as a way to blow off steam with minor repercussions, other than possibly being caught. Another scene that represents adversity from within is when James is discharged from the military and heads home to be with his family. Throughout the movie he was able to make the toughest decisions with somewhat ease when disarming bombs and dealing with combat situations. He had been trained to do this and felt like it was all her knew. In this scene, it shows him with his child having difficulty picking out cereal as there were so many selections. James really didn't know how to act when it came to a normal everyday life, so the transition scene shows him getting off a plane back in Iraq obviously heading back to do what he loves most.<br/><br/>A separate film that I had recently watched that show the adversity of surrounding and yourself is The Cider House Rules (1999). By this I mean that Homer had to overcome the adversity of being an orphan within himself. Homer then once he leaves the orphanage, adversity sets in again, this time with his physical surroundings. Although it was something that he wanted to know by leaving, he had to adapt himself to living without having to take care of younger orphans as well as living in a house with only African-Americans. Eventually after he finds peace with himself, he returns to the orphanage to take over the doctor role and be the main care provider for all."

Aside the idea of a man who seeks thrills and that his life at home is a bore and that one should accomplish himself through one's job, which he does by going back to IRAQ to live his talent and passion, will be a constant motif throughout the film either through the dialogues or pictures.<br/><br/>In addition the scenes of what is happening in IRAQ is worth the mention. The scene where bombs are buried on the road, and Iraqis citizens (some could be terrorists) who try to move their broken chariot pulled by a donkey and panic mounts, the question is how can a soldier keep his sanity of never knowing what will happen? <br/><br/>Always in constant threat in nerve- wracking days which are enough to damage anyone emotionally and mentally. Yet, we have Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) who is an exception. He craves missions that will ask him to put mines out of use.

","This isn't on the same level as Black Hawk Down is but the Hurt Locker is still another thrilling, well-acted, and fairly original movie about the Iraq War which is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>This movie follows 3 soldiers in the Iraq War. They are trained to disarm bombs and they face the threat of death every day as anyone could try to kill them as seen in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>In most war films, armies face each other directly and battle. In this movie though, the enemy hides in plain sight and the soldiers have no way of knowing who can be trying to kill them. Often when they disarm bombs, several possibly dangerous people watch them and any one of them could try to kill them as is shown in the intro. This of course creates conflict between the troops and this movie explains some of the conflict that arises between them.<br/><br/>The scenes where they disarm bombs are very tense because the viewer knows that the bombs could go off at any second. This is made clear from the memorable opening scene. The movie also brings in factors which helps to raise tension even more. It shows several possibly dangerous onlookers, a man driving a taxi within the bomb site, and a man holding a remote which may possibly set off the bombs. The shootout scene near the middle isn't that impressive compared to other scenes in the movie In terms of originality and suspense but it doesn't take up too much time to begin with.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty were the main actors and they carried the movie well. They don't have too much of a variety in terms of their facial expressions and emotions but they still do their best in the movie and they show that they are talented actors.<br/><br/>A common problem found in many war films is the lack of character development. Like many other movies of the genre, this movie also suffers from that problem. The movie doesn't give us something big which makes us care for any of the characters. This is a common problem which arises in many war films nowadays and I hope that it will be fixed sometime in the future.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of character development, this is still a great war film which contains some pretty memorable and original scenes which hold a lot of tension often. It is definitely worth a watch and it is one of the better war films in recent memory."

It IS, as the summary line says, ""Engrossing & Brilliant!"" I found this movie by accident! I was staring at the Netflix main page and went to click on an ad, but a split second before I did, the ad changed to reveal a new ad which happened to be for this movie.

Bigelow also directed Point Break, a decent movie about the FBI infiltrating a surfer gang's turf to investigate bank robberies. She also directed a few other films that I never heard of. But she was spot-on in Hurt Locker which is not only captivating, but also provided an interesting view on human behavior. The Iraq war does not seem to be her topic here; the movie is not political. The acting, especially from Anthony Mackie who played Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Brian Geraghty (Specialist Owen Eldridge,) is top-notch. The main protagonist, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), a battle-tested, adrenaline junkie veteran, arrives as a new team leader of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in the Iraq War replacing Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson who was KIA. It isn't Renner who makes this film a winner---it's the interactions between the actors that help make this exceptional. SPOILER AHEAD! The last 10-15 minutes that includes Renner back home after his tour, shows him alone in a safe yet mundane super-market's cereal/breakfast aisle. It's almost poetic how this is a great contrast as in polar opposites of experiences in his life, that really shows how deeply addicted to his EOD work.<br/><br/>What I really feel hurt this movie was the title. To the average person, what the heck does ""The Hurt Locker"" mean? I would never have guessed what this movie was about just from the horrible title.<br/><br/>Regardless, PLEASE watch this; MOST won't regret it."

","For whatever reasons I had not seen this movie until now. Maybe it was the title, ""Hurt Locker"" doesn't exactly conjure images of an interesting movie. But it DID win a number of awards including the Oscar for Best Picture. With all that I suppose I was expecting more, it is a fine movie but I came away thinking it must have been a weak year for Best picture nominees.<br/><br/>It focuses on a squad that gets alerted to possible bombs and is charged with defusing them or otherwise insuring the safety of the soldiers and surrounding community. <br/><br/>As the movie opens we see one of these that goes bad, the soldier (Guy Pearce in a very brief role) doesn't make it. So the replacement expert comes in. By his own count he has defuses over 800 devices. That is Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James. He is a maverick, he often goes against the guidance of others but he always seems to succeed.<br/><br/>His closest buddy is Anthony Mackie in a good role as Sergeant JT Sanborn. He is more of a ""by the book"" soldier and gets frustrated with some of the antics of James.<br/><br/>The third member of that close-knit group is Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge, who seems always fearful that he will get killed, that whatever assignment will be his last one. His growth is to overcome that. <br/><br/>The Iraq war was, and I suppose still is, a terrible thing. This is a good movie to show presumably what one group goes through each day. As the movie starts they have 39 days left in their tour of duty, part of the suspense is if they will live to go home.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: James does get back home to his small child and wife. He shops for cereal, he cleans leaves out of the gutter. His wife seems distant. As the movie ends we see him in military gear, stepping off a transport at the beginning of his 365 day tour. He just couldn't survive in dull civilian life, he needed the action."

","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Hurt Locker is a highly gripping, intensely thrilling & bone-chillingly suspenseful war drama that's expertly crafted, masterly composed & skilfully narrated from start to finish and, with its firm grip on the very element of suspense, delivers an experience that's destined to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>Set during the Iraq War, the story of The Hurt Locker follows a bomb disposal squad that is assigned a new team leader after their previous boss is killed during one of their operations. The plot covers the relationship between the team members as the two subordinates soon find themselves at odds with the new guy for his maverick ways when it comes to disposing a bomb puts the lives of other officers at risk too.<br/><br/>Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker is arguably the finest work of her filmmaking career for the war atmosphere is brilliantly captured, every aspect is meticulously refined & the way she builds up the tension is worthy of praise. Every single sequence featuring our bomb disposal squad doing their job is nerve-wracking as hell, and while the story can be seen as an accumulation of similar-looking segments, the whole part does have a sensible core.<br/><br/>The set pieces & locations do provide an authentic feeling of being present in an unwanted territory where life hangs in the balance all the time. Camera-work is raw & immediate plus its controlled movements contribute immensely in elevating the film's nail-biting tension to an unbearable level. Editing is neatly executed too for its 131 minutes of story effortlessly sustains the suspense introduced within the film's opening moments, however, there are a few static moments in between.<br/><br/>Sound design always plays a vital role in war films & it's good to see it getting the attention it deserves here. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders beautifully blends into the narrative, and helps greatly in further amplifying the whole experience. The cast features the then-relatively unknown actors in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie & others, with guest appearances from Guy Pearce & Ralph Fiennes, and there isn't really anything to complain because everyone of them delivers a truly committed performance.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is a revelation in the role of Sgt. First Class William James; the new head of the bomb disposal squad whose daredevil acts come off as reckless at first but as the film progresses, we slowly understand why he is the way he is. Anthony Mackie also chips in with a strong input as one of the team members, and his friction with Renner is the story's driving force. Guy Pearce & Ralph Fiennes do a commendable job in their guest roles, while the rest of the supporting cast are equally devoted to their given characters.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hurt Locker is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful, unpredictable & intense war films to come out in a long time, and despite it having no clear antagonists or even a proper climax, remains a thoroughly engaging cinema from the first frame to the last. One of the best films about Iraq War, one of the finest films of its year, and definitely worthy of all its accolades, The Hurt Locker shows war as not just a primal descent into madness but also as a potent drug, as can be seen in the resolution of the lead character's arc. Highly recommended."

","So I enjoyed watching this film. It had suspense and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It does drag along in some parts but I really did enjoy watching it and it's a very tense film as you can imagine, being about bomb disposal and all. <br/><br/>So this is a really good war film. It's aside from your regular guns blazing war film and focuses more on the job than the actual violence and political environment. It really is a good film. It shows how nerve-racking it is to take apart a bomb. Every minute of the story you're thinking ""what will he do next?"" Or ""Will his actions effect the succeeding of the mission?"" And of course, ""OH NO, DON'T CUT THE BLUE WIRE, ANYTHING BUT THE BLUE WIRE!!!!"" It's pretty intense. This film is breathtaking at times...literally! You're so focused on the movie you forget to breath! It is so emotional still. A really engrossing film.<br/><br/>This movie just reached out to you. You are in Iraq. You are disarming a bomb. And you are pooping yourself with the tension. I mainly just watched this film because there's a pretty shot of a bullet landed on the sand in the trailer. And yes, that was a beautiful scene but this movie turned out to be so much more!<br/><br/>You should really ignore the bad reviews of this film because it really is just great. I know most people don't like it, just because it won the award for the Best Picture and Avatar didn't. And of course there are much more Avatar fans than The Hurt Locker fans, which is why this film has been slammed so much by critiques. But just ignore the critiques! This film deserved that award HAHAHAHAH. And also don't be put off by the crappy name. Sure, ""The Hurt Locker"" sounds lame but it is a good film. It took me a while to actually get round to watching this film and I think the rubbish title was the main problem. I dunno, it just sounded kinda boring. But take it from me, I regret making that decision! Never mind, don't judge a book by its cover, Don't judge a book by its title!<br/><br/>The acting is great in this film. You really feel agitated with suspense as you watch James search through a car as there's explosives, enough to blow the town sky high, sitting right in the boot. You're sitting on the edge of you seat thinking, ""Oh no! FIND IT BEFORE SOMEONE DETONATES THEM!"" And you really see the reality of what people go through in this job. And it's not just James either. You feel sorry for both his team mates as they have to try and keep this reckless guy safe, when all he does is go running into trouble! But as well as the reckless side, you also admire his character because of how clever he is. He's one of them hard nut people who look like they're crazy, when really they know exactly what they're doing. <br/><br/>Like I said, there's a pretty shot of a bullet hitting the sand in this film and I thought that was a beautiful nice touch. This movie is also pretty visually too. With beautiful shots of the rust being shaken from a car and the ground trembling. It makes you feel like you're in the movie. And the desserts shots are good too, with blurred views of the desert landscape which really give you an idea of how hot it is. I'm not going to babble on about the scenery though, I want you to see that for yourself!<br/><br/>So yeah, this film is definitely worth a watch. If you're into the war stuff anyway."

","Personal enjoyment: 5 Films Content: 5 The Hurt Locker follows a company of soldiers as they complete the last month of their tour in 2004, war torn Iraq. These brave men don't just work in the hostile terrain, they work at ground zero disarming IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) with the use of bomb suits, bots and blowing s#$% up.<br/><br/>The film is unlike any other war film to date. Thanks to the master full independent direction of Kathryn Bigelow, the amazing screenplay from Mark Boal, and the impressive cinematography from Barry Ackroyd, the film puts us right in the middle of an authentic looking battlefield where anything can happen. Every shot tells a story and shows a different perspective, in fact, the whole film revolves around perspective and emotion.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker's main protagonist William James, (Played by the talented Jeremy Renner) is the lead bomb tech in his unit. Renner does a wonderful job of bringing a maverick sense of ego, recklessness, and emotion that he doesn't slap you in the face with. His attitude toward combat is very different from his fellow soldiers, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (The very real Anthony Mackle) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Emotional Brian Geraghty) who are both going through their own troubles in the desert. Although the Sergeant James is the main character, Bigelow and Boal don't undermine the importance of the other actors. We see as much of them as we have to, to understand their characters and where they stand. While Eldridge is shake by the death of their previous bomb tech and is fighting to redeem himself, Sanborn shows his seriousness for the job is caused by fear and worry for what he will leave behind. Now what can be said about William? The final scene shows us that he'd rather risk his life in the sand then pick out cereal for his son and wife at home.<br/><br/>Something that Hurt Locker does that not a lot of war films do is it gives us a look at the lives of the Iraqi people and their interactions with the soldiers. We aren't given a propaganda piece where they are the enemy and we are the heroes, instead we see them as the observers that are curious at what is going on in their city. From the vendors in the camp to the little boy Beckham, we see the lives of these natives affected in different ways. <br/><br/>The use of sound in Hurt Locker is expertly done as well, building up tension when it has to and making us (or just me) cry when we need to. For the first scene we are given the best examples of what sounds the film will be giving us and what sounds we will be making (for the most part), heavy breathing, sand, light comic relief, yelling, cursing, explosions, and probably the best sound the film uses, Silence. When you combine these great sounds and the expert level cinematography you get a truly amazing piece of cinema. The best example of the camera and sound in sync is when the team breaches a building that hasn't been searched by security. As we go deeper into the building the music begins to build and build and we see, in very thorough detail, the teamwork of the soldiers and the teamwork of the film crew until everything is released. Is there a doctor in the house? This isn't the only occurrence of great filming in the movie but it is the most notable. The only thing that beats it out is when we go home with Sargent James and we see how much we really just want to go back and start the whole thing over again.<br/><br/>The biggest thing The Hurt Locker achieves however is not its impressive war setting or its use of suspense throughout the film or its camera and sound use, it's its real look on how deal with certain situations given to them. We see every time the team works a job how they handle the situation and how it affects them later. When Will fights to remove the locks off a non-voluntary suicide bomber, when Sanborn questions killing Will, when Eldridge speaks to his therapist about his fallen partner, they all go through hard times and they all deal with them in different ways just like other people do, and that is what we never see.<br/><br/>There are no story book endings, no heroic acts of valor, no stupendous expositions or transformers, no bad-ass one-liners, just a team of normal soldiers doing the job that they signed up for."

","The Hurt Locker focuses on a team of soldiers in Iraq who are part of the bomb defuse unit. Throughout the movie, the viewer observes the life and duties of a very risky, fearless, and reactive man.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is human dignity because during the film a young boy dies who the soldier has actually taken a friendly liking to because he was a nice boy and knew he meant no harm. The soldier reacts by trying to find out how he died and why he was used for bombs and why his dead body had bombs in them.<br/><br/>The overall ambiance of the film really shows that the theme and the plot mean what they mean. The lighting is bright and sunny when missions are being performed. The lighting then goes dark and are shot at night when he is sneaking around and doing things he should be doing to try and figure out this mystery.<br/><br/>This movie shows how no matter what situation you're in, if you take someone in as a friend or family, you will do anything for that person if they mean something to you."

","The Hurt Locker is a movie about U.S. soldiers who are part of an Electronic Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit during the Iraq war. The movie focuses on the unit's leader Sergeant First Class William James, (played by Jeremy Renner). James is brought in as the unit leader after the previous leader was killed during an ordinance disposal. During his first operation with his new unit, it is clear that Sergeant James is an adrenaline junkie when he decides to use the EOD suit to disarm a bomb, instead of using the robot. All throughout the movie James displays a reckless attitude when faced with danger during his unit's various operations.<br/><br/>The movie shows how some people in certain fields develop an addiction to adrenaline rushes. Despite the high chance of death certain personality types will use a dangerous situation to get a sort of ""high"" off their own adrenaline. This premise reminded me of Eric Bana's character ""Hoot"" in the movie Black Hawk Down. <br/><br/>At times the movie has a documentary feel to it, using shaky cameras during action sequences to simulate that I was actually on the streets of Baghdad. This is one area of the film I defiantly noticed the influence that Mark Boal had on the cinematography. I found this technique annoying at times because it made some scenes hard to follow, but several times it helped draw me into the scene. Another technique that was utilized, often during the tense scenes where Sergeant James was defusing a bomb, was close ups. This brought focus on the action that Sergeant James was performing and resulted in extremely tense scenes. Many times after one of these tense scenes Sergeant James would crack a joke, and the entire feel of the movie. That was one thing I found enjoyable about Jeremy Renner's acting. He made the transition from super focused ordnance tech to sarcastic joker in just a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Overall The Hurt Locker lacks a solid plot, it just depicts a few man going from mission to mission while their rotation slowly gets closer to its end, although the movie had a rather simple theme, I would still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good war movie."

It's a tremendous depiction of life on the ground in the Middle East, and what it's like to be an American soldier there. <br/><br/>Many of the scenes are reminiscent of the TV series Homeland and without a doubt that show was heavily influenced by this film. There is little plot as such but a storyline emerges as we follow the bomb disposal unit as they go from scene to scene.

And unfortunately for them if they want to come home fine, they have a lot of work to do.<br/><br/>This movie has a great mix of suspense and surprise. The bomb defusing scenes are extremely tense. Usually those are left for the end of the movie, when the character has to choose between the red and green wires, but here they are spread throughout the movie. Not in this case. The explosions are beautiful, and there was more than one moment in which I suddenly found out I was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner does a great job playing a bomb disposal specialist who struggles with two different forces inside of him: the stress from violence of war; and the fact that fighting a war is what he knows how to do.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't have any idea about what the real day-to-day life of a soldier is like and I don't know if this movie is accurate or not.

"moneysorigin","9","0","1","23 February 2015"," War is a drug... so is this movie
","The way how this war movie does not have a voice over narration already makes it stand out from the rest. This is where the masterful directing comes in to tell the story as the the three men see it. In suspenseful dangerous missions these men are situated in, the emotions and ideas can be seen through these men through the slow paced and silent, yet stressful, by the way the camera shows them and their surrounding. It shows well the realism that a modern technological war would be like. Action, as I said, can be slow paced, but it can but the viewer on the edge of his/her seat as anything can happen when these men can be placed in combat zones. The actual story line does not have some main conflict, other then to survive, but that is the realism by showing how in real war, new situations will arise at any time and these men are put in to life-threatening situations everyday. Death can be a surprise, as the movies shows, which can happen at the least suspected times. One of the things I respect most about this film is that it has no biased views against the middle eastern people. As I have said, the directing only shows what these men know, so it shows some innocent bystanders around the dangerous areas, but these men still have to careful about who is part of the violence and who is the regular person. I really respect how the directing was done on this topic. Overall, this movie can be slow paced but that just adds to the realism; but it does not lack in suspense or intrigue at all. If you want to see the affects of modern war and just watch a masterpiece, this is your pick."
"sportello29","7","0","1","15 February 2015"," Gripping, yet wildly overestimated thriller
","Heat of combat, Iraq war, we are introduced to a bomb disposal team of 3 who are in the middle of action. We are thoroughly guided through scenes of just how dangerous and unpredictable this job is and how much precaution and observation needs to be taken at each step. This is amplified by the death of the team leader, who goes on to physically disarm the bomb only to get blown up by a triggered detonator set up by an unforeseen enemy. This scene provides a great contrast going forward, when a new sergeant, James, takes over the squad. He will be conducting similar physical disarming's on a daily basis, even unnecessarily at times, which greatly adds to the heroic recklessness of his character, brilliantly portrayed by Jeremy Renner (maybe the only deserved Oscar nomination).<br/><br/>Throughout the rest of the movie we get to know the squad better, which now consists of team leader James, sergeant Sanborn and a less experienced specialist Owen Eldridge. Both Eldridge and Sanborn are depicted just how one would expect from soldiers in their line of work – human - they are terrified, scared for their lives, extremely cautious and counting down the days to dispatch. <br/><br/>In retrospect James is a true, real life hero. No matter how dangerous the situation might be, he will dive into it head first. We see James almost die while trying to save innocent people – an Iraq civilian and earlier an Iraq child that he was careless enough to bond with. He disarms numerous bombs, sometimes without even wearing a protective suit. On one occasion we learn that his total was somewhere around '857' disarmed bombs. James proves a great leader too and even though his fearless tactics are –at heart- resented by his teammates – they definitely realize and respect his experience, courage and authority. James, in the best way he can, really cares for his team, but in the same way as a hero tends to care for those that need help and guidance – he seems to have this never ending desire and drive to help.<br/><br/>This desire for some reason does not echo at James' home, where he has a wife and a child waiting. His wife seems to accept John as he is, in the mere amount of time that is devoted to that, and realize that there is nothing she can do to change that. And maybe no one can. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there is not enough intimacy with the characters. A lot of time is devoted to gripping and suspenseful combat scenes and the portrayal of characters through these scenes, however the dialog's remain relatively dull and to the point. Bigelow doesn't let us really dive into any of the characters fully. We want to know more about James' past, what kind of man he was before the army, and what really motivates him. We are eager to find out Sanborn's past and what mistakes he has done in his life. Kathryn Bigelow only leaves us making educated guesses. And as such, this movie does not succeed. <br/><br/>This movie is about real life war heroes that unfortunately no one will probably ever hear or read about. And as such this move succeeds on a thrillingly patriotic kind of way, yet it fails to give us a full, detailed look into the human aspects of these heroes, which makes for a very unfulfilled feeling at the end."
"brchthethird","8","0","1","7 February 2015"," A solidly made modern war film
","THE HURT LOCKER is a tense but emotionally distant war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Jeremy Renner. It follows an Army bomb disposal unit around as they do their job in war-torn Iraq. Unlike most war films it doesn't really take a stance on whether or not we should even be there, instead focusing on the psychology of warfare and what it does to the human mind. I thought that this approach mostly worked, although it kept the audience at a certain distance emotionally from the characters. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner, and he is the sergeant in charge of the unit. He is brash, reckless and one could almost say he has a death wish. What is closer to the truth is that he just loves what he does, and the thrill he gets from doing it. Also in his unit are another sergeant and a specialist played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, respectively. They serve as counterpoint to Renner's character, and as a rational check against his unbridled nature. While most of the film deals with their bomb-defusing exploits, there are some moments when the true ugliness of the Iraq War shows its face, such as a tense nighttime scene in which Renner's character stalks someone he thinks is responsible for the death of a young street vendor he met. He ends up in the wrong place and just leaves before the situation escalates. It is in moments like that where the film hints at a possibly deeper reading of the film in terms of whether we should have even been in Iraq in the first place. That being said, the film is well-acted by everyone involved and the hand-held cinematography worked in its favor, putting the viewer into the heat of the situations that arose. I guess my biggest gripe would be that it never explicitly challenges American presence in Iraq, but it's not necessarily a film's job to do that for you. With what it portrayed, and who the main character was, it still allows you to draw your own conclusions. For one, it must take a special someone to be a bomb disposal expert. And also, not everyone is cut out for combat. Overall, THE HURT LOCKER is a solid piece of filmmaking and an interesting look into modern warfare."

You do not know if the person approaching you is doing so to kill you and the others around you, therefore you have to be alert and cautious and treat everyone as if they're going to hurt you. In that respect, I imagine it to be spot on correct.<br/><br/>This movie is totally worth the time and effort of sitting in your living room on a dreary, cold, raining/snowing Sunday afternoon...or any other time you are in the mood to watch a war film. Jeremy Renner will pull at your heart strings as you watch him go from ""Big Billy Bad Ass Bomb Disposer"" to ""Man who cares about a child/children"" and back again."

With Jeremy Renner arriving back home, seeing his wife Evangeline Lily, then returning to more war. To me, it seemed stupid. If it had ended right before he got home and maybe showed him looking disappointed at the idea of leaving, it would have been okay. Most of the film, it treat the audience with intelligence. Except for the ending, we already know he's addicted to war. That's the whole point. So showing him returning, really ruined the film for me.

The other member of team was also good with his arc being interesting but a little bit of a step down from the others. There was also some nice cameos from guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes ans Evangeline Lilly even though none of them are in the film that much between them. The story was really interesting with all three of the main characters having interesting stories and interesting finishes helping carry the film throughout. Also the story was much more tense then action and that was a really good decision as it helps build the overall tension throughout the film. The script is really good with the war dialogue feeling real and natural and it helps humanize the characters especially Renner. The style of the film is also great once again emphasising the style over action that really pays off in the middle eastern environment.

","All in all, I think this film is definitely one of the finer war films to have come out of the post ""Saving Private Ryan"" era; even if, in places, it is contrary to fact<br/><br/>I first watched this film at quite a young age, at that age you can be quite impressionable, and seeing as it was one of the first (of many) war films I would watch, it really set the standard as to what I expected in a war film. <br/><br/>Visually this film is stunning and deserves its Directing Oscar as well as its cinematography nom. I enjoyed its fast, jittery camera movement and thought this added to the overall pace of the film as well as helping to emphasise the instability of the situation and underlying potential of mass destruction. Some scenes,however, do tend to lack in any interesting camera positioning to sink your teeth into and rely too heavily on the work of the camera operator doing his best to add tension. For this reason some scenes (especially those when the characters are running through empty buildings feel a bit unnatural and staged due to the simple angles with the subjects seeming to disappear into the background.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews on this site criticising the scripts lack of story, complaining the characters wonder from scenario to scenario without further explanation or any side stories to fill in the gaps. Some argue that this just allows the writer to go completely wild and stage awful situations that characters find themselves in without a more refined purpose. I, however, enjoy how freely the director can jump around without the restraint of delivering an overall meaning to the film. Often war films get quite bogged down in scenes of useless dialogue which really just result in the general feeling that war is a bad thing. We already know this and are not going to forget about it any time soon. This film ignores the futile scrap for morale comfort and concentrates on other themes which are frankly more entertaining.<br/><br/>I enjoyed in part the performances of the actors in this film, having said this I did feel the hefty weight of the stereotypical performance given by every single other actor who has ever tried to play a US soldier bearing down on these characters shoulders. It is such a difficult generality for an actor playing a soldier to get away from, this half-way house between outward audacity and bravery and inward insecurity and has been done badly so often that it is hard to think how else to act when in these situations. <br/><br/>So these are a few of my views,cheers for reading."

","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is one of the best war movies ever made in my opinion along with well done war films such as Patton (1970), The Deer Hunter (1978), Platoon (1986), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Black Hawk Down (2001). The movie stars Jeremy Renner (in a performance that got him his first Best Actor Oscar nomination.) as Sergeant 1st class William James a man who was recently assigned as a bomb technician as a replacement after the death of Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (played by Guy Pearce). The direction by Bigelow is the strongest direction for a war movie since that of watching both Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and as well as the writing by both Bigelow as well as co-writer and co- producer Mark Boal which was truly brilliant, and also because of the suspenseful and patriotic music. There are many things I do love about this movie beside the writing, the music, and as well as the direction for the film, but also I loved the supporting cast, the cinematography, the characters are very interesting, and even acting is powerful."

","Little marketing was used in the U.K. I only ended up seeing ""The Hurt Locker"" at the time of its release mid-August, because a friend paid for my ticket and eventually as we all know it went on to win huge at the Oscars.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"", is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the War in Iraq for two weeks in 2004. I can't really say that the script will be what draws people towards the film, but rather the situations and the performances. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are a highly engrossing trio of soldiers, who in some way all have different goals. Some are chasing vague battle high's, whereas some just want the job done and to be on their way. Whether their time there has made a difference to the situation or not, it turns out some soldiers never fully leave the battlefield. <br/><br/>The only thing left to say is that Kathryn Bigelow shoots from far and close, to day and night superbly. She rightfully deserves the Oscar for 1. A superb character study, 2. A tense thriller when it comes to those bomb disposal scenes.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""The Hurt Locker"" is a great film. Never holding back in showing some of the more dire situations in a modern War environment, and there's a unique and different tension to every bomb disarmed (Or not). 8/10."

","""The Hurt Locker"" follows the activities of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq circa 2004. The film particularly focuses on Staff Sergeant William James, a reckless bomb disposal expert who lives for the high tension situations he's thrust into.<br/><br/>James is convincingly portrayed by Jeremy Renner in a performance that landed him his first Oscar nomination and made him a star. Anthony Mackie also contributed a solid performance and there are a couple of high-profile cameos that will grab your attention.<br/><br/>The script by Mark Boal received an Oscar and is a cut above the usual war movie fare. It is exceedingly suspenseful and does a fine job of capturing the environment and its denizens. I especially thought that it evoked a strong sense of paranoia and confusion, mirroring what the soldiers must feel in real combat.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's direction was another element of the film that resulted in an Oscar win. The film's documentary feel (courtesy of cinematographer Barry Ackroyd) meshed well with Bigelow's mastery of building and sustaining tension. The score by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders was also an important ingredient in the mix.<br/><br/>Taken altogether, the film makes for an absorbing & visceral experience, though it's ambiguities may be an obstacle for some. Sergeant James is a very intriguing character but much of the insight into his motivations is subject to conjecture. In the end, I feel that ""The Hurt Locker"" was a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner, although I myself would have chosen Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" instead."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","7 July 2014"," ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of cinema's best war films that shows the full-hand war experience both mentally and physically.
","War is a drug. It becomes addictive to soldiers and people to keep causing. The war experience can change one's mental states and can physically destroy you. ""The Hurt Locker"" shows the full-hand war experience without an ongoing plot. Jeremy Renner plays William James, a sergeant during the Iraq war who has an incredibly dangerous job of deactivating-bombs. He works with Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge. The three men battle through the dangers of Iraq, and show what the fighting experience is like. The men encounter various enemies and experience intense scenes involving countdowns before bombs go off, mysterious men pointing cameras at the soldiers, and loud shootouts. Katherine Bigelow directs each scenes with perfection, and portrays the Iraq war in a visionary way in which we get to see how the brave men and women fought for our country, even though they never should have. Mark Boal's screenplay involves the effect of war for the soldiers in physical and mental ways. He shows how they look and feel after fighting scenes and how grueling the war experience is with the heat, patience, and energy exerted in order to survive. Boal also shows how war emotionally changes people. All three sergeants let out their feelings that can be powerful and for Jeremey Renners character, psychotic. Will James really was damaged by his experiences, and eventually becomes accustom to his work. Bigelow shows how the American soldiers in Iraq were not really fighting anybody specific. The republicans in 2003 claimed it was Al Qaeda and that there were WMD's. Then we came up with the idea that were fighting terrorists from Islamic extremist groups. But really we see how we are mostly fighting just normal criminals and people trying to protect their country. Many Islamic terrorists were fought, but mainly we see how their are no specific targets and how unorganized and out of control the war really was. Similar to how out of control each soldiers life was. Many scenes are very long sequences that are similar to the war scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Very intense, heart-pounding dramatic sequences make this intelligent thriller ever so important and entertaining as any war-film you'll ever see. ""The Hurt Locker"" isn't just for powerful and sad battle sequences, it has a profound message about the damage and filth that war contributes."

","The Hurt Locker, premiering on the 4th of September 2008, tells the intense and unique story of Sergeant First Class William James, team leader of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit. Set in the Iraqi War, much of the scenery is covered with dust, sand and isolation. William James is introduced to the team, consisting of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge, after their former team leader, Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson, liquefies in his bomb suit after the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) along the road in Baghdad.<br/><br/>The unconventional death of one of the main characters in the first few minutes of the story symbolises the nature of this movie: viewers are dragged into a movie that depicts a side of war that is not often shown. Instead of focussing on flashy action, bullets flying everywhere and enormous guns, Kathryn Bigelow, the director, takes a much more subtle approach, which was frowned upon by some critics, but heavily appreciated by us. We did not expect such a thought-provoking, tense and sophisticated movie.<br/><br/>One of the first aspects that caught our attention was the personal development of characters during the story. Unlike your average war movie characters, the personalities in The Hurt Locker actually develop: they're actually influenced and consequently changed by actions that happen in the movie. We won't spoil too much, but for example Eldridge battles depression in the movie due to the loss of some of his closest companions. William James has his own demons as well, as we will discover in the movie. <br/><br/>This leads to one of the few disappointments we experienced while watching this movie. At times, the amount of exposition, e.g. background information, can be a bit overwhelming. We felt that a bit too much of the screen time was used up giving the viewer extra information about backgrounds and personal history of the characters. Although this did contribute to the personification and identification of the viewer with the characters, we felt that the exposition time could have been shortened somewhat.<br/><br/>In contrast, the tension in the action scenes was almost tangible. This movie contains a vast amount of scenes that show a 'lack of action', rather than the overly-used 'run and gun' type of action we commonly find in war movies. Tension is not reached by the use of extravagantly big guns and loads of enemies, but rather by the slow, creepy feeling that forms inside the viewer's brain whilst watching William James carefully approach a bomb that could potentially kill him and all his squad members. Even during a heavy gunfight scene, halfway through the movie, tension is build up by the expectations of the viewer, which are carefully guided by the movie using different techniques. During this scene, a 'sniper duel' takes place: not a big shootout, just two snipers and their helpers patiently waiting to take the perfect shot, knowing that if they're even a split second later than their opponent, they'll probably end up in a body bag. <br/><br/>One of those techniques that are used to guide the expectations of the user, is the impressive use of sound in this movie. Personally, we weren't aware of the contribution of sound to this movie until we watched it again. We thus recommend you to watch the movie again and pause it sometimes during the scenes that are filled with tension, e.g. when Owen Eldridge notices a suspicious man with a mobile phone at the beginning of the movie. When the viewer is pointed to the use of sound and starts recognising when it enters a scene, it will become much clearer how sophisticated this movie actually is: the extraordinary soundtrack heavily influences the mood of a scene. This movie would be mediocre at best if it hadn't been for the exceptional soundtrack. <br/><br/>To further investigate the use of sound in the movie, we divide all the sound into two categories: diegetic and non-diegetic sounds. Every type of sound that could be heard in a situation, were the movie 'real', is considered diegetic, for example conversation, ringing mobile phones and explosions. Every other type of sound, which has been added later to the movie and doesn't actually fit with the situation, is called non- diegetic. <br/><br/>Typically, this movie will first heavily rely on non-diegetic sound mixed with (diegetic) conversation, as can be heard in different scenes when an IED is approached. The non-diegetic sound is thus used to build the tension: long, sinister tones add to the suspension in the scene. The scene can then go two ways: either the bomb is disarmed, the non- diegetic sound dies out and diegetic conversation fills the scene, or the bomb explodes, the non-diegetic sound stops abruptly and the devastating diegetic sound of an explosion can be heard. However, only if the viewer pays very close attention, this switch between diegetic and non-diegetic sound can be heard: it is near-perfectly glued together, which greatly adds to the experience of the viewer. <br/><br/>Taking into account the absolutely astonishing soundtrack, the unconventional way the movie is conveyed and the overly large exposition, we are generally very positive about this movie. It should be noted that the trailer did not fit the movie, in our opinion. The trailer shows lots of action, explosions and one-liners, and even though all of these things are included in the movie, the overall mood of the movie is completely different. The movie is definitely not perfect, but it's still a very good, though-provoking, sophisticated movie, and thus earns our eight out of ten stars."

","Brilliant, gritty, dramatic portrayal of a US Army bomb disposal unit in Iraq. Searingly intense without being manipulative or contrived (there is no music within scenes, for example, so the intensity is not artificially lifted by music). <br/><br/>Can seem to drift at times, but in the end it all makes sense, and has a place. The punchline at the end makes it all worth it.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow directs with a deft and varying touch, revealing details which seem insignificant at the time, and omitting details and events which you would think would be important. In the end, it all makes sense. The use of home-movie-style hand-held cameras in certain scenes can be a bit disconcerting at times, but ultimately suited the scene.<br/><br/>Superb performance by then relatively unknown Jeremy Renner.

","The movie ""The Hurt Locker"" is movie filled with action and drama. From the start director Kathryn Bigelow sets the tone with an army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team attempting to detonate and Improvised Explosive Device (IED). The movie stars Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). The movie is about these three soldiers and their mission to dispose of/detonate IED's throughout Iraq. During the first mission and throughout the movie the team's resiliency is tested after finding out how differently one another do business. Throughout the film you get a since of each team members roll in the film. Staff Sergeant James' character is a ""wild boy"" from the start. He loves to do things his way regardless of protocol or how his team members fee and takes a lot of unnecessary risks. This causes conflict from the start and tests the team's resiliency. Sergeant Sanborn's character plays a roll of keeping the team together and plays by the rules. He does not our rank James but has no problem telling him what he's doing wrong or how he feels. His focus in the film is keeping everyone safe and getting the job done which causes lots of conflicts with Staff Sergeant James ""wild boy"" style. Specialist Eldridge character is a low ranking soldier who does what he's told and has no authority. He very unsure of himself and shows a lot of fear. Bigelow does a great job with camera angles throughout the film. The audience gets a glimpse of the soldiers point of view, individuals watching the soldiers from different angles (roof tops, vehicles, etc) point of view, and even robots assisting with bomb detonations view point. These points of views give the audience good insight on the challenges and dangers the team faces daily. The director also does a great job with the sound throughout the film. Everything from the weapons used in the film, the sounds of the military vehicles, and even the soldier's footsteps while running grabs your attention and has you focused on the action throughout the movie. ""The Hurt Locker"" follows in the footsteps of other great war films such as ""Black Hawk Down"", ""We were Soldiers"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"". All these movies give you an in depth view of the dangers soldiers face and how resilient they are. Bigelow takes it one step further by successfully giving you the point of view of an EOD team which is very different than many other war films. The action packed film will have you at the edge of your seat from start to finish."
"jonmurdock","6","0","1","10 February 2014"," OK war movie. Nothing more, nothing less.
","The Hurt Locker isn't a bad film, but it's not a great film either. Jeremy Renner does well in his roll as an adrenalin seeking hothead bomb disposal team leader, although his actions in the movie are not very believable. Once that obstacle is hurdled and understood, what we have left is a fairly watchable war film, 6/10. The story is simple: You are in Iraq and your job is to disarm bombs. That's the entire storyline. Sometimes the enemy shoots at you, and you shoot back at them. The camera is very shaky at times to give you that realistic war-like chaos feeling, but for me it just looks like a shaky camera.<br/><br/>The film threatens to evolve into a story when Sgt. James befriends an irritating Iraqi boy (played by Christopher Sayegh) who sells pirated DVDs on the street, and the boy subsequently ends up as a body bomb which Sgt. James defuses. We don't know who killed the kid, or why - but Sgt. James seeks justice. He ventures out into town on his own at night to kill (possibly) the people responsible. The only problem is, the idea fizzles out and nothing happens. But that doesn't make the film unpredictable.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is an OK war movie. Nothing more, nothing less."
"miesse02","Null","0","1","9 February 2014"," Film Appreciation
","Providing an intense and gritty glimpse into the lives of a team three American soldiers that specialize in the art of defusing and removing roadside bombs and other IED's, ""The Hurt Locker"" (Bigelow, 2008) is action filled adrenaline rush that will keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what waits around the next corner. Starring Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William Jacks, Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn, and Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit (EOD) is assigned to secure the streets of post 9/11 Iraq in a perfect mixture of action and drama that illustrates a humanistic side of war. With Jacks, Sanborn, and Eldridge having their own opinions of war and the job they must do, we are also given a look into the bond and brotherhood that is developed and necessary for survival in a place where they are considered the enemy by many. <br/><br/>Giving a graphic and powerful look into the always tested psyche of an American soldier, an emotional yet realistic portrayal of one's ability to keep it together or fall apart creates a deep connection with audiences of all backgrounds. Keeping viewers entertained with its deep and meaningful emotions to match the level of chaos surrounding First Sergeant Jacks and company, incorporating similar experiences that writer Mark Boal had witnessed firsthand during his time spent with an actual bomb squad in Iraq, provides a strong sense of reality. Utilizing the indirect-subjective point of view through most of the movie, the director places the audience in the middle of an intense action sequence during a bomb defusing or identifying with Eldridge and his internal struggle of accepting death and its probability of happening. Emotions run high and have the ability to blow at any moment, as well.<br/><br/>Earning its spot next to other great war/drama movies like ""Apocalypse Now"" (Coppola, 1979), ""Full Metal Jacket"" (Kubrick, 1987), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (Scott, 2001), with their gift to heightened one's sense of awareness and anticipation while viewing, ""The Hurt Locker"" (Bigelow, 2008) is soon to be an iconic pop-culture classic. Creating a respect and understanding of why some people do what they do, why they do it, and who they do it for, many under lying themes and perspectives are discovered depending how one absorbs and processes information. Providing a peek into a world that exist to civilians only through the media, social networking, and movies (of course), ""The Hurt Locker"" (Bigelow, 2008) successfully delivers an eye opening and emotional message about the cost of freedom and those men and women willing to take on that debt.<br/><br/>References Bigelow, K.

Instead of him, a new man named James joins the team. He is also smart but he often ignores instructions and destroy the group's harmony. Sanborn and Eldridge was completely at a loss. But James is strong-minded and brave so they influences to him,3 of men manage to perform their duties safely. My most impression point is the each of strong minds.

","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proved herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a ""family"" back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.<br/><br/>The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.<br/><br/>One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.<br/><br/>The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.<br/><br/>This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out."

","Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker' was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2009, even though it only experienced a limited release in theaters around America. This movie is a riveting suspense thriller that literally puts you right in the action of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) squad in Iraq, risking their lives every day to complete the missions they are tasked with. The film was shot much like a documentary, but the drama and thrilling suspense give it the qualities of an epic war film.<br/><br/>Right from the start, we get an up close and personal look into what these soldiers deal with every day of their lives. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is the main specialist who suits up and goes in to disarm each bomb with his own hands. He's constantly supervised by Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) while the rest of the squad provides support and cover in the dangerous conditions that they find themselves in. As they move through every mission, tension starts to builds up between the different characters. Most notably is the relationship that develops between SSgt. James and SSgt. Sanborn, as James is the kind of person who exhibits no fear in what he does, while Sanborn acts highly protective and cautious of the task at hand. These two characters let internal struggles come through and provide colorful character development throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is really exciting. It has a cinema verité feel to it, with shaky cameras and brutally graphic scenes, but gets extremely immersive and dynamic as the action goes on. The camera frequently goes from one point of view to the next. For instance, a soldier sees movement in the window of a building across the courtyard, and fires a shot. The camera, immediately shifting to the point of view of the window, just catches the bullet ricocheting off the wall. I found these sudden shifts in point of view to be highly effective in giving a broad presentation of perspective.<br/><br/>'The Hurt Locker' was the closest thing to a true Iraq War documentary we've seen Hollywood put out during that time. It's a glorifying film for the brave American soldiers who go into Iraq and put their lives on the line to fight for our country."

","The sound of war<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is an American film set in a middle-East war setting. Throughout the film we follow sergeant Jeremy Renner, substitute for squad leader Matt Thompson as head of a team designated to disarm high- threat bombs around the country of Iraq. During missions squad members Sanborn and Elridge communicate with James as he approaches targets in a highly protective bomb suit. Loving the adrenaline of the job, some might call James crazy for his approach to certain situations, scaring his squad members and being rather reckless.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker was according to us the best Iraq war film made. We think it also has one of the best portrayals of the senselessness, brutality and randomness that comes with fighting in a war. These are all the aspects that made this movie win 6 Oscars. We liked the fact that they didn't put movie stars or well-known actors in the movie as this made it very convincing. It's just about a small group of men disarming bombs in the heat of the battle, when there is no one else they can count on. Everything can be deadly in those kinds of situations and everyone can be an enemy, their lives are at risk all the time. The plot in the film is great, the atmosphere is even better, everything seemed like it was filmed by a soldier fighting in Iraq in real life. Another good thing about the film was that lots of underlying themes, such as chaos, came back in for example the character James Renner (for example the scene when he stops a vehicle when he is mounted in his bomb defusing gear), the squad leader. The chaos came back because of his reckless approach to doing his work. The fact that they make you feel that you are the fourth member of the squad is also an amazing experience throughout the film. We could really imagine that we were part of the squad because of the quality of the acting, and because they filmed big parts of the movie from eye height, It was also the 360 landscape that made our imagination possible, 360 landscape meaning that you can only hear one character talking at the time, making you feel like you are on the battlefield yourself (this was shown very clearly in the opening scene, where you can hear the heartbeat of the bomb diffuser. The last thing we really liked about the movie was that it is very close to reality (apart from the recklessness of the squad leader); they created this by, for example, putting in the scenes that were in between the action scenes. When you're watching a war film nowadays most of the times the only thing you can see is blood, they found a good balance between the two with the usage of well-written characters and dialogue.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker has made great use of cinematic techniques. First of all, the narrative form is very clear. This is because fabula and syuzhet are synced and because there weren't any flashbacks or flash forwards in film, this made the film ""easy"" to watch. At first, we thought that there would be an open ending because most modern day ""serious"" movies end with this ""annoying"" ending that leaves lots and lots of questions with the viewer. So you can imagine we were pretty delighted with the closed ending in this film. Second of all, we unanimous agreed that the mise and scene was performed brilliantly, the acting was astonishing and made us believe we were like the ""4th squad member"". The setting, namely Iraq was convincing, because these situations occur daily in the Middle East. Thirdly, we thought that the camera-work was done really well, especially because of the eye height filming and of the first person view that was used at certain moments. We especially enjoyed these techniques because it amplifies the feeling that you're the ""4th squad member"". The filter they used; a sand like colour, gave it a sort of Middle East atmosphere. Fourthly, the light and colour completed the film, just like the sound, the producers made sure that the light and color was ""natural"" and ""organic"". Fifthly, the film producers did a great job on the special effects, the explosions and gunfire seemed amazingly realistic. Sixthly, the editing was flawless. All the gun shots, foot steps, explosions etc. were perfectly synced. At last, we have the sound. It's not surprising that the Hurt Locker has won already 2 Oscars for just the Sound in the film. The 360 landscape sound technique (stated earlier) amplifies the ""4th squad member idea"". Sound and image relations were also (like all the other techniques) perfectly synced. The dialogue was very well written and together with the language made a very convincing film.<br/><br/>Overall we think the hurt locker is an amazing film, giving a very good representation of the problems American soldiers face in the middle- east. The message is clear: life of a soldier is hard. Kate Bigelow did an excellent job in terms of dialogue and character development: all characters in the film have seemingly been very polished creating a very convincing story. Cinematic techniques are applied almost excellently: there's a wide variety of sound –and special effects, good usage of light and colour and good editing. Flaws were scarce in this film. After reviewing what we had seen we came to the conclusion this was close to our ''perfect'' film, which is most likely also the reason it won so many Oscars. Therefore we recommend this film to all, it has a good balance of tension, dialogue and action."

","The Hurt Locker is a phenomenally directed look into the psyche-profile of soldiers trying to find their way through hell, and back into normal life. What could have been a simple film ended up being surprising; It was both entertaining and thought provoking. <br/><br/>The acting is superb with Jeremy Renner leading the charismatic and twisted squad through Baghdad, the minimalist score is perfect, and the extremely well directed action scenes are beyond suspenseful and intense. There are a lot of messages in this film and the smart storytelling is seriously impressive. It took me three times to fully realize the brilliance of this film, so this is definitely a film that has to be soaked in. The Hurt Locker is a fantastic film. 5/5 stars"
"raphaklopper","9","0","3","15 April 2013"," One of the best War movie ever!
","After ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" I never thought that another filmmaker would make a war movie that managed to get to their feets ... Kathryn Bigelow succeeded in a FANTASTIC way.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" can be one of the best war movies of all time, explore and show's the Iraq war in a way never seen before, getting to be quite original in many details. One of the most positive and original points on the film is that it dosen't focus attention on shootings sequences as other war films do, but explores the view of the soldiers, as they see and feel the war, putting the public on their places. Who sees the war on television or news, just see unnecessary killing and massacre between peoples and nations, yeah it is true but then people say that the soldiers are murderers. The film manages to explore this sense from the perspective of the soldiers, they are only there to follow rules, their job is being there, the soldiers only have each other and fight to protect the man on their side, we see that they count the days they spend in combat to return home soon which seems impossible. Mark Boal gets conveying this with a superb screenplay, shows reality in an impressive way. Not only is the screenplay is very real but also the impressive visual details that the film delivers. Another plus point in the film are the visual effects, giving the film an visual magnitude, impressive in every passing moment, and with the direction of Kathryn Bigelow everything is just amazing.<br/><br/>The cast could not have been better for the story of these soldiers. Jeremy Renner gives a fantastic performance in every detail as Sergeant First Class William James; Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and more; Brian Geraghty; Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>From start to finish, ""The Hurt Locker"" gives an impressive view of the war in Iraq, stuffed maintenance; emotion; action and an impressive visual spectacle, one of the best war movies ever made."

","Pretty good and exciting movie. Definitely had tension throughout. Despite this, the main character's rebellious attitude was definitely something I feel would have been called out for in the army, especially in such life and death situations.<br/><br/>I feel the tensions between the civilians and the army were done well and there was an obvious aura of dislike towards the military presence. Scenery was done well and I feel that the story moved at a good pace.<br/><br/>In the end, I especially liked the juxtaposition of normal U.S. life versus the harsh reality and dangers in Iraq and in war.

"piratecannon","8","0","1","27 December 2012"," It Hurts So Good
","My favorite war movie of all time is Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg's gritty, unflinching depiction of World War II made audiences feel as if they were really on the front lines. This, paired with some truly substantial emotional heft and psychological underpinnings, makes it a film that is both haunting and unforgettable. I think it's safe to say that Kathryn Bigelow has taken a lot of cues from Spielberg, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker takes place in 2004. US Army Staff Sergeant Will James has just joined Bravo Company's bomb disposal unit, where he patrols the streets of Baghdad and makes it abundantly clear that everything they encounter is a potential threat. The paranoia here is justified, though, as seemingly innocent piles of rubble consistently turn out to be bombs with maniacally complex structures.<br/><br/>As Will goes about his job, it's clear that he's a reckless adrenaline junkie–instead of sending a robot in to assess what are easily lethal situations, he prefers to do it himself. His penchant toward recklessness and danger is further enforced by the fact that he constantly chain smokes and occasionally indulges in the stereotypical drunken, macho horseplay. He also likes to unwind by listening to metal CDs as he examines the spare parts of bombs that almost killed him. While everyone else is counting down the days till they're rotation is up, Will is living for the danger of the moment.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker opens with a quote by Chris Hedges which suggests that war is a drug. This message is driven home for the entire 131 minute run time of the movie, and the imagery here leaves no doubt that the thrill of staring death in the face is what keeps Will going (his motivation to do this is made especially clear by the scenes preceding the film's conclusion). All of this is interesting, but it's something that's been depicted in movies many times before. For example, The Patriot and Full Metal Jacket have already demonstrated how people can have a disturbing ""give and take"" relationship with war, which is exactly what Will has here. I'm not suggesting that this is a bad thing, but it does feel a little recycled.<br/><br/>What's really interesting about The Hurt Locker (and what would've made it more unique in the end) are the technical details of what's involved with disarming these devices–and, of course, what life is like for these soldiers on a daily basis.<br/><br/>It seems that The Hurt Locker is also trying to touch on the notion that violence embeds itself in those in close proximity to it, and that it's transfered to subsequent generations. This is something that's handled with just the right amount of ambiguity, and it does help add a little something to the story that would've otherwise been missing, so, overall, this is an added strength of the film (not to mention that it provides some incentive for repeated viewings).<br/><br/>Where The Hurt Locker succeeds the most, however, is in its action scenes. Each of these finds Will taking on bombs or other unexpected threats, and they cause viewers to soon realize that, in this place, anything can happen. The Hurt Locker, for the most part, avoids Hollywood stereotypes, and isn't afraid to sacrifice characters for the sake of realism. These are some of the most intense moments you'll encounter at theater, and that alone makes it worth the arm and leg theaters are currently charging for admission.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a change of pace in the form of a non-blockbuster, this is the way to go. While the message contained within The Hurt Locker is nothing new, it's still an intense and informative war movie that features top-notch performances."

","The Hurt Locker (2008)<br/><br/>This was a very intense film based on one of the most dangerous jobs in the military. The film was about an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team in Iraq. It shows the conflict in the Middle East first hand from the soldiers that are there fighting to make it a safer place. The three man team is faced with the ongoing threat from the Iraqi people and is always on guard. Director Kathryn Bigelow does a fine job expressing the reality that is faced in the Middle East and this supported the theme of ""war being hell but it can be addicting."" <br/><br/>Army Sergeant First Class Will James, played by Jeremy Renner, took over as the team leader after SSgt Matt Thompson, played by Guy Pearce, was killed while disposing a bomb. SFC James had a very different style compared to Thompson; he was a risk taker or ""wild man"" as stated in the film and likes to take things into his own hands. Sergeant JT Sandborn, played by Anthony Mackie, was a more serious by the book kind of solders that doesn't like SFC James's style. Specialist Owen Eldridge, played by Brian Geraghty, was a more timid solder and unsure of the thought of war. <br/><br/>SFC James is a bit of a loose cannon, during the part of the film when he is trying to disarm the bomb in the car and he is told that they need to go several times by Sgt Sandborn and Sgt James throws off his headset and continues to look for the detonator displays his adrenaline addiction. He placed the whole team in danger so he could satisfy his own need to succeed. <br/><br/>I think the editing played a huge part in the effect of the film. The scene when the car caught on fire and they slowed down the film speed or when the bomb attached to the Iraqi man went off because SFC James didn't have the time or tools to remove it. The slow film speed showed every detail of the explosion and the adrenaline of the actors. The film used a lot of hand held cameras which made the shots shaky and feel like you were there. <br/><br/>War movies tend to be intense suspense films based on adrenaline. Inside the Iraq War was similar in the way the film was shot with handle held cameras although this film is a real documentary. It shows the adrenaline of the solders and the real live hell that had to endure. <br/><br/>I feel that war movies such as ""The Hurt Locker"" are good at showing the viewers what war is really about. I don't think that most people realize what these men and women go through to protect our country. Even though every aspect of the film many not be correct, it still gets ""civilians"" insight on the adrenaline affects and hell that they are put through on a daily basis."

","The Hurt Locker directed by Katheryn Bigelow is a very suspenseful movie depicting a bomb squad during the Iraq war. Sergeant First Class James' character played by Jeremy Renner is the co-leader of the squad. James is an ""adrenaline junkie"" that definitely has a rebellious side. He thinks that he is invincible. His counterpart, Sergeant Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie is representative of the average ""by the book"" soldier. The third member of the team, Specialist Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty is an anxiety-ridden soldier that likes to follow the rules but has trouble with leadership decision making. The movie shows the team in various high stress situations where their life is in grave danger at every turn. The Hurt Locker at its core is about the interplay of the characters of the bomb squad and the psychological effects of their very dangerous profession. Their emotions and growth throughout the movie are highlighted. In one scene, Specialist Eldridge is hesitating about taking a shot or not. He asks Sergeant James what he should do and James calls Eldridge to make his own decision. Eldridge ultimately takes the shot, which probably saves the team. This is a distinct growing moment for Eldridge. Another scene involves Sergeant James who believes he can disarm any bomb but cannot disarm the bomb attached to ""black suit man"", a suicide bomber. James tries to disarm the bomb but fails and the man is blown up. This causes James to accept his human flaws and that no one is invincible. The movie is intense which is made even more so by the filming technique of cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. A number of hand held cameras were used to give the impression of a newsreel. The audience is drawn into an almost real world live action event. This effective technique enhances the intense suspense because it feels very real. The soundtrack or lack thereof is also a brilliant technique because it adds to the newsreel feel and heightens the suspense. Usually, music creates suspense in a movie but this movie is exactly opposite. The story itself is inherently suspenseful and music would have detracted from the intensity. In all, The Hurt Locker is a movie about humanity and the fragile nature of human lives. The scenes may be hard to watch but the occupation of these brave men is an unfortunate necessity in today's world. The sacrifices they make should be highlighted so that Americans do not take our secure lives for granted. This movie, with its flaws, should be viewed by all who value their freedom and security."

","The Hurt Locker portrays a realistic depiction of the mentality of soldiers in the Iraq War. Instead of just focusing on the usual story lines about bravery and valor, Bigalow focuses on the human side of the war, most importantly what drives the soldiers. This is especially true with Sergeant James. He represents the way in which soldiers are affected by the war. He becomes so emotionally detached that the only thing that keeps him going is the need to take risks. These risks are what makes the movie exciting and allows us to connect with the characeters. These dramatic scenes allow us to see James'inner motivations and determine why he takes these risks. By understanding his motivations, viewers are able to form a deep connection to James and others."

","The Hurt Locker gives shocking insight into the struggles of soldiers on and off the battlefield. The film follows a squad of three soldiers who unarm bombs in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. After the original leader dies from a bomb detonation, Sgt. James takes his place. Sgt. James starts off as a poor leader because of his lack of communication with the rest of his squad. As the movie progresses, the relationships develop within the squad and their chemistry becomes much better. The movie comes to a shocking climax when the three soldiers try to find people who detonated a bomb in an urban center in Bagdad. At the end of the movie, when Sgt. James goes home, you see the struggles of soldiers to fit back into society after they have returned home from war. This in my opinion is the most captivating part of the movie."

","I spent the entire film grabbing the arms of my seat. I was there in Irak, steps away from my death and the death of those around me. The tension, the suspense is at times breathtaking, literally. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a miracle and the definitive consecration of a great filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This is also a rare occasion in which I went to see the film without having read a single review or knowing anything about it. One should try to do that more often because the impact of the surprise translates into pure pleasure and in this case, sometimes, you have to look away from the unmitigated horror. Jeremy Renner is a real find. He is superb. A kind soul, wild man with enough arrogance to make him appear reckless and yet his humanity precedes him. People may commit the mistake of avoiding this gem thinking that it's just a war film. Don't. It isn't. It's a great, engrossing film about human emotions, not to be missed"

The camera angles and shots gave the view a great seat within the movie and often left you with the exposed feeling of being there, out in the open, where anyone could be watching and could attack at any moment. A true eerie feeling on the battlefield today.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner give a great performance as Sergean First Class William James and proves why he was selected to carry on the Bourne movies. He's radical, reckless, and has no desire to follow protocol, as a veteran myself his character is well understood. Brian Geraghty also gave a great performance as Specialist Eldridge, a soldier who is almost done with his tour but is almost paralyzed with the fear of dying.<br/><br/>The only performance that I thought was somewhat over the top and therefore not the best was Sergeant Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. I was way too reaching at times and really didn't fit well with the rest of the movie. I understand that they were trying to contrast Renners character and his, but it didn't work so well for me.<br/><br/>Over all this movie was out sanding and deserves to be one of the top 10 if not 5 among he War genre."
"xboxdad","9","0","2","30 July 2012"," A film that displays much realism to the weight of war on human beings
","The Hurt Locker primarily focuses on the story of Sergeant First Class (SFC) William James, who arrives in Baghdad, Iraq to occupy the position of a fallen Soldier in a bomb disposal squad. SFC James, who is played by Jeremy Renner, has a very die-hard leadership style; this leads to a conflict of opinions with his teammates in their early relationship. The members of his team, Sergeant (SGT) JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist (SPC) Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), are accustomed to doing things in full accordance with military regulations. To survive the remainder of their deployment together they must work through their personal and collective difficulties, ensuring the safety and security of the bomb sites that they go into.<br/><br/>The major theme of the film is the effects that war have on people. While SFC James is a warrior who gives everything to the mission, the film also displays his moments of weakness as well. The weight of battle starts to show when the team finds a dead child who is packed with explosives. This young boy coincidentally looks similar to another child who SFC James is fond of back at the team's base. Shortly after these explosives are found, an accompanying officer who has been counseling SPC Eldridge is killed by another explosive device. The death of this officer devastates SPC Eldridge, while SFC James searches for answers in the death of the young boy. In doing so, he makes some erratic decisions which place his life in danger. Further on in their deployment, SFC James and SGT Sanborn answer a call where an innocent man is strapped with an explosive vest. While they do everything they can, the death of this civilian is unavoidable. This causes SGT Sanborn to breakdown expressing his fear of dying as a single man, while shortly after SFC James emotionally falls apart in his solitude.<br/><br/>Similar movies, such as the 2007 film In the Valley of Elah, expose the long term issues that Soldiers like SFC James must deal with when they return from combat. This is lightly touched on at the end of The Hurt Locker, when SFC James is unable to adjust to civilian life so he volunteers to return to war.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker uses many techniques to draw in its audiences. One of these techniques is how the sound is integrated. For example, the explosions that take place are very genuine; one can hear debris hitting buildings, metal objects clanging, the screams that follow, etc. Another technique that is spot on, are the camera angles. These shots are natural and precise, drawing viewers in more. For example, when SFC James enters the home of an Iraqi man in search of answers to the death of a young boy, the camera is quick to focus on him as he shuffles from room to room.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that The Hurt Locker has been reviewed with much acclaim. War is rugged and painful, and the dedication in this film is clearly evident by the realism of the events that take place."

","The Hurt Locker was hyped as a rare example of a film about the war in Iraq that doesn't preach. Kathryn Bigelow, director of 1991's Point Break, crafts a nerve racking thriller that speaks about the reality of conflict in a way most documentaries only strive to. The Hurt Locker stands as a haunting critique of American society both at home and abroad.<br/><br/>This is not writer Mark Boal's first attempt at writing a film set in Iraq, where he was an embedded journalist for Rolling Stone, he previously penned ""In the Wallet of Elah"" (2007), but in this outing his story follows an American bomb disposal unit combing the streets of Baghdad circa 2004.<br/><br/>After a failed disposal resulting in one death, Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) arrives on the scene. James is a wild card, a daredevil who runs to sites of maximum danger, not only disregarding the advice of his comrades, but chucking away the handsets designed to let him hear their concerns about his actions. It's then understandable that members of his team, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) treat him with the same sort of suspicion they reserve for every inch of the debris-littered alleys and public squares they are meant to be looking after. Sanborn, reinforcing that race and class are relevant issues even for a squad unified by shared objectives, calls him a ""red-neck piece of trailer trash"" and knocks him unconscious. Sanborn and Eldridge even contemplate killing James, but over time they develop grudging respect for his unconventional style. When they discover him keeping old bombs under his bed as trophies, it's clear that he is an addict hooked on war.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow shows a laser like perception into the dynamics of male bonding. The scenes in which the men get drunk and start wrestling show a deep understanding of the intense bond between men who fight together. When James forces liquid into Sanborn, who has been lying in the desert for hours watching an enemy, he does so with a delicacy that seems to confirm a love that only men who have risked their lives together on a front line can truly appreciate.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker excels at making us feel that we are stranded alone with the bomb squad in a landscape full of infinite dangers. Our cinematographer Barry Ackroyd makes masterful use of grainy hand-held photography that recalls the jittery man on the spot style of YouTube. It also conveys the nervousness and paranoia the soldiers feel when every passing person could be an insurgent-in-waiting.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker has gained criticized not being political enough. This movie isn't so much about Iraq as it is about war more generally. Perhaps the true subject isn't even war, but about addiction to violence and danger, signs generally found in warriors.<br/><br/>In my opinion the world doesn't need another film telling us how awful Iraq is. The film does comment on this particular war using a B story about James's fondness for an Iraqi boy and this relationship is handled with brilliant care. The heart of this tale lies in its powerful dramatization of ageless emotions: fear and loneliness."

This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one. <br/><br/>There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is (by choice I felt) muted.

One is a by-the-book team leader, one is a shook up young man, and the third is a wild man that loves to play with death.<br/><br/>One thing this movie does really well is capture the suspense an EOD team experiences. It also focuses on the unique characters. However the best part of the movie in my opinion is at the end. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, I just want to say that it's a badass and that it isn't your typical ""Oh everyone lives happily ever after!"" ending.

","The focal point of this brilliant movie is the character of James, played extremely well by Jeremy Renner. The foil to his character is Sergeant J. T. Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. Within these two characters are two completely opposite dispositions concerning the soldier psyche pushed into combat. The opening quite sums up the entire movie really. Sometimes the rush of battle consumes a man, and to no end. One of the greatest aspects of this film is how it re-creates the fear of life-threatening situations modern day soldiers encounter.<br/><br/>We also get the sense of aimlessness, such as the scene where a bomb capable of killing many is in the middle of being defused and yet there are people filming the crisis as if it were a mere show. It kind of brings one back to ""Full Metal Jacket"" when one soldier remarked ""Here we are dying for these people, and they think its one big joke."" The struggle between duty and survival is a constant factor, making this one of the great war films of recent years. I highly recommend this one."
"motorfocus82","8","0","3","26 June 2012"," An interesting story
","After my year of convoy duty, I think I need to repeat a few of the concerns posted by vets about the content and portrayal of the military in this movie. It should be obvious that EOD does not roll this way: They do not run around, three guys in a humvee, responding to calls like frickin' plumbers. They do not leave the wire without everyone knowing where they're going and staying in constant contact with landowners (especially not to break into someone's house dressed with a gun in civilian clothes only to return back and be allowed to enter the base by lying about whorehouses). They do not take psychologists outside the wire on the spur of the moment, if ever. They do not end up out in the middle of nowhere with contractors, and form impromptu sniper teams. And on and on.<br/><br/>On the attitudes of the characters, the hyperactive pseudo-despair displayed by James' subordinates is almost as rare as James' own adrenaline driven pseudo-insanity. It does happen, but the vast majority of the time, that kind of personality is well-controlled in that environment, for reasons involving both straightforward tactical considerations and unit cohesion. Allowing this type of crazy to exist unbridled is a stupid way to run a military, and despite what you may have heard, the American military is most definitely not stupid. Also, colonels do not regularly talk to EOD sergeants and tell them they're 'hot sh*t!' while muscling with their rank. Just in case you didn't know. And I don't know why so many posters on here insist on saying that James is a staff sergeant. He's a sergeant first class. I will say that EOD is filled with ballsy soldiers who deal with fantastic pressure and do their jobs well. Those guys gave us our lives so often in theater that the symbol for their job really should be a green mushroom from Super Mario Brothers. <br/><br/>Now, I'm still giving this movie an 8 because it really is a good story and really does show some realities of the addiction to excitement that need to be shown. The characters are exaggerations, but not extreme ones. The filming and quality of direction are excellent. The tension is thicker than Campbell's Chunky Soup. The acting is very well done. I didn't care for Jeremy Renner before this movie, but his talent impressed throughout. Supporting cast was equally strong. Many of the details of being overseas are carefully portrayed here, and I can appreciate that. As a reflection of soldiers, it's too cynical and psychoanalytical in a sophomoric way to resound flawlessly and should be taken with a grain of salt. But as a movie, it's really good and I enjoyed it."
"tobias_h96","7","0","3","12 June 2012"," War gives America something good after all
","While involvement in the Middle East has overloaded America with criticism, war has also brought something good to the States: The Hurt Locker. This war film is about a bomb disposal team in Iraq. After Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) had died dismantling a bomb, Sergeant First Class William James has gone to Iraq to replace him. Together with Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), he forms a 3-man team. While it's James' task to actually dismantle bombs, Eldrigde and Sanborn assist him and cover his back. The major conflict in the film is between James and Sanborn. Sanborn considers James' way of working reckless and irresponsible, while James thinks Sanborn is making a fuss. The tension between them gets so high, that Sanborn openly proposes to Eldridge to kill James. In chasing terrorists who blew up a petrol tanker, Eldridge gets shot in the leg. When he is about to fly back to America, he blames James for his injury. After that, James and Sanborn are confronted with an innocent man with a bomb strapped to his chest. The bomb is about to go off As becomes clear in the first paragraph, The Hurt Locker is a thrilling movie. Some scenes are full of suspense. When bombs are disposed, the smallest mistake can be fatal, thus extreme caution is necessary. The conflicts between the team members and the gunfights make the movie extra stunning. Sometimes the thrill is interrupted by humoristic passages. This deadpan humour is usually used at climax. For example when the trunk of a car is found loaded with explosives and he is about to do the dangerous disposal, James says, taking of his bomb suit: ""I'm gonna die. I wanna die comfortable"". That is not what the viewer had expected. The Hurt Locker has a very structured plot on one hand, because every new day or scene is indicated by subtitles, which tell you where the main characters are and how many days there are left until they can go home. This gives you a very organized feeling, you know exactly what is going on. On the other hand the film is actually a kind of messy, because sometimes not the whole scene is shown, and questions are created by this. What is happening? Why is this happening? This sometimes causes a little confusion about what exactly happened in the film and that causes you to not fully understand the next scene or part of the movie. The film was set in Jordan just several kilometres away from the Iraqi boundaries which made it a bit more dangerous and more risky, because Iraq does not like America for what happened during the war. Because of this risk the actors might have acted a bit more in a natural way than that they normally would do, they could act that they were scared and looking out for danger more realistically. The different surrounding causes just the right atmosphere; the actors are in a strange environment and they don't know exactly what they can expect. This makes the film and the performance of the actors more real and believable. Another important feature of a film is the characterization. The good thing about the main characters in The Hurt Locker is that they are totally different from one another. For example Sergeant James, who is quite a reckless person, doesn't seem to care about his son and wife at home, while Sergeant Sanborn wants to go home as quickly as possible and wants to return his crew back to the camp safely. We think the fact that these characters collide with each other gives the film a good impression of reality and the way things go in Iraq. This makes that the characters feel like real persons instead of characters. A war movie without sound is like a ship without a rudder. Sound is used more in action movies than every other type of movie, and The Hurt Locker is no exception. The importance of sound was already made clear in the trailer of the movie, where you could hear a clock ticking on the background, which showed that you should have nerves of steel when working in an EOD team. This use of sound was continued in the movie itself, where a lot of explosions and screaming really got you into the movie and made you excited. When people think of action movies they think of a lot of noise. However, in this movie there also is the more quiet sound. It indicates that not much is going on. An example where it was very quiet in the movie is when James has returned home. He is playing with his son and talking about life. The background music is peaceful and quiet. The baby has fun playing with his toys. In this same fragment the sound director also uses one of the most frequently used sound techniques used in movies: the sound bridge. A sound bridge is when sound from the previous scene continues into the next scene or the other way around. Namely, at the end of the scene with his baby you can already hear the helicopters flying over. In conclusion the film 'The Hurt Locker' is a very good film. The setting and plot make that the film is full of suspense and very exciting. The sound builds up the tension you feel as viewer and really drags you into the movie. Also the characters' acting performances are very good. The story is very heavy and impressive, which causes you to sympathize with the characters. The organization of the film however is a bit messy because of some parts being left out, which can cause misunderstandings. Overall, despite the slightly messy plot, the movie is stunning and impressive, which will be remembered for a long time after having seen it."

","The setting is Iraq in 2004. Sergeant William James is the new leader of the bomb squad. He replaces Sergeant Matthew Thompson, who has been killed by a remote controlled IED. James is a bit of a cowboy, and he is considered dangerous for his risk taking approach to the job. While driving in their Humvee, they stop at a point where a Ford Excursion is pulled over with a flat tire.

They come under fire and kill the four snipers after three of the mercenaries are killed.<br/><br/>At a warehouse, James finds the body of a boy with a surgically implanted bomb. He recognizes him as the kid who was earlier selling the soldiers bootleg Dvds. As they leave, the platoons psychiatrist is killed in an explosion. James looks for payback, and breaks into an Iraqi professor's house, but finds nothing. He then comes upon a tanker explosion, and looks for the insurgents by himself. He meets up with Eldridge, a fellow soldier who is shot in the leg during another ambush. <br/><br/>The climax occurs during their last two days when an Iraqi civilian walks down the street with bombs strapped to his body. James must remove the locks one by one in order to save the man's life. Director Kathryn Bigelow uses mostly hand held shots with fast editing to give The Hurt Locker the look of a documentary. It is very realistic, and Jeremy Renner and his supporting cast are excellent."
"jordivanhaaren","9","0","3","9 June 2012"," Great movie with an outstanding performance of Jeremy Renner
","'The Hurt Locker' is not your mainstream good guy versus bad guy thriller that we see way to often nowadays. The movie is located in Iraq and the movie follows the life of a bomb squad team. The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat even when the bomb-squad isn't defusing bombs and it gives the audience a very different view on the war in Iraq. The acting was really good with Anthony Mackie ( as Sergeant JT Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty ( as Specialist Owen Eldridge) but especially the performance of Jeremy Renner (as the reckless Sergeant William James) is literally outstanding. This by Kathryn Bigelow directed movie, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 but was only available in America in June 2009. The movie had a budget of 15 million dollars and the movie lasts 131 minutes. The setting was chosen perfectly and the movie was filmed and edited really well, for instance when on a certain point in the movie a sniper rifle is fired and you see the bullet casing in slow-motion fall in the sand with such well chosen music on the background that you know something important is going to happen. The reckless behavior of Sergeant James is really annoying and concerning his team mates and you really feel their emotions and what they are thinking very well because of for example several dialogues between Sanborn and Eldridge and sometimes a facial expression might already be enough to see what the characters are experiencing. The movie also has several 'happy' moments like when they defuse a bomb but also moments were the characters are talking about family or when you see the characters in the evening just simply having fun under the influence of alcohol. Also when on certain moments you see that Sergeant James is being more of a team player and really changing into a more responsible person, However near the end of the movie you will ask yourself the question whether Sergeant really has changed during the movie or whether he is just the same reckless guy he was at the beginning of the movie One of the things I really consider interesting is how the movie shows how the people of Iraq treat and think about the American's 'helping' them. While the bomb squad is defusing the bomb, the people around are often not very helpful and ignore the instructions the Americans give them. You would think the Iraqi people would be concerned about the bomb and evacuate as fast as possible but this is not the case. The Iraqi people just watch from a close distance to what the squad is doing, Some are even filming the event. Also the squad drives around in a Humvee with a machine gun mounted on top of it. And there is a sign on the Humvee warning the people to stay away from the car or they risk the change of getting shot. This is again a thing the Iraqi people ignore, and even worse near the end you see small children throwing rocks at the Humvee. It other words it is really obvious the Americans aren't welcome and I think the Iraqi people even consider the Americans to be the reason of all the bomb plants in their country. I would definitely recommend this movie because as you might have noticed in my review, I really enjoyed the movie and this movie belongs according to me to the 25 best movies made in the 21st century so far."

","The Hurt Locker has been hailed as one of the best war films of all time, and while that may be a kind remark stretched out too far, it is easily one to commend and one of the best dramatizations of the Iraq War yet. Its high point is its suspense, conveyed in a terrifyingly realistic state. Its characters are also given close attention to, making the experience such a versatile one, that sometimes, it is too good to be true.<br/><br/>Our main protagonist is Sgt. William James (Renner), a new-coming member of the US Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) in Iraq circa 2004. He is quickly, yet somewhat hastily greeted by Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Geraghty), informing them that he is not there to replace their recently fallen man but to simply get the job done. Right off the bat, he is deeper than the average cookie-cutter action hero, more charismatic, more charming, and bolder, always landing with a loud bang. Renner is a beautiful addition to a film already soaring with anticipation.<br/><br/>The film follows the three's adventures defusing bombs, hanging out, exchanging conversations, some of them sounding like they could be final ones, and many capturing poignancy without even remote hesitation. Director Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James Cameron, director of Avatar, who she beat out for both Best Picture and Director, has a unique philosophy on filmmaking. When asked about her specialty in film in an interview, she replied ""I really think it's to explore and push the medium. It's not about breaking gender roles or genre traditions."" I agree with her very much so, although it is a bit numbing when we see a film break so bravely from redundant plot points and genre expectations. Bigelow is more concerned with pushing the envelope, rather than opening a new one. Sometimes, it's best to go further, instead of breathlessly trying to create something so different it becomes a convoluted and restless experience.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker wins with its suspense. Many scenes are captured with such a sure-fire realism to how brutal, unpredictable, and nerve-racking combat is. Then again, how would I know? I've never been drafted or even stepped on land full of decrepit buildings and an endless landscape of sand. I can't fully comment on the film's accuracy or even compare it to the true atmosphere of Iraq or any other war, but I will say that this is on par with my assumption of life on the battlefield.<br/><br/>There is one minor quandary I can pick with the film, and it is its refusal to go further in its commentary on war. I've always wondered what happens when a soldier gets assigned a mission or a task that he does not feel is morally or ethically correct in his eyes. Of course, refusal of order could get you kicked out for good or even scolded mercilessly (again, so I've heard), but what happens when you're assigned a job you almost can't bring yourself to do? Also, it sometimes seems that Eldrige, James, and Samborn have no opinion on the war they are fighting. How does it feel to be manipulated by the government and almost robbed of individualism? As soon as you place the uniform on, you are one of the crowd. The Hurt Locker at least recognizes the beauty of individualism, even though you occupy a sort of ordinary quality.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is beautifully filmed, even with its unstill videography, which I've grown so accustomed to, sometimes seeing a cinematically directed picture feels unnatural. Everything is captured so acutely and professionally, that we are not confused, but delightfully informed on what is where and who is who. The cinematography, by Mark Boal respectively, always provides us with the most unsettling array of shots, quaintly edited together to provide nice coherency, and the acting and presentation is all beautiful and immersing. Just when you think the film has run out of steam, it quickly picks up, mostly during its final scenes, which capture emotions and realism in a stunningly abnormal way. Despite all those remarkable qualities, this is almost not a film to enjoy, but a film to witness.<br/><br/>Starring: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty. Director: Kathryn Bigelow."

","A definite bimodal distribution exists in the reviews. The people that loved the movie, in some cases, go overboard ('the work of a master film maker' types). Those that didn't love it also, in some cases, go overboard. (the 'worst movie ever' types). I particularly liked a comment in one review - 'The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action thriller at once.' Well said. That is what it is. But, assigning the attribute of 'master film maker' isn't realistic.<br/><br/>Personally, as a drama, and a characterization of the motives and heroics of soldiers, I thought Blackhawk Down was a (much) better movie. I see no reason that this film received an Academy Award. But, I enjoyed watching it, I am glad I watched (and own) it, and I will watch it again. The AA designation doesn't influence my assessment.<br/><br/>I agree with the military criticisms, about the inaccuracy of the settings and context in many cases. That doesn't take away from the enjoyment of watching it.<br/><br/>So, watch it for what it is - an suspenseful action movie, with some very personal drama laced in. Don't watch it to see cinematic mastery, or what an AA winner should look like."

","I cannot think of to many negative things to say about ""The Hurt Locker."" My remarks are abundantly delightful. Some scenes made it hard to figure out what the director was trying to express, but I figured it out most of the time. For example, while moving on to another scene I was still trying to figure out the scene beforehand. The transitions sometime made the movie a little confusing. I will have to watch it several times to understand some of the transitions in mind. The location was ideal for the making of ""The Hurt Locker."" Hot, sand, buildings almost in rubble, and the means of transportation. Casualties were abundant in a specific form, which displayed the full-effect of a blast. In addition, the emotional roller coaster between each actor was well defined."
"wandereramor","7","0","1","22 February 2012"," This was fine
","I'll say this for The Hurt Locker: it sure knows how to make a bomb-defusing sequence work, an area where most movies get bogged down in ""red wire or blue wire?"" nonsense. There's simultaneously an incredible tension and a puzzle-solving glee to these scenes that make them absolutely electric, and makes me think that this could have been a pretty good action movie -- hell, the maverick lead/straight-laced sidekick dynamic is lifted straight from Lethal Weapon. Unfortunately, when the actual shooting starts Bigelow's craftsmanship kind of gets consumed in a hail of loud noises and shakycam.<br/><br/>But unfortunately this is a Serious Film, not an action movie, so we have to get a bunch of by-the-numbers character development scenes and theme-summarizing epigraphs. The main issue with this is that the film doesn't really have a lot of quote-unquote big ideas. There are only so many times you can watch Jeremy Renner go off and do something risky on his own while Anthony Mackie yells at him.<br/><br/>There's also something here that isn't really a flaw in the individual film, but more in the emerging discourses and narratives of the Iraq war: it's exclusively a story about Americans going Over There, and the traumatic experiences that the soldiers suffer, with the experiences of Iraqis completely removed. In this film we have a manipulatively-used street vendor kid, but other than that the Iraqis are all just Others, mysterious and dangerous brown faces that just might have a detonator on them. Again, it's not that Bigelow had to address every facet or perspective of the war in her film, but I'm worried that, as with Vietnam, America will end up turning an atrocity done to another nation into its own personal turmoil.<br/><br/>I don't want to make it sound like this is a bad film, because it's not -- in fact, it doesn't really have anything that can be identified as a flaw. But even while watching it I felt kind of detached, and it failed to make any kind of impression on me afterwards. Maybe this just speaks to my intrinsic difficulty empathizing with good-looking soldiers, but despite its technical excellence, The Hurt Locker just doesn't leave the impact that great cinema does."
"paradis_ive","7","0","1","15 February 2012"," Decent but somewhat unrealistic
","I personally loved this movie. It was filled with thrills and suspense and it kept my attention the whole time. I thought the characters that needed to be were deep and the others were developed enough to keep the movie going. I do have to say that based on what I've read in other reviews and the impression I got myself it does pose a rather fantastical view of the army. I'm not very knowledgeable about army life or what these kinds of situations are actually like and dealt with, but I could still tell that the events created in this movie weren't very realistic. This was most obvious in the scene when James tells his team they're going to go after the bombers in the dark since I would assume that they would need to tell someone of higher command first before going off or would need more than just three people. Despite these somewhat noticeable flaws, I thought the movie was decent and a war movie I would recommend to my friends."
"picasso30","7","0","2","14 February 2012"," Hurtlocker goes both ways
","The Hurtlocker is a suspenseful-action thriller movie, there is a bomb expert and its squad, a very nerve racking scary job. I think Bigelow is able to portray every bit of tension of the premise. The film concentrates on the job more then it does politically. Jermey Renner gives a powerful and emotional, unforgettable performance. However, I believe for Military people and people who have background of the Military may think the movie is a disappointment and inaccurate. For me this movies goes both ways because it probably is inaccurate to a certain point, however the Hurt Locker picture and how it affects the audience, really moved people."
"Marcelo_Dos_Santos","6","0","1","7 February 2012"," Strange, powerful and, in a sense, beautiful
","The Hurt Locker, by the ultimately competent and highly skilled Kathryn Bigelow, is treated like a newsreel or a semi documentary, à la The Blair Witch Project. This shaky, many times soft-focused (or just plain out of focus) camera, gives the movie some sort of immediacy, a kind of weird impression of testimony, where the viewer feels he's participating of the action or, at the very least, is seeing a very real event. Focused mainly in the disorders the war introduces in soldiers personalities, Bigelow does her very best to portray the fears, the guilts and, perhaps, the straightforward psychosis they suffer, but, in my opinion, fails to deliver the sense of commitment and sacrifice that, in the very deep, justifies the volunteering they professed. Nice Irak War movie, well acted and of course very well directed, THL shows nice special appearances by Guy Pearce, Evangeline Lilly, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes, despite the fact these are little more than cameos. The weakest point in its scrip is —no doubt about this— the almost unbelievable and plainly ridiculous declaration of principles and philosophy of war analysis towards the end, not because of who makes it, but because of who is this paragraph directed to. Six stars out of ten, mostly because the perfect timing, excellent mise-en-scène and great directing, and because, you know, this is the beautiful and intelligent Bigelow. Worth watching if you can tolerate some unconventional and original narrative resources and techniques."

Staff Sergeant William James is the adrenaline junkie and the thrill of diffusing a live bomb is what he lives for, Specialist Eldridge is overwhelmed with all the death around them and Sergeant Sanborn supports them the best he can.<br/><br/>You have big name actors like David Morse, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fienees make brief but memorable appearances in the movie.<br/><br/>When James is tasked with diffusing of the bombs they're some of the most intense nerve racking scenes as you'll see."
"charlie-westt","10","0","3","26 January 2012"," A Modern Masterpiece
","Kathryn Bigelow has made few movies in her time, some none may have heard of, others some consider a classic. And now, Bigelow returns with her latest film that is simply a masterpiece. The Hurt Locker won the Best Picture Oscar over Avatar, and rightly so. Bigelows approach to the film is original and fantastic and her visual style is the perfect taste for this kind of movie. The first scene literally throws us straight into the middle of the action, and gives us edge of seat action and shocks. And it doesn't stop there. Bigelow has small but important transitions from scene to scene and they work perfectly, giving us a relaxed moment before literally sending the viewer out on their next mission. Bigelow also creates a layout to the film that really sends a viewer through state of emotions, with her beginning the film with sad yet tense occasion. But, we are then introduced to Staff Seargent William James, a character who at first we seem to discover to be a light hearted almost rebellious kind of character, settings mood for the upcoming scene. As we go into our next scene, we see James' almost jokey kind of attitude to the situation, but, does not make it so we are sitting at the screen with a smile on out face, a mood where we feel the tension yet feel the fact that James' attitude is surprising for the situation. But as the films progress, so does James' and slowly he becomes darker and the film follows close behind. With us suddenly facing death and gruesome images, and the anger of James character that flourishes with film, as if they are strongly linked. Jeremy Renner plays Seargent James in The Hurt Locker, and gives a standout performance. As mentioned his character goes through many waves of emotions and different attitudes, and we feel as if Renner himself is not an actor but a devoted soldier who will stop at no cost to find answers and complete his mission. And this is where Renner shines, for as the film begins his character seems to be different but not stand out, but as the films continues if becomes so complex and detailed we cant full comprehend and Renner takes that mantle perfectly, acting as if her is the only one that knows the emotions. Bigelow also makes this movie perfect with her style, with her introduction showing and exploding bomb in slow motion, working superbly, for it gives a future incline to what is going to occur and be the main theme of the movie.Bigelow also uses her camera style perfectly for the film, making it not perfect and constantly still as if watching a scene. She makes sure the camera shakes and rattles as the bullets fly and the feet pound along the ground, making us feel as if we are there in the scene, not sitting in a cinema watching. The sound that echo through the streets, and the silence of a deserted but sinister town not only set a mood but again makes us feel nervous as if we are a soldier walking through the street. Sp, to conclude, Kathryn Bigelow has created a perfect film, with all ingredients included and more, she gives us the finest film in many years which literally ticks all the boxes, unlike many films today, yet makes The Hurt Locker, exciting and thrilling and a movie anyone can watch. Kathryn Bigelow is the first and only female to win a directing Oscar, not only is she one of the most worthy winners in history, I am sure she will have many more to come."
"scruplesindisguise","8","0","2","25 January 2012"," A study of the psyche of a soldier
","I run a risk in writing this review following only one viewing, in that The Hurt Locker is a film that needs multiple viewings to fully take in, and my views may change. However, this should not affect the credibility of the review.<br/><br/>One thing that must be noted is that this is not a 'war film' per se, in the way in which Saving Private Ryan and Platoon are 'war films'. Rather, this is an exploration of the chaos of war, and the way in which it affects one's psyche - quite like a modern-day, slightly tamer and more realistic (and less comic) Catch-22. Character Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the protagonist in question, and the one who receives the main focus. The film serves as an intricate study of how dangers in war (most predominantly in this film: bombs) can have mental and emotional consequences. Director Kathryn Bigelow brings the movie together in such a way that every aspect of the filmmaking process has a part to play in this psychological portrayal. The script is great, albeit sparse at times, but the empty space is vital to the story and the film. I've not seen many other films that create suspense quite like this one, and this is mainly down to the fantastic use of editing and sound mixing. The film avoids cliché due to its vastly realistic approach – but one expects something major to happen almost constantly throughout. Typical Hollywood narrative is avoided, as it just wouldn't quite work with what Bigelow and the others are trying to get across. There is no true climax to the film, but rather a nod towards a message/moral that finalises the story aptly.<br/><br/>The film received 9 Oscar nominations, 6 of which were won. I feel that they were all deserved. The only one with a slight question mark is the nomination for the score, written by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The word 'sparse' comes to mind again, and 'ambience' for the most part. Whilst I strongly believe that appropriateness is paramount in scoring a film (and should that mean silence, then you write silence), I feel that more could have been said through the music. However, there were definitely some nice moments in it.<br/><br/>As a film that focuses mainly on characterisation and the effects on the mind, rather than filmic entertainment, it can appear quite 'slow' on the surface, if you're on to use such a term. However, it is a brilliant study on characterisation and the mind, and moreover, a superb film."

","Winner of 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 2009, ""The Hurt Locker"" has been a highly-acclaimed underrated war film, directed masterfully by Kathryn Bigelow, who coincidentally is the ex-wife to James Cameron, who directed ""Avatar"" a year later. ""The Hurt Locker"" starts off with a three-man United States Army EOD team during the Iraq War, and their 365-day rotation is about to be completed. The whole movie is a cat-and-mouse game through Iraq, where anything can be a deadly bomb. This movie has its slight disadvantages, but this is still one of 2009's best films. Director Kathryn Bigelow definitely deserved her Oscar win for directing this fine piece of work. It's almost hard to believe that a woman can actually make a war movie like this. She had a perfect vision of what the movie should be, and she really made the audience feel like they are in the middle of Iraq. Stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty all portray powerful performances, and they really make the movie look realistic. From the fast-paced editing, the smooth cinematography, the dramatic score, and the excellent directing duty of Kathryn Bigelow, ""The Hurt Locker"" really improves. But my problems with the film are kind of too thoughtful. This is 131 minutes too long, some of the war scenes were lacking, and just the main plot was a little slow. But, I just don't understand how this movie won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Mark Boal, when this type of script makes a movie that's not really a ""writer film"". But this is what kind of makes this movie good a little. I still really loved this film from beginning to end. I was on a thrill ride in Iraq, thanks to the unique and powerful directing of Kathryn Bigelow. ""The Hurt Locker"" also has powerful messages involving those innocent soldiers that gave their lives in Iraq, and to those with hopes of coming back home safe. This is how you make a great war film, where there is more to the story than just bombs that blow up all the time. This is a true bet for the Best Picture win in 2009. ""The Hurt Locker"", in my review, ""a thrilling ride, unique and captivating""."

","I've read the reviews below and could not stop wondering what do people expect from a movie. Reality? Watch documentaries. Or whatever. This movie is really exceptional in many ways. Excellent acting, beautifully directed and shot, fantastic music choice and fine writing. It shows only an excerpt from a soldiers life on the job (as a contrast to life at home). It also shows how cheap and relative life can be outside our cozy little shells we build around us, and we should grab every moment given to enjoy it and do good, while we can. This is not a movie about war in Iraq or wherever. Don't be so superficial. It's only a (perfectly told, btw.) story about human adjustment to whatever life faces us with. This is a world we live in, like it or not. And this movie is just extraordinary in every aspect. Don't know (or care, for that matter) about Oscars, but this is one of the examples how movies should me made. Simple, yet with complex, with so many layers. I've watched it three times so far and each time it gets better. Highly recommended."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","2","8 January 2012"," War as entertainment
","Kathryn's Bigelow's film 'The Hurt Locker' tells the story of a bomb disposal engineer in Iraq. It's long, but consistently gripping: however, does it deserve the hatful of Oscars it won? War films are hardly scarce, after all, and much of the basic narrative here is familiar, including the sense of alienation from civilian life felt by hardened soldiers. And aspects of this movie just didn't ring true for me. Most accounts of war tell of long periods of tedium interspersed by odd moments of acute fear and danger; but in this film, whenever the bomb disposal squad get a new mission, there's someone trying to kill them as they undertake it, or at the very least some idiot with an inexplicable desire to walk into the barrel of a gun. Post-war Iraq was (and sadly remains) a dangerous place; but overall, U.S. casualty rates are not as high (I think) as this film suggests. And the absence of any interest in why the war was fought, or in why some Iraqis might have wanted Americans dead, feels like a mistake: instead, we get countless set piece scenes of the heroes against the gooks - the fact that it's bomb disposal, rather than infantry fighting, that's nominally the subject, doesn't change this in any fundamental way. Perhaps I was unfortunate to watch this at the same time as I was reading Karl Maplantes 'Matterhorn', a novel set in the Vietnam war; that seems truthful and shocking to me, where this film seems more like entertainment. A cynic might suggest this is actually why the Oscars were won."

Movie centers on one soldier who can't get enough of that drug - Staff Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner), who breezes into the Bravo Company bomb squad (which seems to be just three men, James, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) as they're counting down 28 days to rotation. He replaces their last Staff Sergeant (Guy Pearce) who died in a bomb blast (big surprise!).<br/><br/>And I cannot relate to this jerkoff at all. Or what drives him to relish the sordid, edge-of-death life he embraces like heroin. But he is the film's hero. Not ""anti-hero,"" not villain, not protagonist - ""Hero."" He is not portrayed as unbalanced or obsessed - even though he keeps a ""hurt locker,"" a box full of components from the bombs he has defused; and though an injured Eldridge lambastes him for being an adrenalin junkie, it slides off him like bullets slide off Rambo.<br/><br/>You gotta be a special kind of crazy to be a soldier in the first place. So though there are numerous tension-filled vignettes, there's no substance to the tension when we back away to look at the large picture. Why are you in Iraq in the first place? This question is completely ignored in HURT LOCKER. It is not political in the least - and that is another of its failings. There should be a reason for why these men are here. As we know, George Idiot Bush HAD no legitimate reason to place American sons and daughters at Death's door.<br/><br/>Eldridge very correctly laments, ""If you're here in Iraq, you're dead.""<br/><br/>Any time the movie's tension flags, I keep going back to the same refrain: Why are you in Iraq? At many points, it looks like the muscled Amerikans are actually protecting Iraqi civilians from IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) or bombs planted amongst civilian villages - but we are never shown extra-legal Amerikan mercenary companies like Blackwater (renamed Xe), whose CEO, Eric Prince, blatantly admitted to holy crusades and private vendettas to kill Iraqis at the behest of his neo-con, Christian leader, George W. Bush.<br/><br/>And we know for a fact that real soldiers watching this movie would not be lamenting the tragedy and brutality of the Iraqi boy being mutilated or the villager strapped with a bomb pleading with the Americans to save him - we know that many soldiers will be thrilling to these deaths, brought about by their very intrusion into that country. It's Viet Nam all over again. The bigotry displayed by the soldiers in the film is simply mirroring the bigotry of the soldiers on the ground - so why is Bigelow trying to fool us into thinking these soldiers care for the downtrodden people of that country? While the hypocritical American government bullshits its citizens that its military presence is needed in Iraq to quell the terrorism against the Iraqi people, they neglect to inform those citizens (whose American taxes are paying to protect Iraqis, by the way) that the American military presence in Iraq is CAUSING said terrorism...<br/><br/>The cameos are distracting. They are too short and only serve to take us out of the film's ""realism."" Guy Pearce is the rugged Staff Sergeant at the movie's opening who buys the farm. Then David Morse puts in a hilarious cameo as an officer wildly impressed with James's stupidity/ bravado in deactivating a carload of bombs without wearing his puffy bomb-suit, ""You're a wild man! A wild man!"" And Ralph Fiennes suddenly appears as a Brit agent in the desert. As soon as I feel it would be cool to be firing big guns alongside the buffed Mr. Fiennes, the film loses its focus; that should be the LAST thing on our minds. And his sniper scenes are just way too kewl. Get me the hell outa here before I just have to touch his biceps! <br/><br/>Guys who play soldiers in war movies must be akin to white guys playing Apaches in those 1950s racist American westerns. How can a person who chose an artistic profession like acting ever convey the parochial mind-set of a person who chose a profession as a sucker - I mean, soldier? In the end, we're looking at an artist's rendering of being a close-minded, death-wishing, authoritarian, weak-minded adrenaline junkie.<br/><br/>James goes back home - cannot handle it - introspects to his infant son, ""You love everything right now... As you get older, you find less and less things to love. Until, when you're my age, maybe there's only two things left to love. Or one."" Final scene sees James striding into another bomb situation with his puffy suit on, the text blaring its message of doomed heroism: ""Days left in Delta Force rotation: 365.""<br/><br/>And that is why this movie... uh, bombs?..."

","So I watched 2009's best picture winner The Hurt Locker, well was it good, well yeah. Was it truly the best movie of last year, well of the ones I have see I would give that nod personally to the surprisingly good district 9, but this movie was pretty damn good. I reviewed Jeremy Renner in ""Neo Ned"" in which he gave an incredible performance, and though the acting isn't as good on his part here he does a great job. Katheryn Bigelow, does a really good job of bringing us into the world of someone in the grips of war in a very dangerous , very adrenaline related, profession, of bomb defuser dude. I liked the cameos by Lost's Evangeline Lily, and one of my personal favorites Ralph Fiennes (watch in bruge or red dragon if you haven't already).

","My hubby and I saw this movie at last year's Cannes Film Festival and didn't really think too much of it at the time. When the Academy screeners came out we watched it again and wondered how it could possibly get an Oscar nod. Such an unremarkable film. Please don't get me wrong, this is a good film, just not remarkable. <br/><br/>I guess this raises the question: if you're a woman director and have a famous ex or dad, will the Academy treat you preferentially? I'm thinking back to Lost in Translation, another not-remarkable movie.<br/><br/>I know that the Academy can be a bit off with certain projects that have large promotional campaigns or have high level connections, but other than the obvious connect to James Cameron, we just can't figure this one out."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","3","3 June 2011"," When war gets to be a drug.
","To be honest, it took a while for this movie to really start off. I was getting fed up and tired with the movie its shaky cam and sudden zooms. A movie making style that is really starting to get overused and old. It's a technique mostly used to place you right into the action and madness of things but this movie did it almost non-stop. The wasn't really a clear story and I wasn't too taken by any of the characters but the movie reaches a certain point that you accept that this is not an average everyday war movie but one that's unique and truly original with its approach.<br/><br/>This is probably the key for watching this movie; just take it for what it is and don't try to compare it to anything else. When doing so, you'll be taken by this movie and get sucked in with its almost constant tension. It makes this movie also work really well as a war movie.<br/><br/>The movie almost constantly balances between a realistic feeling anti-war movie and one that is made more for entertainment and with some real action in it. This approach is what makes this movie an unique watch. Just like it was quite refreshing that the movie wasn't really following a story, which you can call lazy writing and film-making but it actually in the long run only adds to the movie its realistic and raw feeling.<br/><br/>I don't think many people knew how to take this movie at the time and I bet the studio also had a hard time marketing it in the right way and toward the right audience. It's the reason why ""The Hurt Locker"" never became an hit at the box offices but once it started to get more and more recognition and started to receive some big awards, the movie suddenly became much more popular and one of the front runners at the 2010 Academy Awards. It was the battle of the exes, with Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron as the two favorites to win all of the big Oscar's. It was eventually Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" that beat James Cameron's ""Avatar"". The $11,000,000 one beating out the $237,000,000 costing one and Bigelow became the first female to receive the best directing Oscar.<br/><br/>And to be honest, I never have been a fan of Kathryn Bigelow's directing and movies. This movie came pretty much out of nowhere from her, since nothing in the past indicated that she would ever directed a multiple Oscar winning production. You could say that 7 Oscar's, which is pretty much for any movie, was a bit too much credit for this movie but you can't really hold that against the actual movie. It doesn't make it any less of a solid one.<br/><br/>I also definitely won't overpraise it though. The movie is still really too flawed for that. I still couldn't really get into any of the characters and the movie still felt like a distant one, despite all of the attempts to place you right into the middle of things with its camera-work and directing approach. So you could say that the movie is slightly lacking on all of the emotional levels, while technically the movie still does about everything right, which still ensures you'll eventually start to get sucked in by the movie.<br/><br/>It also truly helps that the movie features an original concept. It focuses on a small elite army bomb squad unit, who get send out to defuse bombs in all forms and shapes, during the latest Iraqi war, constantly putting their lives on danger, also often because of their own doings. It shows how war can be a drug to some and how some people will go to the extreme to get their adrenaline fix. It does a really good job at capturing the essence and sense of a modern war.<br/><br/>A great but above all- unique and original movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"youthguy5","6","0","2","26 May 2011"," Good stuff but missing some crucial elements
","Hurt Locker is a film about the struggle of war, families, the lives of soldiers, love of country, and courage. It succeeds on many levels. First, there were many well crafted actions scenes - from the desert standoff to the guys with the bomb strapped to his body to the disarming of serious ammunition. Many times I caught myself saying, ""No way!"" Secondly, I liked many of the variety of camera shots. The editor included lots of gun scope shots with documentary-type shots and creative shots like the close-up of the water puddle reflecting the soldiers image upside down. The camera made you feel a part of the story. Lastly, I felt the casting, lighting, and setting was all very appropriate. All of these contributed to ""the bringing in"" of the viewer.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the filmed struggled in two major areas. First, there was character development. Who are these men? What are their stories? How did they end up? These are all hanging questions to the viewer. Secondly, the film struggled with plot and storyline. Hurt Locker had many gutsy scenes of courage during war but the storyline surrounding these spurts of action was bland. The film seemed to drag on at many points with unproductive, meaningless silence.<br/><br/>In all, the film made bold steps of inviting viewers into the tragedy of war. This is an important and crucial step to the success of this film."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Seargent Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) is a soldier in Bravo Company, a unit operating on the outskirts of Baghdad, engaging in front line combat. There's a new recruit to his unit in the shape of bomb disposal expert Seargent First Class Will James (Jeremy Renner), a rawhide redneck with a reckless attitude and approach to his work that is at odds with Sanborn's more professional approach. As they go about their duty, dodging gunfire and roadside bombs, the two men engage in a tense power struggle and form an edgy friendship in the chaos and uncertainty of war that tests them to the very limit.<br/><br/>With troops (British and American) still operating in the Middle East, the war is always going to be a relevant subject matter for filmic content. Katherine Bigelow's very well received Iraq based action film attempts to provide a first hand perspective into events, not quite in a hand held camera sense but something very similar to it. While it's won many over and even won some awards, for me, as with many films with such praise, it was decidedly hit and miss.<br/><br/>While a film might be made to feel very authentic and feel very real, it can never seem to fully separate from Hollywood conventions and always feature some sort of genre cliché or feeling of being staged. That, in spite of everything, was the feel with The Hurt Locker. While it's undoubtedly very well made and seat edgedly tense in parts, for fundamentally succeeding where it set out to, it somehow fails to come off as unmissable, feeling slow and dragging as a story, along with, as I said, not really coming off as what you're seeing is happening right in front of you. It's done very Full Metal Jacket style, though lacking that film's unforgettable characters and sense of soul being lost in the heat of war. Carrying the film in the two lead roles, Renner and Mackie play off each other in their respective parts, each the Yin to the other's Yang and tough, believable characters. They have notable support in the shape of Guy Pearce, Raplh Fiennes and David Morse, all decent enough in far more minor roles.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is certainly well worth seeing, and maybe for some it will accurately bring the horror and exhilaration of war to life, but for me it couldn't quite separate itself from the conventions of Hollywood enough. ***"
"Lejink","6","0","3","28 March 2011"," Same stuff, different war...
","Unremittingly tough and bleak modern-day war movie, heavily decorated at the Oscars. War isn't my favourite movie-subject and to really strike home with me, such a movie has to demonstrate either extra originality or emotional power to really resonate with me.<br/><br/>Well-made and acted as it is ""The Hurt Locker"" didn't accomplish either with me. I certainly commend director Bigelow and her writing and production team for taking an uncomfortable subject and addressing it so honestly, but the premises that the war does terrible things to people, physically and psychologically (in that order), throws together unfamiliar comrades in arms and of course involves almost inconceivable brutality and violence are hardly new.<br/><br/>It is of course harrowing to see Iraqi citizens coerced into becoming living bombs or even dead bombs and it is natural t witness the de-sensitising of the sensibilities of the three-man American UXB team, confronting these situations day-in day-out, with no human way to release the complex emotions of fear, disgust and at times callousness they experience in going about what is after all their jobs. The three men here all react in different ways, in itself creating tensions within the group and not surprisingly leading them into deadly danger from time to time.<br/><br/>It's all very difficult but of course important for viewers to watch. The acting is as is absolutely necessary grounded in hyper-reality with a proliferation of hand-held camera shots and pan-outs to the usually dumb crowd of what may or may not be innocent spectators only adding to the tension bordering on paranoia that the soldiers experience every day.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the superstar cameos of the likes of Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes as their celebrity detracted from the veracity of the other characters in the film. There's little pretence at a linear narrative other than the countdown of the days of duty remaining on the roster of the team, and these probably not unisolated dramatic events which overtake them periodically and they have to react to in such a way as to stay alive, in one piece and retain their sanity.<br/><br/>It was enthralling to watch, in particular the recreation of the devastating effects of an explosion, lifting people off the ground in super-slow motion but the whole just didn't get under my skin enough.<br/><br/>There have been many better war films than this which didn't win Oscars."
"ccncgc34","8","0","2","5 February 2011"," Well Executed
","The Hurt Locker is a movie about a bomb clearing team in the final days of their tour of duty. It lays bare the actuality of the Iraqi war and how the tension of living with the knowledge that you could die at any time wears on the soldiers. The title is a good metaphor for the theme of the film which is how the pain and craziness of the war is locked within the soldier. It can't be shared with the average person because they wouldn't understand and when it is shared with their combat brothers - it is hidden quickly. Quite frankly, I was surprised that at the intensity of the movie and how honest it was about human nature. Jeremy Renner (Sgt. James) played his role extremely well. He took the emotions of the character and made them apparent without being overt. He used body and facial cues more than verbal dialogue. As a viewer, I could see that he was on the edge of madness but was trying to maintain his sanity and do the job at hand. There is a depth of emotion that goes unsaid but is there to be absorbed. The lack of a complicated or overly loud soundtrack was a perfect complement to the film. It left the actions and words to speak for themselves and boosted the feeling of isolation created around the soldiers. There are some off camera sounds that, due to the already tension filled scenes, elevate the feeling of fear and nervous energy. Because these times are shot from the subjective point of view, it makes the view feel like they are there. The editor did an excellent job of keeping the documentary ""being there"" feeling through the balancing of subjective and objective points of view and the flash shots. There are good transitions between scenes based on the emotional impact they have such as the fade out and fade in. Slow motion is also used well in the film to help the viewer to feel the blast impact on the people and not just the visual impact. In all, I felt that the movie was well acted and presented. The actors brought depth to the characters that had the potential to be one dimensional. It is dramatically fitting to the theme of the movie with a editing, visual and audio that does not detract, but enhances, the intensity and suspense."

","Certainly a test for a good movie is if you leave the cinema yearning for a sequel, a prequel or something similar. Another test is the pp-test. And another how soon you want see the movie again. The Hurt Locker did not do it for me! It passed none of these test. I did not yearn for something more, I did not pause the movie when I went for a pp and I don't think I intend to see the movie again.<br/><br/>It is not a bad movie, though. The part the team were pinned down by a sniper, was good, perhaps the one and only reason why I would watch the movie again, but not too soon, and only that part. So were the continuity, the story-line and the special effects. It portrayed a part of the history of the Iraq-war well. But that's it. <br/><br/>If you like war-movies, go see it. You won't regret it. But don't watch it expecting something extra-ordinary or spectacular. You'll be disappointed. As I was.<br/><br/>For me, the Oscars this movie received made a serious dent in the credibility of the Oscars as a whole. I cannot help to compare The Hurt Locker with Avatar. Avatar had greatness in it, The Hurt Locker not. Avatar should end on the list of best movies of the decade, The Hurt Locker not."

The technicians of the bomb squad volunteers to save lives by doing the most dangerous job in the world. The EOD searches for roadside bombs on the streets to disarm them. They have a mission to protect and save, but it;s not easy. Having Sgt. James on the unit makes you not wanting to leave the screen. He was a good actor in this movie; if it wasn't for him playing that role the movie may not have been as good. Like when he went to the parked car that had a bomb in it and every body was saying wait until the bomb squad come not only did he obey them he took off some of his protective gear; he said, ""he wanted to be comfortable."" I thought that was awesome, well produced film.<br/><br/>When James came with them they only had a month or so left in Iraq, although James was replacing Sgt.

James acted as if death doesn't apply to him, Sanborn and Eldridge tries to control their wild new leader, the fellow squad members, including Sgt. JT Sanborn and SPC Owen Eldridge just want to survive the few days of duty they have left in Iraq.<br/><br/>The way the lighting and angles were constantly changing with the every scene made the movie interesting. The sounds of the explosions were so intense; it was like I was right there. When Sanborn and James witness a man with a cell phone they was yelling at him to drop the phone it was bright outside, when the bomb went off it got dark like a grayish black color and noise was loud.<br/><br/>Hurt Locker was one of the best war movies I have seen in a long time, probably the best ever, if you have not seen it; it;s a must see film."

The Hurt Locker is a deeply tragic, deeply thoughtful, deeply truthful war film, that really holds you glued to the screen and make you feel hatred the war. All the actors, Renner, Mackie, Feines, Morse do their job and you feel this is what it is like in the war. There's nothing funny, sweet or sterile in war. Sweat, blood, deaths, bullets, explosives - all this makes a war, and Mrs. Bigelow shows that really well. She managed to touch the strings that really ache, and you understand that war is awful."

But understandable, and as always i will not bore you with entire plot of the movie spooned out till the bodem.<br/><br/>OK that being said lets take a nice look at this movies, like i always say in every review i wrote here. Movies are like music, some love to rock and roll other like to hear Beethoven. So to get this two camped ""this movie sucks"" ""this movie rocks"" stuff out of the way i tend to be objective.<br/><br/>Characters Well, when the movie started is saw Pierce and David on the cover. So i had already a ""rubbing my hands this is going to be good"" mood. The beginning was really spectacular. A good explosion, and i saw Pierce fall in the field. From there one my mood was ""Mmmm this is not a good start the cover with the cast is pretty misleading"" The new Sergeant comes in, and sorry to say he looks like a rookie. No offense but to me it seemed like a mishap in casting. But as the movie prolonged he did actually a pretty good job! It is pretty obvious he needs his adrenaline fix and thats pretty cool and all. But it does not fit in war at all. Unresponseable behavior and putting his men at risk is just pretty stupid (story wise) as i was expecting a realistic image of how a team like that would goto work in real life.<br/><br/>The science fiction was disturbing.<br/><br/>Then before you know it your caught in a movie that has allot of science fiction. You see him pull detonation chord and a nice circle of ARMED bombs around him emerge. He simply cuts the detonators and presto everybody can feel relieved again. This movie lacks believability it is not so surprising that this is Mr Camerons ex wife, it totally shows in this movie. I was waiting for the terminators to pop into screen at anytime (joke) Then he goes AWOL, and gets back without any penalty and such. He simply walks back into base without any consequences. Now i am not a soldier and maybe OK given your in war not smart/needed to fire a good Sergeant. But it did not make sense, i was hoping for a scene were he got like a short jail time as penalty that would have added a consequence to his mental state of mind.<br/><br/>But no such thing, there huge holes in movie. Then the bombs there ALL the same, and there all RIGGED to be disarmed by a infant. OK folks its movie but heeij do we not like to be sitting on the tip of our chairs with the excitement of ""CAN HE DO IT! WHAT WIRE TO CUT !! COMMON MAKE A CHOICE!"" that adds to the experience. Here it is more like ""Ok he walks to the bomb, and cuts the detonators away done"" Conclusion I give it a 6, this is because the shots are pretty nicely done. It has that typical war zone look to it, the place were it is shot is convincing enough. And the explosion (not so many) are pretty well done.<br/><br/>But if you are looking for a realistic movie, for sure let this one slide. The cover is misleading David and Pierce have like 10min in the entire movie. That was pretty disappointing, i do not care if this was a movie made by a female or male...<br/><br/>My love is for movies that entertain me regardless gender. This one is with a 6 a OK movie if you are bored and just in for a slow paced action movie.<br/><br/>This could have been better...that is all."

He disobeys orders, which he would have been court marshalled for that, but not so in the film.<br/><br/>The movie is supposed to have lots of suspense, which I didn't think it did.

","I friends i don't know what critics like about this movie. its just a story of about soldiers set up in Iraq going to a field(not actually a war-field) to defuse bombs & the problem they face during defusing it. I think concept of a movie is great but story line & implementation is a weak link in it. the soldiers in this movie seem to be the real one. Its shows what soldiers feel when he is in danger zone. I actually like the scene when they says that I don't know will we return tonight or die & the dialogue when they keep on counting the number of days left I didn't like a lot about this movie except blasting scenes, nothing is good in it. There's no fun in this movie at all. for me its an average movie. I rated this movie 5 because in 2-3 place i got goose bums. Its not worth a movie as it is said to me. i think Inglorious bastards is far a nice movie than this. but this movie doesn't deal a lot. Not as promising as its seems to be."

","Academy award winner for movie? Not. At a stretch, maybe academy award winner for documentary, which it had more of a feel of. I wasn't really sure of all the reasons that I felt that the movie did not live up to its hype and awards. The more I read the review of veterans and those in the military I understand a big part of it. Though suspenseful to a point, the movie seemed totally unbelievable as far as the protocol and procedures in military life. I have not served in the military but I have seen enough movies to know how totally unrealistic it was. Watching Jeremy Renner was like watching an old ego driven sheriff in the old west telling his deputies to stand back while he takes care of the bad guys. I envisioned him sticking his thumbs into his belt loops, pulls up his britches saying ""Yep, y'all just stand back, I've got it"" and walks down the street to meet the baddie.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed Jeremy Renner's acting as he brought his character to life but not Academy award worthy. At the same time, do we really think he'd be riding his 'friend' like a bucking bronco and staring down a careening taxicab coming right at him? He was just an unbelievable character, in a movie with a weak plot (was there a plot?) with an inevitable ending. Walk, disarm, fight, repeat, ad nauseam. The supporting staff did their job well given what they had to work with.<br/><br/>Overall, I did find the movie interesting as far as the rover, the bomb suit and the special effects of the inevitable blasts. I'm glad that I only got the movie from the $1 rental machine. The movie was okay. Not great, not awful."

However, other war films such as platoon made a much better job analyzing this subject making the hurt locker look ridiculous.<br/><br/>Despite the negative things i mentioned before the movie has a smart and interesting plot, the cinematography is quite impressive but a bit confusing and as far as acting, Jeremy Renner(the lead actor) gave a powerful performance worthy of an academy award .<br/><br/>To sum up, the hurt locker is a movie worth renting but definitely not worth buying and Avatar should have won best picture."

","The Hurt Locker is a strange beast indeed. At times it's a genuinely gripping drama - and Jeremy Renner is superb in the lead role - but Oscar material? I don't think so.<br/><br/>It's really only when the film concludes do you realise that there's a complete lack of any narrative drive to hold it all together - it's just a collection of drawn-out episodes which really don't amount to much. And despite the veneer of realism there are just too many inaccuracies and frankly ridiculous scenes included, most of which have been highlighted by other reviewers. The sniper scene in particular is just farcical! Having soaked up the hype regarding this film, and witnessed the Oscar feeding frenzy, I was ultimately a little disappointed with what is merely a better-than-average action flick."

","I am very surprised that THE HURT LOCKER won an Academy Award for best picture, which just goes to show, I guess, that I have too much faith in the system! Although this film does manage to create a genuine feeling of suspense and stress in the viewer, repeatedly brought along to participate in the defusing of massively destructive bombs, that is where the value of this depiction of war ends. I appreciate that Bigelow wanted to show what a tough job the grunts on the ground have, while steering clear of overt critiques of this particularly vexed context, an illegal war and occupation which themselves generated the very danger against which soldiers find the need to defend themselves. However, her good intentions aside, I feel that she ended by doing a disservice to the soldiers.<br/><br/>The main protagonist is some sort of Evil Knieval thrill seeker, of questionable sexual orientation--he has no attraction for his wife and tries to ""ride"" one of his fellow soldiers as a bucking bronco of sorts--I am sorry, but the selection of this character as representative is unfair to the poor slobs who really carry out this dreadful task.<br/><br/>The film has no focus, development or direction, and ends by trying to pretend that instead of being about war in general, or the Iraq occupation in particular, this was really about one sick dude on a serious suicide mission. I won't add to what has been said about the implausibilities, the shaky camera, etc. All in all, this just seems to me like an amateur effort at film-making, sustained by its sole virtue: the ability to scare the pants off the viewer brought in virtual contact with IEDs for the very first time."

I mean, I get it,I get that ""war is a drug"" and makes you less human, but even that type of characters have a soul, they interest you and you wanna know how they end. But even the principal character is completely hollow. If there was a ""Hurt Locker 2"" following the life of Jeremy Renner's character I wouldn't watch it.

","For the most part, Oscars awards are not correlated with best film of the year  Gladiator, Titanic, and Crash should not even have been nominated, let alone win the Best Picture. Well, as it turns out, I did not see Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker, until after it won the Best Picture. During the ceremony, I routed for the film; I found James Cameroon's Avatar (the other main contender) to be undeserving of the award. Even without seeing film, I rationalized that The Hurt Locker-- an Independent, critically acclaim film – would be far more deserving winner than the special effects extravaganza. <br/><br/>Well, after watching the film, I learn a valuable lesson: to not endorse/champion an unseen film. Cameroon did a better film than his ex- wife. Action wise, Bigelow matches Cameroon; in fact, she manages to out due Cameroon's specialty. Unlike the blue alien's action sequences, there is intensity and unpredictability in the Iraq War's action sequences. There is a more visceral reaction in the bombing sequences than in any of the dragons and mecha scenes. Judging solely on action, The Hurt Locker succeeds as an action film. <br/><br/>Aside from some of the minor characters, there is solid acting in the award winner, unlike the box office record holder. There is not as much outrageous and corny acting, as compared to Cameroon's film. Jeremy Ratner could act and be the lead of a film—something that Sam Worthington has proved in his short Hollywood career. Avatar does have some notable actors and actresses, but they are hinder by the poor dialogue. Although far from being perfect (there are excreting conversations), it is not hinder by its dialogue. <br/><br/>If the acting, dialogue, and actions sequences are better than Avatar, how could it be an inferior film? The story is a complete mess  There are many scenes and many interactions that do not appear to belong in the same film. The film's message is not only convey in a blunt manner, it is also done in a poor manner. Yes, Avatar is Pocahontas with aliens – but it does not hamper the film's goal: to be a popcorn spectacle. The Hurt Locker feels like two films competing with each other. On one end, there is the well done action film; on the other end, there is the poorly done drama. For every exhilarating action scene, there is a dull conversation or an absurd plot development. <br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a decent action film, but nowhere near being a classic or Best Picture winner. It should not have the won the award. It does not mean that Avatar should have been granted the award; instead, the award should have gone to more deserving films, such as Inglorious Baterds (awaits the backlash)."
"agsconnolly","5","0","2","16 June 2010"," The Dramatic But Ultimately Confusing Locker
","Like most people, I chose to watch The Hurt Locker off the back of its pretty sizeable hype and because of the awards the film was showered with in early 2010. To be honest, I was expecting it to be pretty hard-going, gritty, shaky-camera-and-battle-scene-heavy stuff, not to mention dripping in political posturing. However, the film is not really any of these things and, for several reasons, is actually very average.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice about The Hurt Locker is that it doesn't actually have a recognisable story. I'm sure this is deliberate to a degree, but it is clear that failed attempts have been made to involve the viewer in the characters. Some fairly tepid dialogue and run-of-the-mill-TV-drama performances contribute greatly to this, and give the film a feel of something less than an award-winner. In fact, some of the tense and dramatic scenes in the film are very well engineered and look great – but the fact I didn't care much about the characters involved made the outcome of these sequences less important.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have noted that the film jumps around from dead-end storyline to dead-end storyline with no explanation. This is true. There is absolutely no reason for most of the diversions the film takes, and to be honest they're not even that interesting, both due to the lack of character development and their hackneyed tone. For example, a selection of scenes towards the end of the film when one of the main characters returns home to find he cannot connect with everyday life as he once did is both utterly pointless and completely unoriginal as a plot device and social message.<br/><br/>Overall, it is pretty obvious why this film has been rated highest on IMDb by the younger demographic. There is a good amount of action and plenty of visual drama for those less likely to be concerned with plot holes and phoned-in performances. For those of us who are more discerning however, this film lacks an awful lot and it is hard to see how it can have won the Oscar for Best Picture. Sound and editing? Fine. Screenplay? That's pushing it. Direction? Questionable at best. Best Picture? Definitely not.<br/><br/>That said, all of the above were better than in Avatar, which is possibly why The Hurt Locker did win. Still, Kathryn Bigelow must have some friends in high places to have achieved what she did with this, a fairly routine yet oddly disjointed effort."

","Those who have experienced the terrors of the War in Iraq and Afghanistan will be greatly offended by the unrealistic scenarios depicted in ""The Hurt Locker"". As much as I respect the torture and torment they had endured overseas, I think they took this movie way too seriously by saying it's unrealistic and inaccurate and I have to disagree with them to some degree. The anti-war sentiments depicted in this movie is exhibited in a delicate matter. For example taken from the quote by journalist Chris Hedges where he mentions that the desire for fighting is very competitive and addictive, thus in his words ""war is a drug."" In a way his words prove a point being that near the end of the movie when Sgt. William James goes back to the warzone in Iraq, because of his restlessness of settling down in his American home with civilians who don't know jack of what's going on in that area. <br/><br/>From watching documentary's and newsreels, only handful return to the Middle East due to this self-proclaimed needy obsession. The go back for the goodness of their people, the adrenaline rush and the salaries they make. <br/><br/>Granted it's nowhere close to perfect and that it shouldn't have been nominated for an Oscar (let alone Best Director for Katheryn Bigelow), the actors were dressed and destined to act like seasoned veterans, but instead they ended up performing implausible and dumbfounded tasks that soldiers would never have been permitted to do. Who in their right mind would attempt to achieve something deadly with nobody at their side? I mean come on, I may have never fought in combat, but trying to be a one-man hero in deadly situations is just foolhardy to put it bluntly. <br/><br/>It's a bit of hyperbole to just completely condemn the movie by observing the flaws and faux pas (which come in abundance), but it's not a complete fallacy compared to this self-described ""hidden enemy"" they like to talk about, and the use of weapons too (IED's). Split-second strategies are a common trend in the Middle East, and it all strings in the matter of life, death or imprisonment for friends and enemies alike. Suicide bombs for children and casual civilian-shield targeting happened there and that's just the icing on the cake. Terrorists have an unorthodox way to define their moral values. For a more accurate viewing of soldiers at war, ""Generation Kill"" is the one to watch. But still, the heart and the effort in making ""The Hurt Locker"" should be praised."

","Sergeant William James is brought in as the new leader of a bomb squad in Iraq but his strange personality and devil-may-care attitude don't really mesh with the rest of his unit.<br/><br/>There are many things I enjoyed about The Hurt Locker. The acting was pretty good all around, especially Jeremy Renner. It was shot very well and the sets really made you feel like you were actually in the Iraq war. The first half hour or so was very good and was truly interested as to where they were going with it. Where they went with however, that wasn't so great. Right around the overly long, poorly explained sniping scene my interest began to shrink and shrink up until the end, which I enjoyed. I also enjoyed that no real side was taken because I am so sick of war movies trying to tell the audience how they should feel about a war.<br/><br/>I found a good majority of The Hurt Locker to be very boring, confusing and a bit unrealistic. There actually weren't that many bomb defusing scenes and I felt that those were by far the most exciting of the movie. The scene where his psychologist dies was extremely transparent as well. It was obvious they were trying to say that he was far too soft to be in the military. He spouts touchy feely psychobabble the entire movie and then he gets blown up because he is too trusting/nice. Not to mention he probably wouldn't be allowed to just wander around during a mission like that. Not cutting edge stuff. <br/><br/>The entire section with the little kid was unnecessary and dull. He goes into town finds the family, questions them, and just waltzes back into the base; Come On. Also, I may have been confused but didn't the kid set up shop inside an American Military base because that doesn't seem right to me. <br/><br/>I personally believe that The Hurt Locker won the Best Picture Oscar and was so highly publicized for 2 reasons. <br/><br/>One, It was about the Iraq war and no one wants to say it is bad. I appreciate what the soldiers are doing too, but that doesn't make the movie any better. <br/><br/>Second, It was directed by a woman, and she is James Cameron's ex-wife. The Academy finally had a woman to hand the Best Director Oscar to and we know how much they love James Cameron. <br/><br/>So, The Hurt Locker is nothing near a classic but it's certainly worth a look."

However, the hopelessly unrealistic military conditions really let it down - buy, hey, it's only a film. Given the poor script (terrible in places) the acting is passable. The direction isn't bad but hardly worthy of an Oscar (yes, I know, she's a woman and that seems to be given undue importance). It feels like she didn't really have a clear idea of what sort of film she was making.

First let me say, yes, the film requires considerable suspension of disbelief and I don't blame any war veteran from not being able to do this--I don't know that I would be able to either. The director could have done more research and she should have. But this film is not a documentary. And no, it is not objective. I respect the film for its phenomenal acting, cinematography, and yes, direction. Despite its long and often disjointed scenes, I felt considerable suspense for most of the film. I was successfully drawn in. I could see how it would be easy to find the film intolerable if I were a veteran. I could also see how it would be easy to find hundreds or thousands of films about FBI agents intolerable because surely the films would miss so many details describing what this honorable profession is like. The film was made for people like me, people who, despite watching numerous four-star war movies, are truly oblivious to the nature of war. I've never been shot at. I've never held a gun.

The best part about this film was that while it was not overtly judgmental about the ills of war (like many other movies) the reality of war and its impact on the people, soldiers etc is enough to send out a very strong anti-war message. Superbly done.<br/><br/>The characters of the three protagonists played by Renner, Geraghty and Mackie are well etched. While sympathy is not sought for these characters, one cannot but feel it. That is this movie's great strength - it succeeds where many have failed. It doesn't try to make a statement - it just leaves you with all the key questions."

The movie is played by the second class Actors which the most proportions go to the two main characters, Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie. Nothing is special on their performances. The other Cast members are Brian Geraghthy, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and many more. The story itself doesn't contain main plot. The only thing that I appreciate in thiz movie is how they make the action scenes. Most war movies rely on big battle scenes with ""Big Boom Bang"", exactly what we have seen in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). But thiz movie uses what I called ""The Horror Formula"". The scenes try to create the tension by putting nice built waiting moments into its action scenes. Some scenes successfully pace our adrenaline. The movie is directed by Kathryn Bigelow who previously directed ""Point Break"" (1991) and ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" (2002). In overall, it is not a great warfare movie ever made, if we compare to the legendary war movies like ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) or ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987).

From the ten nominees for BP there must be another film such as precious, an education, or inglorious basterds that could win this award. but, taking into account that i haven't even seen the previously mentioned films i can say that if the competition was to be between Cameron and Bigelow there is no way to say that avatar was way too much exceeding THL because we have to remember that academy's best picture doesn't care about special effects, or the money invested on the film. what really matters is how the stories can be innovative, the way in which they can transmit a message.

I enjoyed The Hurt Locker---it had nothing to do with the script, which was decent---it had nothing to do with the acting, which was average---it had nothing to do with the direction, which was spotty at times---and it had nothing to do with the look of the film. I enjoyed this movie because it was one of the rare films that the idiot liberals did not condemn the military man. Sure it was not accurate on many accounts, but it at least portrayed the soldiers as men doing their jobs---that accounts for a lot with me. As an ex-military person, I despise the movies like: Jarhead, Courage Under Fire, Platoon (oh yeah, a drug abuser is the hero--right), and Apocalyse Now --- movies where soldiers are portrayed as head-cases, drug abusers, or worse in the eyes of a liberal society that has never ever served their country and sit behind those who served running their mouths about how bad the military is to this world."

In real life, he probably would have been court-martialed for his behavior, wreckless at times. And, that tells me that there was no military consultant to guide the story. There was one instance when Sgt James went out on his own, at night, looking for the suicide bomber that came close to the Green Zone (considered the safest place). This just doesn't happen. But, the Director knew we also wanted to be entertained and we were. Just take a look back, was it really this way? <br/><br/>This is not to take anything away from the brave men and women risking their lives in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but the feeling I have is not all the truth was told here.

I suppose if we didn't see Sgt James act the way he did, we would be looking at a documentary only. Good-bye Oscars (well, maybe for a documentary)<br/><br/>Now, if you wanted to say that Sgt James was a real person and this is his story, and this is how he acted, then fine, we're good with it. <br/><br/>In the beginning it is said War is a drug and for Sgt James it was. This was clear. But does the movie really want us to believe we have cowboys out there looking for another fix?

I am not saying that it is the most realistic movie that everybody says it is, but I do not think that making it a realistic war movie was what it wanted to do. I believe that the movie looked at war in a way that no other movie has done before, and that is what makes it so special. <br/><br/>A definite must see for anyone who is old enough. 8/10"

"Eumenides_0","6","0","4","16 February 2010"," Seeking Thrills in War
","In The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal explore war from a new perspective, imagining it as a drug and the soldiers as adrenaline addicts seeking thrills in their dangerous missions. Mind you, I didn't get this interpretation from watching this movie. A quote kindly explains that war is a drug at the beginning of the movie. Looking back, all my problems with this movie started here. You can't really trust a filmmaker who has so little faith in his viewer that she has to spell everything out for him in the first ten seconds.<br/><br/>My second complaint is that this movie fails at being the character study that it presumes to be. A study presupposes an analysis. The object of study is Sergeant William James (played by Jeremy Renner), a soldier freshly arrived in Iraq, whose mission is to diffuse bombs. James is always getting himself into needless dangers. Now a character study would try to explain why this man is obsessed with risking his life, in opposition to his colleagues, who want to get out of Iraq in one piece. It'd try to get into his mind or analyze him from several perspectives. It needn't give an explanation (I don't think anyone can truthfully explain why a man would be addicted to getting into danger), but it should do more than merely give the viewer a superficial portrayal of the character.<br/><br/>Compare James to Lawrence of Arabia (to talk of character studies in war), the most mysterious character in the history of cinema. David Lean analyzes him from every angle possible, basking in the contradictions of his personality, only to reach at the conclusion that Lawrence will always remain an enigma. But at least he tried to understand him.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker merely jumps from one scene to another. Boal's screenplay is very episodic. There is no story from A to B, like in other 2009 movies like Inglourious Basterds or Up. This is a good choice since it shows the hectic nature of James' existence in Iraq.<br/><br/>Renner gives a good performance. I discovered the actor in this movie and I'm sure he has a pretty good career ahead of him. He plays an everyman, with little heroism in him and a lot of familiarity; he's the sort of person you could know from school or the office. I think this quality was the most important thing he needed to capture in the performance of this man who doesn't know why he's addicted to danger.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty also contribute with fine performances as James' team colleagues. Mackie in particular stood out and I found myself enjoying his character a lot more than Renner's. James is a pretty unpleasant guy. How unpleasant? So unpleasant his colleagues contemplate blowing him up at one time.<br/><br/>There are also three short roles in the movie that deserve mention: Guy Pearce playing the Sergeant James comes to replace; Ralph Fiennes as a mercenary tracking down terrorists in the desert; and David Morse playing a Colonel fascinated with James' dumb bravery.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a strange movie: I didn't dislike it, but I finished it thinking I hadn't watched anything great or too memorable. Perhaps it's because it lacks a traditional narrative structure, but I just don't see a lot of content in it. Otherwise it's one of the best movies released in 2009: the cinematography was pretty great, one need only compare the contrast in colors between the Iraq scenes and the scenes with Jams back at home. The editing was pretty good. I've seen people complain about the use of hand-held cameras in the movie, how everything shakes in the movie and how annoying it is, but I actually found it quite steady most of the time and noticed that the scenes took their time to develop.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the use of silence in the movie. Marco Beltrami was nominated for an Oscar for his score, but it's so subtle I hardly noticed it at all. Instead most of the movie benefits from lack of music, and the silence only makes most of the scenes tenser.<br/><br/>Although it's not the best movie of 2009, I can see how this movie slowly made it to everyone's top lists and how it's getting all awards. Bigelow and Boal deserve a lot of praise for having tried to do something different."

","This film really breaks the mold while maintaining artistic integrity, and human dignity. It's a slice of war, like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but devoid of cliché. It's a war movie but with a human face, however veiled. In ""Platoon,"" the real feel of combat is portrayed. In ""Full Metal Jacket"" you get the dark side of youth in the military. In ""Apocalypse Now"" the genre took a new turn, yet maintained its integrity for an era. So much emotion and conflict packed into such a tight package is what makes this movie great.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","4","14 February 2010"," The Hurt Soldiers
","While Oren Moverman 'The Messenger' gives us the point of view of military messengers and the effect the war has had on them, Kathryn Bigelow's film shows us the perspective of a bomb technician in the middle of the war. 'The Hurt Locker' may be dramatic in parts but its strength is in the suspense and intensity of the situations created by the circumstances. The viewer is kept in constant suspense as to what's going to happen these people in the next moment. The atmosphere is almost always tense. The story moves at a go9od pace and remains constant up until the moment William decides to go solo to find Beckham's killers. From this point on, it takes a slight turn downwards but manages to pick up by the end. The sets look authentic and the camera-work is first-rate. Jeremy Renner does a fine job in carrying the film while actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce are wasted. Renner's William is an arrogant and stubborn soldier who is almost 'addicted' to war and yet he is human enough to be vulnerable. I was on the verge of avoiding this movie thinking it's just another one of those anti-Arab war movies that have nothing new to offer but 'The Hurt Locker' was more than I expected. There is no bad guy in this movie (except the obvious terrorists) but there is also no hero, which is usually the case in wars."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","0","4","13 February 2010"," Perhaps it is the focus and appraisal of the heroics of a US soldier which provides a more emotional and patriotic connection for American audiences that others may not share
","This film is set in Baghdad during the occupation of Iraq. Following the death of a bomb disposal specialist (Guy Pearce), a reckless defusing expert named William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in as a replacement. Will's neglect for protocol and disregard for his fellow soldiers makes him particularly difficult to work with. During his first task with his new company he insists on carrying out the job by himself, rather than using the defusing robot and he also purposely blocks the visibility of his fellow soldiers with a smoke grenade to cause a diversion. His odd behaviour leads the other members of the unit, such as Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), to question whether they want him risking their lives. They are forced to work together through a series of dangerous missions, regularly trying to come to terms with the random occurrence of death and the chaos on the streets of Iraq that cannot be contained.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, was due to be released straight to DVD in Australia before a distributor was able to grant it a cinema release. Much like the September 11 docudrama United 93, Bigelow's film is one that sacrifices the depth of its narrative to immerse and focus the audience in a claustrophobic space of endangerment. Working with a screenplay by Mark Boal, a journalist who attributes much of the film to his own observations in Baghdad, Bigelow was able to shot the film in Jordon with highly gritty and realistic visuals. The dizzying hand-held camera work does not make for attractive framing but its erratic nature expresses the almost overwhelming sense of danger faced in combat by US soldiers. It is through these suspicions by the troops, some of them justified, that this becomes a highly intense film at times. A moment where Will insists in staying behind to defuse a car bomb, while an Iraqi civilian continues to film the soldiers, is one of the early sequences that is impacting in its intensity and also because of the way it portrays risk as a form of adrenaline.<br/><br/>Yet beyond this notion of risk and one's immersion into the spontaneity of combat, the film's narrative lacks the depth, intellect and morality of modern war classics, such as Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line. This is not a film that ever seeks to explore the politics of the war, the role of religion or the minds of the insurgents. The persistence to focus primarily on bomb defusing for the duration of the film ensures that its episodic nature and reliance on climaxes becomes rather repetitive. After the second mission one has to question where the film is going and exactly what the point is. Perhaps this is reflective of the ongoing nature of war itself, or war as a drug the audience is told early on, but it makes for a less interesting narrative, given the attention to velocity rather than development. If the film had persisted with ethical questions, like when Sanborn considers blowing up Will, this might have been a much more thought-provoking film.<br/><br/>The final quarter of the film particularly wavers, with thinly veiled patriotism sinking in more obviously. Bigelow begins to view the character of Will with self-righteousness, having him try to track down the family of a little boy who he believes was used as a suicide bomber. Similarly, Will is abused by a fellow soldier he accidentally wounds in saving his life and he is ignored at home by his wife when he tries to tell her about a deadly combat experience. It is as though Bigelow feels the need to express how under-appreciated soldiers are in the risks that they take. Limiting the home scenes till the very end is also a missed opportunity to explore the disorientation and the isolation from the battlefield. Despite the weaknesses in the narrative and the minimal back-stories of the character, the performances are still impressive. Renner offers a natural performance, shifting between supreme confidence and utter frustration during his tasks. His arrogance is visible in his actions rather than through any smugness, which might have made him unlikeable. Anthony Mackie finely matches Renner's performance as Sanborn though, demonstrating his skepticism and frustration with credibility. It is a shame that the relationship between these two men is not as rounded as it could have been in the screenplay.<br/><br/>For much of the hype and the future accolades that The Hurt Locker is almost certain to receive, this is a strangely underwhelming and forgettable film. It immerses one into the tension and atmosphere of a war zone sufficiently, but the repetitive nature of this means the film is not as intellectually stimulating as one would like it to be. This is an action film, largely interested more in velocity rather than any deeper conclusions about the Iraq war. Perhaps it is the focus and appraisal of the heroics of a US soldier which provides a more emotional and patriotic connection for American audiences that others may not share. It might just be one of the reasons why this intense but hollow film almost failed to find a cinematic release in Australia."

","My partner and I have been viewing movies generated by Hollywood for the past few years following America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, and most of them have fallen short of creating the immediacy, the verisimilitude and the total belief that art is imitating reality. Not so with Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker,"" which steadily builds in believability, suspense and urgency.<br/><br/>The fact that three very well known actors appear in what are essentially cameo roles is surprising. The fact that all three immediately command the screen in just a few minutes is stunning.<br/><br/>""The Hurt Locker"" is a buddy movie with a maverick buddy, a soldier whose adrenalin throbs only when he is thrusting himself into dangers the average person would cringe from even thinking about---and yet he is helpless when it comes to functioning in domesticity.

"nightixu","7","0","4","30 January 2010"," Good iraq war action movie with a lot of goofs.
","Most movies about the Iraq war are mostly dramas. The thing about them is that they take themselves too seriously and contain loads of propaganda or ideology in it. So of course there are emotional or melodramatic dialogues between characters and their opinion about how war is wrong or that what they're doing is right. However, most people i'm sure are tired of that bullcrap.<br/><br/>This movie may just be the thing you need. Its plot is so thin and simple. It's about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team (EOD) in the US army Bravo Team consisting of the three main characters you'll be seeing throughout the whole movie. SFC James, sgt sandborn and sgt Eldridge. It depicts their experiences and the events they faced before their rotation in around 28 days. That's the whole plot but the movie is character driven therefore, what makes this movie a cut above the rest is its characters. Jeremy Renner is fantastic in this movie. I loved his performance in 28 weeks later and i loved it here. He's so charismatic and cool. <br/><br/>The interaction between them and the unstable relationship they build as a team is interesting. They don't just hate each other and then love each other. They hate each other and then you're not sure if they still do. The portrayal of the soldier's psyche as he goes on tour in iraq is great. They don't tell you much, rather they let you see for yourself. See that's the thing about this movie and the others, it's more action and talk less but it gets the message across better than those other propaganda movies which are chock full of dramatic dialogues.<br/><br/>The goofs are what bothered me throughout the movie; and there are A LOT. It may be nitpicking but if i think they should try to make it as real as possible. To make it believable? For example, the EOD team consisting of just three members. Where are their escorts? ATO's must be like medics because of their specialism in a skill that is highly needed. They're high value targets. Also, why are there civilian and animals near the IED? Where's the cordon? Are the soldiers jacking off? Oh and this ones i just cannot comprehend. The way SFC james just walks to the bomb without carrying his kit, checking for secondary devices and handling the bomb like a three year old handles his toys. Where is the SOP? Come on if its that easy, any grunt can be an ATO. Just snap a wire and its defused. You don't even know if its RCIED or keyless car entry system or if its motion sensitive.<br/><br/>The whole plot and events in the movie is very similar to the book by Major Chris Hunter ""Eight lives down"". The movie is good. Gets your blood pumping but makes you feel also for the soldiers and the civilians that suffer. Overall, this movie is a great war movie."
"arthera09","8","0","4","19 January 2010"," good movie, but over hyped
","The best thing about this movie was Jeremy Renner. The writing for the character was great and I really enjoyed the fact that it did not try to take sides in terms of the war and only tried to show why these men do what they do. To me a great central character is key to a film and without this I think this would have been just another action movie. People were claiming that this had some of the most intense action I was never overwhelmed as I was expecting. This may have been a product of hype, but the action served a purpose to showing why this character is who he is and what he experiences. Some of the scenes were played too long and were not that exciting for me. I think they should have put some facts on what the human body does when in one of those suits and the fact that they are all volunteers. I really love the supermarket scene at the end. I think the sniper scene in the middle was nothing special and there was a smarter way of showing the team coming together more related to defusing bombs. The scene felt out of place and broke up the movie right in the middle. Also I do not think the scene when all three of them go down the alley was in line with the character. I do not think he would have put them in danger no matter how much he was losing it. I know it was supposed to be a weak character moment as a consequence of sneaking out of the base to do nothing, but it did not fit with me. There is a lot of good about this movie. I honestly do not think it is an Oscar contender, but it still was one of the better movies I saw this year. People should still watch this movie, but I feel as if a lot of people will like the superficial aspects of the movie which are emphasized instead of the character."

"Turfseer","5","0","3","19 September 2009"," Lethal Weapon meets the Iraqi Insurgency
","After reading many posts about 'HL', I've come to the conclusion that members of Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squads in the military are professionals who do a tough job well. There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.<br/><br/>SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot—before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'—that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.<br/><br/>The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.<br/><br/>The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.<br/><br/>Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.<br/><br/>Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).<br/><br/>While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clichéd at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.<br/><br/>Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare."

","""War is a drug.""

It's Baghdad, 2004; we follow non linear incidents involving a three-man bomb-detonating unit. The protagonist, Staff Sergeant William James, is aptly named if you consider the pragmatic philosophy of the great American thinker and this soldier's fearless de-fusion of IUD's. It's as If the philosopher said that war exists, and explosive devices are its lifeblood, so get over fear and fight.<br/><br/>Along the way, soldier James also thinks of his wife and son and a young boy given up bloodily to the Iraqi insurgency. One soldier describes James as ""not very good with people, but a good warrior,"" summarizing a complicated man seemingly fearless facing the enemy. The buzz on Bigelow and writer Mark Boal is that the film is apolitical, yet no visceral story about war, such as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down, can separate itself from the idea that ""war is hell"" or as I opened this review, a drug. For James, it is a hell of his choosing and an addiction that doesn't separate him from his feelings for his fellow soldiers, his family, or even his unwitting enemy symbolized by the man who begs James to take off the suicide bombs locked on him so that he can live for his four children.<br/><br/>Bigelow's shots of the desert are dry, dusty, and vast. In one prolonged standoff with enemy in an abandoned house hundreds of feet away, she slowly traces points of view and bullet trajectories, as if all were performing a ballet with death. The individual deaths, undramatically executed by faceless snipers, are more harrowing than hordes dispatched at one time.<br/><br/>This war is no fun.

It's just a roller coaster of action packed scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. I was sweating out a lot of the scenes it this, and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. As far as war movies go this is the best, considering it has no message or anything. It's not like Platoon, where you learn something about war and society. But it is what it is and I liked it. Probably not for woman though. My wife got bored and went to the ladies room twice."

","Spoilers - I will talk about parts I did not like<br/><br/>Too much Hollywood - no soldier is going outside the fence in Iraq on a lark - if that really happened I would be amazed and I will take back the comment - no three man bomb squad is going to go after trigger guys and separate to clear buildings by themselves - just would not happen - they each tried to clear a 3- 4 story building? And of course a guy would be abducted and they would get him back in 10 minutes - happens all the time.<br/><br/>Take all the unrealistic junk out of the movie and there was enough tension and suspense to make this an excellent movie. I guess that Hollywood stuff makes it fun for non- military, but if you even spent a year in the military you would know that would just not happen. <br/><br/>Finally - do writers and directors only lift their Officer characters out of Stripes or Apocalypse Now? Could you please take some time to talk to real officers? - they are not all buffoons and sadists. Ignore any scene with officers in it - if you want to see the good and bad of officer leadership, watch Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>Actors were great and it just pains me to watch the unrealistic garbage when what these EOD guys actually do is amazing - the fact that they actually go back for multiple rotations is heroic enough with out adding the John Wayne/Jack Bauer stuff. So close and yet so far."
