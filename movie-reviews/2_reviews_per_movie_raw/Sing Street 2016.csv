","I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone"
"shobanchittuprolu","8","18","20","7 January 2017"," Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.
","Sing Street (2016): Films about people at school forming bands are well known for being 60% more lovable than any other sort, and this movie is no exception.Sing Street,directed by Irish Film maker John Carney,has already been nominated for 74th Golden Globe Awards but sadly it will lose it to La La Land.If not for La La Land,Sing Street has all the necessary emotions and qualities to win a best musical movie of 2016.Why am I boasting it up before the review?You will see..<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>SING STREET takes us back to 1980s Dublin seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy named Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who is looking for a break from a home strained by his parents' relationship and money troubles, while trying to adjust to his new inner-city public school where the kids are rough and the teachers are rougher. He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, Ã¼ber-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.In a sea of opportunities ahead of them, what does the future hold for a love like this?<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Music: Sing Street is brilliant mostly because of its music.Much of the original music by the band ""Sing Street"" was composed by 80s veteran composer Gary Clark,which really gives us some nostalgic 80's rocking music with meaningful lyrics.For every 5 minutes a song always plays and it played a brilliant part in the movie.""The Riddle of the Model"" is one of the best track from this movie.I loved the other tracks too.<br/><br/>2)Performances: Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is outstanding in his role and he surely has a bright future ahead.He surely is a Futurist:)When Conor gives an early Sing Street song called The Riddle of the Model to Raphina, he assures her: ""It's not about you. It's about another model I know."" Walsh-Peelo delivers the line with just the right mixture of shyness and teenage petulance.The other one I liked in this movie is Mark McKenna who played the role Eamon who has talent to play any kind of instrument.Lucy Boynton is lovely.Especially during the shoot of The Riddle of the Model,her expressions are marvelous.Jack Reynor as Brendon is very good in his role.<br/><br/>3)Screenplay and Direction: Sing Street has the most familiar plot for a musical drama but John Carney successfully made such a beautiful engaging drama with a perfect script.Sing Street is, in fact, a delightful coming-of-age tale that both celebrates young love and laments how quickly the fire of youth can be snuffed out. Director John Carney knows exactly how to mesh storytelling and music into his films.He is the next best after Damien Chazelle in directing a perfect musical picture.A great applause for Carney.<br/><br/>So,Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.One of the best musicals in recent times.<br/><br/>My rating 8/10"
"Jaymay","9","96","124","16 March 2016"," Against all odds, John Carney does it again
","I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.<br/><br/>My fears were unfounded.<br/><br/>SING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I'm close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes' films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.<br/><br/>Sing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor ""Cosmo"" Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the 'smart one,' pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he's quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.<br/><br/>You could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It's the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.<br/><br/>It's the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won't give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they're outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today's teenagers as well.<br/><br/>The movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I'm thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that's on par with the films I love so much as a kid."
"sammyboo21-999-252517","10","75","99","9 May 2016"," My Favorite movie of 2016 so far.
","The movie to beat this summer isn't a superhero movie.Its a movie about a teenager forming a band to try and impress a girl. What a wonderful and beautiful movie this. I was smiling and hugging myself throughout. So light and warm hearted and funny and yet deep and powerful. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. It is directed by the great John Carney who directed one of my favorite movies about music, Once. This is one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It stands with Say Anything, Stand By ME, Perks of Being a wallflower, The fault in our stars. Please just go watch this movie. Please. I Loved it. ***** out of 5."
"VLHdelaParra","10","61","80","16 July 2016"," The movie you've always wanted if you were a teen in the '80s!
","I'm happy to grade this movie a full blast 10. I was a teenager in 1985 in the last private Catholic Boarding School left in Mexico City. I relate to the strict uniform policy, the angry and imperfect young Catholic brothers still guessing their vocations, the old professors teaching materials for yester years, the canteen food, hiding Walkman radios and sunglasses, talking about bands across the ocean, the girls who wanted to be older and the fashion. This is a happy sad movie, that will keep you tapping and asking why aren't all movies like this. The script is very very smart, the casting couldn't be wiser. Lucy Boynton does an amazing job. The art direction is so precise you can imagine the smell of the flats. The awesome cars. What a great movie!!<br/><br/>Don't miss this!!!"
"SanFranciscoCinephile","Null","35","46","13 April 2016"," Dream big, and listen to your older brother
","I'm a sucker for movies about musicians, and John Carney has already given us Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). Now he delights once more with Sing Street, a tale told with humor, drama, and some pretty catchy songs, all set in the backdrop of 1980's Dublin.<br/><br/>Yes, Sing Street is set in the 80's so it undeniably lends itself to comic relief as these schoolboys are forced to navigate through hair, makeup, clothing and music video choices along their artistic journey. We get plenty of laughs as we watch them try to forge an identity and look like bona-fide rock stars in this crazy MTV generation. And for good measure, they insert the obligatory Phil Collins joke in the mix.<br/><br/>There is quite a deal of drama as well. We see bullying in an all-boys school, dysfunctional families, the economic hardships of Ireland in the 80's and young people's wish to break out of societal malaise and seek their fortunes elsewhere. I haven't lived in Ireland but the desire to pack your bags and start over in another place is a universal one. Audiences in every continent can relate to that.<br/><br/>The cast is solid and I was very impressed with the leads, especially Ferdia Walsh-Peelo who plays Connor. He can be charming, kind, insecure but out-of-nowhere gutsy which is an accurate depiction of a blossoming musician. After the first hour I began to be doubtful of the character of Connor's brother Brendan for seeming to be too wise for his age, but by the end of the film it all made sense, and Jack Reynor was a fine choice for that role. Lucy Boynton (Raphine) is great as the love interest and mysterious but troubled muse; she packs an emotional performance and probably looks the most natural in 80's fashion, although she didn't quite convince me as a 16 year-old and it wasn't because of all the excess hair and makeup. On the other hand Mr. Walsh-Peelo (Connor) was only 15 when the movie was shot and he's got that boyish appearance. Finally Mark McKenna (Eamon) has such an uncanny resemblance to Julian Lennon it's scary! But a good actor too.<br/><br/>As far as concerns I had only a few major ones but they didn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. First is that the story moves very quickly in the first 30 minutes or so, then takes the foot off the pedal for the remainder. And second, it's a little unrealistic that these kids can write quality songs right out of the blocks. It would have been fun to hear a real stinker when they're starting out. I'm a musician and believe me, our first attempts are pretty bad. That's true even for the all-time best.<br/><br/>There were a few other minor things but they're not worth mentioning. This is a great story, it got all the laughs, cheers and tears in the right places and I would recommend it to everyone, especially those who want to express themselves through art and aspire to greatness. Dream big, all you adolescents. A big thanks to John Carney et al for reminding us of that and making a quality film."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","48","65","16 May 2016"," Irresistibly Charming
","There's nothing quite like the creative process. We've all had that feeling; unfolding with all its frenzied excitement, malleable thoughts and brainstorms and inventive problem-solving. Yet creativity isn't just limited to what music you make, what stories you write, what paintings you paint. Flexing the limits of your creativity is almost like a window into your identity. Do you look for the easy fix, do you power through despite mental blocks, do you try the unexpected or bend towards an originality or an universality. So it goes with Sing Street, a movie that expands the notion of creativity itself, making an unabashedly and irresistibly charming film.<br/><br/>Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo) and his family live in a charmed dwelling overlooking the urban sprawl of South side Dublin. Due to financial strain, Conor is informed that he's being taken out of his private Jesuit high school and being transferred to a public school nearby. At first, things go miserably. He's hassled by bullies, called names openly in class and harangued by the school's principal Father Baxter (Wycherley). His only solace is watching new wave music videos with his older brother Brendan (Reynor). Things change however with the appearance of the mysterious and strikingly beautiful Raphina (Boynton) who stands on the stoop outside the school. He approaches her and asks her to be in a music video; she agrees. Next step: start a band.<br/><br/>Conor quickly makes friends with a gaggle of outcasts from the school in order to haphazardly start, build and maintain a fledgling little group. Among them is the multi-talented Eamon (McKenna) who can not only play multiple instruments but can put Conor's lyrics to song. It is the moments between these two young artists that best exemplifies the movie's central theme. We share with them the 4am feeling of unbounded imaginative bliss as they riff off each other, clean up their chords and rhythms and ask each other the meaning behind the songs they write. Because of Eamon's father's vocation as a covers band leader, the band not only has a place to practice but instruments to play which benefits the rest of the players as they develop their sound.<br/><br/>Conor uses his band not only for the purpose of wooing the girl but also as a means to escape his increasingly turbulent home life. The marriage between his mother (Doyle Kennedy) and father (Gillen) circles the drain as his dropout brother smokes hash and oozes cynicism and unrealized potential. In one moment of investigation, Brendan points to the mother who sits on the stoop, smoking a cigarette, hoping to catch the last rays of sunshine of the day. With big talk of some day going to Paris, the mother settles on these moments to sulk in bitter reflection. ""I cleared a path for you."" Brendan says in a moment of defeat. Seems his carefully curated collection of vinyl and his grimacing observations serve as a counterpoint to encourage Conor's brazen dreams.<br/><br/>Yet it's the girl who pushes Conor to the point of unique creative verisimilitude. And as the would-be model that captures the heart of our young hero, Lucy Boynton is an absolute vision. She coyly hints at gigs and glamour in London yet she lives at an all girls boarding house and dates a guy who listens to Genesis. Yet despite outward moments of confident sashaying, behind the makeup and denim there beats the heart of a true romantic and a true creative conduit. ""When it comes to art, you never go halfway."" she says just after she throws herself into the Irish Sea for the sake of a good video. This moment is immediately followed by Conor responding in kind.<br/><br/>And yes this movie is about a new wave band in the 1980's, so yes there is a lot of hair, makeup, posh scarf wearing and mod style bravado. While today we like to take potshots at the synth-pop aesthetic, there's still something utterly charming about the way it is presented here. Is it nostalgia; probably. Yet there's an unawareness to it, allowing the audience to discover (or re-discover) the trappings of 80's popular music in real time. The excitement Brendan and Conor feel in watching Duran Duran's Rio music video is infectious, and the original songs by the band are easily the best thing about Sing Street.<br/><br/>Conor eventually finds a since of identity within the catchy rhythms of his songs, the jejune charms of Raphina and the kindliness of Brendan's brotherly love. The moments of kitchen sink realism serves not only as a cautionary tale to Conor but to us as well. When we refuse ourselves the rewards of creativity we risk becoming embittered, angry and resentful. In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, ""Go into the arts. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow."" To put it another way, go create something."

","Ah, the joy and pain of first love! Young Conor (aka Cosmo, played in his impressive debut by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) has the smelly end of a shitty stick to deal with while growing up in 1980's Dublin. He has warring parents with the need â€“ for financial reasons - to move Conor from his posh school to 'Singe Street' Catholic school: a decidedly rougher and tougher place, ruled over with a rod of iron by Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley). This is a place of chaos and mayhem, ruled over by bullies of the likes of Barry (a superbly intimidating Ian Kenny).<br/><br/>The 15 year old Conor tries punching above his weight with the lovely 16 year old Raphina (Lucy Boynton) â€“ a struggling wannabe model with ""mysterious eyes"" who hangs around outside the Woman's Refuge opposite the school. To get her number, he claims to head up a band and to need her help with the band's video. One small problem: there is no band and Conor has limited musical ability! He gathers around him a motley crew of friends, and with the help of his stoner brother (Jack Raynor) and his extensive vinyl collection, goes about creating a band to gain fame and fortune (or at least the girl).<br/><br/>This is a film that works on so many levels. As a piece of nostalgia for us older folks, the sights and sounds of the 80's are brought vividly back to life, with a rocking soundtrack of the likes of Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet to enjoy. And as a coming of age movie, the long lingering looks, embarrassment and discomfort of first-dating is both touching and painful to watch, with the best Rich-Tea fuelled snog ever put on screen! Few films in fact have come this close to depicting this glorious ineptitude since John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn struggled to get together in Bill Forsyth's ""Gregory's Girl"" (making me feel ancient, this was actually set in 1981!).<br/><br/>It should be noted that at one point the film also models the casual racism prevalent at the time, with perhaps only the addition of a rebuking ""You can't say things like that"" striking a less realistic note. <br/><br/>This is a film where nearly everyone is damaged in one way or another â€“ drugs; hopeless ambition; child abuse; paedophilia, alcoholism; bullying; (the list goes on). However, the hugely intelligent script by writer and director John Carney drips the issues out in such tiny insinuations and snippets of conversation that it feels lifelike: not as if the film-maker is beating you over the head with it. This is just a poor Dublin life in the 80's: get on with it.<br/><br/>All of this might make you think this is a hugely depressing, kitchen-sink type of drama that will leave you, at the end of the evening, in dire need of a box-set of ""Father Ted"" to cheer you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the same way as the music in Alan Parker's 1991 Dublin-set classic ""The Commitments"" - and indeed 2013's excellent Belfast-based ""Good Vibrations"" - lifted the spirits, so the drive and energy of the soundtrack makes the film a hugely uplifting experience. Besides the classic 80's stuff there are some really great original songs (co-written by the multi- talented John Carney, with Gary Clark): I was still humming ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" in the car park. <br/><br/>The young cast throw themselves into the job with great energy, with Walsh-Peelo and Boynton delivering touching and impressive performances and Mark McKenna particularly worthy of note channeling a young John Lennon. My top acting accolade though goes to Jack Raynor (who was until recently rumoured to be in the running for the role of the young Han Solo: a role that's now just gone to ""Hail Caesar's"" Alden Ehrenreich). Playing Conor's older and wiser brother, his frustration at his role in life boils over in a vinyl- smashing and hugely impressive rant that I would like to see credited with a Best Supporting Actor award. And amid all of the teenage love and band efforts, it is this aspect of brotherly love that eventually shines out as the beating heart of the film. <br/><br/>The film is a little rough at the edges â€“ a dream sequence looks like it could have had a few more dollars thrown at it - but this often adds to the charm. John Carney seems to have quite an Indie following, but I'm not familiar with his other work. This film left me wanting to dig into his archives. It left my wife gushing with tears from beginning to end! A must see film.<br/><br/>(I loved it - did you?

"dave-mcclain","8","21","28","8 May 2016"," ""Sing Street"" is music to the ears - and the heart.
","Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school â€“ both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not ""enough""Â… of something. Well, I say ""enough already"" â€“ and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama ""Sing Street"" (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. ""Happy-Sad"" the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.<br/><br/>Conor Lalor (Ferdia Walsh Peelo) is, in many ways, a typical 15-year-old. He goes to school, where he has both friends and enemies. He has family members who love him, but also add challenges to his life. And, of course, he wants to earn the affections of someone special who has caught his eye. The details of the framework of Conor's life may differ from yours (as well as his gender, interests, location and even time period), but he should be easy to relate to â€“ for anyone who attended (or is now attending) high school.<br/><br/>As for Conor, he lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. He has a brother (six years older) named Brendan (Jack Raynor), who is out of school but still lives at home, and a younger sister named Ann (Kelly Thornton). Their parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) argue â€“ loudly â€“ about money, their kids, their marriage, etc. Conor has the experience of changing schools, starting at Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where, as the new kid, he quickly runs afoul of the principal (Don Wycherly) and the school bully (Ian Kelly). However, Conor soon makes a friend named Darren (Ben Carolan) and is quite taken by a mysterious girl named Raphina (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street from the school.<br/><br/>As a way of getting to know Raphina, Conor asks her to be in a music video for his band. She agrees, so now all Conor has to do isÂ… start a band! He gets Darren to be the band's manager â€“ slash â€“ music video producer. Darren introduces Conor to Eamon (Mark McKenna), who is skilled at a variety of instruments. After the guys recruit from among their school mates, adding friends Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Gary (Karl Rice), along with Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), the only black kid at Synge Street CBS, they choose ""Sing Street"" as the name of their band, and start working on their band's musical and visual identity.<br/><br/>Heavily influenced by early-mid 1980s acts like The Cure, Joe Jackson and Hall & Oates (whose songs appear in the soundtrack), Sing Street works up a cover of Duran Duran's ""Rio"" and then Conor and Eamon start writing original songs together. Brendan makes use of his misspent youth to school his younger brother in the finer points of modern music and encourages Conor to stretch musically. Soon, Raphina becomes Conor's muse and a regular in Sing Street's videos. Raphina and Conor also grow closer, in spite of her ""it's complicated"" relationship status and her plan to move to London to model.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" features a whole lot of talent â€“ on both sides of the camera â€“ and the microphone. Carney's direction and his script are sensitive, engaging and fun. The story has a lot going on, but still keeps things simple, and derives its entertainment value from a variety of sources. The drama comes from following the development of the band, the relationship between Conor and Raphina, the relationships within Conor's house and Conor's problems at school. The comedy comes from the behavior of the film's colorful characters and the natural awkwardness of teenagers discovering life.<br/><br/>Carney says the film is ""wish fulfillment of all of the things I wanted when I was the age of the character and didn't do."" To portray a fictionalized version of his own adolescence, he cast unknown, but talented actors â€“ with terrific results. Raynor creates an interesting and passionate character, who is dealing with the fear that life is passing him by. For their part, Walsh-Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life â€“ all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs.<br/><br/>As the main character, Conor's struggles are relatable, his dreams are understandable and his story is enjoyable. The film isn't completely original or realistic, but it's very effective as a representation of the trials, tribulations and potential triumphs of the teenage years, and offers hope as to what could lie ahead â€“ for those who make the most of those years â€“ and the lessons they produce. ""You can never do anything by half,"" is one character's heart-felt proclamation. ""Sing Street"" continually speaks to the heart â€“ through its comedy, its drama and its wonderful music â€“ and doesn't do it by half. ""A-"""

","A beautifully balanced, sensibly narrated & splendidly performed indie covering the highs & lows of teenage life while demonstrating the magic of creating music with all the romance of the art in tact Sing Street is a heartfelt ode to the carefree, joyous days of growing up and with its subtle touch of melancholy & hummable soundtrack, delivers an experience that's delightfully captivating.<br/><br/>Set in Dublin, Ireland during the 1980s, Sing Street tells the story of a young kid who is looking for an escape from all his troubles at home where his family is on the verge of falling apart, and at his new school where students & teachers are quite rough. His window of opportunity arrives when, in an attempt to impress a girl, he invites her to star in his band's music videos despite not being a part of one.<br/><br/>Written & directed by John Carney, the movie packs just the right amount of heart, fun, nostalgia, heartaches & optimism and also benefits from the interesting set of characters the writer-director brings to life. The events progress in smooth, effective manner from start to finish while the songs are expertly placed at just the right moments to exquisitely capture the underlying context of the emotions on surface.<br/><br/>Production design team does well to nicely capture the period details of the timeline its plot is set in. Cinematography encapsulates the entire feature with an overcast ambiance with warm & cold colours utilised as per the scene requirements. Editing provides a steady pace to its 105 minutes narrative with each scene only taking the story forward while songs are composed from scratch and have an infectious quality to them.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Sing Street features a relatively unknown but incredibly committed cast in Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Mark McKenna, Jack Raynor, Aidan Gillen & Maria Doyle Kennedy and everyone does an excellent job with what they are given. Walsh-Peelo in particular is a standout and shares brilliant chemistry with both Boynton & McKenna while Raynor pretty much steals the show in every scene he appears in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Sing Street is the feel-good movie of the year that's euphonic in both happy & sad moments and manages to incorporate a mix of both with amazing comfort. A healthy dose of entertainment that treads the fine line between wishful fantasy & cold reality that promises plenty of laughs & hints of tears, this bittersweet coming-of-age musical comedy hits the right chords at the right time throughout its runtime and is one of the best films of 2016. Definitely recommended."

","I was a fan of Carney's band the Frames, and was delighted to see his first low budget film , ""Once"" <br/><br/>His second wonderful film had a much bigger budget and well know cast, but still a small film. I just loved, ""Begin Again"" with Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Kiera Knightly.<br/><br/>He goes back to his roots with Sing Street and it is simply a joyful experience. It started off a bit slow for me. But as the band that is the focal point of the film hones their skills and improves so does this wonderful story. I just can't say enough about how great the two leads were in this film Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays the male lead Conor, and Lucy Boynton as Raphina were just wonderful. It is a great film to watch if you are having trouble getting your smile on. <br/><br/>As an American I had a little trouble at times with the thick Irish accents. When I watch the CD I may have to stick the subtitles on.I wish the film had a bit of a bigger budget in the sense that it looks like it was made on a tiny budget and musicals are much better when the sound is powerful. But that is just quibbling. Go see this in the theaters, if for nothing else to make sure Carney gets money to keep making films."
"lesleyharris30","9","6","7","11 June 2017"," A Heartwarming Film that is Ridiculous Fun,
","Sing Street is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a real feel good, sweet movie that is a pure delight for anyone familiar with the eighties, the setting and atmosphere makes it convey very clear that we are in a very different time in Ireland. The original songs are magnificent, each one being annoyingly catchy and serving the plot very well. It is immensely funny, but also stands out in more dramatic moments that are mildly tense, and very real. <br/><br/>The only aspect of the film that I did not particularly appreciate was the parents plot line. It was clearly trying to add an extra layer of difficulty to Conor's life, but it failed to grab me in any way. I did not care for his two dimensional mother and father, nor did I have any interest on seeing how their relationship pans out. <br/><br/>The strongest part of the movie has to be Conor and Brendan's special brotherly bond, it is sweet, pure and I think any pair of brothers can relate to it. With the teasing that goes on between them, as well as the sincere care they both have for one another, the ending brought a tear to my eye as a result of how powerful Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Jack Reynor's relationship was. <br/><br/>It made me experience many different emotions throughout, which is what the best movies do. Funny, heartwarming and wildly entertaining, Sing Street is worth the watch for anyone who is looking for a good comedy or music film. <br/><br/>A young boy starts a band in order to get an older girls attention. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jack Reynor"

","Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.<br/><br/>Mr. Carney was also responsible for two previous music-centric movies, Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). He is an exceptional story teller who puts music at the center, but avoids the label of ""musical"" by making it about people, rather than notes.<br/><br/>It's 1985 in economically depressed Dublin, and a strong opening sequence introduces us to Connor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) as his ever-arguing parents (Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy) inform him of the economic necessity of pulling him out of prep school and enrolling him into a much tougher environment Â… one that comes with bullies and hard-nosed teachers/clergy.<br/><br/>Soon enough Connor is hanging with the misfits and inviting an enchanting ""older"" girl to star in his band's video. She agrees, and wide-eyed Connor quickly sets out to form a band that didn't previously exist.<br/><br/>There are two interesting and fully realized relationships that make this movie click: Connor and the enchanting Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and Connor and his older brother Brendon (Jack Reynor). Brendan is Connor's life mentor and music guru. They are quick to jump on the new world of music videos, and it's a real hoot to watch Connor emulate the style and fashion of Duran, Duran, The Cure, etc.<br/><br/>It's fascinating to note that Connor, while a pretty talented lyricist and singer, doesn't really seem to be in love with the music except as a means to an end Â… a way to get the girl. That said, the real message here is that while teenagers often feel like they can't fix the outside world (parents, teachers, bullies), they can fix themselves by finding a passion in life (the movie uses the term vocation).<br/><br/>It's hard not to notice the influence of such filmmakers as John Hughes and Cameron Crowe, and Carney certainly brings his touch of romanticism. Plus, one must appreciate any movie that delivers an original song as catchy as ""Drive it like you Stole it"", while also taking a shot at Phil Collins. It's a funny and sweet movie that should really catch on through positive word of mouth."

","I needed a movie like this in 2016, and I wish it could have come earlier. I didn't know they had decided to keep making films like this. <br/><br/>'Sing Street', on the surface, is a funny teenage movie about an Irish boy who starts a punk rock band in the 1980s to impress a girl he likes. This premise alone made me want to see it; it sounded hugely enjoyable for someone who loves rock and roll and loves (certain) teen movies. And I wasn't wrong, I had a great time with the film. But it's definitely more than what it sounds. <br/><br/>The movie reminds me so much of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', which is important to acknowledge because that film is one of the defining teen movies of a century devoid of good teen movies. I could count the 21st century gems on one hand, and the other lackluster attempts on ten. Both of these movies succeed in calling back to the glorious John Hughes era. They use their characters right, the dialogue works, and it's relatable for a teen audience. <br/><br/>'Sing Street' is about rebellion. About taking control of one's life and making memories, even if the steps you must take to get there seem too steep to climb. It's about finding out who this musically talented boy is through a journey in which his family is torn apart but his friendships are multiplied. It is heartfelt, beautifully shot, and comes complete with a hip soundtrack. One of the best movies of its year. 9/10"

","It's a few days before the end of May, 2016, and the year in film might already be over as far as I'm concerned. It did not seem that way to me after the first time I saw this film - the ""Mary Sue""-ism of the band's progress in quality, the strange appearance of a 1987 song in a 1985-set film (Starship's track at the party towards the end - from the movie 'Mannequin'), me asking myself which characters were responsible for editing the music video for 'Riddle of the Model' so decently / well?, and a couple more quibbles. These minor details became less important by the second viewing, and completely unimportant by the third and fourth viewings. They were replaced by: the girl that inspires your work, the work that allows you to ignore your current circumstances, the ""adults"", however few they may be, that actually notice what you're doing and encourage you / help you / are happily there for you, the friends you make as a result of putting yourself ""out there"", the joy of coming up with new material, ""who are you, Steely Dan?"", the fantastic storyline with Barry - the 'bully' who is incorporated into the group as the roadie with M's ""Pop Musik"" playing in the background, Brendan and Raphina meeting towards the end of the film, Eamon's mother (hahah), Flash and the Pan's ""Waiting for a Train"", The Cure on a film soundtrack, ""Depech-E Mode"", cookies between kisses, and Raphina... and Brendan. When even Adam Levine works perfectly for the film's ending, you know things are clicking.<br/><br/>On a side note: my profile has my location as San Juan, Puerto Rico, but I did not see this film there... since it has not been shown there, and I unfortunately would not be surprised if it ended up not showing there at all before home video (hope I'm wrong).<br/><br/>On a second side note: while in early high school, we tried to make a music video to compete in MTV's make-a-video contest for Madonna's track 'True Blue'... and failed impressively. Hence my immediately noticing the editing in 'RotM' :)"

","Wow. What an absolutely beautiful film. It is so simple. It is about teenagers in a band. But the humor is so well-timed, and the music so...awesome...that it is a real pleasure to watch. I only heard about Sing Street because of its Golden Globe nomination (which it completely deserved) and didn't watch it on Netflix until well through 2017. I regret not seeing it sooner.<br/><br/>One of the great parts of Sing Street is that the teenagers are actually played by teenagers, not 20 year-olds pretending to be 14 (cough cough Spider-man). They're really believable kids, and just so likable. Their personal stories are interesting and the way they see the world is fascinating to experience. It all feels very real.<br/><br/>Sing Street also has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK that compliments the story so well. Up is my favorite.<br/><br/>Jack Reynor totally deserved his Irish Oscar. He was such a REAL older brother. I did it again, and said how real it felt. That's part of the beauty of the film. It just feels real. But back to Jack Reynor. I didn't know him from anything else, but he was so good in this that when I first saw his face as a racist cop in Detroit (a SUPER intense film) that I actually laughed. Thanks Sing Street.<br/><br/>Must see film. Just bunny stuff."

","I thought that 2016 was dominated musically by ""La La Land"", but then I saw ""Sing street""...<br/><br/>Well, what can I say - music is everything sometimes. And just sometimes - movie making through music is what it takes to make everyone feel so much better. <br/><br/>Topics like family, growing up, friendship and love fill this movie with the necessary energy to carry you from beginning to end with joy and passion. I am truly inspired how the main characters start from the desire to be noticed and reach some of the highest peaks of originality in art. The 80's background music, set and costumes are far too attractive to be missed. And for me - these are all hallmarks of great directorship and cinematography. <br/><br/>The desire to associate with, to give, to win, translates to the viewer the impression of youth's vigor and love towards pushing down walls and changing habits. The young cast of this film reminds us to never let the important things run out of our lives, no matter how hard the situation is. And always to share every spark of creativity. The unique cultural-historical perspective of this movie shows again how music connects past and future, now and then.<br/><br/>Across cultures and distances we are interconnected by art, and in particular by good music. We can experience the passion to express ourselves all the way along our path of growing up and chasing our dreams. And to see once again how we must never lose grasp of our goals, no matter how hard it gets along the way.<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent example of how the family can influence any young kid in both a good and a bad way. Also - the importance of a good advice against the malice of poverty and ignorance is really obvious. ""Sing Street""is the newest story of how love can actually save and dignify. But more than everything we see - how music can be a solution to all. And without any guaranteed success at the end, we enjoy this film as a really splendid creation of nostalgia, music and love.<br/><br/>I truly recommend this small treasure to you and your close ones. We can never have too much music and love in our lives!"
"meleager","9","6","8","13 September 2016"," Beautiful, heartwarming experience
","The movie somehow illuminates in the darkness surrounding the 7th art nowadays. Drawing a simple, yet powerful fable, using bold and at times even aggressive strokes, it creates a convincing story which will certainly affect most of the viewers.<br/><br/>All the actors are great, but the youngsters are just fabulous. I am totally in love with Raphina and Conor has all my sympathies. The powerful performance by Jack Reynor (the big brother) comes as a surprise and provide an extra boost to the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful, beautiful movie. It is also fun and quite optimistic and I would recommend it to anyone."
"ctowyi","8","6","8","1 August 2016"," Thanks for the music lessons
","Brilliant. Once will forever be one of my desert island films, but Sing Street comes really close. Together with Begin Again, John Carney has made an amazing trilogy of 'music' films that beat with warm hearts of gold. <br/><br/>This one is about a boy living in the 80s who wants to start a band because he likes a girl. A rather simple storyline but the execution is bliss. If you were weaned on songs from the 80s you are so going to love this. The music is of course A1, but I never counted the familiar story to be so winsome and endearing. It fricking made me tear up. The reason why it is so good is because Carney knows how to portray the kids and adults like how we think them to be in our idealistic minds. In our minds, at one time or another, we all wished we were like them. I love the banter between the boy and his older brother in the music man-cave. Doesn't anyone want an older brother like that. A bro that knows, feels, loves and understands music, and talks music like it is the only knowledge in the world worth knowing. Carney knows music and he uses it to bridge relationships and incidents in our lives, and it is about getting the girl. It is also about ""finding the happiness in sadness"" that transcends us to a new level, and ""no woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins"". I will remember that one ðŸ˜¬<br/><br/>Thank you for the music lessons."

","Really captures its time, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a great concept. Does a really good job communicating the tone and the feeling of the plot, and none of the actors felt like actors. There were very many things done very well in this movie and very few things that noticeably would need improvement. It'd be an 8 in my books if not for just how well it captured 1980s Dublin. It definitely added to the film experience. If you're looking for a good film with good humour that tells a good story, this would be great option."
"minab-99124","6","16","28","7 August 2016"," Good music and setting, but lacks in story
","I wanted to enjoy Sing Street - what's not to love about a story of a teenage band in the era of some of the best British music? Unfortunately, the overall story disappoints, with a shambling plot, underdeveloped characters and a confusing ending. <br/><br/>Mainly it suffers from trying to be too many things at once. Sing Street has elements of kid-vs- bully, kid-vs-bully-teacher, punk-kid-vs-society, kid-vs-parents, kid-trying-to-get-the-girl . . . And then the film surprises us almost at the end by revealing itself as more of a big-brother-mentor story. Too many threads, too many messages. It would have been much better for the subplots to remain in the sideline. That's the magic of film - some small suggestions of the parents' divorce, for example, would have set the scene fine without having to show us everything. If the story had just focused on the one journey of the kid trying to woo the girl, it would have been far more successful. It felt like there was too much unnecessary drama, and too little lighthearted musical fun. <br/><br/>As for the characters, the main kid's motivation wasn't convincing. He suddenly decides to start a band with some people he doesn't know, just to impress the girl? And all he knows about pop music is what his brother told him the night before, which he parrots to his new-found friends. If he was a true music lover from the start, perhaps his character would have been more likable and relatable. The other characters are mere cardboard cutouts. Teenage characters can be really cool and convincing, like the hilarious gang in JJ Abram's 'Super 8', but Sing Street's teens had no personality at all. You don't even find out the love interest's name til halfway through, and although she's supposed to be mysterious, it ends up taking away from the character. <br/><br/>The ending of Sing Street was unconvincing as well. What, these two fifteen-year-olds are just going to drive a little boat all the way from Dublin to England? This kid who never showed an interest in music at the start of the film is going to try forge a career as a singer/songwriter in London? Sorry, but it was totally unsatisfying. It should have ended with them running away into the night with the city lights behind them, just as the love interest alluded to earlier. <br/><br/>There are some cool songs in here, except the finale song wasn't quite as awesome and climactic as some of the others. It was cool to see and recognise bands and stuff from that era, and I guess the film was entertaining. I recommend skipping the intense, uncomfortable drama and just watching the ""Riddle of the Model"" music video scene on YouTube instead."
"itsJennayy","8","13","22","13 March 2016"," John Carney's highly entertaining and youthfully vibrant, Sing Street will be the most delightful riot of eighties-reminiscent nostalgia you never thought you needed.
","Following Carney's stunning hit Once, his attempt at 2013â€²s Begin Again, although (at first glance) full of indie music-lover potential, never quite felt like it understood what you wanted it to be. Since re-watching Begin Again, hoping to find some reasoning behind this, it became apparent that the film never finds its own voice or identity, like Once did, despite its great cast and original music. Instead of ignoring this, Carney has focused on this misstep with Sing Street, creating a truly genuine ode to not just the seventies and all coming-of-age youth, but his own personal experience. <br/><br/>There is a deliberate personal touch here, and the film is all the better for it - it is present in the relatable character of Cosmo (played by the impressive Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and his hormone- infused ambitions to simply ""get the girl"". Instigated by the presence of the beautiful and mysterious Raphina (played by the lovely Lucy Boynton), Cosmo starts a band. He is guided by his older brother Brendan (played by the excellent Jack Reynor) and his rebellious 80â€²s taste in music, to inspire his own band's music. What follows is a musically-charged narrative of experiments in identity, rebelling against oppression and hilarious attempts at parodying classic 80â€²s music videos. You have to wonder how interesting a character Carney must have been at that age, growing up in conservative Dublin and gaining a taste in new music that opened up his world, like his character Cosmo. <br/><br/>Frieda Walsh-Peelo does a fine job, although not leading man quality yet, he carries the film considerably well for his first acting role. More impressive, is his vocal talent. Frieda is a trained opera singer and musician at only 16. His broad vocal range is apparent and works really well with the many different songs in the film. It will be exciting to see what other projects he tackles in the future. <br/><br/>Lucy Boynton is stunning and so believable as the sure-footed and mysterious Raphina - she really wears the eighties wardrobe well as she fully embodies this role, rather than the other way around. Early on, her character is saved from Manic-Pixie-Dreamgirl syndrome and she becomes a real, imperfect, three-dimensional character. Boynton's light, airy voice lends to her character's naiveness, which is a stark contrast to the image she projects. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most enjoyable character (aside from the underused band members, who do deserve some more love) is Cosmo's older brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor. Reynor manages to make Brendan into both a reckless, failed dreamer as well as the older brother we all wish we had. By the end of this film you'll empathize with him even more and that's not just because it's written well. <br/><br/>The only concern will be that most notably, at the TIFF Next Wave film festival, it was acknowledged during the Q&A's how approximately 90% of the audience were 50 or older. The soundtrack, if marketed correctly, could become a hit. Tunes like ""Rhythm of the Model"" and ""Drive it Like You Stole It"" were clearly audience favourites. It will be interesting to see how this will be marketed though. The music, although catchy and fun, is not ""mainstream"" and younger audiences may not bite. Older audiences who come for shoutouts to Duran Duran and The Cure may be put off by how toned down and slightly unrealistic or easy the plot plays out. <br/><br/>There seems to be some confusion with this film, if it was made for adolescents or older audiences or just John Carney. I would have to agree with all three. I found Sing Street similar to a Pixar film in that it's marketed toward the younger set with a story that doesn't get too ugly but is pulled off well with a strong message. References that only adults will get will go over kids' heads. But ultimately - this is a movie for and by John Carney. And that is why is it so unlike Begin Again - Sing Street has it's own voice and identity. <br/><br/>Overall, the message is so clear and true in this film. The world Carney places his story in is so rich that it refuses to lack depth despite it's expected younger audience. There are relatable subplots about family and marriage, the bond between brothers, oppression in society, and the desire to achieve your dreams despite where you come from. Admittedly, there are some underused characters who still manage to naturally add charisma and charm. Perhaps a missed opportunity, but the rest of the band members fall to the wayside to make room for Cosmo and Raphina's boy- meets-girl plot. This could've easily become a completely different film about the band itself and made into an ensemble's story. However, Sing Street is much more than that - it's a personal journey through adolescence. It's about daring to dream beyond what is put in front of you. (Reviewed by : COLD KNEES)"
"themadmovieman","7","10","16","20 May 2016"," A nice nostalgia tour, but a little too much style over substance
","This is a nice film. It's a coming of age tale with heart, it's got a great soundtrack, and some pretty good performances. However, rather than telling a properly compelling story, Sing Street often feels a little too preoccupied with portraying its time period. It undoubtedly paints a picture of mid-80s pop culture very well, but that's at the expense of a genuinely engrossing story, making this seem like a little too much style over substance.<br/><br/>Directed and written by John Carney, who also made Once (which I didn't like) and Begin Again (which I loved), Sing Street is a bit of a middling film of his. As we've seen in his other films, there's always a real passion for making music, and how it can bring people together, and that does feature once again here.<br/><br/>Time and time again, we get some great original songs mixed with classics of the 80s, and that's one of the things that makes this an enjoyable watch. It's a toe-tapper of a film, and, particularly if you have a strong nostalgia for the time period, you'll love seeing it portrayed on screen so well.<br/><br/>However, unlike Begin Again, which weaved that music in with an engrossing and emotional story, Sing Street suffers from a very thin story, and pretty plain characters, which means that it's never as emotionally resonant as it needs to, and clearly wants to be.<br/><br/>There were numerous moments where the story takes a step back from the fun of making a band and singing songs, and tries to look at the various problems in the characters' lives in order to get you to connect with them more. However, seeing as none of the characters really stand out from one another, and all just feel like very generic coming-of-age movie teenagers, it was a lot harder for me to care about whatever was happening in their personal lives, which meant that any time when the film tried to be more emotional, it really fell flat.<br/><br/>And this is where I'm going to bring in a comparison to The Commitments, which was clearly a big influence on this film. They both have great music, and they've both got a great sense of fun about them, but the major difference is the characters. In The Commitments, the varied personalities gave the film a great dynamic, and also meant that you could care about each individual person on screen, whereas in Sing Street, considering that we don't have that, it loses a huge amount of its power, and makes the majority of the story feel very thin.<br/><br/>The characters may be thin, and that does impact on your interest, but the performances are still very good. Although they may not have so much to do, young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and especially Lucy Boynton really do shine, and do very well to keep you entertained and engaged by what is in truth a bit of an average and generic story.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked Sing Street. It's a pleasant, fun and musical coming-of-age movie which brilliantly portrays its time period and features some strong performances. Its story, however, feels very thin, and that means that it's never as emotionally effective or interesting as it should have been."

I had really enjoyed Begin Again and Once was one of my favourite films when I saw it so I am a fan of director Carney's work and in this he's right back up to Once's standards. I was enjoying it from the start, helped by the 1980's setting which was when I was in senior school just like the protagonists and which the film perfectly portrays, but was not blown away. But as it progressed it just crept into my being, filling me up with its energy, heart, sole and most of all its music and the joy and exuberance of its creators. The young cast here shine, from our hero, to his bully nemesis, taking in along the way the heroes dream girl, his band of misfits, and the worlds ultimate big brother. Sure, for a group of school kids they are unrealistically good at writing and performing their various pastiches of several 80's pop styles, but the songs are incredibly catchy and the homemade videos they create for them are very funny and perfectly of the era. If you don't leave this film with a song in your heart and a smile on your face, then your dead inside."

","The warm and idealistic yet poignantly real Sing Street—about an Irish high-school student in the 1980s who starts a band—has the power to make you nostalgic for a childhood that wasn't your own.<br/><br/>We meet the fifteen-year-old protagonist Conor hiding in his bedroom with a guitar, as his parents argue about their financial troubles and failing marriage. When Conor must transfer to a state Catholic school in a different part of town (based on director John Carney's childhood school), viewers aren't spared the harsh first encounters with his classmates and headmaster. He is, for example, punched and threatened by a school bully and forcibly handled by the school's headmaster after a dress-code violation. These moments and others carry with them a palpable realness, devoid of melodrama or sentimentality. The film's unique realness is present in the difficult moments (the bullying and rough family situation); it is also present in the mundane and witty—from Conor's family watching early MTV music videos together, to the extensive record collection and the poster of Freud in the older brother's bedroom, to Conor's friend's unapologetic love of rabbits. <br/><br/>It's the realness of many of the film's moments that makes its accompanying youthful idealism powerful. The film's plot-line itself is one centered around youthful hope and naiveté. Conor starts a band to impress a beautiful aspiring model who lives across the street from his school. Although she is dating an older man, Conor hopes his music and persistence will win her over. The characters' budding romance is accompanied by a soundtrack of 1980s rock and roll hits and Carney's original '80s-inspired pop tunes, sung in the film by Conor's band. <br/><br/>Sing Street is a life-affirming story about what one can do with hope and music, but it also gives a nod to those with unrealized dreams who use music as a form of escapism. Conor's brother (a frustrated college drop-out), like the movie's viewers, rejoices in Conor's triumphs, and Carney celebrates the older brothers of the world who pave the way (sometimes at their own expense) for their younger siblings. <br/><br/>Sing Street is a film that is both realistic and idealist, that both celebrates the glories of youth and playfully mocks them and that both nostalgically celebrates the music of the 1980s and makes viewers want to, like Conor, be a ""futurist"" who, without looking back, drives life ""like you stole it."""
"Screen_Blitz","9","5","8","18 March 2017"," Sing Street is upbeat, charming, and sensational for music fans everywhere
","This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.<br/><br/>It is been a long time since Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' the last time Hollywood has deliver such an electrifying feel-good musical comedy like this one. This film operates with immense charm and lyrical optimism, and the musical performances by the young cast provide more than a hefty hand for fueling this film's elegant appeal. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo provides an appealing force to be reckon with his singing. Every scene the band play, his voice shines like gold. The musical numbers are far from the classic-type songs that will leave a lasting appeal for many years to come, but they are very lively and not impossible for pinning viewers with the urge to stand up and cheer. The music leaves plenty of room for alluring nostalgia of popular rock music from the 80s. When the atmosphere is not flowing with musical numbers, there is a share humor to handed from the wide cast of characters. The lead character in particular is strongly likable, along with the supporting characters he recruits into his band. One of the sparkling points to the story is the chemistry between Peelo and Lucy Boynton, a romance that while nothing necessarily remarkable, definitely fuels the groovy atmosphere. Jack Reynor who plays the lead character's older brother is quite likable as well, a character who's stuck on the sidelines of the world of adult responsibilities. This guy comes as a form of inspiration to the lead character's optimism and willingness to success.<br/><br/>Sing Street is a heartwarming, feel-good musical comedy with an appeal that is nearly irresistible. This movie is an elegant surprise that is likely to appeal to more than just the crowd of music fanatics. Jim Carney sets out to orchestrate a sensational music-based entry, and it excels greatly here, if not breaking any grounds."

","John Carney's ""Sing Street"" is much closer to ""The Commitments"" than it is to ""Once"" but like ""Once"" it's on a much smaller scale, (a kind of ""Bugsy Malone"" version of ""The Commitments""), but if the scale is small both its heart and its humour are pretty massive and its mostly young cast are fabulous, (and the adults aren't half bad either). You could write the plot on a pinhead, (boy meets girl, boy starts band, boy gets girl), but plot is the last thing you go to a movie like this for, There's more tonic in ""Sing Street"" than there is in a dozen pints of plain."

","This is one of the most fun and genuine movies I've seen in a while. The most basic and tried concept of a guy starting a band to impress a girl is executed with such freshness and color. And when the music starts playing you will wish Sing Street was a real band. Easily one of my favorite movie bands. The acting was surprisingly good and Lucy Boynton performance was fantastic. Sing Street is an absolute gem and I promise you will feel younger by just watching it."

","This movie reminds me how much I miss music videos from a time when all a band needed was themselves and a good looking chick. And with the exception of that syrupy ballad near the end. Sincere and heartfelt in the best ways, genuinely funny (at times), and has a great message for young people who want to find away to express the bad things going on their lives. Maybe not the most original message, but it's told well and these young actors are good at selling it (I also liked the main kid's brother very much, sort of like an Irish Chris Pratt from Parks & Rec).<br/><br/>One odd thing... what was with that cutaway as Sing Street was practicing for the first time where the one guy's mother goes into her bedroom to use a vibrator(?) We also never see her again. I guess I should accept the mystery but... uh what?"

","John Carney now has a trilogy of these ""let's make music and fall in love"" movies. Sure, they're mostly the same, but they're all delightful. This one is probably my least favorite of the three, but it's still very enjoyable. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays Conor, a teen boy with a dissolving family, who ends up in a new school when his parents can't afford a better one. He's immediately the focus of bullying, but that doesn't matter at all when he runs into Raphina (Lucy Boynton, a born star if there ever was one). He lies to her, telling her he's in a band, so he and his friends quickly form one. This film is all about the romance, unlike the previous two films where the romance developed from the music. Yet the love of music is a strong theme in this one, too, with Conor's older brother (Jack Reynor) tutoring him passionately on the subject. And the music the band, Sing Street, ends up creating is excellent, at least if you're cool with '80s music. Carney's trilogy probably represents the last three times I felt I had to buy a soundtrack as soon as I left the theater. I'd be perfectly fine with Carney just hitting these same notes in the future, because they're lovely."

","The movie starts with some promise: Irish boy with difficult home life in new school starts a band. This is the same story line, done with much more intelligence and verve, as the film The Commitments. The dialogue here is boring and silly, the acting amateurish, and the ending ridiculous. The music is OK, if you can believe a group of kids get together and a week later are playing original songs. Except for the lead, none of the characters has any depth. The director/writer never develops the personalities in the band or shows how they work together. The band starts because they want to make a music video, and the whole movie is like a music video: lots of staging and no believable backstory."

I initially gave this a 9 but had to change it seeing the ridiculous praise.<br/><br/>Again, I stress it's perfectly good and you should see it BUT Sing Street is really overrated. It's one of those I enjoyed but you realize flaws in retrospect.<br/><br/>The movie is a thematic mess. It's about ""living the dream"" (and is really one the nose with it) but fails to explore it (especially since La La Land did it way better). Instead of being about him doing the band because he enjoys it, he does it entirely for Raphina completely undercutting its main theme. He is set up as a music prodigy but his brother and friend end up knowing way more and are more deserving of living the dream. Then, he intentionally stops trying in school, fails and is okay with it. This is such an insult to real musicians who go to school to learn the nature of music OR at least have SOME talent!!<br/><br/>Possible spoiler: Then the end is even more ridiculous. He runs away with Raphina to England. It works as feel good but makes no sense: how will he pay? where will he stay? how does he plan on getting accepted anywhere with no talent? what happens when he and Raphina go through a high school break up like EVERY other high school? what will he tell his parents?<br/><br/>This movie is a ridiculous, overrated movie that is perfectly okay.﻿"

","Wonderful narrative, cinematography, and plot. Stunning visuals. A masterpiece. According to Limonoso Tech, these are the IMDb phrases that presage an Oscar nomination, and this film is worthy. 2016 is the year that John Carney surpassed Terrence Malick as our greatest living director. Carney is one of the few remaining auteurs; what can he do next? This film represents the future, a la '85, and Lucy Boynton is the next Keira Knightley. Every music video is perfect and the songs are wonderful. I like how the hero deals with a bully, saying: ""You're just material for my songs."" The ending is satisfying a la ""The Graduate.""

","As charming and cute as it is dramatic and heartfelt, Sing Street does a beautiful job of touching on so many different themes whilst still keeping its musical wits about it. The film does a great service to staying true to that special era of 80's music, hitting almost every beat in genre, and doing so in way that building the characters and story. And the story and character are nothing short of perfect, in handling an emotional drama, and giving the audience funny, compelling, and relatable characters. I hate to compare it to John Carney's other great musical film, Once but he has a certain talent when it comes to writing a film around the music, and having the music tell the story in a special way. It always puts a smile on my face when a song comes together in the way they do in a John Carney movie. I highly recommend you see this movie."

","Now that the usual slew of paid shill IMDb reviews are in, it's time for the sober minded crowd who actually care about the music of the eighties, and film, to set things straight.<br/><br/>From the moment the all knowing, witty mentor of an older brother tells our little 15 something hero and his father that Duran Duran is an artistic statement that belies criticism and is conquerable to The Beatles, I knew something would be sorely remiss here. In fact, Duran Duran seems to be the sole band of any real importance to the eighties if you fall for this ridiculous film's 'perspective'. <br/><br/>I can even see a wry little uncomfortable smile on Simon Le Bon's face (whom I have met), as even his ego would allow that such comparisons are ludicrous. Oh yes, sorry, I get it now. He has been assured royalties from a whole new generation being sold his music as a result of this crappy teensploitation film.<br/><br/>Where are bands such as The Clash, who after all, were voted the most important band of the eighties by Rolling Stone - despite their already breaking up by 82? It is quite obvious that his movie intentionally glosses over any of the truly revolutionary artists of the UK eighties wave, such as Elvis Costello, The Stranglers, The Pretenders, The Police, The Specials, Joy Division, and so, so many others that simply do not exist in this telling of the tale to a new generation.<br/><br/>Perhaps these bands would be too dangerous an influence (certainlyThe Clash) to let today's teenagers in on?<br/><br/>Okay, there is one snippet of a Clash song, and maybe a couple other decent tracks quickly used, but without mention by name of anyone of importance except... Duran Duran. Oh, and Hall & Oates do get treated to the same sort of rip off song writing created by some professional song ripper offer paid by the film producers, that are barely acceptable as music except that they are such accurate rip offs - which of course our 15 year old hero is supposed to have written with his musical cohort who okay, kind of looks like The Edge... but once again, forget U2 even being mentioned by these Irish teenagers in 1985. Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Jokingly, they recruit a token black band member and whereas this could have been a great vehicle by which his character would develop and show them up for their stupidity... in fact he remains exactly that. A token black cast member without any real dialogue. Wow.<br/><br/>The 'love interest' between a milky faced 15 year old and a mid twenties actress (playing a young girl) too, whose character wants to 'get into' modeling and looks more like she's almost too old for prostitution is just bewildering to me. How can anyone take it seriously? Both characters obviously have little in the way of real love for one another, but simply find each other advantageous and desirable for their own self images. Perfect brain washing for today's teens.<br/><br/>Because yes, although compared naturally by many to The Commitments, which is a real story that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves good music, this is blatantly targeted solely at today's teenagers who will find a 15 year old boy being persecuted for wearing heavy make up to school so close to their own painful deeply significant struggles today... <br/><br/>To any adult who was there though, and cared about it, it is a criminal whitewashing of musical history. One I submit is not without intent on the part of the film makers.<br/><br/>The final scene is absolutely priceless though. It's as though these film makers wanted to end by showing how ridiculous the whole thing has been all along... and to think you lasted to this final absurdity of an ending."

If you enjoy the film I'm happy for you ... but I fail to understand!<br/><br/>IMDb requires that reviews have at least 10 lines of text (strange) but I cannot write more about this production without giving away part of the story and without picking out the flaws in some people who may not be ready for such criticism."
"austin0731","8","3","5","3 January 2017"," The third installment of John Carney's musical films
","So apparently Sing Street is made by the people behind ""Begin again"" and ""Once"", two films that I have thoroughly enjoyed. A running theme throughout all three seems to be its theme of depicting musicians and their 'life of struggles'. All three are small budget but packs very meaningful stories completed with beautiful scores and wonderfully performed musical pieces.<br/><br/>Sing street depicts a story of how music and creating music is a cure to the struggles of everyday life. The idea of Irish teens moving to London and the mainland to follow a certain ideal or dream is very much reflected in the story itself. Depicting the risk taking attitude of youth. At the same time featuring the excitement of the creative process and developing a creative idea into a physical medium.<br/><br/>I am most impressed with the performance delivered by Jack Reynor, previously know for ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" where he did not have such a major role. His depiction of a washed up high school dropout is masterfully portrayed and his character acted as such a brilliant mirror to our main character, 'the failed predecessor'. To learn this character's back story through a burst of emotions from him really made the character possess so much more depth and it is all thanks to Jack Reynor's brilliant portrayal.<br/><br/>This film was really great, continuing the trilogy of films that followed this sort of formula yet being unique in their own ways."
"Veteransson","9","3","5","3 January 2017"," Funny, sweet, joyful movie with a lot of heart
","'Sing Street' is set in Dublin during the 80's, when teenager Conor, subliminally portrayed by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, is forced to change schools due to the incapability of his parents to make ends meet. Across the street from his new school, where the protagonist is challenged by the new environment from the first day on, Conor notices a mysterious girl (an outstanding Lucy Boynton). Eager to impress this mysterious girl, he makes up that he plays in a band. So Conor kinda has to start a band now.<br/><br/>'Sing Street' is another music movie written and directed by John Carney, who has had past successes with 'Begin Again' and foremost 'Once'. This time Carney revisits his childhood and it pay off big time. It's a sweet, joyful movie about so much more than impressing the girl. First of all, the music is great. With the help of his brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor with a knock-out performance, Conor tries to find his identity as an artist and moves like a loose cannon from one source of inspiration to another. From Duran Duran, to David Bowie, to the Cure. The songs he composes together with his band, an ensemble of misfits, is catchy, fun, very eighties, with lyrics that shape his character and serve the plot. While the musical aspect of the movie makes the movie lots of fun, there are various powerful scenes that make 'Sing Street' one of the best movies of 2016. One scene where Brendan talks to Conor about their mother, enjoying the last rays of sun of the day seems like a small, simple scene but is so very powerful and plain devastating. It are those moments of great dialogue and symbolism (and not coincidentally most of the time with Jack Reynor in them) that make this movie grow on you even days or weeks after watching it. <br/><br/>This coming of age movie also has the typical romantic story line. The dork trying to get the hot girl is a concept used in many, maybe too many movies and has become a cliché. Here, you just don't care about the cliché because the story line is handled in such a sweet and tender way that you simply want all the clichés to play out as you expect them to, because you want to see them played out in this exact way. Walsh-Peelo and Boynton have an amazing chemistry, with great dialogue, sometimes with a philosophical character. He's only 14 years old, she's 17, but being 'happy sad' puts the oldest among us to think. The dialogue wasn't only strong between these two characters. Over the entire movie, so much is said with subtle choice of words. Nobody ever explicitly states how they feel or what happened in their lives. instead of plainly pointing out how a character feels, the dialogue guides our perception about the feelings and background of a character. This is the dialogue in its purest form. This subtle guiding of our perception is also achieved by the amazing performances of the actors. <br/><br/>Music, trying to find your identity as a person and artist, and love are three main recurring themes through the movie. But the movie reaches another zenith when you realize it's about more than all of that. It's about the relationship between two brothers in a broken family. The relationship between Conor and Brendan is perhaps the best part of the movie, again because of strong performances by both actors, and again because of the way it was handled by John Carney. Brendan's character will be relatable for every first born of the family.<br/><br/>Sing Street is a must see, extremely joyful, sweet and funny movie. Besides the fun, the movie hides many layers that will make the movie stick with you for a long time. Hopefully, this movie will receive the appreciation it deserves during the upcoming award season."

His performance pushes some of the themes in this movie, and in doing that he brings a sort of depth in this movie. He and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo work so well together and it really takes there scenes to a whole other level. Jack Reynor really steals the show, and you leave this movie wanting to see more of his character. His character arc is so well written, he is such a relateable person that you will learn to love very quickly in this movie.<br/><br/>Every performance in this movie is good, including the band itself, all the kids work so well together, and the chemistry in this movie is amazing. <br/><br/>The music in this movie is so good, some of the best songs from a film this year, I don't normally like rock music but it is so good in this movie I sometimes listen to it, which is something I don't normally do. <br/><br/>The themes in this movie are so well realized, this movie is so well written you can take so much from this film.

","The film begins well, however, it seems to be lacking the Ireland- in-the-80s vibe best captured in The Commitments. The lead actors are far too well behaved to be Irish children from that era (I experienced 1980s Ireland, so I have insight). <br/><br/>But, gradually at first, then quickly, the plot seemed to lose cohesion and continuity. I could not tell how much time had elapsed between the scenes, and I am pretty sure there were some chronological inconsistencies that I do not now recall. <br/><br/>If you have yet to see this cinematic abomination, leave when the protagonist's love interest leaves for England, because things are about to become absolutely unbearable. <br/><br/>I saw the flick on a date and almost abandoned her due to the unsettling waves of cringing-shamefulness coursing through my cerebellum all the way down to my socks via my spine and sciatica. Had I been there alone, I would no doubt have biffed my Coke at the screen and walked out. But I could see that my date was loving the film, needless to say, I lost all respect for her and never called her again. <br/><br/>It seemed designed to indulge someone's weird sugar coated fantasies. Just pure cringe. The cringe peaks at the end gig, they were supposed to be a bunch of kids playing at the school disco, but there were violins and all sorts in the mix of these utterly dreadful songs that were clearly not written by teenage boys. There was that terrible scene with the headmaster, in which the plug would literally have been pulled on the band; to say nothing of that 1950s Americana scene which almost made me defecate in my trousers. <br/><br/>And when you thought 'OK, this must be it, the credits will surely save me', it continues. There's a particularly bad scene with the older miserable brother, where he said ""you know I used to play guitar"" and his younger brother is all surprised; how could you not know that your brother - who lives in the same house as you - plays an instrument?! <br/><br/>Even though it started OK, the fact that it became such an omni- shambles as it progressed did irreversible and retrospective damage to the entire movie.

As our protagonist hears new styles of music, his style and the type of music he writes changes to reflect his new interests, so while he starts writing poppy tunes, he's soon writing music influenced by The Cure, Spandau Ballet and Hall & Oates.

The chemistry between the protagonist and his friends feels real, the sourced song soundtrack is top notch and the band come up with several memorable 80s-style tunes of their own. The film's best aspect though is how it taps into the rising popularity of music videos in the mid-1980s with a superb analysis of Duran Duran's 'Rio' clip, plus an awesome segment in which the friends film a video clip of their own (""The Riddle of the Model"") and absolutely nail it right down to the long flowing costumes. What exists here beyond the basic story of a bunch of friends and their love of music is somewhat less interesting. There are standard bullies, nasty teachers who abuse their powers and our hero has a rather humdrum dysfunctional home life. Unremarkable as these aspects of the film may be, the film still stacks up quite well overall since the music is so often in focus. There is also a delightful portion of the film heavily influenced by the prom sequence in 'Back to the Future', and while the protagonist's strained relationship with his parents does not resonate too much, he has some great moments alone with his college dropout older brother who rues the fact that he was the first born and had to suffer their unstable home life for longer."

","I entered the theatre for Sing Street with little clues what it is about, and stumbled into a beautiful film work.<br/><br/>The film delves into the human connections of Cosmo. Before addressing the most nuanced relationship with Raphina, some analytic inks should be spilled on other minor relationships. Starting with his family, Cosmo is raised in a home full of dynamics. The torn marriage of his parents accentuates itself as the film progresses. The children seem fine with it, and regard with a matter-of-fact altitude. The notion of ""happy sad"" is most clearly evident in this relationship. Long gone is the happiness of the couple. Even Cosmo's brother, Brendan, pointed out that the marriage is due to the giving birth of him as a result of thirst for sex. Yet, it is preposterous to take this as an indication of the modest amount of love that the mother and father has for each other. The image of his father sleeping on the floor so that the bed is fully his mother's conjures up a sense of affection. If this act of sacrifice is not suggestive of romance, what else is better to be? Broken is the marriage it may seem, this does not suffice to be an indicator of the lack of love. Love, hate are not a binary concept, nor are they two ends of a continuum; they exist largely independently.<br/><br/>Cosmo's relationship with his brother is no less bewitching. A college drop-out, Brendon seems to stay in for most of the time, so as to avoid encountering with life. This point may not be so conspicuous at first, but it reveals itself in later parts. Enthusiasm fills him every time he shows Cosmo what good music is. The fruits that Cosmo acquires reminisces Brandan of his teenage years, when he was as talented and successfully. The thin but apparent line between his pathetic current state of being and his brother's propitious prospect as a reflection of his own past fuels his indignation. Although it is depicted that the source of frustration is vented on Cosmo, little does it mean to incur guilt in Cosmo, but rather in himself for neglecting the once flourishing years of his life. <br/><br/>Other minor characters develop intriguing relationships with Cosmo. Eamon forms a close friendship with Cosmo: they work together to make music. Eamon also necessarily enables Cosmo to translate his music ideas into tangible notes and compositions. His willingness to help, even when Cosmo out of nowhere crash by at night, highlights the beauty of such a friendship. The bully Barry at first appears an intimidation, then docile towards Cosmo's confidence, and eventually deferential as he works for his band. Brother Baxter is an embodiment of suppression, or more precisely, the conventional and conservative school of thoughts that resist change. He is essential as an avenue to accentuate Cosmo's expression of self-identity.<br/><br/>The key character, besides the protagonist, is of course Raphina. She governs most of Cosmo's thoughts and therefore his actions. Cosmo's decision to form a band is a response to his encounter with Raphina. His songs revolve much around Raphina. His wish to impress her is the main determinant of his writing process.<br/><br/>There are several vivid images in this film that I adore. One of those is the scene of his mother immersed herself in the few last sunlight on the threshold of the house, cherishing a glass of alcohol reading newspaper. The poetic imagery brings home the notion of appreciating the trivial elements of life that may seem insignificant but in fact instrumental in the fulfilment of life.<br/><br/>I find myself catapulted into thoughts for the very last scene. Cosmo and Raphina venture out to the vast water to reach Britain. Inordinate amounts of uncertainty is in direct contrast with their jubilance to arrive in Britain. They are met by heavy waves and a drizzle, which are open to various interpretations. At first, the thought of them failing and returning back to Dublin crossed my mind. However, I tried my best to put my imagination at work, and then made a correlation with a line said by Cosmo earlier, about after a rain the continent where Britain is situated will appear crystal clear to people on the pier. This provides enough evidence to make a plausible interpretation that eventually their aspirations will be realised, despite the adversity that they may face.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm rather impressed by the film. The time I spent for it was truly worthwhile, for this piece of art is what makes film so a powerful medium."

","If you only hear about John Carney's ""Sing Street"" you might think that it has the same story as ""The Commitments"". They do have similar plots but go in their own directions. This one incorporates the theme of the bullied kid. In this case, a boy gets moved to a new school in 1980s Dublin and starts a band. The movie at once serves as a coming-of-age story and also a look at its era. The mom mentions that Ireland doesn't allow divorce (it now does).<br/><br/>I thought that the most impressive scene was the ""Back to the Future"" sequence, where the principal dances (naturally it turns out to be in the boy's imagination). When you look at the kind of school that this is - and what a jerk the principal is - it's understandable why he and his friends decide to start a band. There has to be a way for people to unleash their creativity, especially under these circumstances.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is worth seeing. I now want to see Carney's earlier ""Once"", which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song (most people probably didn't expect it to win since Disney's ""Enchanted"" was also nominated in that category).<br/><br/>I recommend it."

","This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" is a low budget film, with no fancy sets and no fancy clothes. However, it has this mysterious aura around it, and I like it a lot. The main character, Conor, is a very likable youngster, and I particularly feel for him because of his experience in school with the bullies and the headmaster. His friends are all very realistic and down to earth. The whole film breathes of positivity, as it tells a tale of chasing dreams, breaking out of the comfort zone and living the life you want. Maybe that's what attracts me to the film. And of course, the very nice songs that the band performs also make me like the film loads. It is unusual that I like the songs in a film about music, but in this film I find myself singing along to that song ""Drive it Like You Stole It"". I enjoyed watching ""Sing Street""."
"GusF","Null","2","3","5 July 2016"," An absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking
","Taking place in Dublin in 1985, this is an absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking. It has a superb script by John Carney which hits all of the right notes and his direction is certainly up to the task. The film has an excellent soundtrack featuring various styles of music from the period such as the Cure, the Clash, A-ha, Duran Duran, the Jam, Spandau Ballet and Joe Jackson as well as original compositions written by Carney, Gary Clark, Glen Hansard and others. However, in spite of the fact that it was likewise written for the film, ""Go Now"" by Adam Levine seemed like a somewhat awkward fit as it sounded more 2010s than 1980s. The film paints a convincing portrait of dysfunctional families, some of which are considerably more dysfunctional than others. It perfectly captures the essence of 1980s Ireland, which was not exactly a land of opportunity. Actually, Ireland has never been a land of opportunity.<br/><br/>The film stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in a very good performance as Conor Lalor, a 15-year-old boy who is pulled out of his posh, fee paying Jesuit run school (presumably either Belvedere or Gonzaga) and forced to attend the rough innercity school Synge Street CBS due to the fact that his family is having serious financial problems. Walsh-Peelo is very impressive in his first film role, let alone his first leading role, but he is an even better musician. Incidentally, his elder brother Tadhg was in my year in law at UCD. I don't recall ever actually speaking to him but he always seemed like a nice guy. As Conor's parents Robert and Penny's marriage is rapidly deteriorating, his home life is far from ideal. He finds comfort in his love of music. Considering that his new school has a very different atmosphere from his old one, it is not a smooth transition. In his first week, he is targeted by both the school bully Barry Bray and the sadistic headmaster Brother Baxter, who objects to the fact that he is wearing brown shoes in contravention of the strict black shoe policy. After he meets a 16-year-old model named Raphina, Conor tells her that he just so happens to be looking for a model to be in his band's first music video. The only problem is that he does not really have a band. Thankfully, Conor has made his first friend at the school in the form of a budding entrepreneur named Darren Mulvey, who agrees to manage the band and introduces him to the eccentric rabbit enthusiast Eamon who can reportedly ""play every instrument known to mankind.""<br/><br/>Lucy Boynton is extremely strong as Raphina, a seemingly strong, confident girl who uses her air of mystery and sophistication to mask her vulnerability and inner pain. The band's first original song ""The Riddle of the Model"" concerns the perception that people become less interesting the more that you learn about them as anything is initially possible (at least in your head). However, Raphina becomes more and more interesting as we learn more about her. She is without a doubt the film's strongest and most memorable character. Raphina dreams of moving to London to start her career as a model, in large part because she desperately wants to escape her often traumatic life in Ireland. Her mother is a manic depressive who is in and out of hospital while her father, a drunkard, was killed in a car accident a few years earlier. In the film's most heart-breaking, gut-wrenching moment, Raphina tells Conor – albeit not in so many words – that her father sexually abused her. As a result, he gains a new insight into not only Raphina but his own situation as he realises that his home life is nowhere near as bad as it could be. In comparison to many other teen films, Conor and Raphina's relationship is unusual in that it never goes beyond kissing. In that sense, it is very pure and sweet and, as such, it serves as an effective contrast to Raphina's serious personal problems. I think that Conor means so much to Raphina in part because he is one of the few people in her life who has not taken advantage of her, one way or another.<br/><br/>Conor's extremely close relationship with his elder brother Brendan, played very well by Jack Reynor, is just as important to the storyline as his relationship with Raphina. Brendan offers a great deal of valuable advice on both musical and romantic matters. A college dropout, he initially appears to be the stereotypical Generation X stoner and pop philosopher but Carney expertly deconstructs the stereotype by revealing that he regrets his wasted potential. As much as he loves Conor, he is clearly envious of him to some degree as he is the golden boy in the family but he eventually gets over it. Ben Carolan is an absolute laugh riot as Darren, who gets all of the funniest lines and delivers them impeccably. There is an inspired comic moment when he suggests getting Ngig, the school's sole black student, to join the band for the sole reason that it would look cool to have a black guy in the line-up. Mark McKenna is very good as Eamon, Conor's writing partner who becomes his best friend. Aidan Gillen, the best known actor in the film in or out of Ireland, and Maria Doyle Kennedy are excellent as Conor's parents Robert and Penny. The same is true of Don Wycherly as the film's main antagonist Brother Baxter, who physically assaults Conor in a very powerful scene. Ian Kenny is perfectly cast as Barry who, like Raphina, Brendan and Penny, is a far more complicated character than he appears at first glance.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent film which is just as effective in its character development as in its treatment of music."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","4 July 2016"," A lot of fun
","John Carney was surely someone who I very much looked forward to after creating the indie gem Once. Begin Again was solid, but a little inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. This is much more like it. Boasting a coming-of-age drama as well as a music film, he unleashes some really memorable and likable characters that carry us through this charming, sweet film. I don't think it does anything too extraordinary, and the music isn't to the same level as the music from Once (few music is) but it's really good and entertaining, not to mention very emotionally- investing. That final scene is also really magical and beautiful and surely to resonate with a lot."
"jdesando","Null","2","3","9 May 2016"," Delightful Musical with laughs and heart.
","""Maybe you're living in my world. I'm not living in yours. You're just material for my songs."" Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) <br/><br/>By all measures Sing Street is just another teen-band birth in the style of the second British invasion. Difficult love, broken homes, and rebellion are plentiful. However it's not just another cliché because the sentiment is real and the tone light to make a thoroughly enjoyable musical from the pen of writer-director John Carney. His Once set the standard for reasonable romance coming from the street into our hearts.<br/><br/>In 1985, fifteen-year old Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) switches to a Christian Brothers school because his current Jesuit school is too expensive. The ensuing chaos comes out of his posh look and a disciplinarian Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley), who bans Cosmo's brown shoes (all students are supposed to wear black). The universal truth, however, is that music will transform Cosmo's band, formed to catch fetching, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), by inviting her to act in a video for a band he has yet to form.<br/><br/>The feckless parents and the usual bully who changes to good guy make appearances, as do the dorky but lovable band members, a motley crew to be sure. Their diversity, from diminutive dweeb to cool black keyboardist, Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), is enchanting; the creation of songs is gently witnessed, not always an element of any musical history, fact or fiction.<br/><br/>Arguably the most endearing relationship of Cosmo's life is with his brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who could be Seth Rogan's brother. Brendan is a free spirit who has lost his chance to make it in music but has endless patience with his young brother in providing him the wisdom and means to break loose. His sincere love for his brother is a touchingly true part of an otherwise romantic dream.<br/><br/>Mostly the musical emphasizes the mandate for talent to will its way to success, despite the counter-circumstances that keep him home and quiet his talent. London is, as usual, the promised land, even for kids from Dublin, and several times in this romance eyes look across the sea to that great island with its transforming city.<br/><br/>Sing Street is a formula and a most enjoyable one. Filmmaker Carney will bring a tear to your eye as the young'uns break from the imprisoning world of broken homes and repressive schools to play the music of freedom.<br/><br/>Often cited in Sing Street, ""finding happiness in sadness,"" is a mantra worthy of this musical. I'm not arguing with that cliché because I had too much fun watching it play out."
"zephanier","10","1","1","6 January 2020"," An Inspiration to Live
","This movie has no conflicts, there's no ups and downs - just constant ups. At first glance it seems as if the script
is simple and dry and that it required no creativity. It seems to be just about a kid and his teenage-band-fightingparents-inlove phase.<br/><br/>But what makes Sing street different is that the protagonist begins with a clear identity. Which is the typical ending/resolution of a coming of age movie. In Sing streets he begins by not giving a damn about his toxic, unloving parents. And his journey was simply living life to 'really living life'.<br/><br/>The film dips into deep topics and characters that live with them. And is tied together through a bands passion for music. This film really reminds you of your problems but inspires you and reminds you that they don't mean much, that this is your one life and seems to resurface you're passions.<br/><br/>Its and inspiration to live."
"CubsandCulture","10","1","1","26 July 2019"," With this film, Carney cements himself as one the great musical directors of all time
","I saw Once (Carney's first major film) about a year ago. I immediately purchased Begin Again and Sing Street from Amazon after completing it. I watched Begin Again about 2 days after it arrived. And I loved that film as well. But I delayed watching Sing Street for as long as I could. The reason was simple you can only watch a film for the first time once and I didn't want to rush seeing this man's work. I finally gave in and watched Sing Street last night. I am glad I waited and glad I gave in. Like Once and Begin Again, Sing Street is a brilliant film that fits comfortably within the musical genre while being atypical low-key and intimate.<br/><br/>Sing Street is a classic boy meets girl tale centered in Dublin in the mid-80's. A young artistic teenage struggle to find his voice while trying to woo a slightly older girl; their budding love is contrasted with the humanly dysfunctional home life of both and the strife of being in school. It has all the major story beats you expect. There is a bully character. There is a sequence of the straight-laced elders not understanding the teens artistic expression. The older libertine brother of the teen is a voice of wisdom and of warning. Carney's script, much like Begin Again being a reworked A Star is Born, conforms to the coming of age tale. What sets it apart is the details. It contains every story beat one would desire. It is has personal (it is clearly inspired by Carney's life) authentic vibe to it that makes the tropes real again.<br/><br/>But the glory of this film is the direction. The handheld quasi-documentary camera work-especially in the musical scenes-strips the artifice from the story and it truly makes you feel connected to these characters. The movie feels utterly real especially in the precise nature of the teen's naïve attempts to be creative. The direction is beguiling in how it makes spectacle out of intimacy. The film contains a very inventive camera pan that works as a time jump cut, it also has a in narrative fantasy sequence for one of its songs. It somehow manages to keep the film very close and low key but also bold and striking in its grandeur in both sequences. It turns the musical form back onto itself and completes the re-invention of the form started in Once.<br/><br/>The music is, of course, wonderful. It is by the same composer as much of the music from Once. It has the same raw but poignant energy to it. More than that it feels as if the characters are creating it. It has the youthful quality it should. It is good but unpolished. The simple elegance you would expect from a gifted teenage.<br/><br/>I adore this film so much."
"gabineve","10","1","1","22 July 2019"," This film feels like a hug
","I have to be honest, I only decided to watch this film because of the actress Lucy Boynton, who I really like, and I had no expectations whatsoever. The first 10 minutes felt like an ordinary british film, and my only motivation was to wait for Boynton to appear in the screen. But quickly, she was not the only element that made me want to watch the whole thing.
Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about music (specifically), it was about dreams and friends.
Halfway through it, I was really deepened, and in love with all the characters.
Just watch it, it's a good way to spend your night and will learn something from it."

But I believe that anyone from any era could watch this and have nothing but praise. It's simple, understated even, but with a fantastic original soundtrack, cast and script that left me both laughing and crying at the same time- in the best way possible.
While Feargal Sharkey wrote about Teenage Kicks- with all its hopes and dreams, this film displays it in a way that will encourage you to never waste a precious moment - as anything is possible. Enjoy!"

"edgamu","10","1","1","28 December 2018"," The music is great
","This film works in so many levels, but I will stick to the music: Sing Street explores the musical genres of the 80s and 90s and brilliantly combines them together. The band's first song is written in the New Romantics style as a reference to Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, ""Beautiful Sea"" is a nod at The Cure (Cosmo even stands and plays guitar like Robert Smith) and ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" combines the rhythm of Hall and Oates' ""Maneater"" with Joe Jackson's chords from the ""Stepping Out"" era. ""Brown Shoes"" is more like a 90s song with the distorted guitars. Brilliant job of the musical director!"

Actually it's not really like The Commitments at all. The Commitments is not sweet. While that film smacks of hope, what's on screen is brutal, dirty and real. Sing Street is a different beast. It's romantic and full of youthful abandon, great music and three fantastic characters in Ferdio Walsh-Peelo (awesome name), Lucy Boynton and the scene stealing Jack Reynor. I defy anyone with a heart to watch this and not gasp, smile and want to punch the air. Fantastic stuff."
"sharky_55","8","1","1","7 April 2018"," Drive it like you stole it.
","I had forgotten how utterly full of joy and hope Sing Street is, about a teenager growing up in 80s working class Dublin who refuses to simply lie down and accept the cards that have been dealt to him. That this revelatory journey begins with a casual fib to try and impress a pretty girl is apt; Cosmo falls into the juvenile trap of pretending to be someone else for another, but we marvel as he climbs out of that trap and comes of age in the process. <br/><br/>The film has touches of the usual kitchen-sink realism, but avoids the pitfalls of completely swooping down to that gloomy level. Cosmo finds his own solace, slamming the door on his parent's screaming and returning to strumming his acoustic guitar. They're so poor he can't even afford a new pair of black school shoes, but sports winged lashes and rebellious streaks in his hair. Editors Andrew Marcus and Julian Ulrichs make heartbreak and highlights out of the way he retreats into musical daydream, alternating close-ups of Conor's twitching face and an unmoving set of doors before seamlessly shifting into a full blown dream sequence. <br/><br/>That 'dress rehearsal' of their smash hit ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" speaks to Sing Street at its best: loud, brash, and bold, with songs that serenade a life at its breaking point. The scene features an eye-popping colour scheme, sitcom-esque high key lighting, and a wacky ensemble of characters emerging from the crowd in even wackier costumes. If only life were like this. But the boys and their band make their own magic, evolving from a rag-tag bunch in a makeshift setup next to a back alley dumpster. Their music is their bond and their escape; for Cosmo an avenue to splatter his heartache onto notation (even as it is too late for his college-dropout older brother, who reveals his own obscured failings in a startling monologue), for schoolyard bully Barry a chance to escape his abusive, dead-end household. <br/><br/>Cosmo sets his heart on Lucy Boynton's Raphina, a model with an elven elegance about her, and a wardrobe that sees her walk straight off a magazine cover. The relationship is so unbalanced it's almost unfair; Cosmo has already fallen in love before their first conversation, while Raphina's juggling another pretty boy - no, man - on the side. In a classic move, he projects a whole range of fantasies and ideals onto the model, making her the centre of his attention and first music video. Yet John Carney unravels this fairy tale with such finesse, stripping away the mystique from a girl who is in reality only a year older than Conor, and a lot less worldlier than he really thinks. Only then can they be true to themselves, and then each other. <br/><br/>I'm still not as captivated by the ending as I was by the finale of Carney's 2007 masterpiece Once, which seemed to stick truer to the characters. Sometimes romance and real life are at odds with each other, and it takes strength to admit it. What Cosmo and Raphina set off to achieve isn't entirely implausible, but it's brave, far braver than anything else they have aspired to in their short lives (Carney shoots it almost like the prom sequence, the boundary between fantasy and reality hazy). But they're futurists, after all. Nostalgia and cover bands are a thing of the past, for those still sulking around in Dublin. Their time is now. Grab the wheel and own it."

"mac-73920","10","3","6","9 July 2017"," Musical coming of age gold!!
","I have to start this recommendation by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of the director John Carney. 'Once' is one of my all time favorite movies and I love his style and blend of original music with storytelling. Here we have a really great coming of age story about a young boy (Conor) that has to adjust to changing home life as well as a nightmarish new school, how does he manage this...music. For anyone who enjoyed music growing up it'd be hard to deny that it helps shape youths as well as often help you cope or breathe hope and joy into the everyday challenge of just figuring out life as you mature. That pretty much is the essence of the story, listening to and creating his own music is the tool to help him get the girl of his dreams and possibly forge a new future in the backdrop of a jobless and fairly lifeless Dublin, Ireland of the mid 1980s. <br/><br/>The original music from the movie is fantastic and it sounds like it could have been released at the same time as many of the bands Conor is influenced by such as 'Duran Duran', and 'The Cure.' The whole admiration of music and specifically the new era of music video as a new art is all really authentic, and to me his brother Brenan really is the best character in the movie as the idealist pothead who wants his brother to chase the dreams he didn't. Their final moment together was probably the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Its rare that I watch a movie that I want to see again immediately after I see it but that's precisely how I felt. This really is unique and has something to offer everyone from drama, laughs, and a few tugs on the heartstrings all set to a back drop of really great music.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE!!"

","John Carney returns to his hometown of Dublin but this time to 1985 with a group of kids forming a band, rekindling his childhood what ifs and wishful happy endings. I adore Carney's inspirational Once (2007) going straight out and getting the soundtrack. Little did I know, that this wouldn't be the only music masterpiece Carney will come out with. I missed Begin Again (2013) but this urges me to now watch it. <br/><br/>We follow Cosmo, played excellently by newbie Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, who gets moved from his expensive school to the Synge Street Catholic Boys School due to his parents struggles. What appears to be a step backward eventually turns into an accidental chain of events leading to the formation of a band called 'Sing Street'. <br/><br/>It's all about the girl, and isn't it always? Social Network tells us Facebook came about because of a girl, James Cameron tells us the Titanic sunk because of a girl. This girl in question is Raphina, played by the gorgeous Lucy Boynton who is little older than Cosmo but with boyish creative courage, their relationship blossoms as he forms a band to impress her. <br/><br/>The film started to remind me of The Girl Next Door (2004) with Cosmo being Emile Hirsch, Raphina being Elisha Cuthbert and Paul Dano being Eamon who's played by Mark McKenna who, incidentally doesn't like acting. Chris Marquette would be Darren who's played by the tiny yet confident Ben Carolan and the minions from Girl Next Door making up the rest of the band. The colourful, misfit characters are greatly portrayed including keyboardist Ngig, Father Baxter, Bully Barry and other band members Garry and Larry whose bass is larger than him. <br/><br/>Raphina quickly becomes his inspiration though never openly admitting to it (us boys are stupid) and he gets great words of wisdom from his older, drop-out, stoner brother, Brendan played by recent Tranformers starrer, Jack Reynor. His script is incredible, especially his 'paving the way' speech, thought he looked like a hippy Irish version of Chris Pratt. I don't think he can escape that and don't think it's a bad thing. <br/><br/>It brought me back to my childhood, reminded me of all those teenage crushes, the lengths boys will go to just catch a glimpse and the heartache that came with it. That innocent attraction without any sexual tension. The chemistry between the two, both together and alone is superb, see Raphina's reaction to Cosmo's love letters disguised as songs on a cassette. <br/><br/>As with all of John Carney's films, the soundtrack is amazing, the songs written and performed solely for this film are catchy and brilliant. Accompanying is a range of eighties classics that older brother, Brendan uses to educate Cosmo with. Adam Levine returns writing 'Go Now' for the film's end credits. If there's one thing Carney is truly passionate about, it's real music. Street music. The singer/songwriting and what goes on behind these extraordinary artists, earning Once an Oscar and Begin Again nominations. It's his key material and he does it so well. <br/><br/>It's touching, emotional, inspiring and empowering. A definite feel-good movie about boy meets girl that tackles the bullies of life and all in the name of love. Certainly loaded with a cast of actors I'm going to be watching out for. Great gig Sing Street, great gig. One moooore! One mooooooore! <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being full of heart, reminding me of what innocent attraction felt like and for an epic soundtrack. <br/><br/>91% 9/10"
"Zettelhead","3","7","20","10 November 2016"," A fairy tale full of errors
","This is a movie made for young people with all the ingredients they need: pop music, love story, a little family trouble and school environment with all its highs and lows. And for sure: a strong reference to recent fashion. So there is not much to say about the whole plot. It is simple and told straight forward. No surprises, no twists.<br/><br/>Besides that the version of the 80ies given by the director is somehow distorted. There are a lot of errors in historical facts and fashion: the two brothers talk about MTV, but the story takes place in 1985 and MTV Europe was founded in 1987. And by that time it could only be received via cable which was very seldom, especially in poor Ireland. In one scene the protagonist tries to be a Robert Smith imposer and wears a donkey jacket. But this kind of jackets were usually worn by skinheads in the 80ies.<br/><br/>But first an foremost the movie misses the spirit and feeling of the 80ies. Because the feeling of the film is just pure postmodern present age. The music played is mainly pop music the kids were listening to. But the old brother of the protagonist, some weird and misplaced 90ies slacker, is giving all those kiddy-pop-records to his younger brother as if they were long kept treasures. It would be more likely that this guy either would have listened to Birthday Party, Billy Bragg, Wire or some other post-punk underground stuff or still to music from ""his"" time, the late 70ies.<br/><br/>The protagonist changes his design and musical interest like his underwear. But the 80ies were characterized by commitment, credibility and integrity. You chose once if you are mainstream or subculture and than you stuck to it. If you chose to be punk you'd never switched to be new-romantic on the next day. But that is exactly what the characters in the movie do. And it is a way of thinking that perfectly reflects pop cultural habits nowadays that derive mainly out of ignorance.<br/><br/>I played in my first band in 1985 and it definitely felt different - the time, the music, just everything. So if you had your share of the 80ies, forget about this movie. If you are 15 and don't give a damn, enjoy it. But don't expect to learn anything real about the 80ies.<br/><br/>Because it is just a fairy tale with some poorly placed accessories."

","One of my favorite movies of 2016 is this charming, funny, and poignant film set in 1985 Ireland.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" is like an 80s movie filtered through a 2016 perspective, so all of the requisite themes and characteristics of films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"" (and pretty much any film starring Molly Ringwald) are present -- championing nonconformity, resisting the oppression of rigid rules and institutions, montages of upbeat pop songs -- but refreshed to feel relevant in our current cultural climate. This film gave me the feeling I think Richard Curtis films are supposed to, except that his movies are so terrible.<br/><br/>And ""Sing Street"" has a kick-ass soundtrack.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"frenchjuice","7","2","4","30 December 2016"," Blissfully Happy
","If one was to critique a movie based on the emotional feel at the end this movie would probably deserve a 10. Sing Street, directed by John Carney features a young musician who starts a band just to impress a girl, from there it's a semi-adventure dealing with the boy and the girl and their quest to find their ""vocation."" The plot sounds simple enough but the movie's main strength is not in it's plot structure but the emotion the movie makes the audience feel. From thirty minutes in I was smiling through the majority of the movie as I was charmed by the optimistic aura this movie gives. Indeed with the bright colour palette Carney and his cinematographer Yaron Orbach adds to the tone of this film. Instead of portraying real and gritty life they choose to focus on the teenage naivety and energy, sure they do go murky grey when the film calls it but most of the time the colour combination of yellow, green and blue simply hypnotizes the audiences of a more blissfully unaware time. <br/><br/>What adds to the mood is also the music; borrowing inspirations from the pop and rock music of the eighties the music the band plays captures that spirit. The music are all top notch and if this movie had a broader showing it would be in everybody's playlist by now. The songs are played wonderfully by the cast, especially Ferdia Walsh -Peelo the main actor who plays Connor. His initial shyness contrasts well with the progression of the band and his character. All the other characters play their roles great as well, with me believing that they are actually people in the 1980s. <br/><br/>While I am just gushing about the film and it's style there is a reason why this film is a 6 and not a 10. The first is the characters or the lack of the usage of them. While the movie is named after the band Sing Street we hardly get the individual characterization of the band members. While the introduction to them are great and all quirky only one is fleshed out and the rest seem like a backdrop. If the movie developed the band members a bit there could have been interesting dynamic for Connor to play with. As well the plot is too simplistic and because of that there are some forced conflicts that gets dropped quickly. Connor's brother, Brendan seems to have a character development and falls out, the girlfriend Raphina switches her feelings way too much and betrays the already established character from time to time, and there's another character who seem to accept the band only to hate them within the five minutes afterward. <br/><br/>Even with those plot flaws I left my seat pretty happy and was along the character most of the time. If you are feeling sad or just want to be optimistic put this on as it will make you have a smile from cheek to cheek."
"organicsocial","10","2","4","14 September 2016"," Perfect Motivation To Start A Rock Band or Be In One
","Move over School of Rock; Sing Street is the new coming of age rock musical. Here is a young lad singing his heart out for the damsel in distress. I've always thought that impressing some girls is the perfectly sound reason to form a band. There are so many rock legends who started playing the guitar simply to get attention. Loves and crushes or the loss thereof make for a strong gateway to the world of music. However, music is a seductress herself. Eventually, you learn to love it for its own sake. Don't miss this movie if you are a 80's music lover. The soundtrack is a good mix of new wave classics but it also features some of the finest original rock songs produced for a movie. They are groovy and fit in nicely with the plot. Especially ""Riddle of the Model"". But that's all about the music. What about the story?<br/><br/>Set in 1985, in the center of Dublin music scene that saw the rise of many English New Wave bands like Duran Duran and The Cure, semi inspired by synth pop acts like A-ha, Sing Street is one of the best rock music cultural tours you can find in cinema. If you've seen the documentary It Might Get Loud, you'll remember U2 guitarist Edge talking about the early days of the band in Dublin. As he walks through his high school band practice area and the places they would hang out, you get a feeling of nostalgia. Sing Street gives you the same feeling, whether you're Irish or not. Its immersed in the 80s, the education system, the dresses, cassette players, absence of mobile phones and computers, the progressive sounding music and most remarkably, the beginnings of the music video era. It's hard to miss.<br/><br/>Making a period drama musical based around adolescent characters is surely a bold idea, especially when most of your lead cast consists of debutants. The performances are surprisingly intrepid as Ferdia Walsh- Peelo plays the character of Conor, the aspiring teenage musician (who looks like a young Paul McCartney) serenading his muse Raphina, played by a feisty Lucy Boynton. There's Eamon, the band's multi- instrumentalist lead guitarist and Darren, the band manager/cameraman/producer. I must say that it all comes together nicely. We might be looking at a new movie band post School Of Rock. If they are really playing the instruments in the film then they should tour. There are a number of more mature actors setting the premise. For example Conor's family and his Catholic school Principal who, btw are all contributors to his torment. There are great moments with Conor's elder brother Brendan played by Jack Raynor who is a slacker and college dropout but charting his own musical journey. There are a few intense scenes like the one where Conor is forced to wash off his makeup at school or when Brendan rants about his role in clearing the path for him.<br/><br/>The world of Sing Street is not perfect. Its not about privileged kids or happy endings. In fact, it is filled with troubled childhoods and uncertainties. Much like the Ireland in the 80s and 90s. Yet, its a reminder of how creativity thrives in a rut. How the meanest of the people have their reasons to act as such. Sure, at some places Sing Street is predictable but it makes the movie all the more endearing and funny to watch. Teenagers smoking cigarettes, going on out-of-town day trips un-accompanied by adults and making cheap music videos on camcorders. Such great times! Of-course the young bloke gets the girl at the end but we are left with so many questions about their future. We get the sense of what adventures may lie ahead of them as the literal storm approaches. Is there going to be a sequel?"

"iosifgaliardu","10","2","4","21 May 2016"," I could have been that kid.
","There are a lot of I could have beens in this movie including mine after I've seeing it. Makes me pick up the guitar again.<br/><br/>The first one is the the elder brother Seth Rogen jet engine scene, he could have been that kid if he only had the discipline to pursue the dream.<br/><br/>the second is the drunkard father who smacked the bully for not respecting the power of Rock and Roll, because the father, probably, could have been that kid if he only had the discipline to pursue the dream.<br/><br/>the third one is after the movie when the credits were rolling, I realized that the director too could have been that kid, actually he wrote the songs in the movie, ergo, he actually is that kid.<br/><br/>and the fourth one is me picking up the guitar again, because I could have been that kid and there is still hope, I could still write and play the guitar.<br/><br/>There are so many lessons in this movie. To continue life and rise to the top, in spite of being bullied.<br/><br/>To walk the walk and talk the talk, to pay your dues to play the blues. <br/><br/>The importance of discipline for music beginning at early age, <br/><br/>good parenting in spite of being a single mother, displayed by the guitarist's mom.<br/><br/>brotherhood in music, multiculturalism.<br/><br/>the capo was only seen clipped twice and never seen again, because hey, you are not John Denver, kid. You're in a Rock and Roll band.<br/><br/>Songwriting and the importance of jamming.<br/><br/>The end of the movie probably paid tribute Jim Morrison, Jim's father was a ship captain and he rebelled against his father's parenting style.<br/><br/>quoting from the wiki:<br/><br/>Morrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families.[48] Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use physical corporal punishment such as spanking on their children. They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as dressing down. This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings. Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year. <br/><br/>A very good movie. Highly recommended."

"leftylee14","10","2","4","16 May 2016"," Just fantastic
","This film doesn't need an in-depth review in my opinion. It can be summed up in a few words :<br/><br/>John Carney strikes an immaculate balance between a light- hearted,funny and feel-good 80s trip and an heart-tugging emotional drama that nearly everyone can relate to in some way, shape or form.<br/><br/>There's something for everyone here ; the 80s music, the feelings of trying to woo the girl, trying to become your own person, the list goes on. <br/><br/>Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is excellent as Conor Lawlor and Jack Reynor puts in a fabulous performance as his older brother. The rest of the cast are fantastic as well if not slightly underused. Lucy Boyton's ""Raphina"" is a perfect fit for the character, making her mysterious and believable all the time.<br/><br/>This is definitely my favourite film of the year so far, and I doubt anyone will come close anytime soon."
"darcywinchester","9","2","4","15 May 2016"," A gem of a movie with heart
","In this John Carney written and directed film, newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo stars as Connor/Cosmo, a young boy whose parents Robert, played by Aiden Gillan and Penny played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, are splitting up and in an effort to save money they move him to a new school, all-boys Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where bullies, including the head priest, conspire to make his already miserable life worse.<br/><br/>Noticing a beautiful girl who always seems to be waiting on the steps opposite school, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), he approaches her and when she tells him she is a model he asks her if she wants to be in his music video. To his surprise, she agrees to think about it and this leaves him with a problem, he has to put a band together. His one friend Darren (Ben Carolan), introduces him to loner Eamon (Mark McKenna) a great musician who can help him put his lyrics to some great music, then they recruit Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Garry (Karl Rice), now they have a band.<br/><br/>Helped by his brother Brendan (Jack Reynor), he keeps his mind off his parents and school by concentrating on trying to get the girl by putting together a great look and sound, followed by some promo videos. Can Connor/Cosmo lure Raphina away from her older boyfriend and into his arms? <br/><br/>There are some great performances from new actors in this film, which produces a feel-good movie with heart. I think Ferdia will be one to watch and Boynton, but for me, his brother stole the movie, Reynor encapsulated the essence of the theme of the movie. With a great soundtrack of both classic 80s tunes and original music (a soundtrack for Sing Street will be available when the movie hits cinemas), this little gem deserves to punch above its weight in among the blockbuster superhero movies of the moment."

","Very few directors dedicate so much time to creating a compelling story with original music that enhances it to the max. Not only does this movie deals with heartbreaking scenarios ranging from broken families to lost shots at pursuing one's dreams but it provides an uplifting outcome to an otherwise hard childhood. It's impactful and touching, an essay on how to write songs really.<br/><br/>While the movie feels like a love letter to 80s pop and what I can only interpret as a platonic representation of the Irish director's wishful younger life, the story does reminisce of those common 80s teen movies' tropes with romanticised interactions and situations like making friends, forming a band and meeting the girl when he just started in a new school. However these realistic aspects are made available in order for the real themes to take the center stage: dealing with the downsides of a broken family; thinking big, pursuing a passion and fighting against all odds; feeling appreciated, valuable and worthy of love; breaking the norms and looking to the future.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, it will speak volumes to anyone who's going through or has gone through the situations that are portrayed in this movie and which I have briefly mentioned. Otherwise, it is a musically-beautified coming of age tale with a bit overly-romanticised aspects but with the sole purpose of providing a feel-good and endearing movie to inspire. It almost feels autobiographical, like you are witnessing the start of a band you'd love to see but then again these movies are meant to show the human side of the band behind the IPs and commerical image. However, the movie doesn't care for that but rather focuses it in using music as a vessel to expressing emotions and dealing with real life"

Carney has captured: a hope, a dream, a vision, a culture, a spark, a conscience, a respect, a soul, a smile, a tear, a visual and lyrical heartbeat of joy, sadness, pride, honor, tragedy and loneliness. LOVE. The film brought me back in time, to a place that transcends nostalgia. It transported me to a dreamlike reality that exists in my mind when I close my eyes for a brief moment and I wish for the bravery to not worry like an adult and oftentimes shouldn't.

It was done through so many perspectives and managed to not drown out any one character's voice. Carney is modern day Shakespeare in eye, word and note. <br/><br/>As a young man, I dreamt of doing what Carney has done on the screen. John Carney, please don't ever stop creating these masterpieces and if possible, let me help you and your team in contributing an astounding chapter in the history of cinematic storytelling. Often I think I am alone on an inexplicable journey through chaos in this world. Not once, but twice Carney has spoken to me and millions with thoughtful and profoundly creative films that share in so many dimensions. (Full transparency, I haven't seen the second film but will do so in order to make my own conclusions about Keira Knightly.)<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this film."

Sing Street is a movie I randomly picked up on a flight two years ago. Though I didn't head into this movie with a particularly high expectation, considering I had never watched any of John Carney's previous works, what I found was utterly delightful. The movie, to me at least, feels real. the acting in this movie is fantastic which made the characters felt like real people. Their struggles suddenly felt real, and that's what made it so enjoyable."

","What a beautiful feeling it is when you follow your dreams... Sing Street follows this maxim to its fullest as a notion takes shape in the form of a band during the 80's music vid heyday in Ireland. As his world crumbles around him, his parents are breaking up, navigating a new school replete w/bullies & despotic Catholic figureheads, our hero, w/the unflinching support of his stoner brother, starts a band w/a bunch of fellow pariahs hoping just to shoot a music video to impress the older girl who has caught his eye but what he gains is self-confidence, wisdom beyond his years & also a knack for writing catchy songs. Not a bad trade-off for this heartwarming, inspiring yarn that tickled me delighted & left me w/a healthy dose of nostalgia."

","I wanted to like this movie, but it was so unbelievable that it was impossible. Why was it unbelievable? First of all, the band sounded decent without any effort. He wants a band, finds random people who are talented and voila, they're a polished band. He wants the pretty girl so he walks up to her and she agrees to be in a video. The band itself had no focus; they sounded like Hall and Oates one minute, the Cure the next, etc. The characters had no depth, with the exception of the older brother. This movie has been done before. It was a 1978 TV movie called Cotton Candy. Instead of Ireland it was Texas. Instead of paper thin characters and a watered down plot, it was believable and touching."
"vsks","9","2","5","10 May 2016"," Movie that lifts you up in song and spirit
","A charming movie from Ireland about a half-dozen Dublin boys at the Synge Street Christian Brothers School who start a band. We sort of know this story. We've sort of seen it before. But the freshness of the acting make it fun all over again. Conor Lalor (brilliantly played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) is a new student at the school and the adolescent boys there plan to make his life miserable. Life at home is bad, too, with his parents fighting and splitting. A real place, the Synge Street CBS has a long history, and this movie takes place in a time of pupil loss and relatively low achievement (a line in the credits mentions that the school is ""not the same place"" it was in the 1980s, when the film is set). The first scene of Conor in his new classroom shows the elderly priest who is their teacher, hearing aid dangling, writing on the blackboard with his back to the pupils who are creating holy hell. The principal steps inside and the students stand to attention. The principal glances at the board and points out to the teacher that in this class he is to teach French, not Latin. Teacher: ""French. How modern."" The school's Latin motto ""Viriliter Age"" (""Act Manly""), is translated by Conor's older brother as ""Rape your students."" In short, the school is chaos. Conor channels his creativity toward writing songs and creating the band, Sing Street. These musical ambitions have a lofty goal: impressing the older teen girl, Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), who stands near the school every day and claims to be a model. If she is a model, and if he has a band, she can star in his music videos! Simple. The fact that he mostly carries it off is wondrous, resulting in a feel-good movie about a collection of near-misfits who make music work for them. The band's songs are by Gary Clark, lead of the 1980s British band Danny Wilson, and it's good. We don't know how Conor hears it, but what he sees in terms of music video potential is the pole star he's determined to follow—and take Raphina with him."

","Read reviews and thought oh goodie, 80s music. The only tunes I recognized were Duran, Duran; Hall and Oates. The rest I'd never heard. The actors were good, the cinematography and sound good. The storyline was interesting and I liked the characters. However, the whole film was presented with so many negativities, some downright nasty and hateful that is was depressing. And many lines were obscured by heavy accents which made it hard to understand at times just what was going on. I was also disappointed to see so much smoking; I do believe our consciousness was already raised about the evils of tobacco during that era that it was not quite that prolific. I stayed till the end altho tempted to leave earlier but really cannot recommend this movie to anyone."

The movie just recycles common teen movie clichés - but worse than what has been done before. The music is not good enough to carry the movie, really. And the movie is not really documenting great times or developments in history. The main character is just annoying and all characters underdeveloped.

"Rendanlovell","6","2","6","19 July 2016"," Optimistic and well paced but rather standard.
","Here is one film that is getting quite a bit of recognition straight out of Sundance. While it didn't come to many theaters, the general consensus is that it's pretty great. So, naturally, I went in with high expectations. However this film is unfortunately quite standard. It's about a young man who finds a girl that he likes. She tells him that she is a model, so to get her to notice him he says he is in a band and wants her to star in a music video. Of course he isn't actually in a band so he recruits some kids for said band and they start writing some songs. From here the film follows a pretty cut and paste love story formula. The only thing really new is the music.<br/><br/>Which was pretty great. The soundtrack in the film is one of the better ones that I have heard all year. With its main characters being in a band the music can not only accompany a scene but can interact with it. The lyrics in many of the songs are written by said main characters so they obviously directly correlate with what we are watching on screen. Then are the songs that just in the film to heighten a scene.<br/><br/>Those songs are pretty great as well. Another interesting aspect to the film is the cast. Most of which are all but unknown. And for the most part they do a pretty decent job. There are a few of them that struggle but thankfully those actors screen time is held to a minimum. But the ones that do a good job are all the more impressive because the amount of the different things they have to do.<br/><br/>They don't have to show a whole lot of range though, because this film is on the optimistic side. There aren't many moments of conflict in the film and that works for the most part. It keeps everything very upbeat and crowd pleasing. That being said, whenever it does try to introduce conflict or stakes it doesn't land very well. Which mainly encapsulates this movies entire B story.<br/><br/>The B story mainly follows our main characters struggles at home. Where his parents and brother are going through an existential crisis. This side story doesn't pop up all to much through the movie so when it does it feels oddly forced and cliché. It's nothing we haven't seen before and it doesn't do much to change that. This has mainly to do with all side characters being flat as a board.<br/><br/>There isn't anyone outside of the main few characters that are even remotely compelling. While this mainly affects the B story, the main story we have isn't really that great either. This doesn't have to do with the bland characters or it's abundance of optimism, it has to do with the overly familiar plotting. The whole, trying to impressive a girl with something your not story has been used hundreds of times over.<br/><br/>It's hard to call this movie good when it doesn't offer anything interesting with its story. Its characters are fairly bland, the story is overly familiar, and it doesn't have any conflict to really get you invested. But Its cast and soundtrack are good and there's a decent message embedded deep in there somewhere. While, I may not enjoy these types of feel good movies but if this kind of film appeals to you, you'll definitely have a good time with this one."

He has to move schools and ends up in a severe Christian school. Brother Baxter picks on him because he dos not wear the correct black shoes and he also falls foul of the school bully.<br/><br/>He makes friends with fellow schoolmate Darren and they together decide to form a band.

At one point Conor's family watch Duran Duran's video of Rio and act like it's the first time they are seeing the band. So you think it is 1982. Then you have A-ha's Take on Me and mention of Back to the Future so it must be late 1985 or 1986. Then you get Starship's We built this City that was released in 1987.

I immediately went and purchased almost all of them from iTunes. And I still can't get them out of my head. Way too fun and catchy.<br/><br/>I really loved how the story progressed and the characters kind of molded to what they believed was ""cool"". But they each made a look and fit for themselves and it all worked. The music, the outfits, the hair; perfect! I never even grew up in the 80s and I love the great time piece that Sing Street is. But not only that, it was a very well put together coming-of-age story line. Conor had to find a place to fit in and grow up to love the world around him even through his family circumstances. This will be one of my favorites for a very very long time.<br/><br/>Go buy the songs NOW!!!"

","Dublin, 1985. 15-year old Conor has just moved to a new school and, between the inane rules, fascist teacher-priests and bullies, it is a daunting place. He meets a beautiful girl, Raphina, and is immediately smitten by her. To get to see her he says he is in a band and they need a model for a music video, and would she be interested? She agrees. Only problem - he doesn't have a band. He hastily forms one and the creativity starts to flow...<br/><br/>Pretty basic plot. The whole set up with Conor and Raphina is quite contrived. There is no background, limited scene setting and them meeting even seems like a non-event it is so low-key. This is not helped by the fact that she looks (and in real life, is) about 5 years older than him, rather than the one year mentioned in the movie. Made the whole romance seem implausible from the start.<br/><br/>The plot develops in a similar vein, with a few contrivances and implausibilities along the way. Ultimately it is fairly trite and predictable.<br/><br/>However, while lacking in substance, the movie is still very entertaining. While predictable, the plot is quite fun and there are some good comedic moments. The music is good, giving the movie great momentum, and the characters are reasonably engaging.<br/><br/>Add to this some solid performances and, though not brilliant, Sing Street is still pretty good and never dull."

The music it's just great, with Carney himself writing the lyrics and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo doing the vocals and the instrumental part of the songs, the soundtrack really becomes part of the story and actually makes sense in the context. Unlike films like La la land, Sing street is a realistic musical film that blends reality with fiction, and everything feels believable. I cannot recommend this picture enough, is funny, insightful, full of wisdom and with an optimism that inspire us to follow our dreams without feeling corny. Im giving this movie a 10 out of 10."
"ryanwintle","9","1","2","9 February 2017"," Beautifully Made
","Sing Street is art-house, indie fair put into a digestible format for even the most casual movie fan. Sing Street revolves around Conor Lalor (Walsh-Pelo), a 14 year old boy being forced to change schools during his family's financial and personal struggles. The plot of the film kicks off as Conor is leaving his new school and becomes fascinated by Raphina (Lucy Boynton,) a girl who sits across the street from his new school and smokes everyday. After Raphina mentions she's a model, Conor (without actually being in a band) asks her to be in his band's music video in order to impress her. Conor then goes on a hunt for musically inclined kids in his school to start a band.<br/><br/>Sing Street on the surface is a fairly simple premise about the lengths a boy will go to impress a girl. Where Sing Street excels is in it's execution of its sub-plots, subtle themes, and charismatic performances by its three leads. Jack Reynor as Conor's older brother Brendan is the stand out of the film, as his combination of charisma and chemistry with Walsh-Pelo made every scene they shared together a highlight of the 106 minute run time. In general the chemistry between Raphina and Conor, and Brendan and Conor is the films strongest asset and makes what could have been a simple coming of age story into one of the strongest films of 2016.<br/><br/>John Carney deserves credit for balancing comedy, family drama, coming of age, a love story, and the music brilliantly. Sing Street is an under-watched indie darling with strong performances, acceptable pacing, and strong sub-plots about finding yourself, chasing dreams, and family relationships. My only complaint is at times the thick Irish accents throughout the film made it hard to hear some dialogue. Sing Street has far more mass appeal than most indie's and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys strong dramas.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A-"

","Being 57 years of age I'm hardly the target market of this film. But hey, since when does art have to be polarizing? It just needs to be good and have something one can connect to. Sing Street connects with the human spirit inhabiting us all.<br/><br/>Sing Street is about being young and dreaming out beyond what you know. That's pretty universal. Conor has a need to break out of his existence, not reckless rebellion, just to follow his muse which he decides will be music. Turns out he has some talent and is surrounded by some supporting friends who believe in him too. It provides a kind of release he's looking for because he's in a kind of depressing lot within the break-up of his parents and the stifling school and town he lives in. Of course there's a girl because why would you want to be in a band if not for that reason? The phrase ""youth springs eternal"" comes to mind and history has proved it to be a powerful catalyst for creativity and change and so it goes here.<br/><br/>This is a fine little movie. It is well done though certainly light. It's a bit fantastical to be sure and if one is going to dream isn't it best to take that path? Besides the fine production values for a modest film there's some seriously decent 80's music reflecting much of the times as well as, surprisingly, great original music made for the film. This is a fun and uplifting film for all. It might help to love music though it's certainly not required. Writer/director John Carney obviously birthed this one from the heart and it shows as there's hardly a false step. It's kind of like an indie version of ""That Thing You Do"" with a heart first and foremost. I hope this Dublin based production finds a larger audience as it certainly has merit and deserves to be seen. As of early 2017 it's available on several streaming sights so there's hope. Young Ferdia Walsh- Peelo as protagonist Conor deserves special praise as he's immediately likable and pulls the viewer in to story. Simply fun to watch which is a refreshing change from so many dark films of late."

","After BEGIN AGAIN (2013), his Manhattan sortie with Hollywood named stars, Irish music aficionado John Carney's latest flick regresses to his native territory in the spirit of ONCE (2006), SING STREET casts a cohort of teenagers against the retro milieu of Dublin in the mid-80s, friskily encapsulates the music ambiance of that epoch (featuring hits from THE CURE, A-HA, DURAN DURAN, SPANDAU BALLET, THE CLASH etc.), which potently lures those who are in his age group into the realm of nostalgia and reminiscence; on the other hand, its central coming-of-age-and- puppy-love plot and high-school band rebellion can vicariously connect with younger viewers, up till Post-Millennials. That is a win-win stratagem. <br/><br/>SING STREET, is the name of the teen band found by the high-schooler Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo), a 15-year-old boy who has just been transferred to a free Christian Brothers state-school on the Synge Street due to his family's economic restraint, a microcosm of the doldrums smothering the whole country at then. At home, his parents Robert (Gillen) and Penny (Kennedy) constantly rattle each other's cages, and his hemp-incensed big brother Brendan (Reynor, who tends to chew the scenery whenever sharing the same frame with his greener co-star) presciently tells him their marriage is hanging by a thread. At school, Conor is picked on by bully Barry (Kenny) and clashes with Brother Baxtor (Wycherley), the atrocious school principal. The reality sucks, (at one time, one character virtually calls Dublin a shithole), the only vent for Conor is music until he meets his muse Raphina (Boynton, a bliss for a not-so-likable character), an attractive model-to-be who is one year older than him, but thanks to the obsolete makeup and get-up of that period, hardly she and Conor seem to belong to the same age bracket prima facie. Jumping on the bandwagon of all-the- rage music videos, Conor takes the initiative to form a band, recruited Eamon (Kenna), a multi- instrumentalist (who definitely needs a movie of his own) among others, so as to ask Raphina to star in their videos. Raphina is intrigued for the invitation, but like many an Irish folk at that time, London is the holy land for her, not here in Dublin, the video-shooting is just some pastime before her impending departure (with her adult boyfriend who promises her a bright future in London), and Conor knows it very well, he is prepared for the disappointment but love is love, especially the very first crush, how can a boy resist that beautiful feeling? <br/><br/>The film's forte, indeed, derives from Carney's unsentimental angle of inducing a piquant benevolence and sincerity when deciphering the pre-adolescent vagaries of moods in the sometimes harsh, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes delightful reality, and his refusal of padding out the garden-variety narrative with hokum dialogues and feel-good bells-and-whistles (as used in most similar themed pictures). Everything goes pretty much as we expect (bar the impulsive ending), but there is also a can-do vibe pulsating along with the story's frolicking teen spirits, where ingenuousness and defiance are melded together to leaven the film to be more relatable (also ascribed to the deft job from cosmetics section). Bloating ego, showbiz swagger, internal conflicts, demerits would imaginably stem from the scenario have no access to taint the kids' revelry, although, in my case, the band's largely original punk-pop tunes are too nondescript for my tone-deaf ears. Finally, its semi-fantasy, semi-reality coda, speaks volumes of Carney's tendresse towards his young protagonists - dare to love, dare to dream and dare to fight for one's dream, which rounds off this retro-inspiring crowd-pleaser with a substantial leap of artistic licence - a beacon of prowess in filmmaking."
"Semisonic","8","1","2","14 January 2017"," A feel-good moment for Ireland (and for us all)
","Don't you hate those oversweetened soppy good stories that literally reek of fake? As if the movie creators thought they could really make us buy into all that positive sh!te they just made up without even trying to ground it into something realistic! Well, I certainly do. And it's my pleasure to announce that Sing Street had no single hint of that fake happiness, which makes it a rather unique case of a feel-good film that genuinely feels that way.<br/><br/>The story here is simple as hell and revolves around the things all the adolescents dream about: feeling love, finding your true self, breaking free of the confines of the house rules and societal prejudice. But how come Sing Street still feels like a breath of fresh sea breeze in the morning? From a rational standpoint, it's a mystery.<br/><br/>Mr Freud, whose face we could glimpse on several occasions in the film itself, might have an answer though. Feel-good movies don't feel too good because they are about people we (okay, most of us) actually failed to become. Failed to find that true love, or pursue our true destiny, failed to become what we've been dreaming to become. And seeing an artificially crafted cinema figure reach for its stars is less motivating as it's depressing.<br/><br/>But this time we don't have to choose between a starry path charted for and by someone else and our own less stellar reality. This time we've gotten our alter ego right there. A stoner, a school dropout, formally a typical loser... but who still gets some love from the movie, and for whom someone else's pursuit of a dream is not a source of jealousy but rather a moment of redemption and liberation, however small or past due. And for those who are already too expired to put their hopes into following Conor's path, Brendan is an alternative still positive enough to make us all smile, and this time actually feeling that it's a sincere smile.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this film is that, by making all the main characters so dashing and daring, it made them way too unrealistic. Ireland might be a birthplace for a lot of famous musicians, but passing the lyrics written by six(!) grown-up men for a 15 year-old's work is just way over the top. Being so fiercely brave and witty, both with enemies and love interests, and looking so shamelessly dazzling is what every kid has wet dreams of, but nobody ever had for real. So if the Sing Street members had been just several years older, it would've been much more natural. But, then again, the movie wouldn't have had that break-away vibe it bases itself on...<br/><br/>But these are the things we sacrifice for the greater good. And, at the end of the day, Sing Street is good because it made us believe in something for a moment. That no matter if you live your life in Ireland or in some other depressing sh!thole, no matter if you took an arrow in the knee or if the world's trying to screw you over right now, the steering wheel to your future is still in your hands. So ride it like you stole it! PS: the kids playing the band members are just unreal! I can't believe almost all of them don't even have an IMDb profile pic. And Mark McKenna who played Eamon... Dude, you're like Shia LaBeouf all over again, but without that Transformers stain he still can't wash off. Keep going like you do and you're golden!"

On a rainy day, it beat splashing our way to the multiplex to catch the latest mass-market whatever.<br/><br/>However, it fell short of excellence, partly because of some plot mysteries (see below) and partly because the lead character isn't fully engaging and believable. He seems to have a slightly flat affect, showing very little excitement in scenes where his character has things to be excited about. That results in less emotional urgency. Also, I was left wondering whether he was naturally creative, in terms of writing lyrics and such, or whether he suddenly transformed into that type of person just to try to win the beauty's heart.<br/><br/>Among the mysteries (I don't think any of these would count as spoilers):<br/><br/>* When he's forming the band, a couple of guys who competently play the instruments he needs in the band just happen to appear.<br/><br/>* As the band develops, the members start wearing period ""costume"" clothing (such as the hats popular among pop stars in those days), but they're an indigent lot, and there's no telling how any of them could afford this.<br/><br/>* A motorboat gets driven around multiple times, with no indication of how fuel is obtained for it.<br/><br/>* When the lead character makes odd and cutting remarks toward a bully, the bully doesn't do what a bully would normally do.<br/><br/>* Well into the school year, an elderly teacher not only lacks any control over his students, but apparently doesn't even know what subject he's teaching.<br/><br/>Quibbles, I guess, but there are enough of them to make the viewer uncertain that such a tale is believable.<br/><br/>Despite that, I did (as I wrote earlier) like the movie. As someone who was heavily into '80s music, I enjoyed most of the soundtrack cuts. And some of the supporting characters add flavor well. So - see it, but don't expect the production to be more polished than the teenagers' band."

","The film is written and directed by Irish filmmaker John Carney (who's written and directed, as well as composed, films that I hadn't seen nor heard of prior hand, and for obvious reasons) and is set in the 1980s, as tells the story of a teenager in Dublin named Conor who is sent to a Christian school by his folks. He does not fit in, of course, but that is up until he meets a boy named Darren who eventually becomes his ally. He then meets a young-adult lady named Raphina, whom he immediately falls for. On top of that, both he and Darren go to a house to meet Eamon who has an entire collection of instruments. All three of them then start a band, bringing along three more guys, with Darren as the manager.<br/><br/>I will say that the cast do quite well with the material they're given: Ferdia Walsh-Peelo does a fair job as Conor (also known as Cosmo), Lucy Boynton is outstanding as the female lead, Raphina, and Jack Reynor who is spectacular as Conor's brother, Brendan. The cast also includes well-known, such as Aidan Gillen (whom you may recognize as Little-Finger from Game of Thrones) as the father and singer, Maria Doyle Kennedy as the mother.<br/><br/>My only gripes with the film are that the supporting characters don't really stand out as much as they should have. And the dialogue was very hard for me to understand at times, so much that I had to turn on subtitles for the most part. But other than that, I highly enjoyed everything else about this film."
"cherold","8","1","2","30 December 2016"," Lovely, engaging musical
","In spite of my strong dislike of the director's inexplicably beloved Once, I decided to watch his most recent musical, Sing Street, and found it better in every way, with an engaging story, interesting characters, and first rate songs.<br/><br/>The story, which takes place in the 1980s, follows a boy who falls for a preternaturally composed girl and starts a band just to impress her (and get her to perform in his videos). After a shaky start, he begins to absorb the musical influences of the age (dressing in emulation of a series of rock stars) and creates genuinely entertaining music. <br/><br/>My only real objection to anything in the film is the weirdly quick improvement in the band. In something like the second or third rehearsal the protagonist suddenly develops a much better singing voice and the ability to play guitar. It's as though the movie just cut a month out of the story, and it's a bit aggravating. But everything else about this is terrific."
"secretzfan","8","1","2","29 December 2016"," A joy to watch from beginning to end
","From the very start of this film I could tell there was something very different about this film. From the characters to the set design everything about it was pretty amazing. It drew me in to learn more about the world that it was inhabiting. Everything about it felt real and true to how characters in this time period would act. None of it felt like it was a 2016 film. All of it made me feel like I was there in this time with these characters. <br/><br/>Sing Street is a story of a young boy in in the 1980s of Dublin who goes to this catholic school and has a pretty hard time making it there. It is pretty hard for him there are many bullies at every corner and the principal is also pretty hard on him as well from the very start. The whole film feels like it is taking you on this ride with this kid as he finds a group of friends and decides to create a band together in it. <br/><br/>The music in this film is amazing. I found myself moving my head to the beats of the music as it was just so enjoyable and fun. I love how the kids in the film used music too as a way to deal with the hardships that they were going through. It really made me feel more connected to the characters that inhabited this world. And the importance music had for them. <br/><br/>The romance in the film is also pretty well done as it is a really powerful add on to the movie that makes our main character have even more depth than he already had. This film was a absolute joy for me to watch and I am glad I did. <br/><br/>This film is just a good time to watch."

","Another masterpiece from John Carney after Once. He truly makes you happy sad and that what anybody can ask for from such a movie. What i appreciate after the fact was, even though the whole story evolves around the love-friendship relationship between a boy and a girl, Carney doesn't dwell and milk it on the emotion of her breaks his heart by living the boy to go oversees. If he did that it would have a broken chick-flick. And as i love this movie as a whole Jake Reynor clearly steals the show.. He is a revelation in this one, even though he is a side character.. Maybe it is because he is a side character ... I imagine a great future for him.. John Carney, Jack Reynor and the rest, keep up with the great work<br/><br/>P.s.

"Argemaluco","9","1","2","15 December 2016"," Sing Street
","An amateur music band in Dublin during an economic crisis? Am I talking about a remake of The Commitments? No, Sing Street isn't a remake, but the influence of that masterpiece is noticed in various aspects... something which isn't bad at all. Sing Street shares cultural elements with The Commitments, but it immediately finds its own personality, besides of adopting an enough different musical style in order to avoid unfair comparisons to any other ""garage band"" tale. I enjoyed the multiple sub-plots of Sing Street very much; and even though they don't belong to my favorite type of music, I certainly appreciated the ingenuity and talent behind the original songs played by the characters. The historical period (the '80s), geographic setting and socio-economic environment justify the strong influence of the ""new romantics"" which used to be popular during that decade, bringing songs which imitate the style of Duran Duran, Joy Division, The Cure and Spandau Ballet, with some North American references such as Hall & Oates; but, independently from their origin, I found all the songs excellent (I still have ""The Riddle of the Model"" spinning around in my head). The whole cast makes a brilliant work, highlighting Lucy Boynton, who perfectly transmits sweetness and charm as the ""muse"" of band, and Jack Reynor, who steals every scene he's in (besides, I was left with wishes to see a film exclusively focused on his character). In conclusion, Sing Street tells a compelling and honest story which employs music as a genuine complement of the narrative, instead of being a simple ornament. My favorite movie from director John Carney keeps being Once, but Sing Street still deserves an enthusiastic recommendation, specially to those of us who once played (badly) in the garage (or roof) of some house, making more noise than ""music"". Sing Street understands the magic of those moments, and it accompanies them with a subtle echo of social commentary, bringing a fascinating and memorable experience which combines nostalgia and raw reality. And a huge love for the music."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The sounds of Duran Duran, aha, The Cure, and Hall and Oates bring the 80's back in full swing in John Carney's ode to youth, Sing Street. The film delivers a coming of age story about the makings of a boy band and the pangs of first love front and center. <br/><br/>In Dublin, teenage Conor Lawlor (a winning Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) must deal with his parents divorcing, a new school, a sadistic schoolmaster who wants conformity, a bully, and the perfect model of a girlfriend (Lucy Boynton). His life is a shamble until he is guided into the world of music by his slacker brother, Brendan (Jack Raynor). It is there that he begins to find purpose and literally, a voice.<br/><br/>The film is charming, even if its plot is thin and in need of more character development. Mr. Walsh-Peelo, in his film debut, shares a nice chemistry with his band-mates, Ms. Boynton, and Mr. Raynor. But it is the original music score by the director and Gary Clark that carries the story. Its direct homage to the 80's pop bands of that era and their original song contributions to the film, like Drive It Like You Stole It and The Riddle of the Model, are post new wave gems. Even though there is a lack of credibility with these young musicians sounding too polished for their age, the overall effect is a rollicking good time. So tease that hair, put on those tight stone-washed jeans, and want your MTV. Sing Street will play on.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","13 December 2016"," Carney does it again, ""Sing Street"" rocks
","It's official — John Carney is the master of the modern day movie musical. The filmmaker who broke onto the scene and stole indie movie fans' hearts with ""Once"" has a gift for crafting films and original music that work together seamlessly to tell emotionally compelling stories. ""Sing Street"" is probably his most personal effort to date and it pays off.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" follows an Irish teenager named Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) living in Dublin in the mid-1980s. His family has fallen under hard times and it has put a strain on his parents' marriage, making life at home difficult. Once he finds out he's being sent to a Catholic boys school, music turns out to be the one thing he can find solace in. Thanks to his college dropout brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), Conor is exposed to the likes of ""futurist"" bands such as Duran Duran, The Cure, Hall & Oates and more, whose music colors the soundtrack and also influences the original songs Conor writes for his band.<br/><br/>The band comes together, of course, because of a girl. Raphina (Lucy Boynton) is a picture-perfect aspiring model a year older his senior who catches Conor's eye on the way home from school. He convinces her he has a band and she agrees to star in the music video if she likes their sound, so along with a fellow outcast he befriends at school, Conor forms a talented group of schoolmates called Sing Street, a play on their school name. The musical influences from Conor's brother — and Raphina, of course — inspire their music.<br/><br/>The obvious is that ""Sing Street"" is Carney's love letter to his childhood and the music that inspired him, but he's also crafted a coming-of-age story with which one can easily relate. He taps into what we've all felt like being teenager with troubles and heightened emotions and how writing music can be both a powerful and powerfully important way to process it all. Watching Conor and the other boys make music together as a way to make their voice heard is an extremely satisfying part of this viewing experience, because we've all had to find outlets for expression at points in our lives, especially as teenagers.<br/><br/>It certainly helps that Carney has composed some soul-stirring and catchy original songs that a real-life band of 15-year-olds would unlikely be capable of. His co-composers deserve to be mentioned by name these tunes are so enjoyable: Gary Clark, Graham Henderson, Carl Papenfus, Ken Papenfus and Zamo Riffman. The songs range from the catchy Hall & Oates-inspired anthem ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" to the raw and chilling climactic ballad ""To Find You."" If that weren't enough, Carney sends off the film with an original song not written by but intended for the characters, ""Go Now,"" a collaboration with Adam Levine (Carney's ""Begin Again"") and Glen Hansard (""Once""). <br/><br/>Most impressive about Carney's filmography to this point is how he packs films with original songs that are important to the story but don't hinge on it in the way that we're used to from more traditional musicals. His films are about music, not films that are about other things in which music is the means of expressing what's happening in the story. It's more natural this way, but fans of musicals will still gravitate toward his use of original songs to set tone and unlock the emotions present in the narrative.<br/><br/>Bolstered by this lovable soundtrack, ""Sing Street"" is one of those rare and special films that does the basic things so right. It's an honest and uncomplicated story packed with such simple yet undeniable truths that it forges an instant connection with the audience. It forgoes drama and opts for relatable daily struggles, relationships and emotions. Despite a lackluster theatrical run, it will almost certainly find a following on Netflix.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954","10","1","2","9 December 2016"," Drive It like you Stole It, and Ride With John Carney to Sing Street!
","The first thing I have to discuss is the actual band. It was perfect casting! All the characters in this band feel fresh and like a natural bunch. Usually when adults are writing dialogue for teenagers and or young kids, it does not feel that natural. Meaning, it feels like adults have written for the teens, and it does not come off as a realistic conversation a teen would have with another teen(s). Teenagers talk and act like teenagers. Teenage boys get nervous when talking to a pretty girl, teens do want to express themselves, they sometimes do have the too cool for school state of mind, they do want escapism, and that's exactly what you get with these young characters. I understand that Conor and Raphina are our main characters. However, some of the band members do feel just a little underwritten. Also, one thing that I love is how we truly grow with these characters from scene to scene. It was some of the best character development I've seen all year. For example, this isn't a spoiler but Raphina does not really believe in destiny. Nevertheless, by the end of the movie there is a message on following your destiny and not being afraid of your journey ahead. We truly go on an adventure with this band; sometimes things are serious, sometimes funny, and relatable.<br/><br/>The lyrics are more than just songs that sound good, but when you listen to the lyrics, it helps tell the story and pace of the film, and characters emotions throughout the film. They play a song at the end called ""A Beautiful Sea"". The lyrics go a little something like this, ""Under the waves I feel her pull my body down Under the waves she takes me where I wanna drown Ah, gimme miles away she calls my name She gets into my veins And writes my poetry This girl is a beautiful sea The girl is a beautiful sea"". That may be telling us the possible outcome of our main characters Conor and Raphina. I saw one review for this movie that said something about how the songs are just there for a quick dance, clap along, and a nod to bands of that era. I respectfully have to disagree on that. Every song had rhythm, style, well-written lyrics, and helped to tell the story. <br/><br/>All though the story for this film may not be that original, I feel almost like this is the type of film where it is more focused on the characters than the story. The story is a story we've seen many times before. The whole let's form a band, and boy meets girl story has been done already. However, the director of this film is John Carney who is well known for another music film I loved called Begin Again, he really does care for characters in all his films. He understands that characters can't be flat. They have to be well rounded, given depth, goals, desires, and make them relatable for every viewer watching one of his films. You can have the best story in the world, but what good is it if your characters are not utilized efficiently? I feel like with any other director and writer, this movie would have been white bread bland. The best well written relationship here is that between Conor and his long haired, music loving, college-dropout, humorous, brother played by Jack Reynor (Transformers: Age of Extinction, Delivery Man). At the closing-credits, there is a dedication that displays ""for brothers everywhere"". I can see why Carney had that well written and strong relationship between the brothers in this film. It is a sentimental gesture that feels earned.<br/><br/>So these are my Final B*tchin' Buddha Thoughts on the film Sing Street. It has an awesome message for everyone. A message of express yourself, go after what you want, don't let haters stop you, destiny, love makes us do crazy things, and don't be afraid to follow your heart. It is one of the best films of 2016, and I believe everyone will enjoy this. Really, I can't see one person hating this film. Even if you do not like this type of music, I think you will dig this flick. It's fun, funny, a great message for all, and this movie reminded me of why I love movies so much. Compared Begin Again, this is perhaps not the most sophisticated storytelling. But there's an infectious joyousness to the movie, right down to its fanciful fairy-tale ending. I am more than happy to give Sing Street a<br/><br/>10 out of 10!<br/><br/>I really do not see one individual walking out this movie upset and saying it sucks. When I was having a conversation with my family and friends, I told them my top favorite films of 2016 are Captain America: Civil War and 10 Cloverfield Lane. Now I get to add Sing Street to that conversation and top favorite 2016 films.<br/><br/>Well I'm gonna drive it like I stole it, because I'm ready to get out of here. Until next time, I hope you all check out this movie. Thank you for reading, and or viewing. I hope you all have an amazing day as always, and remember, don't just get down but get Boogie. :)"
"themovieparadise","9","1","2","20 November 2016"," Fantastic Musical Movie With Great Performances and Incredible Directing
","The performances are fantastic. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo was great as the lead, and carried the film perfectly. I later looked him up on IMDb and saw that this was his first film appearance; he hadn't acted in anything before. And that makes his performance all the more incredible. Lucy Boynton was also great as Raphina. At first, she was very one-note, but as the film progresses she becomes a lot more developed and more interesting as a character, and I grew to like her a lot more. But from a performance standpoint she did a great job. But I think I liked Jack Reynor most as the older brother, Brendan. There's a considerable age difference between Conor and Brendan, and I loved that this film didn't fall into the clichéd trap of they hate each other and they're always fighting. In Sing Street, Brendan is someone Conor looks up to and respects, and Brendan sees Conor as someone who can make better choices than he did, and sees him as his responsibility to help succeed. It was a refreshing dynamic, and I appreciated the angle..."
"dierregi","8","1","2","7 December 2016"," Heart-warming movie with a couple of minor problems
","Conor is 15, his parents have a rocky relationship and money problems, his older brother Brendan is a college drop-out, his sister has no reason to be in the movie.<br/><br/>Conor is sent to a Catholic school to save money and there he sees and falls in love with Raphina, an older girl. Raphina is supposed to be 16, but the actress playing her is 22, while the actor playing Conor is actually 15 and 7 years is a wide age gap. Skipping the age problem, to win over Raphina, Conor starts a school band with a motley crew just to ask her to appear in his band's videos.<br/><br/>This is Dublin in 1985, Duran Duran are at the height of their power and the video for the their song Rio is Conor first - but not last - inspiration.<br/><br/>It is hilarious to see Conor during his creative process and how his clothes and music are influenced by several bands (The Smiths, Spandau Ballet, etc...) It is easy to relate to that period in life when we are not sure about ourselves and try out different images.<br/><br/>Conor writes some good songs in different styles and experiences the pains of growing up when his parents separate, but at least he can count on Brendan to give advice about music and women.<br/><br/>The core of the plot is the love story, narrated via the original songs and developed in a sweet way. Peppered with humor, excellent costumes and engaging characters, the movie will make most of those who grew up in the 80s feel nostalgic.<br/><br/>Just a couple of minor problems for me: even if U2 were an Irish band exploding in mid 80s, they are not even acknowledged (maybe for copyright reasons?). Finally, unless one is an hopeless romantic or still a teenager, it is difficult not to imagine much disappointment in Conor and Raphina's future."
"masonmorgan-92917","9","1","2","3 December 2016"," Incredibly entertaining with a touching message
","I had heard a lot of buzz revolving around John Carney's Sing Street, with many calling it one of the best movies of 2016. I decided to check it out on Netflix and I can guarantee it's spot among my favorites of 2016.<br/><br/>Sing Street is so delightfully enjoyable that one would have to try to dislike it, and trust me, I tried. As the film started off with many clichés fired off in rapid succession, I quickly began to doubt the film's ability to show me anything new. But just as quickly as I began to doubt it, Sing Street swept me up and showed me a simple story with an incredibly meaningful message. <br/><br/>The thing with Sing Street is that it proves that a film doesn't need to be original to be enjoyable. There is very little here that we haven't seen before, but it was so colorful and charming that it didn't really matter. As I say, clichés are only bad when done poorly and Sing Street proves that perfectly. <br/><br/>The acting within this movie is so grounded and realistic that I completely believed all the emotions showcased by our characters. They share such excellent chemistry that I honestly wouldn't be surprised if these actors were friends for years before the filming. And the character of Eamon is one the most unintentionally cool movie characters I have ever seen. <br/><br/>While the story is simple, it has a surprising amount of layers and depth. While at first we think we're just watching a teenage boy's love for an girl unfold, I quickly realized that it is more of a story between the brothers. This story of brotherhood within the film is absolutely excellent. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, but always touching. The story developed in paths that I never would have expected it too, adding much more depth and meaning to a seemingly ""cliche"" story line. <br/><br/>It is also important to mention that the music for Sing Street is absolutely phenomenal. The songs created by this group of rag-tag teens are perfectly reflected as a juvenile Duran Duran. This is really the first film that I've ever wanted the soundtrack to. The film's main song, Rhythm of the Model, is incredibly addictive and very catchy. The music alone is reason enough to watch Sing Street.<br/><br/>It's not all happiness and rock-and-roll though, as there were some aspects to Sing Street that I found very strange and quite wrong. <br/><br/>Firstly, some of the characters within the story, particularly some of the band members, are grossly underdeveloped. More than half of the band that we follow are just background characters. The few scenes that they did run were really fun, which makes it even more disappointing that we never got any depth to them. The situation involving the band's only black member is even kind of offensive. The main characters invite him to join because he is the only black guy at their school. While this was lighthearted and meant to be funny, this character is completely ignored within the story and this joke that the kids make ends up accurately describing his real role in the film. <br/><br/>The ending felt incredibly out of place as well. Our main character has his heart broken by his boyfriend in a big twist, but shortly after this heartbreaking event, they are back together and acting as if none of it even happened. I enjoy a happy ending, but when the characters just completely ignore a massive plot development that left both of them emotionally wrecked, it feels totally wrong. It's almost as if this plot development was added in to pad run-time. It is never acknowledged after the fact, so what was the point of it even happening? This upset me quite a bit, but not enough to drastically change my enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>Despite some issues, Sing Street is a delightful, fun and totally charming movie. It had me completely hooked in all the way through and I experienced many different emotions throughout. From pure joy to on the verge of tears, Sing Street masterfully tells a story that we've heard and enjoyed many times before. There was a sense of predictability, but the film itself never failed to make me smile and giggle with joy. The incredibly rich and unexpected commentary on brotherly relationships adds entire new shades of meaning to an already wholehearted film."

It isn't musical.<br/><br/>It is a charming movie similar in spirit to Moonrise Kingdom following the romance of two young people who are learning about themselves, each other and the wider world.<br/><br/>The characters seem like real people and it instills that joy for life and makes you remember the people you have loved and the ways you might have met and courted them.<br/><br/>In the sea of Hollywood flops and Hollywood blockbusters this movie stands out.

","Despite the bleak backdrop of a family falling on hard times, the optimistic tone of this film shines through. Conor has an enviable attitude and confidence for his young years, largely thanks to his brother Brendan's guidance in music appreciation. Conor's friendship with Raphina is sweet and hopeful. The relationship between Conor and the band members could have been developed further but what we glean from Conor and Eamon's writing partnership is inspiring. If you're a glass half-empty type you may find the narrative naive but if you prefer to see the glass as half-full, you'll enjoy the anything's possible message."

","I know I need to relax, but I am in such cinematic elation with a movie that shows that there is always something there to remind me of the magical 80's New Wave Music. And in comes in the form of Writer-Director John Carney's exuberant ""Sing Street"". This movie is a love letter to the 80's New Wave Romanticism movement that I just can't get enough of. It stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Connor, a bullied Irish teen who decides to form a band to impress an older girl he meets in the sidewalks of Dublin. He then befriends several quirky but likable teens who become his bandmates and form the band ""Sing Street"". Lucy Boynton plays Raphina, the older girl that Connor wants to give everything she wants; and that's no careless whisper. Carney nails both the direction and the screenplay of ""Sing Street"" with such feel- good and enlightening qualities that its take on me made me go back to that wonderful mid 80's musical time. Walsh-Peelo, Boynton, and the rest of the mostly young cast sure made me want to shout, shout, and let it all out that these young boys & girls on film are for real. ""Sing Street"" is pure movie gold, it is for Rio, and this much is true. I have no more words. ***** Excellent"
"ThomasDrufke","10","1","2","27 September 2016"," For Brothers Everywhere
","Music is one of the driving forces of a motion picture. It can set the mood or ruin the mood in the blink of an eye. I've always been fascinated by that, and Sing Street is a great example of how music and the moments of discovering young adulthood can completely change your life.<br/><br/>2016 has been a great year for film. Yes, some of the blockbusters and the films we had on our ""most anticipated"" lists have definitely let down, but there have been some dang good movies this year. Sing Street may very well be the best that 2016 has to offer. It's the third feature film by John Carney, who's starting to become one of my favorite directors, and it follows along the music path that he chose for his first two features. I have yet to see 'Once', but I have seen 'Begin Again', and it grows on me every time I catch it on TV. Carney has a way of using music to not only set the mood, but to drive home major themes and ideas through the lyrics of a catchy song. Sing Street definitely has catchy songs, but it has an even better story and message.<br/><br/>His films communicate using music, and when such a thing is done right in movies, it's extremely powerful and moving. Carney chose to cast unknown and relatively inexperienced actors for the band members, and that choice proved to be effective as well. There's something to be said about following a group of actors who you have no previous recollection of, and just seeing where the story goes. In many ways, this film felt real. It felt like these kids were actually from the 80's and making a tribute song to the bands that they were listening to at the time. It's truly special.<br/><br/>One of the quotes on the cover of the DVD is from Irish megastar, Bono. He claims that ""In truth, most films won't touch Sing Street's portrayal of awakening."" He's right. There haven't been many films that have come close to Sing Street's portrayal of discovery and having dreams when no one else seems to allow you to. Perhaps 'Almost Famous' is the only other film that feels this genuine when it comes to the world of music.<br/><br/>Although the band members and Lucy Boynton's Raphina character are likely to be the topic of conversation, I think Jack Reynor is the clear standout here. It's by far the meatiest role in the film, but Reynor stands up to the task, and gives perhaps the best performance of his career. I will no longer think of him as the guy from Transformers 4 (yikes), he's now that cool brother from Sing Street. I was blown away.<br/><br/>Not many people can say they were in a band, but I think we can all say we did something crazy for someone we liked. The premise is based around a boy starting a band to an impress a girl, and that's something we can all relate to. On one hand, that angle is interesting enough, but what really fascinated we was how Carney turns a love story into a film about self-discovery and the power you feel when you have created something special. To me, John Carney has created something special in his own right here.<br/><br/>+Carney does it again<br/><br/>+Fresh actors bring a strong likability<br/><br/>+Reynor<br/><br/>+Catchy songs with a heartwarming story<br/><br/>10/10"

"KristianZacc","10","1","2","21 September 2016"," 80s Music Nostalgia Mixed With Original Music Equals An Amazing Film
","Minor/Vague Spoilers <br/><br/>Originally, I was turned off watching this film because I had heard it was a musical and they don't really peak my interest. As time went on I kept hearing about Sing Street and how amazing it was so I decided to take the plunge and boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>First off, I didn't see it as a musical in the traditional sense where everyone just randomly burst out into a choreographed song and dance (even though it happens once but it still isn't done totally in that way). It was more just watching the band aptly named ""Sing Street"" perform their songs. It was closer to just being a coming of age movie with a great story filled with great performances. <br/><br/>This movie, in a nutshell, set in Ireland about one kid starting out in a new school and everyone there is picking on him. He meets this girl and convinces her he is a part of a band (that doesn't exist yet) and they want her to be in their music video. Once she says yes he groups some other kids together and they start their band. <br/><br/>Jack Reynor, plays the older brother and he is a standout. The film shows how brotherhood can impact ones life. This is even referenced in the films closing credits where it says, ""For brothers everywhere."" The film really pulls on the heartstrings through these two brothers and it is in the final sequence where we get a powerful moment from Reynor that really brings this sense of brotherhood together and brings a close to both the character's development. <br/><br/>Aidan Gillen, plays the father mostly known for portraying Littlefinger on Game of Thrones. Even though for most audiences he would be the one cast member that they would know prior to this film he doesn't take up any unnecessary screen time that would take away from the overall film. <br/><br/>The original music that was written for this film was fantastic, ""Riddle of the Model"" and ""Drive it Like You Stole it"" most likely being the big hits that would come from the film. 80s composer Gary Clark composed most of the music that is heard which I'm sure has already been released in a complete soundtrack. Adam Levine even has a song, ""Go On"" that he co-wrote and performs during the final sequence. We hear hit songs that were actually released during the 80s (so it's a well of nostalgia) and it influences the kids, especially the main character Conor (played by Ferdio Walsh-Peelo in his acting debut) who is shown to be changing his hairstyle and the music he wants to play no matter if it's Hall & Oates or The Cure. It's definitely realistic in that way where everyone wants to follow their idols and take from some of their music. <br/><br/>This film is grounded in realism and you feel for these kids. It wouldn't surprise me if some people were able to relate to these characters and be able to bring their own experiences, of trying to find out who you are and where you fit into this crazy world, into the viewing experience. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was fantastic and director John Carney deserves all the praises as he was able to get amazing performances from these kids that couldn't be a more charming film if it tried. I really don't have anything to say about it, even the ending, which I could see if some people thought was a bit too out there or possibly went against the films ""realism"". You get everything you want out of a movie from this film and more!!"
"Equalizer16","9","1","2","17 September 2016"," A funny, remarkable, touching and charming musical story.
","John Carney the director of other musical dramas such as Once and Begin Again has introduced the very enjoyable funny romance story of Conor, a teen living in heavy 80's Dublin, who becomes enchanted by the mysterious Raphina. But for the young lad to have a chance with the young lady, Conor says he's in a band and wants her to be in a music video, in which he must now in a haste build a band and start developing a video.<br/><br/>What you're invited to in this 80's music celebration is a very enjoyable cliché drama that explores the history of pop and rock with the combination of trying to fit in at school. A coming of age story for young nippers during exposure to artists such as Duran Duran, A Ha, and Motörhead. Sing Street also introduces brilliant fun original songs that you can't but help but just have a great time with.<br/><br/>The moment I truly decided how great this film is, was during the amazing gratifying performance scene of ""Drive It Like You Stole It"", followed by the inspiring ""Brown Shoes"" With great, smile inducing performances from new young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (Conor), Lucy Boyton (Raphina), along with the brilliant talent of Brenden Tayor; the protagonists older brother. But a complete charming and entertaining performance by the rest of the supporting cast, all providing quirky hysterics and characteristics.<br/><br/>What only lacks the film is that its atmosphere compared with other British comedy drama that does not surprise and that as far as tone it does not stand out. During viewing I couldn't help but cast my mind to film's like Submarine, and Nowhere Boy, but it does become distinctive in its own sense as the film further develops.<br/><br/>So Sing Street is a very remarkable and enjoyable story, with great fun music, and wonderful charming performances. I would probably call this the British version of School of Rock, but still quite a stand out musical drama. 8.6/10"

Dunne, and Aidan Gillen Written&Directed By: John Carney Review BOY MEETS GIRL. GIRL UNIMPRESSED. BOY STARTS BAND. I heard about this film during a screen junkies movie fight when JTE(Josh The Engineer) said this film. He just kept talking about how it captures the pure heart & Joy of cinema where like when you watch Rocky you fist pump in the air every time you watch it and this brings back that kind of memory when you watch it but instead of a fist pump you just feel the need to dance. Conor faces along with a difficult home life, a new public school in the inner city. When he meets Raphina who lives across the school he decides to start a band and form a relationship. When I watch a film like this I usually hate the music or almost any movie with people singing. But I really liked the songs, heck I feel like downloading one when I'm done. The plot doesn't seem original but does fit directors John Carney description and he has an act for writing musical styled films with rock'n roll. I couldn't find anything wrong with it, however it is hard to sit if you factor in the joy of needing to sing or dance. The acting was great from the youngsters it's a predominantly young cast. The shots and angles John Carney uses works to the films advantage.The Choreography for the dance sequences where a tribute to old-school films and quite delightful to see. Sing Street is one of my favorite films for being John Carney's best film with his style and the execution of it's plot and character's. The music is groovy and just makes you want to sing. I'm giving Sing Street a five out of five."
"Genti22","10","1","2","5 September 2016"," A masterpiece
","Sing Street is a musical comedy-drama that's written, produced and directed by John Carney. On the lead it stars Lucy Boynton, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jack Reynor, Kelly Thornton and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo. This movie is about a boy who lives with his two parents that are seemingly on the verge of breaking up, and they move him to a free state-school. There he falls for a girl who then he decides to create a band to impress her. This movie is much deeper than that, and I think it benefits from it a lot because this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. The acting is phenomenal from every single actor here, starting with Ferdia Walsh-Peelo on the lead as Conor Lalor who gives genuinely one of the best male performances of the year. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Raphina, the girl who Conor falls for, is also amazing. But who totally stood out to me was Conor's brother in the movie, Brendan portrayed by Jack Reynor. I can not believe that this is the same guy who was in Transformers: Age of Extinction. I remembered him instantly from that monstrosity but with every second passing with him on screen I was more and more impressed. The writer-director John Carney does a wonderful job here, from the camera-work to the incredible soundtrack that just stays with you long after you've seen this masterpiece. The life lessons are perfectly conveyed to the audience and the ""kid"" in all of us. I am certainly not what would be considered as an 80's kid and I might have not got all the references but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie so much. I felt for the characters and let me just say that the ending is so emotional and works so well with the story that was being told, that completes this absolute masterpiece of a movie and I can't wait to watch it again."

","Sometimes a film sneaks up on you and is so enjoyable, so feel good that you forget everything else that's going on in your life and just enjoy it.<br/><br/>For me that's what 'Sing Street' did. I'd seen and enjoyed Carney's film 'Once' and loved the music but disliked his other film 'Begin Again'. 'Sing Street' though is on another level.<br/><br/>It's got a great story, the characters are identifiable, and each of the songs sticks in your head.<br/><br/>Whereas 'Begin Again' seemed to get bogged down by bad language and ex references, here Carney goes back to the basics of 'Once' - characters, stories and music. It's a perfect combination.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film highly enough. As the final song says, go on."

","This film is 100% worth watching. It's a unique, merry film that will get you smiling and inspire you in so many ways. The film was about so much more than just the main tag-line: boy meets girl and tries to impress her. It had so many little sub plots to it, and although it was a very optimistic film, had elements of realism and conflict in it. The way the characters bond throughout the film and the inspirational stories of what they go through together is truly remarkable. I would say it was a solid 9/10 production-wise, but overall the film was a truly recommendable piece of art and if you are someone who enjoys music and films, this movie is perfect for you. The songs were catchy, the characters were extremely likable and different, and it was its own film that didn't try to be anything else. Magnificent and enjoyable, with key messages and admirable role models within."

"avik-basu1889","8","1","2","21 August 2016"," Rock n' Roll is a Risk !!!
","'Sing Street' is set in 1980s Ireland. Right at the beginning of the film we are given footage of a news reel showing numerous Irish people leaving their deadbeat lives in Ireland to look for a new life in England. This little bit of footage actually establishes the overall binding theme of the film. This desire to leave the dying, hopeless economy of Ireland to go somewhere with more scope has a direct connection with the life of our protagonist Connor. His parents' marriage is on the rocks and on the verge of collapse. He and his siblings are living a depressed existence with no sense of freedom. Connor gets transferred to a Catholic school. Although initially he gets bullied in his new school, but later on he finds some new friends who share his love for music and they help Connor in forming the band 'Sing Street' in order to impress the girl Raphina that Connor becomes deeply infatuated with.<br/><br/>The only other John Carney film I had seen before is 'Once' which I think is a masterpiece. 'Sing Street' is very different in style to 'Once'. While 'Once' has a raw, stripped down style of storytelling, 'Sing Street' has a much more upbeat, energetic style which kind of reminded me of the 2014 film 'Pride'. The upbeat style of the film's screenplay and style of direction embody the spirit of Connor and his teenage friends who also want to make their presence felt. Just like the people flocking to England to have a promising future, Connor also isn't contented with his present life and wants to do something with his life and pursue his love which is music. He doesn't know what awaits him on the other side if he pursues what he wishes to, but his romantic teenage heart is willing to take that risk and break free.<br/><br/>The relationship between Connor and his brother Brandon was beautiful and in a way the heart of the whole film. Through the backstories and other hints that are given, it is implied that Connor is the spiritual successor of Brandon. Once upon a time, Brandon had also found himself in the same position that Connor finds himself in. He also wanted to escape the metaphoric prison and live his life the way he wants to, but unfortunately couldn't. In the film Connor is standing at that same crossroad where he wants to escape the suffocating oppression of his teachers, the depressing state of his family life and go away along with his special girl Raphina to live their dreams. Brandon is a a very likable character, one can easily understand him, his opinions and his decisions. The way he helps Connor is nothing short of heartwarming. It is because of the existence of this loving brotherly relationship between Connor and Brandon that I think 'Sing Street' can be used brilliantly in a double feature with Ken Loach's 'Kes'. 'Kes' is another film where the protagonist Billy tries to escape the grim and depressing reality of his life through his pet bird. But instead of being loving, his older brother is adversarial which beautifully contrasts the relationship between Connor and Brandon in 'Sing Street'.<br/><br/>The romance between Connor and Raphina felt cute and believable. The chemistry between the boys of the bands also felt great. Apart from his real brother Brandon, Connor's relationship with the members of his band especially Eamon felt very tender and sweet.<br/><br/>John Carney uses flashy directing techniques here to complement the rebellious teenage spirit of the characters. We see rapid use of zoom, 360 degree shot that transitions into another scene, a whole fantasy-like sequence that almost felt like it was from another movie,etc. This completely contrasts the toned down approach in 'Once', but considering the subject of the film, the upbeat tone is perfect.<br/><br/>The acting is great from everyone involved. The actors give three dimensional performances. They are funny, likable and relateable. Special mention has to be given to Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and Lucy Boynton.<br/><br/>If I can find a flaw in the film, I'll say that the music in the film, although being great to listen to, sounds a bit unrealistically professional which took me out of the film at times. I know that this is a feelgood film which at times flirts with elements of fantasy, but I think the quality of the music could have been intentionally lowered a bit and for me, it would have made the film even more personal and intimate and lovable.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is really enjoyable. It is funny, emotional, thought-provoking and has a big heart. It pays a tribute to all brothers all over the world. The romance between the leads is cute and believable. It didn't move me as much as 'Once', but it is certainly a worthy entry in Carney's filmography."

","When his family decides to cut expenses because of the recession, Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) a teenager who loves music, is transferred to a public Christian school where he finds to be totally out of place. One day he sees a girl, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), waiting out of the school and goes to talk to her, deeply moved he decides to put a band together so she can star in their music videos and mainly to impress her. This brings him and her and his new friends in the band into a coming-of-age tale that is a powerful as it is romantic.<br/><br/>I think ""Sing Street"" is the kind of movie that would enable a director to do whatever he wants next, that's how brilliant of a piece John Carney has put together and by looking at how confidently and effortlessly it manages to be alive I have now moved to the church of John Carney, despite not quite enjoying his past film ""Begin Again"".<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that filled me with joy about filmmaking and storytelling, a beautiful, coherent, original, hopeful and thrilling piece that moved me throughout its duration and hasn't left my head for quite some time. This is an exemplary piece where everything just clicks and matches, be it the director being so inspired by the content, the actors giving it their all, the music being so on point it could already go down in history, everything is simply delightful and touching without ever being sugary or melodramatic.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that so much is fitted into a one hundred minute frame, but I guess that it all starts and ends with these characters being so alive and so effective, in a setting so perfectly fitting, they just become this overwhelming figures that speak so intimately to us without even having to do anything. Their portrayal is so well realized and so incredibly touching it naturally brings an audience's heart to soar.<br/><br/>These people are first and foremost relatable, yet after that their representation on screen become so unique and especially original you don't know where to look when they are on screen. The casting department deserves a raise after having worked this out, there isn't one actor that feels out of place. Even some of the extra's work is key to the film and enhances moments to even further meaning. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo manages to play this person without ever stepping into grounds we wouldn't appreciate, yet he manages to walk on that fine line really tightly and emerge with a characterization that is as three dimensional as possible and one that will certainly stand the test of time. Yet, the real knockout here has to be Lucy Boynton. No doubt her unbelievable charm and unique beauty help build the role, but this is a performance that goes well beyond that. It is the classic performance you get a crush on and that is always the sign of really excellent work because it means you have brought your character to life in such a complete and convincing way we start to project ourselves onto her. This is inspiring character work.<br/><br/>And I still haven't mentioned Jack Reynor or any of the band mates. Every single one of these people is made to be on screen portraying this role, it enriches the film so much to see such perfect casting and execution. However, we cannot ignore the gargantuan work Carney has put into this and the way it comes through to us. Every action, every shot both in foreground and background, all that is going on bears meaning and development, it really shows how much passion went into this.<br/><br/>The visual language just flows effortlessly and you are never lost, we go through fantasies, an ensemble cast, video cutaways, it all molds into one beautiful story that has something magical about it. It moves your emotions endlessly and makes you get carried away with these people. Even the music, which often in these kind of films results as a kind of gimmick, here it is used to brilliant effect, it molds organically into the narrative and gives ""Sing Street"" that punch that truly takes your breath away, even though it can feel a little too advanced for its own sake. <br/><br/>The thematic exploration in the key of the coming-of-age story is pretty ambitious, the themes range from the complications of love to the wild world of teenage fantasies and dreams, exploring their reflection in reality and the very complicated and bittersweet relation that exists between them, resulting in something that literally everyone can truly be moved by. Still all of that is achieved not only by not taking away the fun of the film, it is actually integrated into that, it in fused into this energetic narrative, with very clear and logical touches, of which the result is a constantly alive film where every action has a thematic effect.<br/><br/>The only criticism that ""Sing Street"" might be subject to is possibly in its overwhelming romanticism. Whilst there is a point to that, I just think that the film world is realized in such a way that where it never oversteps itself and makes for the romantic side being earned rather than forced. It really does turn into almost a modern fairy tale, but it knows that and that is its aim, making the pay off so incredibly effective. There might be a little bit too much hope-fullness in the air, but it is so well portrayed it is impossible to be mad at it.<br/><br/>All of these abstract and probably unclear thoughts above are indicative of the power of this film: a piece that emotes even with its smallest and most insignificant moments. A truly original and unseen formula that is as inspiring as it is beautiful. One of the best films of the year and a must see for every single person."
"Reno-Rangan","9","1","2","14 August 2016"," Back to the 80s with rock and roll and romance.
","I seriously thought this might be an overrated film. I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.<br/><br/>This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.<br/><br/>""Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad.""<br/><br/>At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.<br/><br/>Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.<br/><br/>In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.<br/><br/>""It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them.""<br/><br/>I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.<br/><br/>A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.<br/><br/>All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.<br/><br/>The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Sing street is a brilliant, inspiring, feel good film which will leave you pumping your fist in the air once you walk out of the cinema. The movie manages to balance fun, 80's vibe, original songs and a brilliant soundtrack (which is not forced upon us) that makes the viewer feel like they are in the era in which this film was set. Also, the performances from every character were absolutely fantastic from the young acting debutant, Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (who you cannot tell is acting on screen for the first time) to the consistently rewarding Aidan Gillen, who makes the most out of the rather small role he is given. The film is directed and written with a consistent, fast pace yet it allows the audience to digest everything happening on-screen. These characteristics make way for one of 2016's best films so far. My only issue, however, with this film is the stereotypical ""bully character"" who's arc seemed a little rushed throughout the film as they were trying to conclude the story (still a decent character though)."

","'SING STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Another comedy-drama musical film, from writer/director John Carney (the man who also brought us 'ONCE' and 'BEGIN AGAIN'). It tells the story of a boy, growing up in Dublin (during the 1980s), who starts a band to impress a beautiful girl he likes. The film stars newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (in his film debut); and it costars Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor, Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy. Like Carney's other films, it's received rave reviews from critics, and it's also been a hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well (like Carney's other films).<br/><br/>The movie takes place in south inner-city Dublin, in 1985. Robert Lalor (Gillen) sets his family down, to explain that they're struggling financially. In order to save money, he's taking his youngest son, Conor (Walsh-Peelo), out of paid schooling; and he's sending him to a free state-school, called Synge Street CBS. It's a Catholic school, run by a sadistic principal (Don Wycherley). Right away Conor feels like he doesn't fit in. Then he meets a girl named Raphina (Boynton), and he immediately takes a liking to her. In order to impress Raphina, Conor tells her he's in a band. This leads Conor into making more friends, to start the band, and a journey of self-discovery begins. <br/><br/>The movie is extremely uplifting, and inspiring; especially if you feel like you're an outsider. Like Carney's other films, the music is really catchy (and well produced) as well. The performances are all good, and the characters are almost all lovable. Carney just seems like a master, at making this type of movie; and I think this is his best one yet!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA"
"Lejink","8","1","2","17 July 2016"," Boys and Girls on Film
","Really enjoyed watching this I suppose you might call it musical-comedy film set in 1985 Dublin. Mixing in recognisable parts of various earlier films and TV programmes such as, deep breath, ""The Commitments"", ""Gregory's Girl"", ""Back To The Future"" ""About A Boy"" and even ""Grange Hill"", you can tell from all of these that we're firmly in teenage angst territory. To be fair, the setting in Dublin doesn't add too much to proceedings as there's no special references to the sectarian divide which was more prevalent then, so that the film could have been set in Anytown, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. However the Dublin placement is as apt as any in demonstrating the outreach of popular music as well as the romance of young folks yearning for a better life away from home and of course the unique Irish accent and humour.<br/><br/>Of course a certain amount of stereotypical characterisation can't be avoided in a feel-good movie like this, with the supposedly unattainable dream girl, old-fashioned, domineering school headmaster and lunkheaded bully who all interact with the young lead as he arrives new in school wearing an immediately distinctive pair of brown loafers and who makes it even tougher for himself in a way by going all Robert Smith as he forms a New Romantics-inspired band with a bunch of talented schoolmates and dolls himself up in eye-shadow and multi-coloured hair.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes like I said have resonances from the other films mentioned with many of the scenes seeming familiar from elsewhere but there's enough flair, charm and energy to make it pull through and come together. My favourite scenes were the recruitment of the only black boy on the estate, the songwriting sessions with his multi-talented schoolmate and the ""Back To The Future"" dream sequence but episodic as it is, it's all directed and acted very engagingly so that you accept and acknowledge the sometime clichés as you laugh along with the humour and get behind the teen hero as he chases his dreams of sorting out his dysfunctional family, getting the girl and chasing his musical dream. The ending's good as we're not shown if any of them work out but at least the lad's trying to make a change in his life.<br/><br/>The original songs are all very good, if not always strictly in-period, there's little profanity in the dialogue and the acting and singing of the young cast are very good, making it a fun, enjoyable dare I say it, family entertainment movie."

","John Carney's movies are always nice. He does with musicals what Richard Curtis (Notting Hill, About Time) does with sophisticated comedies: he revitalizes the genre. He writes (and directs) musical films made of good ideas, beautiful people, catching tunes and not-stupid romantic stories (check 'Once', 2007 or 'Begin Again', 2013).<br/><br/>Sometimes the outcome is a big hit ('Begin Again', 2013), sometimes a less inspired production. Sing Street is a nice movie, that introduces a very talented actor and singer (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and gives the beautiful Lucy Boynton (also probably previously unknown to greater movie audience) the chance to play a major role.<br/><br/>The story is rich of events, the characters are nice and the songs are good (and well produced). And the result, once more, is entertaining."
"CineMuseFilms","8","1","2","10 July 2016"," a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music
","For many people, garage bands are synonymous with adolescence and its associated yearnings for identity, independence and fun. The Irish-produced Sing Street (2016) steps into this space with a more complex mixture of ingredients than is usual for such films. Described as a musical comedy, it is also a coming-of-age romance and a period film set against themes of economic recession, family discord and school bullying. Director/writer John Carney prefers to call it a 'stealth musical': one that sneaks up on audiences who otherwise might not choose to see a traditional musical. Whatever you call it, this in one of the most engaging and enjoyable films of the year so far.<br/><br/>Set in Dublin during the 1980s, this simple story is told through the eyes of 15 year-old Conor whose quarrelling cash-strapped parents move him from an expensive private school to a local parish school. It is a cultural shock and violence from schoolyard thugs and priests are standard fare for a community where drugs, alcohol and beatings are commonplace. He meets alluring but unattainable 16 year-old Raphina who has left school to become a London model and asks her to join his band (which does not exist). The rest of the film traces the formation of his band called Sing Street and its growth from hopeless wannabes to a credible group of musicians. Unlike traditional musicals where dialogue slips into song at the slightest provocation, the music works naturally both in and for the film to underscore the humour and pathos of growing up. The first-time romance runs parallel to the evolving music while Conor's maturing outlook on life helps him rise above the limited opportunities that Dublin offers.<br/><br/>Sing Street has no pretensions to thematic originality and it relies entirely on genre-familiar ingredients. But it soars well above its class because of outstanding casting and a brilliant soundtrack. Conor and Raphina are immensely attractive and likable personalities and their remarkable acting range lets them glide effortlessly from precocious youth through adolescent angst to unrestrained exuberance. They are the soul of the film and become as one with its music. The toe-tapping soundtrack includes Duran Duran, Joe Jackson, Hall & Oates, The Jam, The Cure, as well as performances by the Sing Street Band and others, making this is a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music. This is a great little gem from The Emerald Isle."
"WinterbornTM","9","1","2","10 July 2016"," Sing Street (2016) Review
","Sing Street is a 2016 drama written and directed by John Carney and starring Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor and Aidan Gillen.<br/><br/>Being directed and written by John Carney, the man behind movies like Once and Begin Away, it's clear from the start that music is going to be a huge part of the movie. The story is set in 80's Dublin and follows our main character, Conor Lalor, who, after he has a crush on a girl, he decides to start a band so he can win her over. <br/><br/>Even though the plot doesn't sound that original, it's the characters and the setting that really shine in this film. Ireland in the 1980's was a harsh place, with economic problems. Conor is forced to move to a school, where he faces bullying and teacher abuse. Also the state of his family is on thin ice, with his parents being on the verge of divorce.<br/><br/>All these things might make the movie seem a tad dramatic, but there is always a light shining on the main characters, mainly from the antics of the band members, how they struggle to film their music videos, and also the romance that's about to blossom between our protagonist and his crush. <br/><br/>Also, Conor receives a lot of support and training provided by his older brother, Brendan, portrayed by Jack Reynor. I was a bit skeptic about Reynor, knowing him from the last Transformers movie, but he really does a great job in portraying the older brother who refuses to conform, but is aware of the state of his family, and tries to take care of his brother at all costs. <br/><br/>Sing Street is guaranteed one of the best movies released this year, with great characters, epic music, a touch of drama and hints of comedy, with breakout stars like Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Lucy Boynton. This movie is a must! Final Grade: 9 out of 10."

It was excellent I loved it. I hope that a song will get nominated for best original song at the Oscars. The performances were pretty good, it was Fierda Walsh- Peelos first movie and he did a great job as the lead. But the best performance by far in this movie was Jack Reynor. Say what you want about the Transformers movie but he is a really good actor and you see it in this movie. The characters were pretty good and very likable and the chemistry was great. My favorite part was the slow song that they played at one of the gigs. It was very emotional and almost made me tear up. It was that great.<br/><br/>But there are some negatives in this movie. The story very clichéd at times. However the worst part was the ending. The last scene where they were out on the ocean with the boat.

The characters mostly all rang true, although some of the insights seemed a bit far fetched for teenagers.<br/><br/>There wasn't a whole lot of conflict throughout, so there were a few slow periods, but the film was nicely paced in total.<br/><br/>The heroine of the film reminded me of Ione Skye (where are you?), which added a feeling of 80s realism in addition to the wardrobes and music, and the red-headed kid reminded me of a fellow I knew in high school, so I kind of felt like I knew these characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable film with very few missteps and a hopeful ending that at that time and place in history (and in the film) actually seemed to make sense for the characters involved."

"paul-allaer","9","1","3","8 May 2016"," ""Futurist Band Forming""
","""Sing Street"" (2016 release from Ireland; 105 min.) brings the story of Conor, a 15 yr. old boy. As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is ""Dublin 1985"", and we see Conor strumming the guitar in his bedroom. At dinner time, Conor's parents inform him and his older brother and younger sister that Conor is being transferred to a Catholic school to save money. Conor has a hard time adjusting to the new school environment and is picked on by another boy. Then one day, Conor notices a girl across the street. He gathers all his courage and asks her to be in a video for his band. When she says ""okay"", Conor realizes that he needs to out together a band, on the double! At this point we're not eve 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest music-related film from writer-producer-director John Carney (Once; Begin Again). In fact, one can make the argument that ""Sing Street"" is the spiritual prequel to Once, as ""Sing Street"" looks at the life of 15 and 16 yr olds as they are starting to make decisions for themselves and trying to make something of their lives. And what better motivation to start a band than to impress a girl! Carney nails the musical landscape of the mid-80s in Ireland perfectly. ""Thursday, 7 pm, It's Top of the Pops!"" screams a voice on TV, and we witness Duran Duran's ""Rio"" video. When Conor struggles to recruit like-minded kids for his band (called Sing Street), he posts fliers in various locations, ""Futurist Band Forming"". And how might such a futurist band sound? It sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand (check out first song ""The Riddle of the Model""). While much of the movie is light-hearted, Carney does not forget to shed light on some darker aspects of Irish society (mass-migration to England; stoner older brother is college drop-out, and of course the role of religion (Catholic, specifically) in society. But in the end, it's all about the music. Carney co-wrote and co-plays on all the new songs with Gary Clark, and Once star Glen Hansard is listed in the credits as one of the studio musicians. Last but certainly not least, props to the performances given by the two leads: Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Conor, and Lucy Boynton as 16 yr. old Raphina. Ah, to be young and having your whole life ahead of you... Bottom line: this movie is sheer exuberance.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report (perhaps the lousy weather had something to do with it). I had a smile on my face for much of the movie. If you are looking for a feel-good movie that happens to showcase a lot of great music, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Sing Street"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"futuredwight2007","8","1","3","26 April 2016"," ""Sing Street"" is a Beautiful Modern Musical
","John Carney's ""Sing Street"" is a masterful modern musical. It delves into the relatable complexities of aspiring talents everywhere. It is a fun, engaging, charming, and often beautiful reflection on what goes through the ever-changing minds of those who want more in life. Carney's previous efforts are all in the similar vein of hopeful desperation, but something about the youthful approach in this film makes it stand out as an absolutely must-see.<br/><br/>The film follows Cosmo, a 15-year-old guitarist. As his parents enter the final stages of a troubled marriage, Cosmo is sent to an All- Boys Irish-Catholic Preparatory Institute. This new school is strictly run by Brother Baxter, who leaves no room for personal endeavors into one's soul. That is, until one day, when Cosmo first meets Rafina. An eccentric and perplexing character, she embodies the idea and beauty of chaos (something that the refined find ever so appealing nowadays, it appears). But more importantly, Rafina is the catalyst for Cosmo to pursue some sort of artistic endeavor in his life, and begin to explore his greater expressions. In an attempt to woo her, Cosmo creates a ragtag band with his fellow cohorts, a selection of hilarious misfit students. From here, the film delves deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of love, music, art, and the pursuit of happiness.<br/><br/>When ""Sing Street"" works, it works. The film is composed of simplistic cinematography that helps capture an enlightened look of (often gloomily portrayed) Ireland. The performances are all superb, especially the chemistry between the lead performances of newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (Cosmo), and the beautiful Lucy Boynton. The supporting cast is great, but the best moments often come from the under-utilized fellow band-mates, who are hilarious. Most importantly, the energy of the original music, and the scenes enveloped around the various compositions, are beautiful. Every song is fitting for the era, and deeply meaningful. I suspect this soundtrack will go very far in the future. The peak of this film falls in the end of the second act, during a well-crafted fantasy sequence for Cosmo, as he pictures the young, charming, musician ideals. He imagines performing to an energetic prom-night crowd, all set to the theme of ""the dance scene in Back to the Future."" He pictures Rafina coming in to dance, the crowd parting ways, and everything being resolved in his life. But as the song finishes, his fantasy ends, and he returns to the bleak reality of the world around him.<br/><br/>These beautiful moments are littered throughout the film, and make it all the better. Unfortunately, I have two major qualms with this film. First and foremost, the performance from Jack Reynor as 'Brendan,' Cosmo's elder brother, who acts as a secondary catalyst for Cosmo's interest in music, is mediocre at best. Despite a hilariously well-written character, Reynor's attempt at an Irish accent often slips in and out of authenticity, and makes it very distracting to believe in him. <br/><br/>The second critique I have regards the clichés of modern romance films. Rafina is first presented as a strong, independent female. She desperately wishes to leave the clutches of her home in Ireland, to sail to the shores of Britain, and pursue her dreams of being a model. And despite these strong ideals, she is reduced down to a Siren for Cosmo. Their affection for each other is palpable, but in the end, her dreams are set aside. She becomes a weak, secondary character.<br/><br/>Why this peeves me so much is that I have seen this before. Millions of times. I could list off film after film after film where a male character is introduced to some amazing female figure, strives for her, temporarily loses her, but after some time, they reunite. It's so beyond cliché at this point, that I want something more real to happen. I had hoped the film would have taken a more cynical or realist approach, and have Rafina leave the island for good, off into the world to pursue her dreams of becoming a model. This loss would have been a more connectable motivation for Cosmo, and to see his music to take form. Per typical romance film clichés, though, this was not the case. The two get together, and live happily ever after. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Sing Street"" has the potential to be a classic coming-of- age film for future ages. But more importantly, this film is a perfect musical. The age and days of the American musicals are done and over. ""West Side Story"" is gone; ""Chicago"" and ""Oklahoma"" can remain places on a map. If ""Sing Street"" gives us any sign on the new musical approach in film, we are in great hands. There is a beautiful line in the film where the sinister Brother Baxter, after forcing Cosmo to wipe away make-up from his face, says to him, ""No more Ziggy Stardust."" And, as sad and timely as that statement is (Rest in Peace Mr. Bowie), it's true. The time for classic music and artistic expressions of the past have come and gone. But what lies in their wake, and what rises from the ashes, is something to be excited for. <br/><br/>I would give ""Sing Street"" an 8/10."

When a movie hits some real notes you watch closely, thinking that it might be about to break free from the reins of cliché and show you something different. You generally also get poignancy in the bargain: truth hits home.<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" starts like that, and it starts well. Connor is a fifteen year old high school kid who has to change schools due to financial difficulty his constantly warring parents are experiencing. The school is a nightmare, filled with bullies, delinquents, and teachers as violent as both.<br/><br/>Connor has a plan, though: he wants to start a band. He does this with an ease that feels a bit contrived. In fact, everything that happens with the band seems too easy: all the members can play adequately from the get go, despite only being in their middle teens, and they come together much quicker than seems likely. When Connor sings, the voice doesn't sound like it comes from his body, or even from the environment the character is in. It sounds like it comes from a recording studio, and a man much older with more training, and maybe even some studio effects to balance it out.<br/><br/>If Connor can sing this well, why is he looking to start a band with a bunch of school friends? Shouldn't he be on ""Top of the Pops""?<br/><br/>""Sing Street"" is a movie that starts like a breath of fresh air, a movie that could end up containing truth. Alas, it doesn't; it heads into cliché territory and never really looks back.<br/><br/>The movie features a dream sequence in which everyone sings and dances and priests do cartwheels.

","""Sing Street"" premises 14-year-old Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) forming a band and becoming the star of his own bleak reality. Good! Compelling! Why does he start a band? So he can impress the pretty girl hanging out, by herself, on the stairs across his school! Oh. That's the point when I almost lost my just awoken interest. But, as ""Sing Street"" features one of my favourite actresses, I wanted to give it a try.<br/><br/>It is set in 1980's Ireland: the viewer is thrown into a world of unemployment, Catholicism, racism, and boredom. I enjoyed the stabs at society, although the message would've been clear even with a lesser use of the word ""faggot"". <br/><br/>Noteworthy are the performances of Lucy Boynton, Maria Doyle Kennedy and Jack Reynor. Boynton succeeds to deliver cheesy lines believably and with dignity. (Raphina: ""Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy sad."" Damn she's like what, 15? I hate when teenagers get BS lines dripping with ""profoundness"". Yes, ""The Fault in Our Stars"", I'm rolling my eyes at you). Boynton is able to breathe fresh life into a somewhat cardboard-y, stereotypical character. In this way, her character (Raphina) became the most accessible to me. Maria Doyle Kennedy, who I know and love from Canadian TV series ""Orphan Black"", portrays the wife who's had it. Although she doesn't get a lot of screen time, her portrayal is convincing and a highlight. Reynor plays the oldest brother: he's definitely got the best lines and makes the viewer root and hope for Brendan. Another plus is the setting. The film depicts beautiful shots of Irish scenery, green and lush. Furthermore, the movie's colour scheme and tone, in their subtlety, provide real candy for the eye. Humdrum yet beautiful.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though I didn't find the story to be very original. A predictable plot without any surprises whatsoever, corny dialogue that made me cringe at times, and a protagonist that I just didn't like made for a not very enjoyable viewing experience. I'm not a fan of dysfunctional family settings used only as a plot device – I'd have wished for more in-depth portrayal of the parents. Moreover, although I understand why Barry's abusive family is introduced, I wish they had cut it out. In its briefness it becomes almost comical. And then – the biggest bully joins the band. Really? Come ooooon. <br/><br/>A character that really annoyed me, besides the protagonist, was the boy with copper hair and braces. Ugh. I wanted to turn down the volume whenever he had some lines. For me, not sympathizing with the main characters of a movie is always problematic. In this case, I couldn't feel with nor root for the major characters (the band) at all, and that's the movie's major fail. Also, I'm just not a fan of teenage love portrayals, and that's perhaps my main issue.<br/><br/>I had hoped for a good soundtrack, at least, but did not overly enjoy the chosen songs either. All in all, the movie was rather a let-down. It didn't accomplish what the premise suggested – to lift me up and make me dream."

Surprisingly enough, the songs which are often rubbish in this kind of production were actually enjoyable. In general, I must admit that I kind of liked the movie. Not my favorite by any means but just good enough to recommend it to a youngish crowd. Still, if you are into movies where music is kind of the key element, there are better options out there. The Boat that rocked and Begin Again are two good examples."

","Writer-director John Carney repeats his familiar (Once) boy meets girl rock and roll story in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. The soundtrack features Duran Duran, The Cure, Hall and Oates, and others from that time period. Conor(Ferdio Walsh-Peelo) is a fifteen year old who falls in love at first sight when he spots sixteen year old Raphina(Lucy Boynton) standing on the front steps of a building. He works up the courage to speak with her. She tells him that she is a model who aspires to travel to London and the big time. He says that he is in a band and asks her to star in a music video. The problem is he has no band, and so he manages to gather up some locals and they actually become rather decent musicians and Conor has some talent as a song writer. The rest is fairly familiar and somewhat predictable, but the leads are so charming that Sing Street is worth watching. It is not as good as ""once"" but Carney keeps the film interesting and the music is not bad, so crank up the surround sound and enjoy the ride."

","It gets a 7 for me and that is good. 8-9-10 are off the charts good. This movie has little scenes that you can not help but look at and see other things. The 2 boys who get together and write the lyrics and music make you see McCartney and Lennon. The lead singer gives you the feel of Billy Joe Armstrong from Greenday. The soundtrack brings back ''That Thing You Do'' but with better songs and background. The boy who plays the older brother is great-- really connects with the viewer, (Jack Reynor) The story...old as time- Boy sees girl and starts band to meet girl. As in most movies the band is quite good. Some good one liners and funny parts, like when the young man is concerned because she may have a boyfriend and says he picked up in a car with music playing. The brother asks what band and he says Genesis, to which the brother says ''it won't last''nobody dates a guy who likes Phil Collins. Overall a good movie and it just rides along...before you know it, it is over. So if you have a little over an hour and a half give it a whirl. The young actors are good for the roles they had and one had a John Cusak look about him-- Like I said it makes you find similarities to other people and subjects."
