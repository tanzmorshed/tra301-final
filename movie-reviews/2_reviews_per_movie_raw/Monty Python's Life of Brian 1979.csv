","Personally, I believe this to be one of the most intelligent comedies ever made. It might not appear that way at first because the film does have its share of simple slapstick and ""naughty"" moments, but generally, the topics the Pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. <br/><br/>A firework of hilarious sketches, timeless quotes and clever comments on the human condition, this film was deemed too dangerous for the masses and therefore, until recently, banned in several countries (normally, this only used to happen to the so called ""Video Nasties"").<br/><br/>This film never once makes fun of Jesus (Christ) - but it DOES take the mickey out of blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion.<br/><br/>An outstanding achievement and endlessly re-watchable. <br/><br/>My vote: 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"Gazzer-2","8","357","470","1 April 2002"," I Think God Has A Sense Of Humor, Don't You?
","And in the 1979th year of Our Lord, God took in a screening of Monty Python's ""Life Of Brian,"" and thought it was funny. <br/><br/>He did NOT think the film was blasphemous or offensive in any way. Yea, God did admire it's incredibly clever pokes at religion and at religious fanatics, for God Himself knew the virtue of being able to laugh at one's self. He also knew before He even walked into the theater that the title character, Brian, was NOT Jesus Christ, but merely a man who was born at the same time as Christ---right next door, in fact---and became mistaken for a messiah. God settled into His seat, with popcorn in one hand and diet soda in another, and had a rollicking good time.<br/><br/>He recommended ""Life Of Brian"" to His Son, Jesus, who went to see it the following week. He, too, thought it was a hilarious film, and immediately sang the praises of the Monty Python troupe---John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam & Michael Palin---for creating such a wonderful spoof. And He recommended the film to His friends. Have an open mind, He told them, and have fun. <br/><br/>But God and His Son were quite puzzled why so many people in the Bible Belt community were so upset by ""Life Of Brian""---especially the ones who hadn't even bothered to SEE the frigging film for fear of being damned for all time. And They both shook their heads in dismay. It's only a movie, They thought, and a very funny, harmless one at that. Get a life!<br/><br/>But God gave Monty Python's ""Life Of Brian"" the power to overcome such ridiculous adversity, and today, well over two decades later, the film is rightfully regarded as a comedy classic, and one of the Python's finest works. It's *still* not a film for everybody, but does it have to be? If you're in tune with the Python's style of zany comedy, you'll enjoy ""Life Of Brian.""<br/><br/>And praise be to Saint George Harrison, late of The Beatles, for lending the Pythons a hand in making this wonderful movie. :-)"
"ptpenry","10","199","268","11 February 2002"," Stunningly funny
","One of my fave films of all time, this film has so many laugh-out-loud jokes and ridiculous thought processes that it would probably be unfair to pick out just a few. Tough - I'm going to: John Cleese as the legionnary Latin teacher rebuking Brian not for daring to use graffiti on the Roman fort but for using the wrong tense, Michael Palin trying to find his place in life as an ex-leper, Terry Jones as Brian's mother trying to protect him from myrrh - let's face it, we've all wondered what myrrh is ! The bit that always makes me laugh without fail is something that isn't always noticed - when Michael Palin is having a go at the guards; ""Do you find it risible when I say the name of my friend Biggus Diccus ?"" if you look carefully you'll see that Palin is trying really hard not to laugh.<br/><br/>Puerile, silly but also very very clever. This film doesn't criticise religion or Jesus in any way ( what was wrong with the people who tried to ban it ? ) - it's just asking what it could have been like in a society that was expecting the Messiah to show up at any moment, and covering it in a massive coating of comedy.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute classic - 10 out of 10."
"j30bell","9","198","272","20 December 2004"," A Masterwork of British Comedy
","In Life of Brian, Python created what John Cleese called simply ""our masterpiece"". As a piece of writing, it is the most impressive of the three feature length Python movies. The scenes remain episodic, but there is a much more coherent narrative than in the earlier Holy Grail  I loved HG too, but for different reasons. The characters (well about one or two of the characters) have acquired some subtle shading, which is rare in comedy and, alas, rare in British comedy in particular. The plight of Chapman's Brian is one that I really cared about (although his death is also extremely funny, upbeat and one of the truly iconic moments in British cinema).<br/><br/>The story must be fairly well known. Brian is born at the same time as Jesus with whom he leads a kind of parallel life, thus allowing the team to lampoon and satirise everything from religious zealotry and mob hysteria to 1950s biblical/sword & sandals epic cinema. It does this by marrying historic situations with more modern attitudes; thus we have revolutionary Stan who wants to be Loretta and have the right to have babies, the old man who can't understand why he's being stoned for saying simply ""that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah!"" the gruff centurion correcting Brian's Latin grammar while he's trying to daub anti-Roman slogans on a wall and the gentle centurion asking each of a line of the condemned ""crucifixion? Good"" while ticking them off on his clipboard. Interspersed with this is slapstick, pantomime women (I'm not sure there are any real women in Python, which is probably its greatest failing) and a small amount of the trademark Python surrealism (the spaceship, the ""prophet"" talking about the sons misplacing the things owned by their fathers who had placed them down only just a moment ago etc). In short, something for everyone  except, perhaps, committed Christians.<br/><br/>A lot of attention has been paid to whether LoB is blasphemous. The Pythons claim not and I'm not sufficiently religious to care very much. On the surface, I disagree. There are also occasional sideswipes at ancient Jewish custom  although, to be fair, only stoning which, if you'll pardon the pun, might be considered a fair target. Jesus is not criticised, but the film's central message seems to be; be in the right place at the right time and even a man called Brian can become God. Almost the last line is from Eric Idle saying; ""you come from nothing and go back to nothing"" which doesn't suggest that the man on the mount at the beginning is a divinity, no matter whether he's talking sense or not.<br/><br/>Most importantly though, LoB is refreshingly satirical. There always was an element of this in Python (mediaeval Christian philosophy lampooned in the Holy Grail for example ""this new learning amazes me Sir Bedevere, explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes so, if she weighs the same as a duck, she must be made of wood, and therefore - a witch"". I guess LoB attracted attention because the satire had never been so bold or obvious before. This is also what makes LoB such an incredibly funny film to watch; but put it this way  despite what Rowan Atkinson may have once said  I'd be very surprised if the Python's weren't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.<br/><br/>That shouldn't put you off, though. Unless your faith is too weak to survive Python's gentle humanism, watch this movie  you'll probably love it."
"alice liddell","10","185","266","13 October 1999"," Still one of the funniest films of all time.
","It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).<br/><br/>Also, nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it.  Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.<br/><br/>But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique.  My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?<br/><br/>How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.<br/><br/>This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context: it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.<br/><br/>The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?).  No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed.<br/><br/>But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices.  The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor.  They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor.  This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism.  Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.<br/><br/>The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with.  If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot.  The seriousness is only there if you want it.  Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining.  It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense.  Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.  Treasure it."
"pstancer","10","121","183","14 January 2005"," Classic seamless comedy.
","This film is by far the best of the Python outings. It ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, which unlike 'The Holy Grail', hasn't dated with time but improves with repeated viewing.<br/><br/>The Pythons supposed take on Christianity, which caused outrage when it was first released (mostly by people who hadn't seen it), is actually a take on cults, both religious and political, and the people who follow them.<br/><br/>Brian, our hapless hero, is confused, horny, and constantly mistaken for the Messiah; who just happened to be born in the manger next to him. Brian just wants to be left alone, and to pursue his love for Judith, a member of the People's Front of Judea. Judith just wants the Romans to go home; but only after they've left the sanitation, the medicine, education, irrigation, roads, public order, etc., etc. ... oh and don't forget the wine! <br/><br/>Will Brian's love for Judith go unrequited? Will only the cheese makers be blessed, or does this refer to all manufacturers of dairy products? And just what have the Romans ever done for us? <br/><br/>It's subtle; it's anarchic; and it's possibly still banned in Norway. This is classic seamless comedy at its best. 10/10."
"Krupsky","10","14","17","14 April 2019"," Best comedy ever
","Love this Gem!<br/><br/>This story in different variations was told for almost two thousand years, but it always had inconsistencies and white spots, and its true essence, it seems, was always well hidden by someone. Much has changed when a group of researchers from England took up the ancient tradition, many of whom were attributed to excessive alcohol addiction, as well as the American avant-garde artist who joined them.<br/><br/>The film was shot in the scenery, built for the film Franco Zeffirelli ""Jesus of Nazareth."""
"lee_eisenberg","10","90","144","10 October 2005"," Ave Monty Python!
","This is, in my opinion, the best religious movie ever made. Monty Python's Flying Circus knows how to do everything hilariously. Focusing on Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who gets mistaken for the messiah in Judea in 33 AD, the movie pokes fun at everything: Romans, Jews, imperialism, even extraterrestrials. With sardonic lines almost every minute, they play religious fundamentalism for what it is: silly. I don't even know which scene was my favorite; every part was so funny. You'll never forget the song at the end. This is comedy in its greatest form, and it makes sense that it would come from the guys who brought us the ""parrot sketch"". Absolutely a hoot."
"JerBear-2","10","105","172","30 May 1999"," One of the top 10 of all time
","True, my tastes are eclectic. This movie is so incredibly clever and thought provoking that it's not surprising that it raised so many hackles. Plus, it's as fast paced and funny as a Marx Brothers movie without the musical breaks. You can watch it 20 times and you'll still sing at the end. Undoubtedly one of the top 10!!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","86","141","29 June 2004"," Still funny, after 25 years
","When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feel particularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a well-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject is religion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the western world, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, of course, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should be noted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, and not a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, and then they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if you don't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course, one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, but they could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laugh at them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian ""believers"" can probably laugh at it too, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans of the Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a dark sense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it. 8/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","78","127","21 June 2004"," Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film
","Monty Python's follow-up to their cult smash Holy Grail was Life of Brian, a film that takes on (if not always with the utmost seriousness, then usually with a mix of silliness and slight intellectualism) the believers in religions, the zealous nature that belief brings out in people.  I first saw the film in the theater upon its re-release last month, and I found it very funny, though not with the kind of belly laughs that I had on my first reaction to Holy Grail.  It's not without it's scenes that stick out as some of Python's finest (the Stoning, Pilate's scenes, the Spaceship sequence), even as sometimes it goes a little too broad for comfort (part of the colisseum).<br/><br/>Yet, the great strengths that lie in Life of Brian are that 1) the writers and performers (Chapman, Cleese, Gilliam, Jones, Idle, Palin) bring their irreverent strengths to a fine point with the script and multiple roles. Even when a scene doesn't get the laughs it could've or should've, it turns out to be a scene brimming with a cleverness that could only exist in the ""Python-esque"" universe.  2) the director (Jones) and designer/animator (Gilliam) lay the groundwork for this realistic atmosphere of 33 A.D. and bring out what is the best in the acting, Pythons or otherwise (famous British comedian Spike Milligan has a role of note).  Held over from the sets of Franco Zeferelli's Christ film, the Pythons use all these locations and settings and little details to spring out their wild, brilliant gags. The look of the film enriches the comedic elements, and the result is (arguably, of course) the troupe's best film.  Not for all tastes by the way (Monty Python in general for me took some while to warm up to, but paid off once it worked).  Grade: A"
"O'Hanrahanrahan","Null","71","121","11 August 2000"," Disgraceful depiction of the Popular Front.
","For many years I have worked tirelessly to promote the aims of the Popular Front of Judea, and quite frankly I'm disgusted at its treatment of us. To depict us as a lonely old man is one of the most grotesque distortions ever commited to celluloid. We are at least three times that number, and furthermore we don't have a single repressed transexual among us. An absolute disgrace. I shall never watch this film again, unless I rent it out on video or see it on the TV in the near future. Vive la PFJ."
"waltersjon","10","11","15","19 May 2019"," Life of Brian is Monty Python's greatest work
","Life of Brian was radical at the time and it's still a great anti establishment and anti authority film. Which pokes fun at politics and religion and status. It's so funny and some of the scenes are so sharp with lots of historical in jokes. As someone involved in politics I particularly love the idea that Reg 'our glorious leader' can't go on the raid as 'he has a bad back' yet he's happy to martyr the rest of the team. And when they call for a meeting and pass motions it is as Judith says 'perfectly simple Reg' that they should just go and try and stop the Romans' 'nailing him up.' And Brian's success is greeted with shocked surprise and the announcement that 'we need doers in our movement' (unlike Reg). Another highlight has to be Reg asking 'what have the Romans ever done for us.' And as the film ends tunefully there's a message for us all 'Always look on the bright side of life.'"
"MrVibrating","10","74","133","27 December 2005"," One of my all-time favourites
","While Quest for the Holy Grail was funny because it was so low-budgetty and silly, Life of Brian is more advanced and with a greater variation of humour. It also has a bigger budget, which is great to see. Every scene looks realistic, and the sets (someone said they were formerly used by ""The Last Temptation of Christ?) are great.<br/><br/>Almost every line in this movie is a classic, and all of them very quotable. The characters are hilarious, and out-of-this world zany.The plot is good, and contrary to the Holy Grail, it actually comes to a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The movie also dares to joke about religion. No, they don't joke about Jesus or God, but about the believers in them. The line ""I say you are Messiah, and I should know. I've followed a few"" is so spot-on it hurts(when I laugh).<br/><br/>All in all, watch this. This is possibly the funniest movie ever created. You can't afford to miss it."

","This is such a fine movie. It involves a guy who was born just down the street in Bethlehem. The Magi go to him first and then realize they are confused and leave. He tries to lead a normal life, but word gets out that he is the Messiah. He does everything he can to get this off his back, but a group of followers begin interpreting his words as great wisdom and godliness. It gets so bad that when they are sent to check out ""the other Guy"" they ultimately find his pronouncement (actually non-pronouncements) to be much more impressive. There is a hilarious scene where he tries to make a statement about the Romans, but his Latin is so bad he is force to write it over and over on the walls, like an American schoolboy. The final scene is incredible. If you've never heard the song or seen the images, check it out. I would imaging there are some people who find this movie blasphemous. I consider it one of the greatest parodies ever produced."
"Teyss","10","10","16","5 December 2016"," Satirical and cunning farce: you either love it or hate it
","""God created man in His own image"" (Genesis, 1:27). He gave him humour, and saw it was good. Later, God created cinema, and saw it was good. Still later, God created the Monty Python, but was not sure it was good. It got out of hand, because this disrespectful bunch used God's creations, man, humour and cinema, to turn them against religion.<br/><br/>So the story goes: some believers think ""Life of Brian"" is blasphemous. It was banned on its initial release by several UK councils, Ireland and Norway. However, non-believers think this aspect is trivial. Let's try to neutrally assess how provocative the movie is.<br/><br/>In any case, the religious satire needs to be tempered by two caveats: the movie not only mocks religion, but almost everything MP can lay their hands upon; the blasphemous parts are not hostile nor gratuitous. Let's explore both elements. I won't discuss humour, because it is subjective (for me the movie is hilarious).<br/><br/>1. What do MP target apart from religion?<br/><br/><ul><li>People. Except Brian, humans are stupid and/or ridiculous morons. Brian's mother is greedy, vulgar and simple-minded. Persons quarrel foolishly precisely when Jesus voices his Sermon on the Mount, a message of love. Even Brian's girlfriend, brainwashed by ideology, abandons Brian on the cross when he asks to be freed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crowds. If individually people are pathetic, when they gather, they also are ugly. Women cruelly regroup at the beginning to lapidate a poor lad whose crime is trifle. An insensitive mob plays with prisoners' lives by asking for irrelevant pardons to make fun of Pilate's pronunciation. Crowds blindly worship Brian: ""We've got to work it out for ourselves"", they repeat like brainless zombies. The suicide squad, well, commits suicide without freeing Brian.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Oppressive power. Romans imprison, crucify and execute. Yet the powerful are laughable. The mighty Pilate and Biggus Dikus are grotesque. A Roman patrol, instead of arresting Brian for a graffiti, makes him copy a hundred times ""Romans go home"" in Latin (a reference to the slogan ""US go home"" during the Vietnam War, which ended four years before the movie was released).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Vain ideology that delivers no results (a possible reference to left-wing politics). To resist oppression, the rebel group displays an impressive incompetence. They spend more time fighting each other than against Romans (People's Front of Judea, Judean People's Front, Judean Popular People's Front). They just talk pompously and don't manage to perform one single effective action during the entire movie: only does Brian graffiti the fortress. The rebel leader is cynical, cowardly and short-sighted.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Themselves. Like a schoolboy bunch, MP make fun of everything including their own movie. Each of them plays different roles, some completely silly. Graham Chapman appears in frontal nudity, very rare in cinema at the time. They introduce an absurd and useless scene parodying Star Wars (WTF?), whereby a spaceship captures Brian (FWTF?) and crashes after a battle (FWTFF?).</li></ul><br/><br/>2. The movie iconoclastically tackles various religious fundamentals. MP argued their movie is heretical, not blasphemous, because it mocks dogma but not God: granted, even though the representation of Jesus is ambiguous (see below). Also, it sometimes feels as if it does not criticise religion as much as the usage people make of it, since they are dumb as noted above.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Nativity. The three Wise Men mistake Brian for Jesus, implying the Latter was a man like any other.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Crucifixion. Brian ends on the cross like Jesus: the loop with the initial confusion is looped. Crucifixion, which was actually widespread, is not shown as horrible but as a relatively minor punishment. The final scene is not tragic but comical: the crucified sing ""Always look on the bright side of life"", one of MP's best songs. Understandably, this sequence was highly controversial.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Messiah. It is easy to become one like Brian: a few words, some mystery and crowds will follow senselessly. Faith, as love, is blind.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Sayings. Jesus's Sermon is misunderstood (""Blessed are the cheese-makers"", ""Blessed are the Greek""). Yet it is unclear who is being made fun of: people who miss the point, or Jesus who accumulates the ""Blessed are"". Jesus is surrounded by a halo, but this positive view could be first or second degree.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Relics. When Brian drops a gourd and a shoe, his followers absurdly split into two groups, each worshipping a different relic. And that is how sects are born...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fear. Religion is based on fear (Hell, Judgement Day, the deadly sins, the ten commandments, crucifixion representations, prohibitions). In the movie, would-be prophets distil fear with dreadful predictions... until a lunatic turns this rhetoric upside-down (""A friend shall lose his friend's hammer""). Again it is not clear if the target is religion, or people who need to be frightened in order to orientate their deeds.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wows. A hermit breaks his silence wow... because Brian stepped on his foot. Wows appear as a useless and easily reversible commitment.</li></ul><br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>In summary, ""Life of Brian"" is farcical yet meaningful, richer than its simple blasphemous reputation: it blends MP's unique style into a consistent and funny satire. Historically well documented, it arguably is the best of the three movies they directed, less gratuitous and nonsensical than ""Holy Grail"" and ""The Meaning of Life"".<br/><br/>Behind the farce, the movie delivers a hedonistic message: even if life is bleak, let's have fun. People are idiotic and cruel, but also laughable. Oppressive powers can be ridiculed. Humans are condemned, but show resilience by singing. Ideology can be a risible delusion.

","I have been reading the reviews, and I'm just happy to see that there still are some people out there who appreciate real comedy. For anyone who is willing to actually watch the movie, and not expect a zoolander-ish barrage of fleetingly funny moments, this is definitely one of the funniest movies in the history of film. One may watch this movie a hundred times, and still find parts of it he never noticed before. The scene with Michael Palin chained up to the wall in the dungeon is possibly the most perfect absurd comedy sketch in existence. (Oh, what I wouldn't GIVE to be SPAT at in the face!) Even better than the Dead Parrot! And the movie has a wonderful unity as well, as a massive (semi-serious) satire of not just religion, but humanity in general. Two of them went to Oxford, three to Cambridge--these guys are well educated, and their work is absolutely brilliant, simply funny on the surface and hilariously complex beneath. This movie IS better than Holy Grail, and is the python's finest work."

","Religious parable about intolerance focuses on Brian , a Jew in Roman-occupied Judea. After joining up with an anti-Roman political organization, Brian , a reluctant savior is mistaken for a prophet , and becomes a peculiar Messiah . Then a group decides Brian is the Messiah and he cannot convince them he is not . Brian joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, one of several dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing .<br/><br/>Irreverent and often sidesplitting satire of Jesus Christ movies that will probably offend some catholics , including many Political and Social comments . Graham Chapman plays the title role born in a manger just down the street from Jesus Christ's and spends his life being mistaken for a messiah . This is the tale of of a man whose life parallels Jesus ; it results to be the most sustained and funniest film from Britain's bad boys . Six cast members played 40 various characters such as Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones and Michael Palin . Well produced by George Harrison, a huge fan of Monty Python, he felt so strongly about the movie he ""pawned"" his home in London and his office building, to raise the 4 million $ . According to the diaries of Michael Palin a possible title was ""Brian of Nazareth"", which was strongly favored by Palin, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle . In the end this was never used, perhaps to avoid title comparisons with Jesus of Nazareth (1977), whose leftover sets were used for filming parts of this film . However, when the film was released in Italy in the early 1990s, it was titled ""Brian di Nazareth¨ . Originally financed by EMI, but they backed out when they believed the script to be blasphemous . EMI was sued by the Pythons and settled out of court. Finance was then arranged through George Harrison, who thought it was the last chance to have another Python film, creating Handmade Films for this purpose . Though the movie has been directed by Terry Jones only, to avoid the frictions and conflicts there were in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Terry Gilliam directed at least two scenes: the very first one, with the arrival of the Wise Men and the Nativity, and the abduction of Brian by the aliens, as explained in the commentary.<br/><br/>Lively Original Music by Geoffrey Burgon , including jolly final song sung by Eric Idle . Colorful as well as evocative Cinematography by Peter Biziou . The motion picture was well directed by Terry Jones . In 1965, with his friend Michael Palin, he made The Late Show (1966) for television, which was his first success and he wrote for many other TV shows . But Jones' greatest success was the zany Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-74) (with Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle) and other hits such as Jabberwocky , The meaning of life , Monty Python and the Holy Grail and this Life of Brian , among others ."

Hell, many comedy fans would even say that I was being blasphemous, but here goes...<br/><br/>Life Of Brian isn't THAT funny!<br/><br/>There, I've said iteven after multiple viewings, I still find the Life of Brian, Monty Python's tale of an ordinary man who is mistaken for the Messiah, to be rather disappointing as far as belly laughs are concerned.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a very quotable film, the sets and cinematography look great, and it certainly has a lot of valid things to say about the stupidity of religion and it's followers (who are, let's face it, often pretty stupid!), but I honestly feel that much of the movie's comedy just doesn't work, and actually feels rather laboured. I mean, is a speech impediment really THAT hilarious?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that I am not amused by any of the Python's silliness: there are definitely laughs to be had, particularly at some of the more absurd moments (after all, who can keep a straight face at the phrase 'wolf's nipples'?), but, with the complete adoration that Life of Brian receives from it's fans (particularly from students), anyone would think it was the second coming.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."

","The first time I watched Life of Brian I hardly laughed at all. Why? Certainly not because it wasn't funny. The problem was that the most absurd and hilarious moments in the movie are actually painfully real, only exaggerated a little bit. If the messenger hadn't been so funny the message would have really depressed me. Which is why it's such a great movie, I suppose. It's hilarious, and at the same time it's actually about something that matters, and is really depressing at that.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think it's blasphemous in any way. It conveys its message in a way that's probably offensive to some people, but it doesn't mock God or Jesus, it doesn't even lash out against religion as a whole. It merely points out the absurdity of people who are too lazy or too stupid to think for themselves, and desperately cling to anybody willing to lead them. Or even unwilling to lead them. You can almost feel the anger and frustration of the writers in some scenes, as if they want to scream ""God/Evolution/Whatever you believe in gave you a mind to think with on your own.

Beatle George Harrison had to dole out millions to save it after the studio pulled out over fears of backlash. Good on ya, George, because what resulted is nothing short of a landmark achievement in comedy. While ""Life of Brian"" has all the elite DNA of typical Python, it elevates beyond its siblings with an ending for the ages, as the crucifixion itself is repurposed as musical comedy of gleefully poor taste. A choir of convicts nailed into wooden slabs breaks out in song with ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,"" cementing the scene as a culturally understood reference point throughout Britain, and in much the same way that ""this goes to eleven"" from ""<a href=""/title/tt0088258/"">This Is Spinal Tap (1984)</a>"" is established nomenclature in the States.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie couldn't be made today, as the use of superficially insensitive comedic material to lambaste ignorance has somehow become verboten. What a shame, that. Fortunately, ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" wasn't a stage production, and instead remains immortalized on film for the weathering of all shifts in the cultural winds. - (Was this review of use to you?

","The British comedy troupe Monty Python had always been on the edge of controversy ever since their show ""Flying Circus"" appeared on the BBC in the late 1960s, but nothing had prepared the world for what Life of Brian had brought. In Life of Brian, the comedians go after the one institution that has always had trouble accepting satire: religion, specifically the Christian Church. Seen as blasphemous, Life of Brian needed an eleventh hour rescue for Beatle George Harrison to finish the film. The church was wise to wonder what the Pythons were doing. Life of Brian is filled with questions of the role of religion in society, why people often feel they need religion, and the age old question of ""What would happen if the 3 wise men went to the wrong stable on that night they brought gifts to the young savior?"" There is typical Python silliness throughout the movie, set up early where listeners at one of Jesus' sermons (held at ""tea time,"" of course) think they hear that ""blessed are the cheese makers."" But the most important part of this film, and it's charm, are the questions of religion. No matter your faith, you will find scenes in Life of Brian unsettling, provocative, and humorous, possibly all three at once. While not wall-to-wall as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian is a humorous look at civilization's oldest and dearest institutions, and asks us to consider what we are doing."

Still, I make no apologies, and you don't see people going around quoting French and Saunders, do you? If there is such a thing as a perfect film, this is it. Of course, it's all been said on here before, over and over, about how good this is, so I will aim for a slightly different approach.<br/><br/>To really appreciate the absolutely impeccable comic timing these men exude, watch the expression on Chapman's face a split second before he is 'thwown to the floor' a second time. There is a look of absolute incomprehension/fear/comic despair that I would love to have on a poster were one to exist. I would never tire of looking at it. Also, when Chapman starts saying ""Thamson the Thadchuthees Thtrangler' etc to the restive crowd at the end, they know EXACTLY when to make them start laughing. Listen to it, it's EXACTLY right. Awesome.<br/><br/>Of course, the script itself is faultless, but I'm not one of those blind Python acolytes who says everything they ever did worked or stood the test of time; the 'Lumberjack Song' certainly doesn't stand repeated listening, and now sounds cringe worthy if people sing it in homage. I thought that when Palin did it in Himalaya recently; he sounded almost embarrassed by it.<br/><br/>But enough nit picking. When you do comedy, at this sort of prodigious rate, it won't all work. To me, the only bit I didn't really like was the Spaceship section, but this is redeemed by the three word response uttered by the chap who sees Brian walk away unscathed. So much of it does work, it's beyond criticism.<br/><br/>Sublime, and if you haven't seen it, you've settled for second best without knowing it."

But with this film, the team stuck its neck out. A much bigger budget, more of a film than series of scenes/sketches and a very controversial social commentary and satire.

They had 6 very talented people, and between them they knew how to get the best out of each of them individually, in front of and behind the camera. The casting as always was spot on, every character memorable. For bewildered & sensitive - get Chapman, for shouty & demonstrative - get Cleese, cheeky chappy - get Idle, big nose - erm..Chapman again, effeminate & snooty - get Palin... As well as roles in front of the camera, Jones and Gilliam did a great job in bringing the Holy Land 2000 years ago to life. and to top it off they had the had one of the best team of comedy script-writers going.<br/><br/>I could focus on a particular part of this film, but what's the point its all good.

","As some reviewer said this is the best of the Monty Series, I completely agree with the person. This is one of the most brilliant- I will not call comedy, but satire - on society.<br/><br/>Let us forward the timeline of the movie by about 2000 years, to today, naturally then the link to Jesus is removed. Thankfully the name, Brian, is one of today's common one, and the whole story becomes one of today.<br/><br/>Every facet of the movie is - as we see happening around us.<br/><br/>A man, through circumstances becomes a leader with a huge fan-base (immaterial whether religious, or Political, or any other Idol, like Ronaldo/ Messi). This fans eat out of his hand, he knows he isn't what they think, but he doesn't have any means to come out of it, (in real life he doesn't want either) and whatever he does, whatever he says, is the edict for the mass. I see it happening every where, don't blame only Hitler.<br/><br/>Then we have the Scheming revolutionaries, who only plot and scheme, with the pawns (like Brian) sent to execute their scheme. And when they fail, with fatal consequence, the honchos are there to sing the requiem, and mourn the loss, on the conference table (As Bush et al did at Iraq casualty or Johnson at Vietnam)- this too isn't limited to a country or a section - even the today's similar so-called revolutionaries are doing it everywhere in the world. And as with these revolutionaries, for modern ones too, the target is known (kidnap Pilate's wife), but not the goal (what are the demands to be made once she is held on ransom).<br/><br/>The graffiti sequence - is hand-holding Brian, correcting his mistakes, encouraging him to continue, till the authority realized that it was mistake, and then trying to erase the activity and punish the individual - Osama, Taliban, IS all are this.<br/><br/>Every section of the movie resonates with some or other happenings in the society, in many spheres, religious, political,... by the elements, sometimes for gains, at other, just for a whim, or a conviction (without any reasonable base or end). <br/><br/>On this angle, the movie, a comedy, becomes intensely depressing, when I look and match the things around us."

","I'm not a Python fan but I thought this film was hilarious. I am also a communicating member of the Church of Scotland and attend church fairly regularly. I might point out that I have heard a minister make mention of this film in his sermon and he was not condemning it. Even now, supporters of this film have to keep on driving home the point that this film is NOT about Jesus. Yes, Jesus does appear and is portrayed reverentially in the film (what the Pythons say about not being afraid of the blasphemy laws is a load of big talk). The laughs come thick and fast. If mishearing Jesus's words as ""Blessed are the cheesemakers"" is blasphemous then schoolchildren all over the world commit blasphemy when they sing ""Dance then, wherever you may be. I am the Lord of the Dance Settee"". If creating a fictional character whose life runs parallel to that of Jesus is blasphemous then Lew Wallace committed a blasphemy when he wrote Ben Hur. In a recent Channel 4 documentary about the film Polly Toynbee said there is a great humour vacumn at the heart of religion. It's true. The way some religious groups got so hot under their clerical collars about it takes your breath away. When the film opened in Glasgow, the late Pastor Jack Glass, well known arch enemy of Billy Connolly, presented the cinema manager with four nails. Glass told the manager this was because he was crucifying Jesus all over again. Much as he would have disliked it,Glass had a few things in common with Billy Connolly. Both came from a Glaswegian working class background, both had beards and expressed their strongly held views irrespective of what other people thought. Glass also had a bit of a knack for making people laugh although unlike Billy Connolly this was not intentional. Most of the religious nuts who opposed and continue to oppose this film have never seen it but these people aren't noted for their broad mindedness. Some have seen it and probably would have sat their scowling and not laughing as it was what they saw as their Christian duty. But frankly, it's very hard to sit through this film and not laugh. Brian's ride in the spaceship is hilarious. There are also some brilliant lines in the film. Come on, you religious fanatics. Get a life. Have a laugh. Your faith must be very flimsy if it is harmed by a film that is just meant as a joke."

","The Pythons' 1979 movie has its moments but doesn't replicate the mix of intellectualism and absurdity that defined ""Flying Circus"" and ""Holy Grail."" ""Brian"" is altogether too linear and grounded for the Pythons. One notable exception, an alien abduction, feels a bit strained, like a conscious attempt to do something random. It would have been one of the most pedestrian segues on an episode of ""Flying Circus.""<br/><br/>Moreover, religious fundamentalism seems far too easy a target for the Pythons. Satire was always an important part of their act, and there are some very funny instances of it here at the expense of the People's Front of Judea (PFJ) and its similarly-named but much-despised splinter groups, but nothing quite as sharply-written as the exchange with the anarcho-syndicalist peasant in ""Holy Grail."" Moreover, the scenes never seem to end quickly enough after the points have been scored. The same wells, whether PFJ infighting or crowds slavishly following (and misunderstanding) prophets, are visited so often that the movie becomes predictable and stale, adjectives not often heard in reference to the most influential sketch comedy troupe of all time.<br/><br/>The best bits here are more low-brow: Romans with sophomoric names that send the centurions into uncontrollable giggling fits, and straight- faced full-frontal nudity. Even in these cases, though, incredibly slow pacing saps some of the humor. A gag about speech impediments, for example, takes ages to play out to its conclusion. The film ends well, though, with a perfectly earnest Eric Idle singing the hilarious earworm ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""<br/><br/>Some religious groups and even entire nations (Ireland and Norway) took the Pythons' bait and reacted with great offense to the release of ""Brian,"" a fact that says a lot more about the time period than it does about the movie, which hardly justifies such a response. From a contemporary perspective ""Flying Circus"" seems far more subversive than ""Brian"" in the sense that it forged new comedic ground and tested the limits of the television format. ""Brian"" doesn't reach beyond what the Pythons had already achieved, and, in failing to succeed at anything different, compares unfavorably."

The result is a satire not of specific religions, but of religious characteristics that apply to most of the world's religions: people being quick to believe, notions of what is sin, etc. It plays off a western sensibility, but it doesn't directly criticize Judeo-Christian religious practice. The incredible Monty Python cast delivers this in their typical sketch humor manner, though this film has much more continuity than 1975's ""Holy Grail.""<br/><br/>Brian Cohen was born the same day as Jesus, but Jesus is separated from the film early on, so the film becomes about how Brian finds himself looking for something to believe in and eventual finds people strangely believing he is the messiah. He is a true protagonist in that the ridiculousness happens to him instead of the other way around. It is the rest of the cast in their multiple roles that surround his story with humor.<br/><br/>The array of comedic characters are not nearly as diverse and memorable as ""Holy Grail"" and for that matter the film is not nearly as memorable or funny. The comedic elements are the same, but they are much more potent in ""Grail."" However, the plot line is much smoother, with the sketches fitting into the plot line instead of bouncing all over the place.<br/><br/>""Brian"" is good as a satire, better than it is at being a comedy. While the film will still has the distinct look and feel of a Monty Python work, it doesn't go from hilarious scene to hilarious scene as one might expect if they've only seen ""Grail."" There's a lot of clever humor, but ""Brian"" is not nearly as out of the box as you'd like. But in terms of offensive, only if you take all discussion of religious ideas and history very seriously as the Monty Python crew quite literally turn the sacred into the profane."
"MaxBorg89","10","5","12","22 January 2006"," If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten...
","... And that's to watch a Monty Python film and laugh yourself to death. Their sense of humor hasn't dated a bit, and it still satisfies audiences around the world. Life of Brian was released in 1979, but it keeps ranking high in people's TOP 10 comedy lists (in my case, it shares the first place with Young Frankenstein). Even the most depressed people in the universe will feel happy again once they've seen this incredibly funny movie.<br/><br/>Now, a short message to those intimidated by the fact that Life of Brian was banned in some countries (though eventually released after a few years) for its supposed ""blasphemy"": there is nothing blasphemous in this film. All right, it makes fun of prophets, messiahs, wise men and crucifixion, and yes, Jesus does show up for a couple of seconds, in the infamous ""Blessed are the cheese-makers"" sequence, but the Pythons didn't mean to mock the Bible. They just wanted to tell the story of an ordinary man, Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who just happened to live in that period. It's an enjoyable satire on everyday life, both Jewish and Roman (or Woman, as Michael Palin would say), in 33 AD Judea.<br/><br/>The movie has so many memorable gags and characters it's impossible to list all of them: my personal favorites are Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) with his speaking defect (see the Woman part) and his friend Biggus Dickus (Chapman again), the PFJ led by John Cleese's Reg, and of course the immortal ending, which I won't and can't reveal, but I assure you: rarely has a comedy had such a brilliant, original conclusion. It's in the same league as Some Like it Hot's ""Well, nobody's perfect!"".<br/><br/>So, I really hope you'll have a good time with Britain's best comedians. I sure did.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way: always look on the bright side of life..."

"rebeljenn","5","11","34","16 January 2006"," It's funny, but it's not for everyone
","'Life of Brian' is Monty Python's film about Brian, a man in the old days who gets mistaken for being Jesus Christ. This film endures the humor that is typical of Monty Python. Fans of this type of dark and crazy humor and Monty Python will no-doubt love this film. It's not a masterpiece of film-making, but it has plenty of comedy at the expense of the Romans and Brian and other unfortunate souls. If you do not like Monty Python, you will not like this. In my opinion, Monty Python is alright, but it is not the funniest film out there, and it's not the sense of humor that is my favourite (if that makes sense). There's also some pretty good morals to be learned from watching this film. You'll laugh at the character names and even at the memorable song at the end. Enjoy it, but the film is not for everyone."
"JamesHitchcock","10","4","9","3 January 2012"," He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy
","To celebrate my 1000th review for IMDb, I turn to another favourite film. ""Life of Brian"", the third Monty Python film, follows the formula used with great success in the second, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", namely that of telling a story, loosely based upon historical fact or legend, though a series of sketches.<br/><br/>The title character is Brian Cohen, a young Judean living during the first century AD. He joins the People's Front of Judea, a small group fighting to free the country from Roman occupation. After a series of misadventures, Brian is mistaken for the Messiah by a crowd of followers and ends up being crucified. Brian is frequently confused with Jesus Christ; the two men were both born in stables in Bethlehem on the same day, and the film opens with the Magi mistakenly coming to offer their homage to Brian, before realising their error.<br/><br/>The film was hugely controversial when it came out in 1979, with numerous religious groups accusing the Pythons of irreverence; in a notorious television debate John Cleese and Michael Palin were forced to defend it against Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark. These accusations had the predictable effect of increasing interest in the film, and thereby boosting cinema attendances, but they also highlighted a possible legal problem. Two years earlier, Britain's once-moribund blasphemy laws had been successfully revived by the anti-pornography campaigner Mary Whitehouse in a prosecution against the magazine ""Gay News"". Fear of a similar prosecution meant that the Pythons had to be careful not to be seen attacking Christ himself; it is always made clear that Brian and Jesus are two separate people and that it is the hapless Brian who is being lampooned. The nearest the film comes to criticising Christian doctrine is during the ""Sermon on the Mount"" scene where Christ's words are misheard or misunderstood by his listeners. (""Blessed are the cheesemakers"" ""Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products"").<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film does contain a good deal of religious satire, aimed at those forms of organised religion which are intolerant of opposing viewpoints or refuse to permit critical scrutiny of their own dogmas. This is shown in the early scene where an elderly man is about to be stoned for blasphemy, having said ""that piece of fish was good enough for Jehovah"", and more importantly in the scene where the crowd take Brian for the Messiah. This new religion only lasts for a short while, but during its brief existence it mimics some of the less admirable features of real-life religions, such as the tendency to split into competing, mutually hostile sects and the attribution of miraculous or mystical significance to the most mundane words and actions. The mob's faith is not shaken when Brian's divinity is denied not only by his own mother (""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"") but even by Brian himself. (""Only the true Messiah denies his divinity!"") <br/><br/>There is also a good deal of political satire in the film, much of it of a surprisingly conservative nature. The famous ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"" sketch, for example, can be seen as a vindication of British and European colonialism. The political left is parodied by the People's Front of Judea. This tiny organisation, whose lack of significance is equalled only by the self-importance of its members, ostensibly exists to campaign against the Roman occupiers, but expends most of its energies in ideological squabbles against other revolutionary groupuscules such as the Popular Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front. Its bureaucratic mentality means that it is incapable of taking any action without extensive debate and the passing of several motions.<br/><br/>Another target of the film's satire is Biblical epics like ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" or Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"", which generally took a reverential attitude to religion. (Shooting in Tunisia, the Pythons reused some of the sets from Zeffirelli's film). The final crucifixion scene contains an obvious reference to Kubrick's ""Spartacus"". (""I'm Brian and so's my wife!)"" Cleese wanted to play Brian himself, but this role eventually went to Graham Chapman, leaving Cleese free to play his normal gallery of pompous authority-figures, including Reg, the leader of the PFJ, and the centurion who, after catching Brian painting the slogan ""Romans Go Home!"" in incorrect Latin (""Romanes eunt domus"") forces him to paint the grammatically correct version ""Romani ite domum"" 100 times. There are also memorable contributions from the other Pythons, including Terry Jones (who also directed) as Brian's shrewish mother Mandy, Eric Idle in his normal wisecracking ""Mr Cheeky"" personality and Palin as the camp, lisping Pontius Pilate (""the little wascal has spiwit"") and as the ineffectual public-schoolboy Roman officer Nisus Wettus. (""Crucifixion? Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each""). Idle's other great contribution to the film was to write the closing song ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"", which has since taken on a life of its own, being played at football matches, weddings and funerals, including Chapman's.<br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" came out when I was a teenager, and as like most British teenagers of the period I was a huge Python fan I enjoyed it enormously. Since then I have watched it regularly, and every time I do I find something new to laugh at or some new subtlety I had not previously noticed. It is, in my view, the best of the Python films and the greatest British comedy of the seventies; it paved the way for the revival of British film-making in the eighties. Several of the greatest films of this revival were to be made by Handmade Films, the company set up by former Beatle (and Python fan) George Harrison to make ""Life of Brian"". 10/10"
"jluis1984","10","4","9","3 April 2007"," Probably Monty Python's movie masterpiece...
","Story says that after the enormous success of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", a reporter asked the comedy troupe about their next film project. Not having an answer for that, Eric Idle answered ""Jesus Christ - Lust for Glory"" as a joke, and it became their typical answer to questions about the Python's future projects. Fortunately, what started as a joke soon began to be taken seriously by the comedians as an interesting project to make, and they began working in a movie, not about the life and times of Jesus Christ (as they were unable to find anything to mock about it), but about the credulity and hysteria of those who follow messianic saviors. ""Life of Brian"" was the name of the movie, and as soon as it was released quickly became known as one of the funniest and most controversial works done by the Pythons, and not without a reason!<br/><br/>The movie's plot is obviously, about the life of Brain Cohen (Graham Chapman), who is a poor Jewish boy who was born in Nazareth on the same day as Jesus. Years later, Brian is now a young man who has grown hating the Roman occupation of his country while working at the local Arena. One day Brian attends one of Jesus' sermons and among the crowd he notices Judith (Sue Jones-Davies), a woman who leads him to the rebel group ""People's Front of Judea"". Brian joyfully joins the rebels, but the missions given to him do not exactly end in the best way for the group. Things get complicated for Brian when after a bizarre series of circumstances, he ends up being confused with a messiah, and with this he gains an considerable amount of ""devoted followers"".<br/><br/>The first thing one notices about ""Life of Brian"" when compared to the Pythons' previous movie is how structured is the plot. While of course ""Holy Grail"" had the running theme of King Arthur, it was still a series of sketches tied together by their style and themes. ""Life of Brian"" shows the Python style of comedy completely adapted to a cleverly written and well structured narrative that, with their usual mix of witty satire and surreal nonsense, showcases their ideas about organized religions as well as the other social themes (government and other political satire for example) they tend to use. Very fresh and original, the comedy in ""Life of Brian"" is top notch, and takes what started in the now legendary ""Flying Circus"" to a whole new level. Contrary to what could be thought, the structured narrative enhances the comedy instead of limit it, and makes for a more focused piece of work.<br/><br/>Python member Terry Jones takes again the director's seat (without Terry Gilliam this time), and makes the Python's masterpiece come to life, remaining true to its roots without sacrificing the film's structure. While it's obvious that Jones knows that the film's power is in the script and the cast, he allows himself to showcase his love for ancient history and, taking advantage of the budget (and the locations of ""Jesus of Nazareth""), he sets the wacky story of Brian in a lavish and very realist Jerusalem. The sharp contrast between Jones' care for some historical accuracy and the script's bizarre and surreal humor truly adds a lot to the ""Pythonesque"" atmosphere of the film, as it feels oddly appropriate within the satiric tone of the movie. With a style more focused on the characters than in the visuals, Jones was the natural choice to direct ""Life of Brian"", as its truly the characters what makes the movie the jewel of British humor.<br/><br/>And as always, the Pythons are simply superb in their portrayal of the many characters of the movie. Graham Chapman only plays three this time, but he is Brian, and as our main character he perfectly portrays the naivetÃ© of the young idealist man. John Cleese is also excellent in the many characters he plays, specially as the leader of the People's Front of Judea. Director Terry Jones himself appears as, among others, Brian's mother, making a remarkable character with his peculiar falsetto voice. While I can't single out an actor as the best in the film, I must say that Michael Palin's performance as Pontius Pilate is easily one of the funniest of the movie. Finally, Eric Idle gives the icing in the cake as he sings the Python's most famous song, ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"".<br/><br/>If ""Life of Brian"" has a fault, it would be that it may feel too long to those unfamiliar with Monty Python's style of humor. That said, this movie is probably the easiest to ""get"" as it lacks the surreal randomness of ""Holy Grail"" or the darkness of the sketches in ""Meaning of Life"", making it the ideal introduction to Python's humor. I can't write about ""Life of Brian"" without talking about the ""controversies"" it met after released, as it was accused of being blasphemous and disrespectful to God. While the film is indeed irreverent, it is in no way an attack to God, it is more a satire on the way some religious people follow their leaders blindly without really thinking about it. There is nothing blasphemous in the movie, and it is more humanist than irreligious.<br/><br/>Monty Python's style has proved to be one of the most influential in the history of British comedy, and personally I think that ""Life of Brian"" is the crowning achievement of their career. The brilliant satire they cleverly put in the movie's script is easily one of the best in history of film, as it's as merciless as it is funny. Zany, irreverent and wild, ""Life of Brian"" can stand proudly as the Python's movie masterpiece, and while sadly they only made one film after this, it's always better to look on the bright side of life and see it as the testament of their genius. 10/10"
"CinematicInceptions","8","3","6","3 April 2016"," Spot on comedy and decent social commentary.
","Although this movie is made mostly for laughs, I think the Python comedy troupe recognized what opportunities the genre afforded them, and used it to their advantage as a way to inspire people to be better. In my opinion, movies should be any combination of three things: entertaining, thought provoking, and inspiring. While entertainment is at the forefront here, there are some of the other two elements here. The primary two things that I think they are trying to get across here is 1. Be able to think for yourself and 2. Be careful who you follow. These subtle ideas are probably more incriminating on religions than any of the actual jokes made. But in some ways, the psychology of the masses that follow Brian are not as inaccurate as they are made to be.<br/><br/>There is a bit of a different feel from Holy Grail here. Once again, every actor has his own style of comedy and plays similar characters, but there is slightly less absurdity, less budget cut gags, and much more verbal comedy. Graham Chapman plays our protagonist again, and mostly makes us laugh through his facial expressions and reactions to the events around him. John Cleese plays most of the supporting cast and probably has the most lines out of any actor. Terry Jones is featured a few times in very different roles, but always making us giggle at his vocal versatility. Michael Palin makes a few appearances, most notably as the ex-leper. But Eric Idle really steals the show in this one, popping up all over the place, often multiple times in the same scene and always with a big grin on his face.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what makes the comedy of this movie feel so spot on. Holy Grail was hilarious for sure, but it was outrageous and didn't change tone very much. But with Life Of Brian, it just seemed like the Pythons knew just when to extend their jokes and where to stop them off and how to blend their jokes. Brian haggling over price when he doesn't want to is funny enough, but then they take it further and make it happen at an incredibly inconvenient time. Having a Roman general named Biggus Dickus isn't worth making an extended joke with a whole family of off-color names, so instead they make it a bigger joke by directing the humor at the guards not being able to contain their laughter. Then you get a couple random moments like Brian getting suddenly picked up by aliens. And then adding in tiny laughs like the guy who says he's not different round it out. Of course, this doesn't mean it will make everyone laugh, and it's definitely not LCD comedy, but it just seems like they nailed their comedic pacing. It's really too bad that so few comedies today decide to be more intelligent and original, but I won't go into that.<br/><br/>If you liked Holy Grail or Meaning of Life, definitely watch this. If you were turned off by Holy Grail, this will probably be more appealing to you because it's less absurd. It's probably the best one of the three to start with if you aren't sure you'll like the style, though Holy Grail is the most kid-friendly. There really aren't that many jokes that poke fun at Christianity, but much of the humor requires some biblical knowledge to be fully appreciated. So, this may not be the comedy for you, but I would give it about ten minutes and if you aren't amused by then, it's not worth your time. Overall Rating: 8.6/10."

","How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!"

"bob the moo","Null","4","10","24 January 2007"," A classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films
","Born in a stable, the infant Brian is mistaken for someone else until the wise men twig that they are in the wrong stable. Brian's life continues to be unremarkable until he is about 30 when he gets mixed up with the People's Front of Judea in their fight against the Romans (although he is only there to try and get in Judith). Unsurprisingly the actions of the PFJ don't exactly particularly succeed and Brian finds himself on the run from the Romans as a result. However while hiding out in speakers' corner he is first taken for a wise teacher but then for some sort of messiah  a mistaken identity that escalates out of control very quickly.<br/><br/>Watching the film now it is not really worth discussing whether this is mocking Jesus or not because the accepted wisdom is now that it is not an attack on Jesus but rather a lampoon on religion itself (although their original idea was to make ""Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory""). However if it doesn't seem so controversial nowadays just imagine an Islamic remake and how that would be received. Anyway back to the film in hand rather than the reaction of people who have not seen it complaining about their perception of it. At its heart this is a Monty Python film and the sense of humour is very British and very much them. I say this rather obvious statement because despite the fuss the most memorable thing about the film is how funny it is. It will always be remembered for the controversy but when you watch it it is basically a collection of sketches and comedy characters rolling one after the other with many of them well-known and full of memorable and funny dialogue.<br/><br/>That it isn't just a collection of sketches held together (like some of their other films) is down to how good the story is. Of course they did have a bit of help with this in regards material to adapt but still it does feel much more satisfying to have this solid narrative underneath all the madness. Over time some people have come to seen this film as an entire attack on religion but it isn't because the laughs were the focus. However scattered across the whole film are scenes that do effectively lampoon the concept of religious beliefs and religious establishments. Most of these are very clever and, in particular, one scene sums up the history of religious splits and factions (the shoe and the gourd) and is impressive in its superficial simplicity.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the cast are all on fine form. Although he wanted to play Brian, Cleese is much, much more effective in the many small roles he has and is best when he has petty authority figures to deliver. Of course similar things could said of all of the cast as Idle, Jones, Palin and Gilliam are all very good in their characters and are mostly all playing to their strengths. In the ""title"" role Chapman actually has the least rewarding role as he has to play it (comparatively) straight in order to keep the narrative together. He does it very well but the rest of the Pythons are much better simply because they have sketches to delivery rather than a narrative to drive.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films. Scene by scene it is a great collection of absurd sketches but the narrative is pretty much strong enough to prevent it just being this. Although the laughs are the all, the film has plenty of clever lampoons on the development of religions and religious organisations. It is a shame that it is so well known for the controversy because this has so much more that makes it memorable."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","4","10","1 October 2006"," Intelligence wrapped up in hilarious absurdity
","Good satires are hard to come by and between Natural Born Killers (1993) and the recent Thank You For Smoking (2006), not many come to mind  except the masterful Python achievement ""Life of Brian"" which sets an example for all satires to come. It is clear that Terry Jones has done something very cool and insightful here; he has created a world of subtle and not-so-subtle spoofs which locks you into and absorbs you in its fantastic humour. Even if you are not a Monty Python cultist you must recognize that every joke in the film is a well-articulated kick up the arse to some issue. <br/><br/>The plot outline is of the three wise men come bearing gifts to the newborn Brian thinking he is Jesus. When they realize their mistake they move onto the next stable where the right infant lies in his crib. This mix-up is the start of Brian's life, who will from now on live in the shadow of Jesus. Right, now forget all about this plot because nearly all scenes sidetrack from the key template  instead the story tips over into hilarious diversions and detours in Jerusalem. Even the opening credits do not seem to serve any purpose to the story it tells; it is a spoof of the James Bond openings with surrealistic montages and a sensual singer wailing. This is just how amazingly random Life of Brian is.<br/><br/>Yet it needs to be said that ""Life of Brian"" lacks some of the absurdity and randomness of the previous Python installment, The Holy Grail (1975). The gags and spoofs here are generally much smarter and more satirical. Whether you find this funnier or not is a matter of choice, but I think it works slightly better  furthermore, this film has held up better over the years for me. The intelligence behind the parodies is bafflingly spot-on when you scratch the 'funny' surface. It is impossible to do the gags justice in writing, but one of my favourite moments in the film is at the stoning of a 'blasphemer' who keeps saying ""Jehovah"". At the mention of the word, the crowd gasp in outrage and Matthias angrily tells the man: ""You're only making it worse for yourself!"" to which the blasphemer, about to be stoned, replies: ""Worse? How could it be worse!?"" Brilliant. It is chock-full of these gems, all commenting on the paranoia of the masses.<br/><br/>Many Christian fundamentalists have complained that ""Life of Brian"" is too anti-religion, which is idiotic. It presupposes that there were three wisemen, miracles and Jesus which is pro-Christian enough, so stop whining you morons. This is satirical masterpiece with more humour in it than most films I've seen and firmly stapled a the bottom of my top 20 films list.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","I could write volumes about this beloved movie, but I won't, being limited as I am.<br/><br/>From what I understand, one major complaint many had about this movie is that it disrespects Jesus Christ. Nothing could be further from the truth! A college friend of mine, who's very religious, refused to go see it, believing this to be the case. I assured him that it doesn't mock Christ, so he took my word for it and went to see it.<br/><br/>He enjoyed it, as did the rest of my friends. I explained to him that what the movie is mocking is the fringe element, nuts who glom on to anything and everything to follow en masse. The little bit Jesus is depicted (eg, the Sermon on the Mount,) is not disrespectful in the least.<br/><br/>The movie is zany, looney and nutso, as one would expect from MPFC. As always, there're things going on in the background that you need to watch for, little subtle bits that this troupe is famous for.<br/><br/>The basic storyline is how Brian, as he's growing up, gets caught up in things going on in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. He's often a victim of circumstance, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and rarely gets anything like a break. He's a likable fellow as a protagonist and you can't help but identify with him when things always go so wrong for him.<br/><br/>Now, some little factoids about the movie. It was filmed in Tunisia, and what the viewer doesn't know is that there were often scorpions in the immediate vicinity; they said the area was riddled with them. Something non-MPFC fans might not know is that Graham Chapman, in the lead as Brian, was also a medical doctor. He was not only the star of the show, but the physician for the cast and crew. When he wasn't in front of the camera, he'd hold ""surgeries"" (as the British call them) to treat people for various ailments, usually dysentery or scorpion stings.<br/><br/>The movie actually had TWO directors: the Two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam.) (Terry G., as they called him, was the token American in MPFC.) One more thing, before I go over the limit and write a novella: There's one scene in this movie that has NOTHING to do with it AT ALL, it comes out of the blue, it's hysterically funny. See the movie, if only for that one scene, it's worth it. You'll know it when you see it."

But I choose Brian for two scenes. The brilliance of the stoning scene, and the utter genius of the Latin lesson. Of course, John Cleese is in the middle of both, but do not make the mistake of thinking he carries the load; Palin's characters in the movie shine on their own (especially the sermonizer, with his long, drawn-out description of the thing they cannot find from the night before...that has an attachment), Idle is brilliant in his multiple roles (Ten shekels, you must be mad!), and the list just goes on. Perhaps the least-funny of all characters is Brian himself, but even here, Chapman's acting is superb in playing the straight man for all the jokes (which must have been tough for him!). Blasphemy? Don't be ridiculous.

","There is never a dull moment in LOB and some of the dialogue and jokes are now legendary such is the genius of Monty Python, lines such as ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"" and ""What have the Romans ever done for us"" immediately come to mind. Graham Chapman is in top form as the beleaguered would be rebel Brian, and later on as Biggus Dickus. John Cleese is unforgettable too as both PFJ (or was it JPF?) leader Reg and the Roman centurion and the Jewish official at the stoning. Michael Palin's lampooning of the controversial figure of Pontius Pilate was simply hilarious and in fact not too inaccurate, take away the speech impediment and you have a ruthless governor, which most historians agree that's what the real Pilate was. Eric Idle, in my opinion was probably the funniest of all, ""Oh shut up big nose"" ""I want you all to call me Loreta"" ""He's deee he's deee he's deeaffff and mamama mad sir"" had me in tears, also Terry Jones as Brian's overbearing mother was simply outstanding Terry Gilliam's role was one of the smaller ones as he doesn't appear as much but he also does well in the roles he plays. so all in all the acting was perfect for this type of movie. Now onto the elephant in the room, does this movie lampoon Christ or insult religion, well no it doesn't as Kenneth Colley plays the small role of Jesus Christ straight and respectfully so it doesn't mock him and Brian isn't a metaphor or representation of him as its established early on that they're two different people. If anything it lampoons the time period that the movie was set and the one historical figure who is directly lampooned was Pontius Pilate. The movie ends on an upbeat note which is appropriate for a comedy like this, all in all you have funny jokes, witty and memorable dialogue and an ending which will leave you feeling glad you watched it. 10/10"

"Ajtlawyer","Null","5","15","2 October 2004"," stick to the TV shows
","I have always been a great fan of Monty Python which is without a doubt the greatest TV comedy troupe of all time. But I have never thought that their style of humor was ever enough to carry a feature-length movie and watching the re-release of ""Life of Brian"" only confirms that for me. <br/><br/>Monty Python's Flying Circus worked best in the short, often hysterically funny, skit form. The TV episodes would often have a very general theme but usually careened from one topic to another without necessarily any connection. But on the big screen they have to do an entire story either about King Arthur or about Brian of Nazareth and I don't think that they ever really sustain the humor in either show. Certainly there are some inspired parts---the Roman centurions desperately trying not to laugh at a lisping Pontius Pilate. Only they then overkill that joke by having Pilate then speak to a crowd of Jews later in the movie. It was funny the first time, not funny the second time. The bits dealing with the all-talk, no-action People's Front of Judea were good as well. But the rest of the movie doesn't really work for me, or I should say they certainly don't measure up to the best parts of the TV series. <br/><br/>I was finally able to spot George Harrison's cameo in the movie. George considered the Pythons to be the spiritual heirs of the Beatles and Python Eric Idle later helped make a very funny mockumentary of the Beatles called ""The Rutles"" which George also participated in. What would been terrific to see would've been some sort of joint effort between Monty Python and the Beatles (as it was, Ringo was the only Beatle to have a brief appearance on a Python episode). <br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" gets credit for being the first and only movie to satirize Christianity and I think Christians who are offended take it way too seriously. But if you want to watch truly great film satires, watch the Marx Brothers' terrific ""Duck Soup"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"". Both are extremely funny and relevant."

Heck, this is a spoof of a biblical film with a spaceship that pops in for about 30 seconds, a stoning scene that just keeps getting funnier and funnier, and a joke about male genitalia that somehow holds up 40 something years later.

Perhaps the only bit which doesn't quite work is the appearance of the spaceship but it is sufficiently off-the-wall to be acceptable.<br/><br/>Look out for a lovely bit by Spike Milligan, a true class act.

","This is HORRIFIC movie. It's horrific for the worst reason..it's a python movie and it's not funny! This goes to show you that when Monty Python tries to go bigger and more serious, they fail. One thing that also brings it down is the fact that so many religious people are ranting about how it's ""an affront to God"" or ""It's sacrilege and ""Monty Python is an agent from Satan"" etc. I didn't see any of that in the movie. The Sermon on the Mount scene or the line ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!"" may be a little touchy to some people but that's it. The rest of the movie is not funny at all. The ""we're supposed to haggle!"" scene is funny and the ""Always look on the Bright Side of Life"" music number is great but that's it.

Like I say in the title this is the best Python by far, even over the holy grail and that also had me in stitches. The best scene is when Brian looks out of his window and sees this big crowd waiting for him because they think he is the Masiah even though he keeps saying he isn't. If there was a DVD boxset with the title best of British films this will definitely be in the collection hands down."
"Lloyd-23","10","2","5","11 October 1999"," An unusual double: profound and hilarious.
","The Python team succeeds in doing something which very few people can do. What's more, it makes it look easy.  One moment they are making a very clever joke, which takes a lot of understanding, which makes many references to culture and history, and which makes a very good point, and the next joke in the script is ""Shut up, Big Nose!""  All the way through, this pattern is repeated, and all the way through, both kinds of joke are very funny.<br/><br/>The pace never lets up, and it moves from one excellent sequence to another, each one advancing the plot (with the probable exception of the bit with the space ship).  Along the way, one sees several classic moments which have since been much copied.  Where were they first?  In this film.  ""What have the Romans ever given us?"", ""Splitter!"", ""Alms for an ex-leper!"" - if you don't see this film, then you will be missing out on some important popular culture.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, and each of the Python team plays several roles, sometimes even having to do reaction shots to shots of themselves playing other parts.  This sort of ensemble casting is sadly rare in films, being a sort of theatrical ploy, and yet in this film it feels entirely natural.<br/><br/>The film looks very good.  In fact, it is probably the most visually convincing depiction of life in a biblical city I have seen.  The Python team is made up of educated men, and these went to some effort to see that the costumes and sets, and atmosphere were up to scratch.  This re-enforces the comedy, and greatly re-enforces the profound elements of the film.<br/><br/>There is a central message to this film, summed up in Brian's hilarious and desperate speech to the multitude which has gathered (""'Popped by'? Swarmed by, more like!"") outside his window.  It is that people should not follow religions like blind sheep, but should think for themselves.  Few more worthwhile and sound messages could be preached by anyone.  Don't take my word for it, though, decide for yourself.<br/><br/>Along the way, many other points are made, each highlighting the petty-mindedness of humans.  This film comes highly recommended for viewing by the young.  It could be a good influence on them, I hope, and can make them only more reasonable and tolerant adults, assuming that they don't die young of an excess of laughing.<br/><br/>There are only two films which always leave me wanting to see them again immediately: Gregory's Girl, and Life of Brian.  As soon as the end credits roll, I have the strong urge to rewind the tape and see it all again.<br/><br/>""And there shall be a Man... and he shall lose his hammer, and think that's very odd, because he could remember exactly where he put it only the night before... about eight o'clock.""

Brian himself is a reluctant Messiah, but people get pretty confused when he is born one manger down from Jesus.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when people listen to the sermon on the mount and most are too far away to hear clearly, so they keep arguing about just what Jesus actually said. ""Did he say, blessed are the cheesemakers?"".""Well, he must have been speaking metaphorically, to include the producers of other dairy products as well""<br/><br/>If you can handle some very irreverent jokes about Christianity and Judaism, you'll love this flick from the Monty Python troupe."

","Much of the Bible does not make sense, is contradicting, and a number of things; taken into consideration that the Bible was compiled from scraps many ages after Jesus died, I can see why. ""A shoe!"" need I say more? Just goes to show how desperate that we were to believe in something, or foolish enough to believe anything. ""-Are you a virgin... is it too personal? -How much more personal could you get?! -She is."" ""Virgin Mother"" is a major oxymoron and contradiction. While I saw the elements that completely represent organized religion, I was also horrified and disgusted by it; that we have followed nonsense and been blind and ignorant for so long really irks me. I am gay, so I am very touchy about religion, as it is often discriminating. For that reason, viewing this movie made me hit the ceiling. It is difficult to describe what I've felt from it.

There's no point in hammering something when its source material is poor to begin with.  The execution is even worse.<br/><br/>Brain is the weakest in the Python trilogy (Holy Grail, this, Meaning of Life) because of their handling of the topic.  It is embarrassingly clunky; Mel Brooks tried a similar method when he made History of the World: Part I. The humor isn't as clever and is more disconnected than the plot of Swept Away.

","While I enjoy many of Monty Python's skits and love the Holy Grail, this film just didn't do it for me. There wasn't any non-stop laughter or extremely engaging or entertaining material. Their usual witty yet ridiculous arguments with genius thought processes were just not there. They had a lot of fun with speech impediments and nose jokes but they were really overdone and it grew tiresome after a while. They did a good job of not being too blasphemous or offensive (which surprised me given the subject matter) and focused most of their ridicule at large groups of people with terrible communication acting like lemmings while none of them have any idea of what is going on. It just wasn't very clever or intelligent as their other humor. The alien scene (which was completely unexpected) really brought the overall film and appearance down which had been good till that point with the impressive rugged ancient filming locations and sets. I thought the stoning scene was the best, with other good ones like the grammar Roman (like a grammar Nazi), price haggling, and the excellent argument against transgenders and their struggle against coping with reality. It wasn't bad but it was nothing to gloat over, not nearly Monty Python's best work, and nothing worthy of the top 250 list."

After he escapes capture, 100s of people mistake him for the messiah and begin to follow him around, making life a living hell. I've heard many people praise this as the funniest Monty Python film, and though I disagree, this movie is still classic Monty Python funny.<br/><br/>This and The Holy Grail are the two Monty Python movies that actually tell a story. I don't find this as funny as The Holy Grail because the style is different. The Holy Grail had rude humour, but it didn't feature the same amount of f-words, or the unnecessary full frontal male nudity. Of course, like any Monty Python film, there are scenes that are so absurd you can't help but laugh. It was only near the end of the movie that I started to laugh out loud.

Think of a group of self- congratulating nerds at college who decide to act out one of their own unfunny jokes and drag this boring skit on for over two hours. That's what you've got with this movie--a skit that might have been funny at the Oxford drama club spun out with dire acting and vulgarity. And when I use the term vulgar, I don't use it lightly. I write erotic gay novels, so I've never been accused of being a prude, but the Monty Python cast arguing about nose-picking over the Sermon on the Mount was so pathetically schoolboyish that I cringe in embarrassment for them.

However, with only a few exceptions, after that point the film fell flat to me. The film became too caught in the plot itself, which is usually a bad idea for comedies and lacked gags, which is something I never expected to say of Monty Python.<br/><br/>The film was not offensive in the manner that some religious people have stated.

The movie itself does not make fun of christians or Jesus but rather things in the time like stonings, lepers, and the Romans.

"GTeixeira","10","2","6","28 July 2013"," The greatest comedy ever
","Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's.<br/><br/>This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles.<br/><br/>As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. <br/><br/>In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point.<br/><br/>Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable.<br/><br/>Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion.

","Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian.<br/><br/>Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah."

","There's a scene in this send up of Biblical movies and stories that always gets a chuckle out of me. At the end, there are a dozen or so men strung up there and left to die on crosses. Brian, the protagonist, is one of them. He's done nothing to deserve it. His friends and rescuers have failed him. But his crucified neighbor sums up the most apt attitude by cheerfully advising Brian not to be so glum about it all. He begins to sing and whistle a song, ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,"" that contains incongruous lyrics that are too vulgar to reproduce here. Not only, ""Always look on the bright side of Death/ Just before you draw your terminal breath,"" but ""Life's a piece of s***/ When you look at it...."" Monty Python seem to me to have been entirely serious, amid the gaggle of gags, in skewering all of our intense dispositions to follow one or another social or religious movement. As far as I know they were only explicit about it in the penultimate scene of ""The Meaning of Life,"" which wound up with an actor in drag advising us to try to be nice to one another. I think it was meant seriously.<br/><br/>But then there is often a momentous covert message behind some of the jokes. I'll give one example.<br/><br/>Brian, having been mistaken for a prophet in the Holy Land, runs down the streets followed by a gang of ardent worshippers and he accidentally loses his shoe and leaves it behind rather than be caught. The followers stop and gape at the shoe. One holds the shoe in the air and cries that Brian wants all of us to wear only one shoe. Another argues that it's not the shoe that's the sign, it's Brian's gourd that he left behind. An dispute ensues over whether it should be the shoe or the gourd. A joke, because the conflict lacks instrumental meaning -- except when you think of Sunni vs. Shi'ite in the Middle East, or Catholic vs. Protestant in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes are sillier than others, recalling Mel Brooks. Pilate has speech defect. His ""r"" comes out as ""w"", and the crowd keeps tricking him into calling out names with lots of ""r""s in them, which convulses them with laughter. ""Woger the Wobber!"" he cries, and the crowd hoots and doubles over. His friend, Biggus Dickus, speaks with a lisp and is drawn into lengthy pronouncements containing ""s"". Well, I DID mention Mel Brooks.<br/><br/>It helps, though, if you're in the right mood for this nihilistic nonsense. Anything can happen. Anything goes. A man may jump from a tower and land in a space ship that happens to be speeding by. When the Roman guards find a rebel painting ""Romans Go Home"" (in Latin) on a wall, they don't arrest him. They correct his grammar and make him copy it one hundred times on the wall. (The Centurion, John Cleese, had attended prep school and Cambridge and had taught Latin.) I don't know how well that will go over with kids who never heard of using correct grammar, let alone in Latin, a notoriously synthetic language in which each word contains many morphemes. I swear there must be an agglutinative language somewhere in which you can say something like, ""I'd rather watch television tonight than hang out at the Sonicburger"" -- and it all comes out as one word.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're in a mood to have your head taken and shaken back and forth a little, ""The Life of Brian"" might get the job done."

","Starring: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam<br/><br/>Running time: 94 minutes<br/><br/>Year: 1979<br/><br/>Directed by: Terry Jones<br/><br/>Written by: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones & Michael Palin<br/><br/>I, personally, am not a huge fan of Monty Python. I thought The Holy Grail was overrated and I didn't really understand what was so funny. I have to say this second instalment is a lot funnier, well in my eyes anyway.<br/><br/>Brian (Chapman) is born on Christmas Day, the same day Jesus Christ was actually born, not just on Christmas Day. He is nearly mistaken for the Messiah by the Three Wise Men who visit him on the day of his birth, soon realising their mistake they leave and take their gifts with them and deliver them to the actual Messiah, Jesus Christ, who has been born next door.<br/><br/>Thirty years later and Brian has grown up to be just a normal man whilst Jesus is everyone's saviour. During this time hatred for the Roman Empire is building and Brian is recruited to help take them down. When he is caught and then escapes custody, he is mistaken for the Messiah once again and must prove he is not the man they believe he is.<br/><br/>I had trouble explaining the concept as it certainly isn't overly clear throughout the film but that is not really what the Python films are about. This one does have a better story then Holy Grail but that is not what drives this film on, or any of the Pythons for that matter. It is the pure stupidity and humour that goes on throughout. The humour in the film quite often requires a laugh out loud moment, compared to some comedy films that just get a forced grin. Look out for a hilarious scene involving the name Biggus Dickus. So stupid, silly and immature I know but it had me laughing my head off and that's what I mean by these films, they are so stupid and unbelievable you have to just take them with a pinch of salt and for the stupid parody that they are.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are great. Each actor taking on several roles, with forty roles spread between six actors, each delivering the individual role with perfection and the right amount of humour. Cleese and Gilliam are definite stand outs. <br/><br/>The script is excellent, especially the dialogue as let's be honest the film carries no story and no real emotional attachment. It is purely just here to be laughed at and trust me there are several scenes where you will be doing just that. <br/><br/>The film is utterly daft and really won't be everyone's cup of tea. The first film certainly wasn't mine but I do believe this one was much better. Many people believe the Pythons are some of the best comedy films ever made, I on the other hand do not. The comedy is funny, not constant but when it comes it comes thick and fast, but I like to engage into a half decent story as well as being made to laugh. I have never understood why these films are rated so highly as they do not have a patch on other parody films bought out. All parodies are stupid but these sometimes take the bit too far. Not far enough however to be banned for blaspheming, which is an absolute joke. The film does not make fun of the story of Christ but of a man born at the very same time and attempting to live during this period and undergoing the same nasty routines that Jesus went through to tell people his beliefs. It is not an outright parody of the man himself.<br/><br/>I don't want to get too involved into why people banned this film as I am one who is not a huge fan of the film but one who can watch it once to see what the fuss is all about and then perhaps shelve it to not bother with it again. It is a funny film and did have me laughing and there for I do rate it as an average film but to me it is not the classic comedic masterpiece people worship and praise. Sorry avid fans of the Python series but it hasn't managed to entice me in."

","I just sat down and watched Life of Brian again. It would have been maybe 15 years since I last saw it. It inspired me to write a review.<br/><br/>This is what comedy is meant to be. Now, this is British comedy, so to be fair, an American audience may not appreciate the style of humour as much. <br/><br/>The movie is broken up into short vignettes, yet maintains a fantastic sense of continuity.<br/><br/>It is one of those rare movies that gets better every time you watch it.

","Perhaps to really appreciate this film you have to have a knowledge of history; it is not just sophomoric humor, it is humor based in the historical milieu of the time.<br/><br/>Judea was, as always happens in the Middle East (it must be something in the water), fighting both outside invaders and inside itself, between Jewish factions. The ""Judean People's Front"", ""The People's Front of Judea"" and all the rest were real,though not in actual name. <br/><br/>One truth of history is that a foreign power is able to conquer new territory by exploiting the infighting that is often there. Romans didn't have to resort to the tactics of the present day CIA and infiltrate factions to incite civil war; the nations in those days were already doing that. Hence the reference in the scene, ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"", ""Well, they brought peace, no one else could have with this lot!""<br/><br/>It is a paradox that the Romans, through conquering, brought peace. That was the great power of the Roman Empire. They were in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" made me appreciate Jesus. This film world was probably more on the mark than we think. After all, who really did say that Jesus did all the miraculous things others said? His later followers.<br/><br/>I believe Jesus was a human being who did change the world with his message of peace and love; the fact that he was a man makes it all the more miraculous. After all, Gods can do that miracle stuff; it's their job. But this lone man, Jesus, brought the message of love and peace to the world; what we do with that message is up to us. <br/><br/>Christianity used to be based on the concept of ""following Jesus"", living according to his teachings. Today, the Christian concept seems to be standing in front of Jesus with your hand out saying, ""Hey, Dude, I believe in all that stuff, whatever you said; now give me salvation."" It is the Idiot's Guide to Salvation.<br/><br/>This movie is about the beginning of such hypocrisy; the factions with their shoes and gourds and condemnation of each other. Jesus did his thing; they made it what it is today, and poor Brian was caught in the middle.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film. I agree that to appreciate it fully, one has to know that it is based in truth. All great humor has a serious foundation. To view ""Life of Brian"" only as a comedy makes it seem perhaps shallow. It is not."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","2","6","24 April 2010"," Utterly hilarious from start to finish!
","Life of Brian may have caused controversy on release, but this has always been my personal favourite of the Monty Python movies. Why? Because it is hilarious! True, the story isn't the best component of the film, but everything else works wonders. It is essentially an irreverent and inspired send up of religious epics, and is helped brilliantly by gags and a script that is so joyfully juvenile, if extremely rude, and quotable. Quotes such as ""He's not the Messiah. He is a very naughty boy"" and ""Welease Wodewick"" had me literally peeing my pants. The sets are realistic and all of the Pythons who here take several pot shots at their favourite targets, especially Terry Jones, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin are on top form. Overall, irreverent and hilarious, a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I'm sure they would be on top of great skits around profiling. <br/><br/>I replay the Pontius Pilot scene and find tears rolling down my face I am laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Take the plunge, lighten up and enjoy connections to whatever religious dogma you have been subjected to."

","I love 'The Life of Brian'! Probably the most coherent of all the Python films, the film centres upon the unfortunate Brian, born in the stable next door to Jesus, who is burdened with a ridiculous mother (""he's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!""), an large nose and a crowd of people who believe is the Messiah. One of my favourite films of all time because it contains side splitting scenes such as the Pontius Pilot scene in which Pilot discusses his friend Bigus Diccus and his wife Incontinentia Buttocks. This humour is not sophisticated, but schoolboy humour is exactly what's expected of Monty Python isn't it? I originally saw it because I heard it had been controversial with the Christian right, this is the same reason I watched Jerry Springer the opera and read the Da Vinci code, and I can easily see why. Some of the scenes could cause offence but they aren't meant to and they are extremely funny. This film is absolutely unmissable and you'll find yourself quoting it all the time, so... are you the Judean people's front? F**k off! We're the people's front of Judea!

Every little moment and detail in this movie, from the beginning with Brians mother questioning the three wise mens wisdom to the closing song ""always look at the bright side of life"".<br/><br/>It's not just the jokes that is perfectly planned, the story really invites to more jokes, more funny scenes, more quick jokes, more catchphrases. And the actors make a great job. The entire team that is credited on this movie is all great comedians.

No. I strongly support them"

","A loser called Brian is born on the same night as Jesus of Nazareth. He lives a parallel life with Jesus of Nazareth. He joins 'People's Front of Judea', a Jewish revolutionary party, against Romans and is confused as a messiah by the Jews and so is finally crucified. It seems 'Life of Brian' was banned in many countries like Netherlands etc. It's a very well made film and all the actors have done a wonderful job. Six actors have played 40 characters all together. Monty Python did not have enough money to release it so George Harrison released it because he didn't want to miss out on a Monty Python film. That's what I call art and that's whom I call an artist. He has done a cameo in the film though I could never identify him. Keith moon was supposed to play a small role too but he died just before that.<br/><br/>It's a very responsible cinema. I don't think it's a tight script or great film but just an entertainer with great message. It's so weird that behind all the buffoonery and laughter-riots there actually is a highly intelligent, politically correct cinema. Read all the books on Jesus and John the Baptist and Caesar and you can confuse yourself with 'truth' of Christianity. Watch this movie and you realize it was just the faith of a common man and political equations which created a cult which by accident became history and now can be summed up as Jesus of Nazareth. There are people standing in the middle of the market and talking incoherently and people are trying to make some sense out of it. It's not too difficult to identify these buffoons if you have attended religious meetings. It's sad that people need a messiah to tell them a simple truth 'Love your neighbors' and still they don't. This movie exposes the double standards of the religious people who think being religious is sufficient enough stone people to death.<br/><br/>Life of Brian is a daring film. I really wonder how only Christians can stand a clear cut spoof on their religion. Muslims cant even show Prophet in a serious film (refrence to 'The Message') forget about a character like 'Brian'. Of course there's no point in saying anything about Jews as far as religion is concerned and Hindus have become fanatics after the whole 'Babri Masjid' drama. <br/><br/>I really don't consider it a comedy film. It's a serious movie about the confused history of Christianity. It makes fun of us who killed innumerous people who unintentionally called the name of the god (Jehovah). It makes fun of the society where women were not eligible to cast a stone on culprits but they could be stoned to death by men. No wonder this film was banned after all it's difficult to take the responsibility of killing millions of people in the name of 'Jehova'. I think it deserves a 10 not because of art called comedy or movie making but because of human emotion called 'confidence' and attitude called kick-ass."

"TheNorthernMonkee","10","2","6","18 July 2005"," THE Python movie! Still as relevant today as in 1979
","SPOILERS Once upon a time, six amazing friends teamed up together to write one of the finest British comedies of all time. They would collectively be known as 'Monty python' and the series was ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". Shown from 1969 to 1974, the series featured some of the funniest comedy ever created in this country.<br/><br/>Five years after they finished their series, the Pythons managed to cause widespread outrage and criticism with their third film. Set during the time of Jesus Christ, this witty and satirical piece of humour was considered by many to be blasphemy. Over twenty years later and it's still a miracle really that the film was ever released. Occasionally poking fun at Christianity whilst never pushing over the boundary, it's not surprising some found it so 'evil'. Still, extremist religious types aside, it's not difficult to see why this film is so well loved. Better organised than other Python works (which occasionally feel like sketch shows, irrelevant of how funny they are), this is THE Python movie. Hilarious, easy to watch and with the ultimate film soundtrack, this film is a masterpiece in every definition of the word and should be embraced with all your heart.<br/><br/>Born on the same night as Jesus Christ, Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman) lives a simple life selling food at the Colloseum and looking after his mum Mandy (fellow Python and film director Terry Jones). One day at work, Brian encounters the mysterious and slightly useless, Peoples Front of Judea. Hating the Romans only slightly less than the Judean Peoples Front and the Popular People's Front (""he's over there""), they enlist Brian into their ranks and it isn't long before Brian finds love, followers and that the Romans want him dead.<br/><br/>With characters like Brian (Chapman) himself, Biggus Dickus (Chapman again), the Ex-Leper (Michael Palin) or Loretta (Eric Idle), it's difficult not to love ""Life of Brian"". Running in direct correlation to the life of Jesus (we only see him twice, once at birth and once on the Mount), we constantly are shown characters who have met the Son of God (apologies to those brought up in alternative religions for this opinion) or are looking for their chosen religious prophet. Throughout though whether the jokes are religious or not, they are often funny and normally a superb satire of ancient and modern life.<br/><br/>'Brian' also contains one of the finest film tracks of all time. ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" written and performed by Eric Idle is brilliant. Sang from the top of a crucifix (don't forget Idle plays many characters so let's not state who's up there), the song is the perfect conclusion to the film and a wonderful final laugh to leave the audience happy.<br/><br/>On one final note, on the topic of music, ""Life of Brian"" also contains one of the daftest, shortest cameos of all time. At one point Brian is being confronted by his followers and as he deals with them he is briefly introduced to Mr Papadopolous. Speaking his line ""hello"" with a strong Liverpudlian accent, Papadopolous is played by none other than George Harrison. A key financial backer, Harrison was given the chance to briefly appear in this piece of genius and his short cameo can only improve what is by all standards, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" understandably got a lot of condemnation when it was released. At times seeming to poke fun at religion, it was shown to mass protests and with Church condemnation. Aside from this criticism though, the film should be judged as a piece of comedy, and for that it is genius. Hilarious and engaging, it is a brilliant piece of social satire with some memorable characters and some stunning scenes. It is practically flawless and should be viewed as often as possible."
"wozzasfc","8","2","6","8 June 2005"," Life Of BRIAN
","Firstly, I can not believe they tried to ban this due to blasphemy. Anyone with a shred of intelligence will realise, it is not a story mocking Jesus or religion, but is just a comedy set around the Jesus era based on a man who is mistaken as a Messiah. Very early in the film this is established as Brian is part of a crowd actually listening to Jesus giving a speech to the people.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the over-the-top comedy of this masterpiece, then you will undoubtedly enjoy Monty Python and the Holy Grail. With the Python boys from the series cast in many different roles, the cast is not the largest, but one of the funniest you will ever see. You soon forget you have just seen John Cleese playing the part of a rebel leader before he is cast to play a roman soldier on the lookout for the rebel leader and his gang. This shows the high level of acting involved.<br/><br/>The comedy is still as fresh in 2005 as it was when it was made, and a must-see for any fan of John Cleese, Eric Idle and comedy in general."

"Ferdinand_the_Barbarian","10","2","6","1 September 2004"," Blasphemous? I think not.
","Life of Brian is, undoubtedly, the best religious satire I have ever laid eyes on. It's authentic, has good acting, and is biting in its commentary. It rivals some of the great parody work of Mel Brooks for the greatest comedy of all time (Young Frankenstein may trump Life of Brian). And this comes from somebody who is a Christian, and holds to a very strict interpretation of the Bible. Maybe, though, that's why it's so funny.<br/><br/>The Python crew themselves made it quite clear that they couldn't even attempt to make fun of Jesus, nor could they mock his message. Rather, they'd mock those people who misunderstood the message and killed each other for 2000 years because of it. What better way to do so than to make a movie following the life of somebody who's mistaken for Christ, rather than following Jesus himself.<br/><br/>This movie is probably the best example of the acting talents of the Python members. While John Cleese and Eric Idle continue to light up the screen in newer movies (most recently, Cleese in Shrek 2, as well as Eric Idle narrating Ella Enchanted), you'll not find a better performance from Graham Chapman, nor the rest of the Pythons.<br/><br/>One potential drawback to the movie is in its lack of laugh-out-loud comedy.<br/><br/>However, the smart viewer will see beyond this and recognize a work of comic genius. Some of the most unforgettable lines ever are held in this comic jewel: ""Blessed are the cheesemakers"" is just one among many.<br/><br/>Also of note is the generally un-Ptyhonesque ending to the movie. True, it's anticlimactic, in a sense, but it's a far better ending than that of The Holy Grail. Ahh, but if you haven't seen the movie, I'd better not give away the ending.<br/><br/>Dear reader, before you go, remember, this movie is to be watched more than once. While certain scenes are unforgettably funny the first time around (I want to be called...Loretta), there are things you'll undoubtedly miss.<br/><br/>Now, I send thee forth to bask in the radiance of Python."

Also, the performances are outstanding.

It's a pity that this film still courts controversy, it's message is a valid one and not executed in a cruel or unfair manner. And bear in mind, it's still funny in it's ridiculousness.

Life of Brian on the other hand is extremely watchable and quite funny for the Monty Python crew where the humour still isn't the sharpest but it doesn't need to be. My favourite part has to be when Brian is being took away by the Roman soldiers and Judith starts to smack the back of John Cleese's Roman centurion character and her final smack knocks his helmet crooked and he turns round and says ""stop it"" but it was the way he said it which had be laughing my head off! Just little things like that which makes this the best Python movie. Graham Chapman as Brian is great as he plays his charachter in a similar way as he did Arthur in Holy Grail (being funny by being serious), shame he died a while back as he is one of my favourite Pythons. Has to be admired for its originality and i think Life Of Brian is for anyone and yeah the song at the end 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' is a nice way from stopping the movie having a tragic end which would have been a terrible thing for a comedy spoof flick but the song is annoying so why they released it into the British pop charts in the early 90's is beyond me even though Eric Idle's performance on Top Of The Pops was funny.

","This film certainlyhas the best narrative quality of any of the Python films and the writing, as always, is brilliant.  It is a very funny film in a dark satiric way.  All the Pythons, except for Terry Gilliam are very educated men (Oxford and Cambridge) and it shows in their writing. No one has mentioned and I think that it could be the case, that some of the satiric swipes in this film are directed at fans of Python themselves. Think about it, how people who like Python insist on repeating quotes and recite or sing along with Python.  The scene where Briantells the crowd to be individuals and the crowd repeats back in unison may be directed at their own fans urging them to get a life."

"CIDMoosa","8","1","2","7 June 2018"," Classic British Comedy !
","Coming from the Monty Python group, Life of Brian is classic British comedy at its best - perhaps one of the most intellectual comedies made. Downright sardonic and profane in its making, Life of Brian is all about Brian who is born on Christmas day in a stable next to Jesus and spends his life being mistaken for a messiah. Brian's life is sketched parallel to that of Jesus, cleverly letting the filmmakers lampoon everything from religious zealotry, mob hysteria, sword/sandal epic movies and some hard hitting political travesty. All the gags and sequences could appear a bit juvenile to those not familiar with the Monty python style of comedy , but the movie is indeed a laugh riot and the makers live up to their earlier hit Monty Python and the Holy Grail with downright clever satirical wit and commentary on totalitarianism, history, politics and most importantly religion. Some scenes to watch out for would be of Brian dropping a gourd and a shoe, his followers absurdly split into two groups, each worshipping a different relic - a hilarious take on the multi sectarian worshipping practices existing today or Brian uttering some gibberish to a crowd out of fear wrapped in some enigma that makes a blind mob follow him as the next prophet. That said and done my favorite part of the movie would be the blatantly original caricature of left-wing resistance groups with their endless subgroups, internal politics, conflicting agendas and vain ideology / speech without any results (ala Sankaradi in Sandesam!). Quite understandably, this flick was banned in many a European country until recent times for the supposedly sacrilegious take on religion (unsurprising with so with many parts parodying nativity, crucifixion et al). However on close watch, it never makes fun of Jesus - but it does thwart the blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion in a quite comical fashion. A controversial piece of comedy - a remainder to the critics that banning movies or cutting movie scenes based on religious pretexts exists in Hollywood / British movies as well as early as 1979, and is not limited to the Asian market of Viswaroopam, Padmavat etc."

"The-Last-Prydonian","10","1","2","21 December 2017"," Who ever thought a flippant humorous remark would lead to a satirical comedy classic?
","It's funny and dare I say serendipitous that the impetus behind Life of Brian stemmed from a throwaway remark made by Eric Idle. After the success of the Python's last movie which at the time was Monty Python and the Holy Grail, he had been asked what their next feature would be with which he flippantly responded with Jesus Christ - Lust for Glory. Who would have thought that such an offhand quip would eventually lead to their most celebrated and critically praised works being brought to the cinema theaters. At least those which were brave enough to screen it given the immediate controversy that was to follow. Shrewdly however they chose not to actually focus on lampooning Jesus himself, as they felt there was nothing funny about his life and subsequent death. Any attempts at humour at his expense would have seemed shallow and taking mere potshots. However they set their sights on organized religion which the team had a combined mistrust of. There may not have been anything satirical about the Messiah but his followers, that was another matter.<br/><br/>It's no exaggeration that the film is nothing short of a work of genius with it's astute observations of the possible fanaticism, herd mentality and it's abuse for political advantage is adeptly shrouded with their trademark off the wall humour. Satire has arguably never been so much fun. Forgoing having Jesus himself as the film's lead protagonist and replacing himself with an everyday young Jewish man, who due to a series of absurd events finds himself mistaken for being the true ""Messiah"". In a superb post-opening credits sequence we even see Brian's shrill battleaxe of a mother having already given birth to her son, being mistakenly visited by the Three Wise Men as the stable they're inhabiting is right next to the one Jesus was born in. It's a sublime comedic twist on the Christian tale that implies that Brian is always fated to be mistaken for the genuine article.<br/><br/>What follows is a what could be referred to as a series of set pieces that could even be described as individual sketches wrapped around it's simple but engaging narrative. It's arguably why; The Meaning of Life which came four years later was less of a success critically and commercially as it opted for the similar sketch format of the Monty Python TV series, making it less accessible to the general public. Only dedicated fans would have likely appreciated the more traditional format. But narrative and it's surreal comedy aside, what marks it out in it's brilliance is how universal it's themes still are to this very day. Taking sharp digs at revolutionary groups and British left wing politics the movies PFJ (People's Front of Judea) closely resembling trade unions and the ironic and ridiculous rivalry that has existed between rebel factions. It could possibly also be seen as a veiled lampooning of sectarian bigotry and narcissism which not only exists in Christianity but Islam as well. None more so is this typified in a inspired moment where a select number of the PFJ set out to kidnap Pontious Pilates wife, only to cross paths with rivals from the Campaign for a Free Galilee which results in them foolishly fighting among themselves.<br/><br/>On a more personal level in terms of our antipathetic hero there is an air of poignancy to his predicament that adds a layer of melancholy, as despite some genuine idealism on his part (compacted by the shock revelation on discovering his father was Roman) is that what primarily leads him to join in on the rebellion is his love for Judith, a young member of the PFJ who's enthusiasm and passion outweighs even Brian's. The sympathy we feel for him and his desire for her are equally palpable as we know that when all is said and done, is that what he'd want is just a quiet life with her.<br/><br/>To top off what makes the film such a unforgettable classic is the reliably brilliant and versatile multiple performances of it's main actors. Replicating what made part of the format of Holy Grail uniquely inspired, they each play to their own individual strengths as they portray a host of eccentric characters, many of whom lead to Brian being habitually exasperated. The supporting cast which includes obscure Welsh actress Sue-Jones Davies as Judith, and features brief appearances by Python regular Carol Cleaveland and veteran TV actress Gwen Taylor are also uniformly excellent. And look out for a blink and you'll miss it cameo from British comedy legend Spike Milligan as an elderly prophet.<br/><br/>To summarize Life of Brian, it's not only admirable for it's creative cleverness and insightful wisdom but given it's modest budget of $4 million (the backing of which came from former Beetle, George Harrison who went on to establish his own production company; Handmade Films) it's a testament to what can be achieved on minimal funding. The fact that it has been awarded the status of being the ""greatest comedy of all time"" by The BFI, (British Film Institute) and declared it to be the 28th best British film of all time which really is quite something. It's influence is unmistakable and it's overall message timeless and will never be forgotten."
"sol-","Null","1","2","18 November 2017"," Brian's Song
","Mistaken for the messiah, a hapless a young man from Nazareth tries to avoid crucifixion in this controversial comedy that was banned in several countries upon initial release due to its religious irreverence. Written by the six members of the Monty Python troupe (who collectively play forty roles), the humour is hit-and-miss as per the troupe's norm. There is nothing especially funny about Terry Jones in drag, the lisping of Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate goes on for far too long and other parts are simply silly (mentally handicapped jailer). The jokes that do work are admittedly excellent though. A lesson on how to haggle is a particular highlight, same goes for a stoning scene in which all participants are actually women in disguise, plus the politics of the various rebel factions in Judea are great. The second half of the movie also works better than the buildup to it as the title character finds himself unable to rid himself of followers mistaking him for their saviour and no matter what he says, he cannot get them to change their view. The film is also topped off with the most memorable ending of all four Monty Python movies with its celebration of optimism in the face of adversity."

","Brian is an ordinary Judean who just happened to be born at the same time as Christ (leading to some confusion among the wise men). He grows up with a dislike of the Roman occupiers and falls in with a terrorist group known as the Judean People's Front. It isn't long before this gets him into trouble with the Romans and they plan to crucify him. He manages to escape, with the help of a passing spaceship, but soon has other problems. After posing as a street side preacher he picks up a group of followers who believe that he is the Messiah!<br/><br/>These days it is hard to see why this film was considered controversial; it is clear from the opening scene that Brian is not Jesus under another name. It is however very funny; a series of hilarious and eminently quotable scenes that combine to make a great film. The Monty Python team are on top form, each of them playing a number of roles. Graham Chapman stands out as he plays the eponymous Brian; an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary events. The jokes are all pretty funny but if one doesn't particularly amuse you another will be along shortly. The film feels fresh and relevant today; in fact some of the satire could have easily have been written in the present day as we see rebel groups who hate each other more than their official enemy and people are executed for supposed blasphemy where the accusers won't repeat what was allegedly said as they would be considered blasphemous too. If you are a fan of laugh out loud comedy then this film is a must it is hilarious from start to finish."

","Whenever I say this film revolted me, people look knowingly, or smugly, or even pityingly at me, and say, ah, it offended your religious beliefs, you thought it blasphemy. No, I say, I don't have any religious beliefs and it was something far worse than blasphemous. It was inhuman. For the record, this film is a blatant and obvious con-trick, and was always meant to be that. By making schoolboy jokes about supposed Christianity, and the clichÃ©s of Biblical epic movies, the Monty Python gang could pretend that they were being terribly daring, that they were prepared to risk their reputations by taking on the might of the Church. They did nothing of the sort. The jokes are just stupid, and often very nasty, demeaning to common humanity; they're not in the least satirical or brave or savage. They're also not funny. But, because jokes about religious matters were uncommon in dumb comedies in 1979, the brain-dead idolaters of the team could tell themselves that it was real cutting-edge stuff, and then the Pythons could add to their unmerited lustre by pretending they were somehow ""more than merely funny"". More than funny? Come off it. I smiled momentarily maybe four times, mostly thanks to the uncredited Spike Milligan, who, in a few seconds of screen-time, was better value than the whole of the rest of the cast. The film reeks of contempt for its own fans; you will find this hilarious, it commands us, because we tell you it is, and you will be grateful that we have condescended to entertain you. It is, in fact, vulgar swill which cheapens us all, and its admirers should be ashamed of themselves."

","Except for the funny stoning scene toward the beginning, and the song at the end, everything else in the movie misfires. Yes, the idea is that another man (Brian) is mistaken for the Messiah-but the story's big flaw is that the real Messiah is already present, briefly shown giving a sermon to a crowd. On top of that, there is nothing about Brian that would convince anyone he was the Messiah; he doesn't even pretend to be one. This gives the whole movie a contrived atmosphere.<br/><br/>The other scenes are hardly funny either. The Jews who plot against the Romans ask what the Roman occupiers have done for them, and as the scene goes on, the speaker amasses a list of benefits brought by the Romans. In a way, this glorifies colonialism and fails to explain why natives invariably come to despise their occupiers. There were plenty of reasons for the Jews to hate the Romans, but that is hardly brought up. Also, other jokes such as ""Biggus Dickus"" and Pontius Pilate not being able to say the letter ""R"" are juvenile without being funny.<br/><br/>""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was much better because it was clever; this movie perhaps tried to be meaningful and simply blew it."

Even though they were Brits portraying Jews, I still laughed at things like ""Hey Big Nose!"" And you ""You bloody Romans!""

"Desertman84","10","2","7","25 October 2012"," A Classic Religious Satire Comedy
","Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release.<br/><br/>On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""<br/><br/>The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical."
"gavin6942","7","2","7","22 May 2008"," The Second Best of the Python Films
","Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" tells the story of Brian, a young Jew born in a manger just a few doors down from Jesus. Brian's life runs parallel with Jesus' as he becomes indoctrinated into the anti-Roman People's Front of Judea and is eventually mistaken for a prophet. How will Brian accept his new fame and popularity? <br/><br/>What always confused me about ""Life of Brian"" is the film's alleged mass appeal. Apparently, it is considered the funniest British film of all time, or at least one of them. Yet, Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"" is the one that received deluxe treatment, has a musical developed from it and is most often quoted by other people. Maybe Americans find ""Grail"" funny and Brits like ""Brian"". I don't know. But what I do know is that although I think ""Brian"" is funny, it's not even in my top twenty for comedies.<br/><br/>Graham Chapman shines as Brian Cohen, of course. He was clearly the leader of the Pythons, at least on screen, and rightfully so. He may not have the name John Cleese does or the directing chops Terry Jones or Terry Gilliam do, but he could command a screen. He will be missed.<br/><br/>The film is most funny for those who feel a sense of anti-authority in their blood. You can't take the story of Jesus too seriously or this account will offend you. Imperial nations are a target here, as are blind followers of religion. Even the modern Israel-Lebanon-Palestine conflict comes into play, although in a different form than we know it now.<br/><br/>Not unlike past work, the best jokes come from over-analyzing situations and words. In ""Grail"" we had Dennis explain the anarcho-syndicalist commune. Here, we get an extensive Latin lesson (Romani Ite Dormum). Great material by anyone's standards.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Holy Grail"" is the better film and even ""Meaning of Life"" probably has more humorous parts. Not that ""Life of Brian"" isn't funny... but I would suggest that only those who enjoyed these other two really give it a try. It's something of an acquired taste, as all British comedy is."

","The daring of it!How cutting edge!Those remarkable Python boys do it again with something to offend everybody!.............Give me a break will ya? Christianity is a soft target.And this movie does lampoon Christianity despite the clever - clever Oxbridge sophistry employed by Cleese and Co. to the contrary.I don't have a problem with that per se,my problem is that the makers lacked the courage to admit it.Surely a group as daring and innovative as the Pythons should have the balls to say ""yes,this is a movie that takes the pxss out of Christianity - and we don't care"". I went to see ""The Life of Brian"" in the West End with a group of middle - aged schoolteachers and social workers all of whom were determined to demonstrate how unoffended they were by guffawing heartily at the drop of a hat.There was no one under 30 in the audience,perhaps an indication that the Pythons' appeal was to a demographic that found their humour familiar from years of being subjected to it from the original sources i.e. The Goon Show,Round the Horne,Marty Feldman and of course the great Spike Milligan who surely must have felt just a little rueful at accepting a small part in the movie that would never have existed had he not more or less single - handedly invented surreal radio thirty years earlier. Yes it is a funny movie,and I did laugh a lot,but daring and original it most certainly isn't.""Carry on Cleo"" was funnier without the pretension and the faux daring. It is probably becoming clear that I am not a particular admirer of Pythonesque (the very word sends a shudder up my spine) humour. To me the whole group seem like smug,sniggering,cocky overgrown schoolboys who have been told how clever they are for so long that they have - for years -believed in their own publicity.Occasionally,one - like Michael Palin - will make a genuine effort to do something completely different(to coin a phrase) but even he cannot resist referring to his time with The Organisation on a regular basis. Terry Gilliam,perhaps the most talented of them all,broke free to make ""The Twelve Monkeys"",one of the most dazzling of all 1990s movies,a creation of real daring and panache. If the boys really want to be brave and outrageous perhaps they should consider making ""The Life of Mohamed"" but I really don't think they will,do you?"

","I'll put my Monty Python fan resume against anyone. I started watching ""Flying Circus"" in the '70s when it first aired in the US on PBS. I've seen all of their movies and concert videos. I have all of their albums. I've read most of their books. I've seen John Cleese live. Being a fan doesn't mean that you are blind. There was a reason that they had a hard time finding investors for this movie. It's not funny. There are maybe six laughs in the whole movie. Most of it is annoyingly unfunny."

Idk if I would say his film is better or worse but just as good as Holy Grail.

","Monty Python...do I even need to say more?<br/><br/>They were obviously some of the funniest people on the planet-British or otherwise, and this can clearly be expressed in their filmography, which also includes the beloved comedy classic ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Personally, it's somewhat difficult for em to come up with which of their films is the finest and funniest-but I think it just might be ""Life of Brian"".<br/><br/>While the group has always had a satirical edge, ""Life of Brian"" is easily their most satirical work, as it mocks countless things in an extremely creative and entertaining fashion. The film is quite controversial due to it concerning religion, and injecting humor into subjects such as Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but it is more than just a film that mocks only religion. There are jokes throughout that satirize everything from political correctness to science fiction. It's a funny movie, and its targets are seemingly endless.<br/><br/>This is an inventive classic of comedy, filled with memorable and famous moments from start to finish."

","Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979): Dir: Terry Jones / Cast: Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese: Hilarious farce symbolizing the average people. Brian just happens to be born in the stable next to Jesus and gained accidental recognition for a revolution against the Romans. Christians may find this content disturbing however it is difficult not to laugh at the hysterical viewpoint of Monty Python. Brian is thrown into a life of complete misunderstanding until he is hanging on a cross joining others in the singing of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Directed by fellow Python Terry Jones in mock documentary style. Graham Chapman plays off the anguish and confusion of Brian who only wishes to be left alone. Michael Palin plays Pontius Pilate who is mocked with regards to his speech impairment. Eric Idle plays a criminal who relishes the idea of being crucified and even leads the vocals in the famous concluding sing-along. John Cleese leads the revolutionary group that harasses Brian and ultimately lead him into trouble. Jones provides the shrieking demeanor of mother who informs a mob that her son has been ""a very naughty boy!"" Terry Gilliam handles the visual appeal particularly the noted title sequence. Controversial satire of the misinterpretations of the disciples of Jesus but Jesus came to deliver mankind from a fate that even Brian would dread. Score: 9 / 10"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","25 December 2014"," Monty Python's Magnum Opus
","Almost every cinema lover has his/her Christmas favourite that he/she likes to revisit on an annual basis as if it's part of a tradition. Preferred choice for most is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life, for some it's John McTiernan's Die Hard & for few it's Chris Columbus' Home Alone but the one I keep revisiting on this auspicious day is Monty Python's Life of Brian.<br/><br/>One of the funniest, silliest & craziest films of all time, Life of Brian is slapstick & satirical humour at its finest, zaniest & sharpest. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen, a Jewish man born on the same day & next door to Jesus Christ, who spends his life being mistaken for a prophet & becomes a reluctant Messiah after joining an anti-Roman political organization.<br/><br/>Directed by Terry Jones, the film opens with what could very well be the most hysterical opening credit song in cinema history & certainly the one with most common-sense making lyrics. This is Monty Python's best work to date in my opinion, even better than Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and to finish it with an uplifting song that's all about our lives is an instant classic moment.<br/><br/>Hilarious from start to finish, it rarely lets you breathe for it hordes the screen with one crazy moment after another. Some of the things might look little dated or not feel that funny anymore but its satirical take on religious attitudes, and not religion, is what makes it all the more amazing. The cast is awesome, writing is clever & the number of memorable moments are way too many to count.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Monty Python's Life of Brian is another cinematic gold from this classic comedy troupe & is without a doubt one of the greatest comedy films of all time. It has been 35 years since it first surfaced on the film screen & yet it retains all of its potency. An intensely entertaining ride that delivers the laughs in heavy doses from its first moment to the last, Life of Brian is comedy filmmaking at its most insane. Highly recommended."
"Seraphion","7","1","3","4 October 2014"," Very hilarious, very enjoyably entertaining
","The movie opens up very crazily funny. It still retains the signature man dressed as a woman role with the crazy voice from what we see in the Holy Grail from four years earlier. But compared to the Holy Grail, this movie builds its comedic moments far more better with beats which are easier to understand. This is in comparison with the Holy Grail's beats which mostly depend on instant laughter with shorter builds, being more practical even in the dialog part jokes. Life of Brian offers the jokes more intelligently built with enough build up time that makes the laughs even more logical and relate-able. I personally enjoy the stoning scene, the slogan spelling scene, and the mistaken messiah scenes. The acting is not really different from what the Holy Grail presented, just a bunch of crazy old English comedians having their funny way about things."
"braddugg","8","1","3","17 September 2014"," This is religious, political, funny satire.
","Few films are funny, few satirical and few religious and a few more political. This is religious, political, funny satire.<br/><br/>Set in the backdrop of B.C when Jesus Christ was born and the same day when Brian was born. He says same as Jesus Christ said and is even crucified like Jesus Christ. So we have a whole life of a man who is made a Messiah in completely funny way. The best was when the the Roman king says dialogues where ""R"" becomes ""W"". You must listen them and they are utterly hilarious. <br/><br/>It's good because it's whimsical, witty and wonderful. There are lot many subtexts that question faith and even our way of following faith, though not mine, but many others. No wonder, if it was accused or even banned by the Christian communities for it's depiction of religion and customs. But, this a whole hearted and fun filled film that would be enjoyable if we leave out our prejudices and beliefs and see it. There are high chances that you ail like it. <br/><br/>There are many funny things to begin with, Brian's mother is acted by a man, I felt that funny. The quarrel about a nose, the revelation of being Roman and even the organised crucifixion. Ah, those are not those typical laugh out loud moments but sure there is inherent comedy in them. <br/><br/>Technically, this has good production values, good art direction, good costumes, great acting, fine editing and sound design and superb lines. Now, I thank Terry Gilliam for starting Monty Python series and to Terry Jones for directing this film. It's totally stupid and even maniacal and a must watch film.<br/><br/>Watch if you like out and out fun films. No brainer this, but long detailed and funny scenes make this a 4/5 movie for me."
"jose-cruz53","9","1","3","27 October 2012"," One of the greatest comedies ever made!
","This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the ""main"" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode.<br/><br/>This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course)."

Life of Brian is possibly the best comedy film ever made, certainly in the top three.<br/><br/>The classic Monty Python formula of silliness on top with intelligence underneath were never done better. Beyond that it is also a high quality production, which means it has aged better than some of Monty Python's other creations. For example the famous musical number on the cross is absolutely first class from a musical perspective and the scene where a Roman patrol forces an activist to correct the spelling of his graffiti is one of the best jokes in film history.<br/><br/>On a side-note it is deeply ironic that this silly film is actually closer to the Jesus myth (and what little historical evidence there is for it) than so called serious religious films like ""The Passion of the Christ"".<br/><br/>For those too young to have seen this already: don't let it's age scare you away, give it a go, it's still a very, very funny flick."

","Okay, after 250 comments what's left to say. Personally, I took the movie as a send-up of those god-awful biblical costume epics of the 1950's. One's like The Silver Chalice (1954) or David and Bathsheba (1951), et al. You know, the kind that gave you 90 minutes of sex and violence and then 10 minutes of redeeming religiosity spread on with a trowel. That way you could enjoy the fun stuff without guilt, and Hollywood could show it had gotten rid of all those Commie screenwriters of the 1940's.<br/><br/>I don't know how they did it, but this is the most realistic looking Holy Land that I've seen— the parched countryside, the magnificent battlements, the ragged crowds, etc. The budget couldn't have been that big, but the settings are impressive in their realism—not what you'd expect from a send-up like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a funny movie. And if it doesn't exactly end with the voice of God, it does end on a humorously ironic note—all those crucifees hanging there, singing ""Look on the Bright Side of Life"". Beneath the black humor, there may well be real wisdom, and who's to say that this is not, in its own way, a voice from above."

What other film (excluding any other Monty Python creations) can you say is absolutely hilarious and intellectual at the same time? With Terry Jones as a women and Michael Palin as an ex-leper as well as a Roman Emperor with a speech impediment, it was an absolute dead cert hit (not to mention that it was almost banned because of its attitude towards religion, and caused a huge uproar in many countries).

"DavidPumpkins","9","1","3","27 February 2001"," Probably the funniest film of all time
","The Monty Python team's finest hour, ""Life of Brian"" is absolutely hilarious from start to finish.  A wide range of characters are played by the six members of the Monty Python team, the most memorable include Michael Palin's speech-impaired Roman governor, Eric Idle's transvestite wannabe Stan/Loretta and of course Brian himself, played with great aplomb by the late Graham Chapman, who also played the lead role in the equally amusing ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975). Some of the scenes are classic Python, including the ageing gladiator keeling over in the arena (""I think I'm about to go into cardiac arrest!"") and who could possibly forget the finale in which the whole cast break into song, the brilliant 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life', also written by Eric Idle.<br/><br/>If you've got even a vague sense of humour, you'll not stop laughing throughout and will probably still be chuckling long after the film has finished. The best example of Python's cinematic exploits, and the film was made all the more popular after the controversy caused by its religious content upon its release in 1979.  The protesters missed the point entirely, so make sure that you don't : See this film now, you won't regret it."

"Tankard22","4","8","82","8 March 2007"," Upon Reflection
","This was my favorite Monty Python film some years ago. Graham Chapman is the best serious actor in the group and I really liked the sudeo history of ancient Palestine. Like I said, at the time, I found this to be pretty funny and thought that it really wasn't offensive to Christianity.<br/><br/>But since I've taken my religion seriously in the past several years I have begun to see that it is offensive and mocking of Christianity.<br/><br/>""But it's Brian!!!"" I know it's Brian. I do, however the Python boys themselves have stated publicly that their intentions were to parody Jesus and Christianity. They cleverly use the device that we are following Brian and not Jesus and obviously show Jesus seriously delivering a sermon in a quick shot and yet the whole picture is taking shots at Christians and making light of the miracles of Christ.<br/><br/>Sure if you don't believe or have a limited faith you might eat these ""harmless"" parodies up. After all the Jews are spoofed with their stonings and their revolutionaries and the Romans are poked fun at, so what's so bad about showing Brian? Well, Brian may not be the Messiah, but his followers think he is and the whole moral of the story seems to be that these people are just blindly following. Following Brian as they followed or currently follow Jesus.<br/><br/>We see them attributing miracles to Brian as a man falls into a pit, still blind! They are making fun of Christians, they are making fun of me. They are making light of the miracles of Jesus by using Brian as His representation. ""But they showed the real Jesus... This is Brian..."" Right! Sure! The catchy tune and the singing on the cross may be funny to some, me at onetime included, but if you truly believe in the sacrifice of Jesus; this torture is not funny. This movie ceases to become funny when one is looking at it from a point of view of faith.<br/><br/>The Monty Python gang was a talented group of people who liked to go overboard with the naughty bits. But this time they did go too far. Idle admits that the film is heretical and though they cloak their real motives with the invention of Brian the core message is one of disrespect for Christianity and ""Jesus freaks"" like myself."

Let us reflect on ourselves and let God come down from the altar.<br/><br/>God is not himself, but our worship, worship and superstition.<br/><br/>
Perhaps Only Brian himself was conscious, and he felt sorrow, and mourned to all, which gave him some possibility of a loving God.

""Life Of Brian"" is not eligible , because it's not ""American"", yet one of their 'top 5' , ""Dr. Strangelove"" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK.

While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ).<br/><br/>Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge.

","One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter.<br/><br/>I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them.<br/><br/>However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film)."

I know it was lambasted as sacrilegious by the Christian Right, and the Jewish Right too (for its cynical treatment of the Judean resistance groups), but those people never did have any sense of humor. In fact there's no disrespect shown to the teachings of anybody's religion. I lived not far from the ""mount"" of the Sermon on the Mount (in America it would be only a ""hill""), and the scene of onlookers at the back of the crowd not quite able to hear, and having their own personal encounters, just fits the actual layout perfectly.

","This film spirals from one laugh out loud moment to another, but the funniest of them all, and one that must strike a chord with everyone sentenced to learning Latin at school, must be the 'dog Latin' lesson given by Cleese's Centurion to Brian after he has painted his 'Romans Go Home' slogan in the town centre. It's 25 years since I saw this at the cinema with the lady due to be my wife, and I still cry with laughter. She doesn't. I think I'm right in saying that the Python team had a fairly limited budget to work to, but this doesn't matter in the end, as it simply makes the individual performances stand out, unlike modern films where the actors sometime seem to be simply assisting the CGI star. This was the Python's at their creative peak, a luscious swan song of anarchic comment and comedy, and one that prevents the bad taste in the mouth from the later 'Meaning of Life'."

There is trenchant satire about the lemming-like nature of people and an unfortunate tendency towards intolerance, which unfortunately is as relevant today as in 1979. The satire is interspersed with moments of inspired sheer silliness.

","Those who don't think it's funny usually are missing the point(s). Monty Python, like most Brit comedy, were usually fairly intellectual in their ridicule ... and if you can grasp the spoofs of historical (and even present day) references, you will never tire of it. They were always ahead of their time, and by the way, this is not a religious spoof, but rather it's more of a political spoof. Note to readers: I will give an example of an incisive comedic part of the movie . Their skewering in the movie, of all the Jewish ""guerilla"" groups, parallels, the very same type of groups today, who happen to be Arabic/Palestinian. The movie is very funny, yet can be thought provoking as well. Generally, I find British comedy to be droll at times, but it rarely degenerates to gutter humour laced with crudities and profanities the way a lot of modern North American comedy tends to. I find that this movie highlights the clumsy, sheepish, nature of humans who may have the best intentions but mess things up royally."

After tackling the local Mythology of Briton with Holy Grail, the Pythons go after bigger game with the major mythology of western civilization.

","I'm all for Holy Grail. I do love a bit of Meaning of Life now and then. But give me Life of Brian anytime. It's funny, it's deep, it's entertaining, it's (often, for me anyway) tear-jerking. This film is not only very well made but also very clever. The jokes are mostly intelligent and it's comments on religion should not be ignored.<br/><br/>   This has often been listed as one of the best films for atheists, and has been fought by the hyper-religious. In actuality, neither side is correct. Life of Brian neither advocates atheism or goes against religion in any way. It goes against overly-religious people and how quick they are to follow anyone and believe anything without thinking for themselves. Jesus is shown once, in a very positive way. Brian does not claim to be the Messiah, people just blindly believe it. <br/><br/>   Everyone in the film does a fantastic job. John Cleese is, as always, most enjoyable when yelling. Eric Idle (A personal hero of mine) is delightful, cheeky, and gets a chance to show off not only his great body but also his sweet voice. You can't turn around in Life of Brian without running into Michael Palin, but he does a decent job with each character. Jones is perfect as Brian's mother and Terry Gilliam gives probably his best performance as a 'mad and deaf' jailer (Complimented perfectly by the wonderful Eric Idle). However, the gem of the film is the late Graham Chapman as Brian. Chapman throws himself into the role, and plays it to humanistic perfection. His performance (and the fantastic actress that plays Judith) are what sets Life of Brian apart from the other two Python films. It gives it a very human feel, and you truly sympathize with Brian.<br/><br/>   This is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the best comedic films of all time. It challenged how far you could go in films and influenced a generation. Truly, the Pythons did for comedy what the Beatles did for music. And they prove it best in this fantastic film. <br/><br/>   (From my experience, the only people who don't like Life of Brian are those that either 'don't get it' and are confused by the lack of fart jokes or are over-religious and needlessly offended.)"

","`The film so funny it was banned in Norway!' Life of Brian has been penned with that phrase in Sweden, because it was, because Norway believed it to be blasphemous. In an interview, they said that they didn't really consider it to be blasphemous, and I don't either. It's just funny, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Brian is a baby born on the original Christmas. First, the three Wise Men accidentally go into his house, instead of Jesus'. Fast forward to the year 33 A.D., where Brian (Graham Chapman) is a regular Jew, who hates the Romans who take over and lives with his overbearing mother (Terry Jones). He falls into the hands of the People's Front of Judea and is fighting against the Romans. Soon he becomes mistaken for the Messiah. Well, at least it has more of a plot than The Meaning of Life.<br/><br/>Better than Meaning of Life, not as funny as Holy Grail. During the first two thirds of the movie, the laughs came steadily. During the last part of the film, the laughs teetered off a little. And, since most of the plot is about Brian being mistaken for the Messiah, it came surprisingly late in the film, maybe around halfway. Of course, it couldn't be considered a Monty Python film if it didn't have the trademark animation. The opening credits (which also sported a better song than Meaning of Life) had kooky animation, as with the animation/claymation halfway through, where Brian gets `rescued' by a spaceship.<br/><br/>Being a Latin student myself, I cracked up when Brian was writing graffiti and was corrected by a soldier about his grammar. I could actually understand what they were talking about! Something else that made me laugh out loud was when Brian went to buy something but was hounded to haggle. There were other funny scenes, and most of the movie was hit instead of missthough a couple points didn't strike me as funny.<br/><br/>During the interview I mentioned earlier, they ended by singing `Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', and I didn't know that it came from this movie. It was a humorous ending to the movie.<br/><br/>Of course, all of the Monty Pythoners were in top condition, not showing any signs of weakness yet. I particularly like John Cleese and Eric Idle the most, with Idle seeming to come off best. The six main actors altogether had 40 parts! Beat that, Eddie Murphy! Other `regulars', such as Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes, did well also.<br/><br/>Not the best, not the worst of the Monty Python movies, but Life of Brian isn't one to be missed.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for nudity, religious themes, and language."
"archive-1","Null","1","4","27 November 2002"," The Meaning of Brian
","The Meaning of Brian<br/><br/>Monty Python's The Life of Brian was released in 1979 to unprecedented scandal, even before production began the subject matter was deemed so controversial no movie studio or financier would touch it, if not for ex-Beatle George Harrison whose production company came to the rescue the project would probably never have gotten off the ground.<br/><br/>
The Life of Brian was directed by Terry Jones and written as a collaborative effort involving the Python team; Graham Chapman - John Cleese - Terry Gilliam - Eric Idle - Terry Jones and Michael Palin. In the movie Brian Cohen, a young Jew played by Graham Chapman, discovers from his harlot mother that his father was a Roman centurion not a Jew as he was led to believe. To prove his Jewishness he joins a radical underground movement and by misadventure ends up lauded the messiah by multitudes of equally disaffected Israelites, his bemused mother recast a virgin. Brian's simple message that everyone's an individual, doesn't need a leader, shouldn't follow demagogues strikes a cord with an oppressed people but is quickly hijacked. Arrested by the Romans he is sentenced to death and abandoned by his companions, who in the final act are seen weaving politically advantageous myths around his martyrs death.<br/><br/>At first glance the life of Brian bears little resemblance to the life of Christ except in parody, however there's more to it then perceived by viewers. Anticipating a scandal which could result in the film being banned or its release restricted the Python team cunningly depicted Brian and Jesus as two different men in the opening act,  it pacified the general public and censors but not the clergy who understood the meaning of the movie.<br/><br/>When people think of Jesus images of the Christmas nativity and passion plays spring to mind; the son of a God, born of a virgin, who preached love and forgiveness before dying on the cross for the sins of the world. Raised from the dead three days latter, the promise of eternal life fulfilled to all who believe. A narrative crafted into what became the Christian Bible in the first centuries AD by the Church of Roman, the fact Jesus was born a Jew, was by occupation a rabbi ignored. As such it would come as a surprise to most Christians to discover he has a presence in Judaic scripture, in the Talmud, Babylonian Edition, there are many references to Jesus, his mother and disciples which modern Christians would find as offensive as their first century counterparts did. It is these references which the Monty Python team used to form the basis of the Life of Brian, a fact not widely publicized at the time or since.<br/><br/>The Babylonian Talmud contradicts the popular Jesus story, within its pages he's referred to as Yeshu ben Pandera and Yeshu the Nazarene, the illegitimate son of Mary Magdala a ladies hairdresser. Yeshu being Hebrew for ""Jesus"", ben Pandera ""son of Pandera"" and Nazarene denoting his home town of ""Nazareth"". His mothers designation as a ladies hairdresser is an ancient metaphor for ""prostitute"". In these texts, written c70AD, it states Jesus' birth was the outcome of his mother having been raped by a Roman centurion called Panthera, with whom she had an adulterous relationship. First century philosopher Celsus wrote he had been told by a noted Hebrew scholar that Jesus' mother had been divorced by her carpenter husband for committing adultery, wandering in disgrace before giving birth to him in seclusion. The Talmud  says Jesus incited Jews to deviate from the principals of Judaism and was put to death, after having been abandoned by his followers. Some biblical scholars believe the deviation in question was an anti theocratic stance, teaching that a man can find salvation in the next life by good deeds in this life and communicate directly with God via prayer without recourse to synagogues or priesthoods which he denounced as corrupt due to its alliance with Rome and amassing of wealth at the expense of the poor. The Talmud has many references to Jesus which Christians would find disturbing, the Toledoth Jeshu details how Jesus' disciples plotted to steal his body but a gardener removed it from the tomb to avoid a desecration and when the disciples returned to find it empty proclaimed Jesus had risen from the dead.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly as Christianity swept the world Jews found themselves in increasing danger for having such things printed in their holy book, so in the seventeenth century elders took steps to expunge all references to Jesus as states in which they lived threatened to ban the Talmud and Christian zealots threatened to exterminate Jews for their ancestors having written such things. After the invention of the printing press Church censors had to approve book content prior to publication and synagogues had no chance of obtaining licenses to publish anything perceived as defamatory to the life of Christ, so self censorship was practiced and all references were quietly removed. It wasn't until after WWII and the establishment of the State of Israel that rabbinical scholars and elders felt secure enough to reissue unabridged Talmud's, although Christian elders and scholars denounced it ferociously at the time.<br/><br/>The Monty Python team found the pompous, self righteous traits of Christianity irresistible and targeted it often on their TV show. Although they expected controversy upon the release of the Life of Brian they were quite stunned by the depth of outrage, John Cleese and Terry Jones shuddering with alarm as heated words were shot at them during TV dialogues with churchman. It's not surprising they hadn't the courage at the time to admit they were poking their tongue at Christianity by adapting the Talmudic account of Christ's life, however had they the joke would have gone over most peoples heads anyway. The joke only understood by devout Christians and biblical scholars who didn't find it funny, most lay people took offense merely because they were told to from the pulpit. The movie was denounced by the Pope, the Arch Bishop of Canterbury and every major Christian denomination in the world who mobilized congregations to protest outside cinemas and lobby legislators to ban the movie or have its rating classification changed so impressionable young people couldn't see it and succeeded in many places. More than 20 years on the movie remains as popular as it is controversial, whenever screened on TV or in cinemas as part of a Monty Python festival it generates protests, although its enduring popularity has more to do with great writing and acting performances then religious jibes."

But give it a chance, it has something for everyone.<br/><br/>The thing that I love about Monthy Python in general is that they manage to make fantastic comedy that still makes great social commentary. I would even claim that the most effective way to comment on social events is to joke about it. Just think about what Charlie Chaplin did with Hitler!<br/><br/>I must admit that a lot of the stuff that Monthy Python did has aged very badly, especially the TV-series. And let´s face it, the TV-series didn´t make much sense outside of Britain from the start either since most of the jokes are built around a contemporary Britain of the 70´s. I was a toddler at the time of the TV-series so it makes even less sense to me. BUT, this is NOT true of Life of Brian and the other Python films, with the exception of The Meaning of Life. <br/><br/>In Life of Brian the Pythons manage to comment on everything that makes us tick. That is also why it is so great, you laugh about stuff that in reality is plain cruel. It covers everything from Witch hunts to the death penalty. And most importantly,  Bible-nuts, political opportunist and every type of follow-the-leader types should not watch this film. You might face the risk of seeing yourself ridiculed. <br/><br/>But since I am writing this in the time of the second Intifata I would also dare to make the statement that you can actually see a glimpse of what is happening on the West bank.

","On one hand, it's more complex than 'the Holy Grail' that I do not consider a religious satire, but more like a satire on tales of knights, compared with 'Life of Brian'.  On the other hand there is the uncomplicated controversy 'sex, sex, sex that's all they think about' in a supposedly medieval way.  But of course the lavatorial humour is only there to lighten up the more concerned and clever jokes, like the mockery of the stoning, feminism, the gladiators, the crucifixions, the self-chastisement, the bargaining nonsense, the supposed superiority of the Romans (Biggus Dickus et al) and the repressing of Jews.  Religious viewers who don't have much stamina could have a cardiac arrest when watching this film I guess.  But under all the mockery MP have a very sharp knowledge of the bible, philosophy and events that 2001 years ago took place (or what is believed by certain religious groups) and don't really get anti-clericist.<br/><br/>Without George Harrison this 'hand made film' would not have been possible. I see it twice a year to remind me of the craziness of religious herding, stalking and hypocrisy.  And also to remember to always look on the bright side of life.  Do not make your history homework: watch this instead!  The only time MP got carried away really is with the alien spaceship, which is childish and not important.  What is important, are the settings and decors, which are more convincing than those of 'Gladiator' (Scott, 2000) and 'the Last temptation of Christ' (Scorsese, 1988) as far as I'm concerned.  BTW, how would Kirk Douglas in Spartacus (Kubrick, 1960) have performed the the famous song at the end of the film?  Anyway, MP perform 40 (fourty) brilliant roles with just them six and that might just be the biggest gag of the film.<br/><br/>Strange, that 'Life of Brian' is considered one of the best comedies ever and Buñuel's 'Simón of the desert' (1965) and 'the Milky Way' (1969) are almost not known at all.  Let's just blame it on the subtitles.  On its turn, Life of Brian might partially have been an inspiration for 'Army of Darkness' (Raimi, 1992).  My favourite line by Simón del Desierto: 'I'm beginning to realize that I don't realize what I'm saying.  What am I saying?'  So satisfy your curiosity and try these films: what are you waiting for ... Christmas?  10/10"
"FreeMM","10","1","4","20 September 2001"," One of the funniest films you will ever see
","A lot of reviewers have highlighted what is so great about this film, it's satire.  Satire is often funny, but never as consistently funny.  This is gut wrenchingly funny as opposed to funny ha ha.  No stone is left unturned. Religion is the but of the joke, but the fundamentalists, socialists and ignorants all get lambasted in a severely underrated film.<br/><br/>The concept of Jesus as a chancer and a man who happened to be in the right place at the right time is pure genius.  The utilisation of modern attitudes and language works wonders as this historical tale unwinds and the immaculate conception is explained away in perhaps the most original thought on this matter.  There is joke after joke after joke.  You can't catch them all the first time and it takes repeated viewing to ascertain and appreciate the complexity of the intelligent writing.<br/><br/>Beyond the jokes are the messages.  Messages that are so obvious and relevant in today's society, but messages that fall on deaf ears every day.<br/><br/>Those that say this isn't funny or isn't their funniest piece of work they just don't know.  They're not there.  They're missing a critical piece of art and historical social commentary that's ever been committed to film.<br/><br/>Genius."

Unfortunately due to its religious overtones it has not achieved the rating it deserves - I'm sure that hard-core Christians would have been so offended by it that they would have given it low scores.  Even so, it's probably a more accurate representation of the period around the time of Christ than most documentaries on the era."

"thehumanduvet","9","1","4","6 March 2001"," Classic scandal-mongering from the Pythons
","An awesome achievement from the Monty Python team, creating a biting yet hilarious satire on religion and politics and getting exactly the response hoped for - the film was condemned by godbotherers at the time as blaspheming the life of Christ, when in fact it is quite respectful towards the actual story of Jesus, but uses the life of an ordinary man living in the same time and place to lambast religion as a whole. Right-wing christianity thereby condemned itself as reactionary and unable to take any hint of criticism without the cries of 'Unbeliever!?Persecute him!' that greet the first critic of the fledgling Brian religion in the film. The Life of Brian is a plea for tolerance and common sense in all things, and although religion is its main target, it hits on many other human failings, particularly in politics and bureaucracy, without ever losing sight of the fact that it is above all a comedy. Packed with visual and verbal hilarity in the best Python style, and carrying a vital message that people should think for themselves and not take things too seriously, this is a great and important film which could, if enough people watched it properly, and took in what it has to say without mindlessly condemning, make the world a kinder and happier place.

","Where to begin?<br/><br/>I like this film.  I have it on video and it one of the few that I can watch again and again and still be laughing.  I think I first watched it when I was in my early years and found it funny that there was swearing (I was an impressionable child and found casual swearing amazingly funny).<br/><br/>It wasn't until I started University and I had (just) got over this phase that I happened to see the film in a sale.  I thought I'd buy it just to lapse back to my childhood and see if it was funny.  It was, and this time for entirely different reasons.  The situation for a start.  The fact that at the time of Jesus, there can be an ordinary person leading a normal life who happens to become 'famous' (for want of a better word) for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Add to that, a few throw away lines and some excellent acting (Michael Palin in particular) and you have a film that is well conceived, written and performed (is that the right order?).

"eastie","10","1","4","8 November 2000"," history
","Most of what can be said about Life of Brian already has been. It's the Pythons' tightest, funniest (all right, so that's subjective) and most thoughtful film. I watched Ben Hur the whole way through for the first time the other day, and the only thing that made it's turgid portents bearable was picturing Charlton Heston asking ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" The big irony is that in spite of deliberately placing modern characters and attitudes into a historical setting for the sake of comedy, Life of Brian is in many ways the more historically sensitive film. Ben Hur is typical Hollywood history, turning the Judeans into proto-liberal nationalists on a quest for freedom from oppression every bit as anachronistic and spurious as that of Mel Gibson's William Wallace. At least Braveheart has only the single-whammy of glib, historically insensitive, self-congratulatory, judgemental retrospect. Ben Hur doubles its money by throwing in religious pomposity for that extra emotionally-manipulative kick.<br/><br/>Life of Brian, on the other hand, despite forswearing any pretensions to historical accuracy, comes a lot nearer to providing a balanced historical perspective. What did the Romans ever do for us? Quite a lot, actually. Why are we resisting them? We're not quite sure. OK, so that's not particularly accurate either. The Jewish nation and subsequent diaspora is one of the pivotal test cases in any analysis of the concept of nationalism. Clearly, as the several major revolts demonstrate, there was real opposition to Roman rule, and it was proto-nationalist, insofar as any concepts of nation had by then developed. It's putting the heavily loaded - intrinsically modern - language of freedom into their mouths which is so offensive. It doesn't really need to be pointed out why Hollywood insists on doing this, but I'll do it anyway: it's a cheap way to cash in on the pride that every American is brought up to feel in the wonderful, mysterious accident of 1776. Someone else has already talked about Life of Brian's assault on selective history with regard to religion (still it's most powerful feature - I'm resolutely secular, but the level at which Christianity is ingrained into my culture is so fundamental that to conceive of the real-life figure of Jesus as just another bloke is still shocking). Life of Brian's common sense approach not only attacks this selectivity, it also lampoons retrospective history: the tendency to read one's own beliefs and priorities into people who viewed the world from an utterly different perspective and who, as the LP Hartley cliche has it, ""do things differently"". The People's Front of Judea are self-evidently ridiculous. But how can anyone have thought that Charlton Heston as Judea Ben Hur wasn't?"
"carlgt1","8","1","4","4 November 2000"," Pretty good though not the best Python
","This is a pretty good film although my least favorite of the Monty Python films (in ascending order I like Meaning of Life & Holy Grail better). Chapman does a great portrayal of the mistaken messiah Brian, and the rest of the cast does a great job of ridiculing the messiah crazy ancient times, but it just seems to drag for some reason.  It's a good showcase for the comic skills of the Python troupe as they each portray a few characters. Besides the irreverence which angered the church & sanctimonious people back in the day, the film does bring up some interesting points of hero-worship. And the idea that people want to believe in SOMETHING that carries down through to modern times."

""Life of Brian"" is my favourite comedy film.  The humour is sarcastic, daring and consistent pretty much until the end.  There are very few films that can be watched repeatedly and still make you laugh out loud but this is one of them.  I'm disappointed more of my friends here (America) haven't seen it.

Whilst The Holy Grail is a classic of manic and 'silly' fun, The Life of Brian is, on the whole, more thoughtful and inspired.<br/><br/>LOB represents the final blooming of the Python's creative talent. The film is not only hilarious in itself, it also takes a subtle(ish) swipe at organised religion as a whole. For example, the crowd breaking up into smaller factions and arguing over how to worship 'the messiah' only moments after hailing him.<br/><br/>Also the film appears to take a broadside at nationalist hatred, with the classic 'What have the Romans ever done for us?' scene. Is it coincidence that the Judaian People's Front all speak with Welsh accents??<br/><br/>This film perhaps carries more classic comedy moments than any other film ever:<br/><br/>*POTENTIAL SPOILERS (but they probably only mean something to those that have already seen the film)* 'No-one's to begin stoning...not even...if they do say Jehovah'; 'Romans, they go to the house? (a superb sketch on Latin lessons); 'Apart from the irrigation, the aqueduct...what have the Romans ever done for us?'; 'He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy' and the ultimate scene 'Does anyone else find is risible...when I mention my friend Bigus...?'.There are so many more classic scenes. *END OF POTENTIAL SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Even if you don't like Monty Python, this film is worth watching, its a natural progression from the classic humour they were doing in the early 70's. Not necessarily better, but different.<br/><br/>Holy Grail in its craziness may appear to represent English humour to an international audience, but then, so did Benny Hill (groan). However, it is Life of Brian that truly shows English comedy at its very best!"

In this Python masterpiece, poor Brian (an unsuspecting red-sea-pedestrian) is named the messiah in a botched attempt to escape the Romans.<br/><br/>Brian's Latin lesson is reminiscent of most everybody's experience with a foreign language teacher I'm sure...and Brian's mother is a perfect example of the mother in law from hell (for reference to this watch the scene where Judith first meets Mrs. Cohen).  Pontius and Biggus Dickus are a speech pathologist's worst nightmare delivering some hysterical lines (my favorite being, ""So Jew, your father was a woman?""  ""No no, a *Roman*"" ""Stwike him centuwion vewy woughly."")<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can say about this movie is the fact that we're assailed with a brief shot of Graham Chapman's naughty bits in a full frontal balcony scene.

Those who condemned it for blasphemy and lack of respect for Jesus are missing the point. What is sent up here is not God, nor Christ, but the ridiculous ways in which humans use spirituality and belief for their own ends, and so deny themselves the very thing they are seeking.<br/><br/>The idea is brilliant - a poor Jewish man finds himself by accident following in the footsteps of Christ, and discovering the pitfalls and perils thereof. It's a classic one-step displacement in order to laugh at social and moral stupidities of the past and present. The script is very tight, nothing is overdone or laboured, you're kept chuckling right the way through whilst marvelling at the cleverness of the storytelling.<br/><br/>My favourite part was when Brian was writing out his slogan ""Romans go Home"" and gets caught. Anybody who has sat through Latin classes will groan as the memories of declensions and conjugations come back. Horrible!<br/><br/>It's classic Python, the best thing they've ever done and it still is very funny even in 2000. John Cleese is brilliant, so is Terry Jones and Graham Chapman is perfect as the straight man Brian. <br/><br/>And of course there's that wonderful song ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" - sheer genius, horribly covered by Art Garfunkel in ""As Good as It Gets"". <br/><br/>I've seen this too many times to offer a really critical review.

","""Life of Brian"" is the kind of comedy that Monty Python is known for, which is taking a subject and tearing it apart by making fun of it!

It also makes way for some of Monty Python's funniest jokes which have had me laughing until it started to hurt!  Although I'm amazed that they've got away with as much as they did, because after ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", people are ready to jump on the bandwagon of brutally attacking a film that may seem controversial in it's religious subject matter.  But still, it's hard to attack this movie when it paralyzes you with laughter!  It's not as funny as some of Monty Python's other movies, but this is still very funny.  I couldn't believe the ending, with ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"".  Eric Idle really pulled out all of his gags in this picture, and I think his best scene is as the worker with the speech impediment.  I thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie!

","Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian, is a 1979 British religious satire comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was also directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.<br/><br/>Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films, longtime Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his company HandMade Films.<br/><br/>The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy, and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate, effectively preventing the film from being shown, since the distributors said it could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The filmmakers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters in Sweden reading, ""So funny, it was banned in Norway!"""

","If the story of Christianity's roots is eternal, so too should be anyone brave enough to parody it. This, the British troupe's second cinematic expedition, is neither as carelessly silly as ""The Holy Grail"" nor as manic and sketch-heavy as ""The Meaning of Life,"" but it's every bit as funny in its own dryly sarcastic way. Though it might not be as immediately gratifying as its peers, I've come to appreciate ""Brian"" as the Pythons' best-written picture over the years, with a razor-sharp wit playing excellently alongside the requisite amounts of lunacy and brow-furrowing topics of conversation. And, though it's clearly a product of the late '70s in many ways, its not-so-subtle warnings against blind faith in any organization (or the men at the helm) is still very relevant in today's world. It isn't the non-stop jaunt through the funhouse that you might expect from this cast, yet ""Brian"" delivers no less efficiently in different ways, especially during its hilariously bleak song and dance finale."

This might be offensive to the religious but I thought it was hilarious and a clever poke at fanatics but even though some of the jokes are hysterical, many happen to be a little too crude and vulgar for some people. But, then again, that's the Pythons for you. 'Life of Brian' tells one linear story unlike 'The Meaning of Life' which featured a series of sketches showing the different 'stages of life'. It's not about Jesus, but a humble neighbour of his who's been mistaken for a messiah. Even after poor Brian's constant denials and refusals he is forced to be seen as a messiah and treated as one and this is a result of the people's blind faith. The only reason that I can think of why people of religious faith will find this offensive is because they lack a sense of humour."
"OldAle1","9","1","5","5 May 2009"," Always look on the silly side of belief
","Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago. They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella. Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though with less interesting in stonings than is usual. Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnapping of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" The conventional wisdom on 'Life of Brian' is that it's the Python crew's most ""polished"" or ""competent"" film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find 'Holy Grail' funnier. It's still scatter-shot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor. Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was it's biggest problem....<br/><br/>Early highlights include the stoning scene and the scene with the ex-leper, but where the film really takes off in my mind is when Brian becomes an accidental prophet. It seems to be channeling or ripping off Holy Grail at first - smart, articulate Brian being completely misunderstood by the idiot peasants, just exactly as Bedevere in the earlier film presiding over the witch's trial - but the brilliance with which Brian quickly goes from being just another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe. I think this may be the high point of the Pythons' wordplay, and the fact that it's foreshadowed in an early scene where Brian and others are listening to the real Messiah but misinterpreting his words wildly only adds an icing to the cake. If there's a message to Life of Brian it's that people will hear what they want to hear, and sometimes no matter how clear you think you're being, you're not going to get through to them - especially if God's in the way; also, people want someone else to save them, to do the work of making the hard decisions – even if they have to turn off their brains to believe.<br/><br/>I find comedy harder to describe or critique than just about anything else; perhaps that's a cop-out but I'm not sure how I can really get at just how clever and funny the film is without quoting a bunch of dialogue, and what's the point in that? You're here on IMDb, you can check it out easily yourselves. I will close by saying that in one way 'Life of Brian' does seem to ""conform"" to the more modern style of religious ""epic"" - the Jerusalem and the Jews here are dirty, disheveled, and poor. Gone pretty much for good by this time is the splendor of the 50s and 60s Cinemascope epics - although I suspect that may have as much do with the small budgets of the Pythons' film, and Scorsese's and Gibson's later efforts, as with any conscious desire to make things grubby"

","I hadn't seen this movie in quite some time, yet it never ceases to amaze me! I rented it recently because my twin brother was having dental surgery (I drove him home and spent the night at his place in case he needed anything). I thought that this movie would help cheer him up. Both of us agree that it is one of our favorites.<br/><br/>Much has already been written about whether or not this movie makes fun of Jesus. I don't think it does, and I am among those who say that it really makes fun of religious fanaticism. Much has also been written about how this film was criticized by those who had never seen it and therefore could not, as Brian says, figure this out for themselves. A very telling scene is when Brian addresses the crowd and tells them that they are all different. They reply, in unison, ""Yes, we are all different...tell us more!"" But my favorite scene is still the classic Michael Palin as Pontious Pilate ""Biggus Dickus"" bit. I can watch this movie and just smile at it until this scene. It still cracks me up. As I said above, I hadn't seen it in awhile, yet during that scene I lost it. I laughed so hard that tears were coming out of my eyes. Yes, I know it's juvenile! But the way Palin plays it, speech impediment and all (yes, I know, how un-PC) is what makes it. You can see that when he gets in close to the soldier, he is straining not to laugh.

Holy Grail is fun, and has a ton of wonderful commentaries on culture, history, multiple-realities, AND debunks everything humans create...yet it somehow comes off as sillier than Life of Brian. They are BOTH worth seeing. Let the nitpicking come to an end! The Monty Python Flying Circus television show, which was broadcast via PBS here (1969-74), must have kept them exhausted, and ""Grail"" came at the end of this era. Certainly, the production values are better in ""Brian"", and the Python gang was motivated enough to come BACK together to make it which could only mean they were older, wiser, and perhaps more focused than before. I refuse to choose. I own them both, and I laugh with amazement at the both of them each and every time. However, ""The Life of Brian"" is SO dead-on accurate, and SO equality minded when pointing out the foolishness of religions, bureaucracy, politics, social norms, political correctness, activists, and society in general, it leaves no one unscathed, unbattered, or able to restrain themselves from gut busting laughter while admiring the insights of these men."
"dragonshield","8","1","5","21 August 2007"," Life of Brian - The bright side of that almost forgotten specific humour
","I bought ""Montys Enzyklo Pythonia"" -DVD package a while back. It contains all the three movies and unfortunately one of those movies I had not seen before - ""Life of Brian"" is a great comedy. It wasn't as good as I expected, but it sure was great. I have to admit that I still like ""Holy Grail"" the most from the Monty Python movies. I didn't like ""The Meaning of Life"" so much and I think it's the worst one of the three movies, though it isn't that bad after all. The story tells about.. Well, about the life of Brian, who is born in the exact same date as Jesus himself. After a few ten years Brian, a Jew in Roman-occupied Judea, is mistaken for a messiah which throws him into a plot he wouldn't want to be part of.<br/><br/>The story itself is surprisingly good and the storyline follows the movie really well, so it stays in the package throughout unlike ""Holy Grail"" which is just messing around with intelligent silliness and ""The Meaning of Life"" which doesn't even have a real plot. So, story-wise this movie is the best one of the three candidates, having a story which is also surprisingly entertaining and interesting. It isn't anything that serious though, as there still is that same Monty Python humour that no-one else than the Monty Python boys could come up with, and it is indeed hysterical. The movie is non-stop joking throughout and it doesn't really get boring in any part, which is especially good when it comes to comedies like these. The jokes are funny, some of them being not that funny and some of them being absolutely hilarious. I still didn't laugh as much as in ""Holy Grail"" though, so you shouldn't be expecting a comedy in the same level.<br/><br/>Again, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin play various characters, which all of them have their different personalities; Hilarious, yet sometimes being familiarly sickening - The kind of personalities we know the Monty Python boys of. Once again, my personal favourites are John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin, who have always been the best actors Monty Python has offered, or at least for me. The other three, Graham Chapman who is pure excellence as the main character Brian Cohen, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones also perform their roles flawlessly and of course with guaranteed Python style, which really can not be compared to any other comedy styles.<br/><br/>What I like about ""Life of Brian"" is the whole set-up of it; The milieu is Judea, but the Judean people themselves are all actually English, which is merely hilarious as its own - The whole story and the jokes are just a plus to that. As a fan of British humour, especially the accent, I find some of the jokes hysterical just because of the accent of the language; The use of words, different emphasis's and the whole body language which is also so significant for the entire purposes of the jokes. It's just so brilliant and the humour this movie has to offer has also surprisingly much intelligence inside it, though it is silly and it swings on the edges of stupidity.<br/><br/>I found ""Life of Brian"" entertaining throughout and I'm glad to say I have finally seen it. It's a must-see for every Python -fan there is and it's a must-see for every comedy-fan there is. Monty Python's humour is not for everyone and as far as I know it that specific humour has divided people to two different groups; Those who like it and those who don't, it just depends on the person you are. If you haven't liked the series I would still recommend seeing this film, as it's actually a bit different than the series, naturally, as it still is a full length motion picture after all. As I watched ""The Meaning of Life"" in slight disappointment before I saw ""Life of Brian"" I found this surprisingly refreshing - One thing I can also be glad of is that this isn't a disappointment. It's a sure recommendation for all those who want to have a laugh and a great time when watching a movie. No matter how much you'd hate it, you can Always Look on the Bright Side of Life - Even perhaps the Life of Brian."

","The first time I saw it, I thought Holy Grail was a lot funnier, now I like them both equally. The film starts on Christmas night, with the birth of Brian, where the three wise men mistake him for Jesus Christ. Later, when Brian (Graham Chapman) has grown, he is only known as a stadium snack seller, but it is there that he meets and joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, who do nothing, but really hate the Romans. Later, after carrying out a job for them, and escaping from lisping Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) (""Welease Wodewick""), he says wise words to some pilgrims on the streets. It is after this that suddenly people start following him, believing he is the Messiah. The film concludes with the controversial crucifixion of Brian, and many other characters. Also starring John Cleese in many of the cooperative roles, Chapman also playing some small roles including lisping Biggus Dickus (""Thomething I Thaid?""), Terry Gilliam playing ugly cooperatives, Eric Idle playing cheerful, questioning and reasoning roles, Terry Jones as the Pepperpot mother of Brian and other smaller roles, Palin takes quite a lot of the supporting roles, Sue Jones-Davies as Judith, and a cameo by Spike Milligan. The highlights for me are Brian opening the window (naked) to a crowd, and his mother says ""He is not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"", and Idle asks ""Are you a virgin"", and of course, the great end to the film with the song by Idle, number 6 on 50 Greatest One Hit Wonders, ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"". It may have been controversial at the time, but it is now no match for The Passion of the Christ. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Eric Idle was number 21, and Cleese number 2 on The Comedians' Comedian, the film was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 1 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","My first film with the entire crew from Monty Python (their third feature-length film), whilst I count out Terry Gilliam's TIME BANDITS (1981, a 7/10), which is sort of a post-break-up solo activity (in spite of Cleese and Palin's participation). <br/><br/>What can I say? Due to the cultural disparity, comedy maybe the most possible film genre which is predisposed to feel outdated, especially for those from non-native audience. I could only squeeze some scattered laughter to cater for the film, which is a parody of the life of Jesus Christ grafted in a mistaken Messiah with a hotchpotch of haphazard mess and ridicule.<br/><br/>Maybe the film should have a default setting for its viewers, because being an agnostic, I could hardly get the film, thus there is a possibility if one acquires more religious backdrops, there is a chance he or she could appreciate it more. Also it is a perplexing question mark in my mind, how could this film manages a 8.2 out of 10 rating and listed among top 250 in IMDb? (I had the same doubt when encountering THE PRINCESS BRIDE 1987, a 6/10). <br/><br/>So back to the film itself, the acting is fairly passable (John Cleese and Michael Palin are hilarious in their deadpan performances, but the mis-pronunciation gags are a bit over- abused). Among all the intentional tricks, the paragraphs of pursuing the Messiah and Eric Idle's rib-tickling Loretta are my picks. <br/><br/>It is no surprise this religious satire would provoke some blasphemy controversy, but the nerves and unconventionality are what should be admired, but if we separate the film from any context liaisons, the film is merely a modest farce, take the example of the ending, when the crucifixion scenes arrive, a sudden bathos ultimately reduces any putative knockout accompanied by the schmaltzy rendition of ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE (which I find enjoys a more suitable circumstances in AS GOOD AS IT GETS 1997)."

","Picking a favorite between this & Holy Grail is a fool's game. I SLIGHTLY prefer Grail, though I don't feel great about it. The main difference between the 2 is that while Grail is an impeccable collection of medieval comedy sketches, Brian is an actual movie. While admirable, that plotting is what provides the few issues (editing, pacing). Still, it's insanely funny; ""always look on the bright side"" ending is one of the greatest pieces of filmed comedy ever."

","I watched this movie for the first time in at least 30 years and wondered if it still holds up. It does!! The hilarious gags keep coming at such a rapid clip that even the ones that don't work well area quickly run over by those that do. For all the controversy about it's alleged offensiveness to Christians, RELAX! The troupe is really just having some harmless fun with organized, monotheistic religion of all sorts. However, they have even MORE fun with the radical left, and THOSE jokes are even more relevant than ever. The classic exchange in which Eric Idle's character demands the right to not only become a woman but to have babies (""you're oppressing me"") - a joke at the time - has become a case of life imitating art.
To say this movie is not to be taken seriously is an understatement. The good-natured irreverence and silliness still gets big laughs. But remember, they're NOT the Judean People's Front, they're the People's Front of Judea!!"

The film has become unnecessarily one of the most controversial movies ever made according to some religious groups who took offence at the suggestion of lampooning the story of Christ. As stated by Palin and Cleese in a terrific interview they conducted and indeed in the actual narrative right at the beginning of the story, Jesus is a completely separate entity to Brian. He is born in the stable next door clearly shown. And right at the start all the complaints are thrown straight out of the window and smashed into the ground much like the spaceship in the incredible sci-fi scene half way through!

","British comedy is one of the best in the world, if not the best. The Monty Python team also have some of the best comedians such as the likes of John Cleese.

It would have been funnier if Brian really did ape the life of Jesus in a humorous way, similar to how they started with the 3 wise men and wrong stable. Yet we had a somewhat inconsequential tale of Brian. Despite the high praise and status the humour isn't always there for me or I must have missed something. 6/10"
"PyroSikTh","9","0","2","27 January 2020"," Comedy Masterpiece that Couldn't be Made Today
","This was the very last VHS I ever got, and I've loved it ever since. In celebration of the recently late Terry Jones, we decided to revisit it, and honestly didn't even realise he directed it until the opening credits. It was also the perfect opportunity to educate my wife who had never seen it before, and I couldn't abide that. For those of you similarly uneducated on one of the greatest comedy movies of all time, Life of Brian follows a man born on the same day and next door to Jesus Christ. Thirty-three years later he discovers he has Roman ancestry, joins an anti-Roman movement, and gets mistaken for the Messiah. And not once does it take the piss out of Jesus.<br/><br/>Ironically enough considering the controversy, Life of Brian is a satire of blind faith and religion itself. Nothing encapsulates this better than when Brian loses his sandal while being chased by a group of rabid followers. The followers stop to consider the sandal and what Brian leaving it behind is meant to mean. There's disagreements as to the significance and the group of followers quickly splinter by their differing interpretations. When they finally catch up with Brian he tells them to go away, and the followers take it as profound wisdom to go away in a certain way in order to attain spiritual cleansing. When there's complaints of no food, Brian points out a bush of fruit a hundred yards away and it's instantly hailed as a miracle, and when the guy who's been using that bush to sustain him for eighteen years complains, he's branded a blasphemour. And this goes on throughout the movie, including the famous nude scene with such iconic gems as ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"" and ""We are all individuals! I'm not.""<br/><br/>The genius of Life of Brian is how multilayered the jokes are, and how relentless they become the deeper your understanding of them is. On the surface there's plenty of comedy to be found, from the slapstick (Brian falling on a preacher, pushing him into a large jar) to the surrealist (Brian being abducted by aliens). Then there's the wordplay with Pontius Pilate talking about his friend Biggus Dickus and his inability to pronounce Rs, and the splintered revolutionary factions battling it out in the Roman corridors. Dig deeper and there's the satirical look at religious followers I explained above. But then there's even more, such as the grammar-lesson in Latin, which I can imagine develops a whole new level of comedy for those who actually know a little bit of how Latin works. Even if you don't, the scene is brimming with other humour in the Roman soldiery taking the time to teach a Jew Latin grammar, and giving him school-age punishment of writing it out a hundred times.<br/><br/>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Life of Brian could not be made today. For starters the controversy it garnered at the time would only be amplified in today's internet age of Twitter complainers. Movies today are so frightened of alienating particular audiences that even the most risquÃ© comedies have a line to draw. Not only that but we don't have George Harrison to mortgage his house in order to finance the movie any more. But even further, Life of Brian has not aged well. This is largely a good thing as it adds a dash of shock and becomes refreshing to watch today, but there are certain jokes and moments that would not land very well at all. The one that jumped out to me immediately is Eric Idle's blackface in the opening scene. Unlike Tropic Thunder, the blackface isn't treated as a joke, they just painted Idle's face black to turn him into a black wise man. Another one (again the subject of Eric Idle) is Stan wanting to be a woman called Loretta, and the response he receives from his friends is blatant transphobia. The film doesn't have particularly great treatment of women either. Of all the female characters in the movie, only three of them were played by actual women. The most obvious is Terry Jones as Brian's mother, but the stoning scene becomes unintentionally ironic when you realise it's a bunch of men pretending to be women pretending to be men. Nonetheless, it's to be expected from a comedy troupe comprised entirely of white men.<br/><br/>That aside, Life of Brian is a comedy masterpiece. The questionable acting doesn't matter, the repeated sets don't matter, the complete blindness to political correctness doesn't matter. All that matters is how hilarious it is, and Life of Brian is one of the absolute funniest. It doesn't matter how many times you rewatch it, there's always something new, another layer to the joke to appreciate, and the shallower jokes are so good and timeless that they're easily enjoyed for what they are over and over again. There's a reason Life of Brian is a landmark in pop culture, still quoted, referenced, and homaged today. It deserves nothing less than a 9/10."

His experiences loosely parallel those of Christ (seen briefly in direct and reverent fashion, played by Kenneth Colley), but the film is anything but blasphemous since its silly attacks don't aim at faith and divinity but rather hypocrisy, stubbornness, misunderstanding, groupthink, and overly pious biblical epics in general. What it is, however, is funny--very, very funny, in ways that only Python was ever able to truly master, specifically how they dress up clever and barbed commentary in the guise of sheer, tacky lunacy, and making the humor consistently work on both levels.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","20 April 2019"," A comedy film about Jesus Christ (sort of)? It can work! This is perhaps the defining one.
","""Life of Brian"" is a British comedy movie from 1979 and the most known effort most likely by the comedy troup Monty Python. Do I even need to say that? I think everybody knows. Anyway, this one has its 40th anniversary now and on that occasion, even if some devout Christians may not have liked it, especially for the Easter holidays, it returned to theaters again and yesterday I was lucky enough to be in a viewing. The director is Terry Jones and he is also one of the many writers. I will spare you most of the names, but of course Terry Gilliam, a really successful filmmaker in his own right, deserves a mention too and he is also acting in here obviously. I would also like to mention John Cleese, who probably gave my favorite performance from everybody in here, and he was just great fun and had amazing screen presence and he was also more handsome than I thought and I am writing this as a heterosexual male. Fittingly, back then that was half his life as he turns 80 later this year. The main character is played by Graham Chapman, who was perhaps the unluckiest from the Monty Python bunch as he died relatively early from cancer. And while some are dead, others managed great careers, including Oscar nominations, like Cleese. There were also some that ended up forgotten mostly like the Judith actress. Great choice for a name by the way.<br/><br/>Okay, this film takes place during the years of Jesus Christ, but it is not about him. Instead it is about Brian, a baby born the exact same day and same hour like Jesus right a few meters away from him and the Three Kings arrive there first as we find out right at the beginning in one of the most hilarious scenes of the film. The mother was always great. There is also some bizarre hilarity about her obviously being played by a male and being in disguise as a male with all the other women throwing stones during the execution. But while there is a plot and the film is also chronologic, it felt like a sketch comedy most of the time and the actors playing several characters like it is not uncommon for these shows) also add to that. But a high quality sketch comedy with a big budget obviously. The funniest moment for me was certainly the first Biggus Dickus scene with the guards next to the emperor (was that Caesar?) being unable to control their laughter, especially at the end when he mentions Biggus Dickus' wife Incontinencia. Hilarious stuff and also great to see B.D. later on in person with his speech impediment. Just like his imperator's. It was kinda funny how the people had so much fun throwing names at them and they did not get it. Yeah, these were the highlights basically. I think all the actors did a good job overall, some really stood out. I also liked the ""everybody just one cross"" fella and Cleese like I mentioned already. The only thing that keeps me from giving this an even higher rating is that the plot did not feel too fluent enough for me and early on it took me a relatively long (after the 3 Kings scene) to get into this movie. But when I did, I quite enjoyed it. The final ""Always Look on the Bright Side"" sequence is of course a classic, no denying. And how Brian eventually ends up on the cross too, shows that the film may be closer to Jesus' story than you think. It sure is a witty little movie and maybe it is also the small moments and references that make it work, like the guy pretending to be Brian eventually saying no he isn't him and he does want to return to the cross. Or how Brian talks about how good the sex was. Or the fella who gets tortured so hard and he returns briefly at the end wishing he would finaly get killed too. Or the soldier guy constantly returning to the rebels' hideout with the fella saying oh it's not too bad to get crucified. Haha I guess now I also know why some super religious people don't like this movie. But also away from the religious aspect, there are many fun moments to appreciate here. How they thought there was no Brian, but scream the name because of the r. The PFJ and so on and so on. I must say I am not really well aware about Monty Python and their works, but this film surely sparkled my interest, so I may check out some other stuff in the future. For also away from the comedy, in terms of sets, costumes, makeup and cinematography, this is a really good achievement. Infinitely better than the level you usually see in comedy films. The only scene I found a bit overrated was the balcony scene near the end. And a bit overlong too. But the real question here, the only question, that needs to be asked: Was this a great or just a good good movie? I think I will go with the latter and give it 3 out of 5 stars. A top250 classic, like it says here on imdb, it is not I would say. But one that deserves to be seen at least once and is also really funny on rewatch. It may have been the delicate subject that kept it from getting the awards recognition it deserved, but I guess it is all good with how it is seen as a classic by many today. Go watch it, preferably on the big screen."

","Monty Python's Life of Brian is about a man born in around the same time and place as Jesus who seeks to end Roman oppression in Israel. Brian, played by Graham Chapman, joins the People's Front of Judea, a group of men seeking the same goal as him, and together they discuss attacks on the empire to take them down once and for all. Along the way, Brian must decide what he wants out of life and whether the People's Front of Judea is right for him. Life of Brian is a decent comedy that sets up a few great jokes at the expense of the story.
The movie follows Brian's life in distinct sections that each build up to and execute a joke, but some key story elements are lost along the way. One of my favorite gags from the movie comes after Brian is thrown into prison and must stand before the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, played by Michael Palin, to plead his case. Brian and Pontius Pilate have a conversation about a friend named 'Biggus Dickus', a name representing a rather obvious phallus. The ensuing joke is that the guards are not allowed to laugh at the high ranking Roman's name because it would be disrespectful. I love the way Palin plays out this scene because it becomes obvious that he is trying to cause trouble by using the name repeatedly and in humorous ways. Palin makes it very clear that he, as an actor, is trying to have fun with the scene and helps to create a sense of awkward comedy that I enjoyed. Monty Python sets up and cleanly executes jokes that make watching worthwhile.
Of course, a Monty Python movie wouldn't be a Monty Python movie without a section that can be only described as non sequitur. The twist begins with Brian jumping off a building in an effort to flee the Romans. He is quickly abducted by aliens, causing the movie to transform into a low budget Star Wars for a couple of minutes before the UFO crashes back into Earth. Upon landing, the story unpauses like nothing odd has happened. Although this move makes no sense in the context of the plot, it is indicative of the sort of audience Life of Brian is meant for. Monty Python targets audiences that are watching to forget about life for a while, to have a good laugh for once. The surrealism of the alien twist helps to distance the world of Life of Brian further from that of the real one, giving audiences an escape from reality. I really enjoyed this wrench in the story because it was like a breath of fresh air -- it was so different and unexpected that I couldn't help but appreciate it. This twist and many more make Life of Brian a humorous movie.
Because the comedy group of Monty Python consists of only six people, all of the main actors in the film play more than two roles each. This became most obvious to me when I realized mid-film that the leader of the People's Front of Judea and the Roman centurion are played by the same actor, John Cleese. I thought this decision was actually quite brilliant because it gives the film an added layer of irony; the two characters are leaders on opposite sides of the main conflict, and seeing them played by the same person simply doesn't make sense. John Cleese also fits both roles rather well, surprisingly, which added to the comedic effect the film had in store. Cleese's roles in Life of Brian add an interesting fourth-wall-breaking dynamic to the film, making it both more outlandish and comedic.
Monty Python creates for the purpose of humoring audiences over all else, one of their defining characteristics. Comedy takes the driver's seat in Life of Brian, pushing any real compelling storytelling straight to the back burner. Because of the way the scenes are structured, I found it hard to take away elements from each section that contributed to the overarching plot of the movie. I often found myself wondering what the plot of the movie was supposed to be about, or what motivated the characters, and even at the end I still could not piece this story together in my mind. I was often thinking about the story while watching because I found that some of the jokes weren't very funny. In order for this movie style to work, every punchline set up needs to hit hard or else the scene is a failure. Everything in the scene builds up to this joke, so it had better be a good one to make watching it not a waste of time. A good example of this idea working quite well can be seen in another of Monty Python's movies, The Holy Grail. This masterpiece of a movie had me laughing continuously for the entire show at whatever gag they wanted to throw my way. What The Holy Grail does well is that the already solid pieces (the individual jokes) fit together quite nicely with the central plot of King Arthur's quest, whereas Life of Brian has scenes that simply feel both disjointed from the story and lacking of comedic effect.
Life of Brian is worth seeing if you're into the surrealistic comedy of Monty Python or if you enjoyed watching their other big hit, The Holy Grail. However, for the common moviegoer, Life of Brian is too all over the place to digest smoothly. This movie is best when watching with friends or anywhere with a light atmosphere. Life of Brian is an enjoyable film, but it's definitely not the holy grail of Monty Python films. That is why I gave it a 7/10."

In response, the wit of this humor began to tire without a substantive basis to complement.

I hardly understood a word spoken in the film, but I held out hope that the basic premise would reveal itself the way it has in other movies that I've had trouble following. No such luck. This thing started out way over the top and wound up just utterly stupid. I generally enjoy good parody but this seemed more like goofy slapstick.

","Revisiting this film after many years was a real treat. I had forgotten just how funny it is and also that it is shot so well and flows seamlessly that one is inclined not to notice that, of course, it is essentially a string of hilarious sequences much as was the original TV show. Filmed in Tunisia, the locations are most convincing and with the use of many extras never has the look of a staid, set bound movie. So well directed that everyone seems to be having fun and giving a great performance but John Cleese, Michael Palin and Eric Idle are stand outs and a joy to watch. Terrible that the film should not only still be relevant in its attack on almost everything but perhaps even more so now with seemingly everybody being so sensitive about themselves. Possibly too many jokes entered around speech impediments but it did seem back then that so many people in positions of authority did seem to have some sort of strange way of speaking.

","Having already searched for the holy grail, the Monty Python took swipes at the big J.C. in this controversial farce that still offends today. But whether you are atheist, open minded Christian or Muslim or Jew, or just a fan of this style of comedy, you will always look on the bright side of laughs. As a film goer with a genuine belief in basic Christian principals, I choose to laugh and not take every slam at the story of the Crucifixion as a slam against the man whom I believe died for my sins, long before I committed them. <br/><br/>As a teenager, I didn't quite get the droll humor of Monty Python, but upon reaching a certain age, I discovered the ""Meaning of Life"", and another search for the holy grail lead me to Spamalot on Broadway, and after a long hiatus, a return to comical Calvary where the zealots of organized religion take a slam, where it is up to the viewer to decide the writer's and actor's motives for taking potshots at the most holy of sacrifices ever made. To the writer's credit, they chose not to focus directly on Jesus, and created typical Python onlookers to historical events.<br/><br/>Like Mel Brooks and his only history of the world, the Python gang strives to get the period detail right. The only detail is in the style of comedy, and while it often feels like there should be a laugh-track, a sense of awe takes over, especially with a very Bond like opening theme sung by Shirley Bassey sound-a- like Sonia Jones. The British accents of the cast properly spoofs all of those epics of the 1950's and 60's where it pretty much seemed that all you had to be was trained in the British theater to be cast in a biblical epic.<br/><br/>Of course, Monty Python cult followers can quote every line, and I feel if the Christians who protested this were to watch this, they'd see that it is the religious epic genre that's being spoofed, not Jesus being ridiculed. It just makes me wish for a similar film spoofing ""The Ten Commandments"", a classic epic that takes a lot of ribbing in the first place. Granted, some of the humor is crude, but to paraphrase the popular theme song, ""Life's a piece of (enter brown word) when you look at it"", so sometimes a bit of crudeness can appropriately describe a situation like this that no other way could."

You will understand the world, and how it operates, better if you see and understand this movie.<br/><br/>In the closing scene, with Brian on the cross, the movie ends with the song ""Always look on the bright side"". Well taking this idea further, you will realise that the movie ends happy for Brian, though not shown. You see, Judith, his lover, knew that he was on the cross, and had not been released, as the order from Pontus Pilate was. All Judith had to do, was to point out this to the Romans, and they like to follow orders, and because she loved Brian, it is easy to assume that she would realise this and tell the Romans about this order not being fulfilled. Thus eventually he would be saved."

","This movie lived up to the expectations that come with bearing Monty Python's title and even exceeded them. While perhaps playing second base to ""The Holy Grail"", ""Life of Brian"" was a hysterical look at the time of Jesus' crucifixion, and is driven by a clever, yet simple, driving plot. The ridiculousness of the comedy is what truly makes Monty Python films, and the plot of this masterpiece was utterly ludicrous. This is not to mention the absurd understatement of moments, childish laughter at profanity, and hyperbolic stupidity of characters. Like most comedies of the era, though, ""Life of Brian"" is marred by cliché and cringe-worthy, corny jokes. While this suits Monty Python perfectly, and cannot be considered cliché due to Monty Python's role in bringing such comedy to the mainstream, it is a little bit painful to watch at times from the modern age. Nevertheless, ""Life of Brian"" is hilarious British comedy at its finest, mocking a part of history that films today seem to lack the courage to even touch. Few films make a mockery of religion and the Jewish people of the first century like this one does."

"ElMaruecan82","10","0","1","16 August 2016"," The Prime of Monty Python ...
","1969 was a great year for British comedy, the Benny Hill Show started and so did Monty Python's Flying Circus, marking the debut of the surreal comedy group featuring, in order of heights, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and the two Terries, Gilliam and Jones, and they were so groundbreaking they made the word 'Pythonesque' exist.<br/><br/>But let's still play with numbers, 1969 was the debut and sadly, in 1989, untimely passing of Graham Chapman, marked the end of an era and annihilated any chance for further reunions. So the number '9' is pretty significant in the history of the group, and it's all fitting that the year that goes in-between constitutes the prime of Monty Python, because it was the year of ""Life of Brian"" and because, I believe this is the film that expressed their yearning to irreverent, absurd, surrealist but ultimately intelligent comedy to the fullest. And I put the emphasis on 'intelligent'.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is commonly know that 'drama' appeals to the heart, while 'comedy' appeals to the intellect. We love to laugh because the mechanism that allows us to do so pass by the brain, and you can't fool it nor take any shortcut, it's a hit-or-miss, So it all comes down to one thing: if something makes people laugh and think, then if it doesn't make you laugh, think of the reason first. Obviously, ""Life of Brian"" didn't make everyone laugh, because scholars, religious, Catholics thought the movie made fun of Jesus. Well, if one thing, the film is about Brian, not Jesus, Jesus only shows up twice in the film and he's never mocked or ridiculed, his divinity seems quite undisputed on the contrary.<br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" is irreverent and has a rather nasty attitude toward religion, but let's make our brain work a little. I discovered the movie in Latin class, because the teacher wanted to show us the ""Romane, Ite Domum"", moment (which was grammatically accurate) and it was so hilarious we asked him to let the film play for the rest of the hour. I finished the film later, but I owe my discovery to Latin, so it's all fitting that Latin makes me understand the movie too, and here's how. Religion comes from two Latin words: 'relego' as reading a second time, and 'religo': assembling people. And this is what religion is about, interpreting things (reading again), and finding a sort of mystical strength and communion in unity.<br/><br/>For the 'relego', you have the emblematic sequence of Bryan being taken for a prophet and no matter what he says, or he leaves behind, even a shoe, people keep on finding reasons to sanctify him. If he on an old man's foot and breaks his vow of silence, the crowd shouts: ""it's a miracle"", and they're ready to lynch the old man when he starts hitting Bryan. This is the 'religo' effect on crowds, and ""Life of Brian"" is perhaps the only film featuring a dialogue between one person and a crowd. And when people shout all in unison ""we'll think by ourselves"", you have the maddening effect of religion, and perhaps the only one truth of the film: a crowd is incapable to be rational. And that doesn't apply to religion but even the Judean Front rebels kept insulting the Romans while incapable to think of one negative thing the Occupation brought.<br/><br/>That's exactly the sensitive subject ""Life of Brian"" is dealing with, it's not about Christ, it is about a context, a crazy contest where the value of one's life was so cheap people had to give a meaning to death, and vice versa. You have a foretaste with the hilarious stoning scene where most of the stoners, are women wearing fake beards, so not even women are immune to these practices. Nothing has changed much although civilization allowed people to wise up a little, but even religious guys should gentlemanly reckon that religion calls for more complex reactions than blind faiths, especially if these reaction make people laugh, and not even at the prophet, but just a misunderstood alter-ego.<br/><br/>The film was funny and intelligent enough not to mock for the sake of mocking; this is why I maintain that it is the prime of Monty Python. I read some commentators saying it wasn't as funny as they expected, or not just ""Holy Grail"". Well, ""Holy Grail"" was one of the funniest movies of all-time, so it would have been difficult to beat it only four years later, but ""Life of Brian"" was busy with a plot, it did rely on Monty Python's usual zaniness (a surreal alien space sequence, the bargaining part, Pilate's lisp to the belly-laugh inducing Biggus Dickus part) but it told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end (""Grail"" has the two thirds right) and it even afforded the luxury to include a romantic interlude and one dramatic performance, not the least because it's Graham Chapman's. As the titular hero, Chapman is really the straight-man of a world that turned crazy, and his performance is integral to the film's appeal.<br/><br/>While Chapman is the soul of the film (and the only member who doesn't go into hundreds of disguise) the other Pythons are perfect in their respective field, actors and director, and the one with a little more musical talent provided the film's (or the groups') upbeat signature song and one of the most memorable movies' endings. It is ironic in the context of the film, but while they're singing, and whistling, we can't help but think of it as a happy ending, because indeed, we should always look at the bright side of life and so should the critics.<br/><br/>And maybe this is the second truth of the film. The song would be later performer during Graham Chapman's funeral and only the Pythons could make a sad event such a joyful moment, and this the intelligence of the heart."

","The Monty Python boys have had their ups and downs – mainly within their ranks, while their output has remained pretty solid – from revolutionising TV comedy with their surreal and 'anything can happen' way of doing things to their big-screen epics (and by that I mean 'The Holy Grail' and, of course, 'The Life of Brian' (notice how I kind of forgot The Meaning of Life – which is basically a sketch show where some scenes work better than others).<br/><br/>I was pretty young when Brian hit the cinemas and I didn't know anything about it – only that I wasn't allowed to watch it (not just because I was about fifteen years too young) but because my local cinema refused to show it and you had to drive to the next town to see it. Yes, it's that (allegedly) controversial. The reason being is because it makes fun of Jesus/Christianity. Only it doesn't. That's basically what people who didn't see it and didn't want to like it said about it. Yes, it is set during Jesus' time (and Jesus himself is never ridiculed, shown only twice – once as an infant surrounded by angels the way you'd see in any nativity play and once on a hillside, preaching to his numerous followers).<br/><br/>No, Life of Brian – as you may have guessed by the title – is a film about Brian – just an average guy of the time who becomes hopelessly out of his depth when he's accidentally mistaken for the messiah. What follows is typical madcap Monty Python humour. No, it never makes fun of Christianity, only the way things (in that time period) can be misinterpreted and distorted into what others want them to be.<br/><br/>If you like Monty Python – you'll love this. If you like comedy – you'll like this. If you haven't seen it yet and have an appreciation for satire – you'll also love this. There are so many classic scenes and phrases that you've probably already heard and yet never known where they come from contained within. There's hard to pick a stand-alone performance from the cast – John Cleese's height and general loudness puts him up there, but, seriously, it's well and truly a team effort.<br/><br/>Life of Brian is one of those rarest of films – one that stands up to the tests of time and is still as relevant and funny today as it was when I wasn't allowed to watch it. Brian may not be the chosen one, but this film certainly should be."

","I love British humor, and Monty Python in particular. I can take 10 episodes of ""Are you being served"" in a row. Even MP's lesser works, like ""Holy Grail"" still tickle my fancy. So take that 8/10 with the corresponding grain of salt.<br/><br/>Treating the life and times of Christ with a touch of comedy is not an easy task. MP came up with the perfect solution by chronicling instead the inglourious basterd born next door, Brian. Brian's life in many ways parallel's Jesus - and in some others, not.<br/><br/>MP is known for short sketches, and really this movie is just a concatenation of brilliant sketches, but so well fused together, that it stands as a full-length feature comedy chronicling the life of a mistaken prophet on his way to crucifixion. It is populated by the most funny characters, like a lisping Pontius Pilate, who revels in telling his soldiers about his friend ""Biggus Dickus"" and his wife ""Incontinentia Buttox,"" throwing them to the lions if they dare laugh. In this inimitable scene, as in many others, it is not the relative lame joke that brings down the house, but the way it is relentlessly built up even more, just when you think it's had its 15 seconds of fame. Sometimes more is ...more!<br/><br/>The film is a not-so-hidden diatribe against religious zealotry, feeble politicians, and that most dangerous thing, mass opinion, which is all too easily manipulated as Alex de Tocqueville has taught us.<br/><br/>The sets are surprisingly good for such a comedy production, as many were left over from another biblical film and reused. This works extremely well in the film's favor, as it juxtaposes the slyness and buffoonery of its characters against a very believable backdrop. And who can complain about some Mozart sacral music in the background?<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best comedies ever filmed, almost in a league with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" which is high praise from me because I am an even bigger Kubrick fan than MP fan."

But he's not, and the comedy troupe have instead set their sights on everything from the Romans and blind worship to Hollywood biblical epics. Mostly the Romans. They even slap Pilate with a speech impediment. It possesses a biting satirical wit that brings a smile to my face - especially in a movie that includes full-frontal and a zealous John Cleese; that guy's a can't-lose proposition).

","classic, great classic movie with fantastic characters Life of Brian"" is really more about movies than about religion: It finds its origins in those countless Biblical epics where Roman legions marched up and down while intrigue waxed hot and heavy in Pilate's inner court. The movie is the most ambitious project yet for the Python people, but had its inspiration, no doubt, in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" which took on the King Arthur legends The approach is much the same: The Python personalities are plugged into a set of historical movie clichés, and then the situations are treated with the utmost logic. What would have happened at your typical pre-Christian stoning? How did women find out what was going on when they were allegedly banned from public meetings? What if Pontius Pilate spoke with a lisp? A few slight lapses in reality are permitted, to be sure, as when Brian falls from a high tower and is saved by an alien spaceship that happens to whisk by at that very moment"

And keep on wondering ""what the hell is going on""? But it doesn't matter what the hell is going on. It just keeps on happening in a direction-less direction. And you are bound to go with it.

","It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time.<br/><br/>I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction.<br/><br/>Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy.<br/><br/>Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's ""Biggus Dickus"" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. <br/><br/>I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10"

The bit that always makes me laugh without fail is something that isn't always noticed - when Michael Palin is having a go at the guards; ""Do you find it risible when I say the name of my friend Biggus Diccus ?"" if you look carefully you'll see that Palin is trying really hard not to laugh.<br/><br/>Puerile, silly but also very very clever. This film doesn't criticise religion or Jesus in any way ( what was wrong with the people who tried to ban it ? ) - it's just asking what it could have been like in a society that was expecting the Messiah to show up at any moment, and covering it in a massive coating of comedy.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute classic"

","During the Easter season, there are many movies one may watch as a tradition. Movies like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and THE PASSION OF THE CHRSIT may come to mind. We have a tradition in our family of watching a very unlikely Easter movie - THE LIFE OF BRIAN. Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, also known as THE LIFE OF BRIAN, is a 1979 British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team. It tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Graham Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.<br/><br/>The film contains themes of religious satire which were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate (effectively preventing the film from being shown, as the distributors said the film could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate). Certain countries banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The film makers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters stating ""So funny it was banned in Norway!"". By today's standards though the humor is considered fairly tame.<br/><br/>The film was a box-office success, grossing fourth-highest of any film in the UK in 1979 and highest of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular since then, receiving positive reviews and being named 'Greatest comedy film of all time' by several magazines and television networks.<br/><br/>Brian Cohen is born in a stable a few doors from the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian grows up an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the Peoples' Front of Judea (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other rather than the Romans.<br/><br/>After several misadventures (including a brief trip to outer space in an alien spaceship), and escaping from Pontius Pilate, the fugitive winds up in a lineup of wannabe mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian babbles pseudo-religious truisms, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a ""miracle"". After slipping away from the mob, Brian runs into Judith, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Brian opens the curtains to discover an enormous mass of people outside his mother's house, all proclaiming him the Messiah. Appalled, Brian is helpless to change their minds, for his every word and action are immediately seized as points of doctrine.<br/><br/>Neither can the hapless Brian find solace back at the PFJ's headquarters, where people fling their afflicted bodies at him demanding miracle cures. After sneaking out the back, Brian finally is captured and scheduled to be crucified. Meanwhile, a huge crowd of natives has assembled outside the palace. Pilate (together with the visiting Biggus Dickus) tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the decision of who should be pardoned. The crowd, however, simply shouts out names containing the letter ""R"", in order to mock Pilate's mispronunciation. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, since the name contains the letter ""R"". Pilate then agrees to ""welease Bwian"".<br/><br/>The order from Pilate is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a moment parodying the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be ""Brian of Nazareth"" and the wrong man is released. Various other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as, one by one, his ""allies"" (including Judith and his mother) step forward to explain why they are leaving the ""noble freedom fighter"" hanging in the hot sun. Condemned to a long and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who break into song with ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life""..."

","The film Life of Brian was released in 1979 and was one of the best comedies of its time. The director of the film was Terry Jones. Actor Graham Chapman plays the main character Brian Cohen, as well as two other characters, and was also one of the writers of the film. While this film may be considered controversial to some, the movie is a comical story about man named Brian who was born next door to Jesus Christ. The film tales a tale about religious stories and history and is a hilariously funny at times. Most actors portray several roles, using costumes and props to add to the overall humor. <br/><br/>The theme of the film seems to be to poke fun of some of the aspects of religion and history, while also showing how life would be if one were mistaken as the messiah. Brian Cohen was mistaken as the messiah both as an infant and an adult. This places him is several overly amusing situation. For instance as a newborn, Brian is located right next door to baby Jesus and is visited by actors John Cleese, Michael Palin and Brian Cohen (Three Wise Men). The three wise men mistakenly visits Brian and give him gifts; however the characters immediately return to retrieve their gifts, once they realize their mistakes. A recent movie that has a similar theme to Life of Brian is Year One, featuring actors Jack Black and Michael Cera. The movie is a witty comedy that is based on the cave man era. The movie uses overly funny hysterics which is similar to Life of Brian to tale a story of two cave men, who run into biblical characters while overcoming several obstacles.<br/><br/>The angles and lighting of the Life of Brian play an important role to the theme. During the film many of the actors play several roles, this means that they are typically in some form of a costume. It is important for the camera catch them at the right angles, so that the costume alters their identity. The lighting also adds to the theme. While it is also important for the actors it is also a factor when it comes to the time period of the plot. The story is set in the A.D era which means there was no electricity and all the light stemmed from natural light and fire. This sets the tone of the theme.<br/><br/>The overall theme to the film is simply comedy. The movie is not meant to tell the tale of Jesus Christ or the Romans; it is simply a comedy that uses history and biblical characters as its setting. As long as one can be open minded, the film will achieve its comical goal, which seems to be an influence on comedy's today."

'Life of Brian (1979)' was the second of three original feature films by the Monty Python troupe (not counting 'And Now for Something Completely Different (1971)', which was a compilation of sketches from the TV show remade for theatrical consumption). The other two films – 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' and 'The Meaning of Life (1983)' – I'd watched back in 2006/2007, and found them not lacking in wry British humour, though I hardly considered them masterpieces of the highest order.<br/><br/>I feel about the same about 'Life of Brian.' On the plus side, it really digs its heels into religion, with the crowds of Brian-worshipping disciples chasing the hapless hero (played by Graham Chapman) through the streets, interpreting his lost sandal as a divine gesture, and celebrating the presence of juniper berries as a miracle. The film is certainly less off-the-wall than 'Holy Grail,' with an abridged role for Terry Gilliam's distinctive animation, and fewer self-referential flourishes – except for a bizarre Deus Ex Machina involving an alien spaceship that breaks Brian's tumble from a tall building. The two songs are fantastic, of course: the first a Bond-like ballad belted out with the bravado of Shirley Bassey, and the second a droll, cheery closer about the joys of accepting crucifixion."

It is classic British comedy at its best and is slight better than the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life as it is consistently funny throughout whereas the other 2 are a bit hit and miss. I really cannot understand the big fuss about the supposed anti religious theme. It is in my opinion simply making an inoffensive film to bring enjoyment to all.

My father also watched them with me and he always looked blank at the TV screen and probably wondered why I was rolling about the floor in fits of laughter. Of the people I have come across over the years who have seen the film they drop into two distinct groups the lovers and the 'just isn't funny' group. I genuinely cannot recall anybody saying it was a bad film and perhaps more relevant cannot recall anyone upset by the so called blasphemy. I am not interested in the acting or lighting or the other ingredients that go to make up the film.

Here we had a group of anarchic comedians who were not only hilarious, they were highly intelligent and educated. The perfect formula for pricking establishment egos.<br/><br/>In this movie we see every aspect of human institution being taken to the cleaners. There's dictatorial but dim Roman soldiers epitomised by John Cleese's centurion, steadfastly correcting the Latin grammar of a rebel's graffiti. There's oh-so-politically-correct tub-thumping Marxist plotters, obsessed with nomenclature and for whom holding meetings is the be-all and end-all of insurrection. There's the wonderfully-observed scene in which Brian - chased by adoring multitudes - drops his gourd and then loses his sandal, each of which are picked up and held as 'signs', and already we can see the mob splintering into two deluded factions of the same ideal, like Catholics and Protestants, Sunnis and Shias.<br/><br/>There's Brian's mum as a bigoted old fruitcake who comes out with a line that will surely prove to be as immortal as any from the gospel texts 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!' This isn't just a thoroughly deserved mockery of religion, it's a custard-pie in the face of human arrogance and vanity wherever it may be.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the funniest movies ever made.

Even the most religious or political person alive can't deny that this topic is as relevant today as it was when the film was first made. This world is full of fanatics. The movie is full of the gang's usual, well-argued fallacies. The Pythons really did their homework on this one. They make a complete mockery of serious geographical, religious and historical events and customs. According to Monty Python's history, many rejected Jesus as the Messiah because Brian was born in the stable next door. That's only the beginning of the confusion. Pontius Pilate has a speech impediment, Roman gladiatorial events have a children's matinée, Roman soldiers are Latin professors, and terrorists wanting to be freed from Roman bondage can't agree on why they hate Rome in the first place. This is Monty Python's most coherent and most controversial film. If you've got thick skin and don't get easily get offended, it's also their funniest."

Some may say it's blasphemous (or even, as one of the Pythons said themselves, ""It's not blasphemous, it's heretical"") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. As with the fantastic Irish comedy Father Ted, I think you have to be Catholic (or at least a Christian) to fully appreciate things like this.<br/><br/>I especially liked that they kept Brian as the straight character amongst all the insanely funny people creating something like madness around him. I think my favourite character in the entire film is Brian's mother, the Virgin Mandy. Right from the very first scene she (or, should I say, he? - Mandy is, of course, played by Terry Jones) is in, she has me in stitches. I still can't work out what animal she's doing an impression of when she says it's got horns during the visit by the three wise men, but that just adds to the comedy of the film for me. A special mention has to go - as well - to Michael Palin's Pilate.

A talented writing team bounced ideas off each other and fueled each other to really come up with a winner. The desert location filming really made this film, it would not have been the same on fake back-lot sets.

Popular culture has essentially caught up with this film, but it's still pretty good:  Graham Chapman plays Brian as a put-upon Everyman, and he comes across as very sweet and likable.

","I prefer Life of Brian to both the Holy Grail and the Meaning of Life, not least because it is one continuous, relatively coherent (to the extent that Python is ever coherent...) story rather than a collection of shortish sketches.<br/><br/>It's more than mindless fun, though. It appropriately ridicules some of the most important problems of humanity, such as the blind, unthinking adherence to self-styled leaders or ""messiahs"" (""I'm not the Messiah!"" - ""I say you are, and I should know, I've followed a few!""), the petty squibbling about the deeper significance of utterly insignificant things (his sandal left behind in the sand...), and how quickly religious bigots denounce those who don't quite share their own weird thoughts (""Kill the heretic!""). Brian's futile attempt to make them think for themselves is just SO spot-on: ""You don't need to follow anyone! You're all individuals!"" - (the whole crowd in unison:) ""Yes, we're all individuals!"" (Brian:) ""You're all different!"" (unison:) ""Yes, we're all different!"" (single, dissident voice:) ""I'm not..."" (that last line is one of my absolute favourites, in all its delightful absurdity.)<br/><br/>Another thing the film so aptly ridicules is the way in which ""liberation fronts"" or ""freedom groups"", who should have every reason to work together to achieve their common goal, will always argue and fight among themselves instead (the references to the Judean People's Front, the Popular Front of Judea, the Popular People's Front, and so on and so on...).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. It's not about Jesus at all - on the contrary, a Christian may well choose to see at as ridiculing only the false prophets (while a non-Christian like myself can safely see it as ridiculing ALL religious mumbo-jumbo...;-) ). And the crucifixion scene at the end is an absolute classic. Bottom line: Always look at the bright side of life! How can anyone (except the most ardent puritans steeped in the Dark Ages where having fun was supposed to be bad) take offense at such a pure and simple philosophy of life?"

","To wit, using Christianity as a stepping-off point, the Pythons take on all organized religion and apply their satirical examination relentlessly. The subject of the experiment, needless to say, is found wanting and disposed of almost as quickly as a few of Pilate's ""Pwaetowian guards"". Along the way, we are treated to aliens, complete breakdowns of communication (a favorite Python theme), i.e., ""Blessed are the cheesemakers..."", and, astoundingly, a hilarious lesson in Latin grammar!<br/><br/>Next to ""Grail"" this is the most-quoted Python movie. Its sets, performances, and script are extraordinary. Plus there's a gritty realism that seems to be beyond the grasp of Mr. Gibson and his current opus. ""Life of Brian"" is a believable story, space travel and all.<br/><br/>Not recommended for your fundamentalist friends. Then again...<g>"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","0","2","28 March 2004"," Best Comedy Ever!
","You don't get much better comedy than Monty Python.  There were four films and a couple of unofficial ones like Time Bandits and Erik The Viking but out of the four Python films Life of Brian is without doubt the greatest comedy along with Spinal Tap I have ever seen.   What I love about Life of Brian most is that it is a British film and it was a film that had done well over in the States and it was a chance for America to look at a British set of actors and see how funny and inventive they are, but they did try and get on the wrong side of people as well with the topic of Jesus.  What also I admire is how they are taking the Mick out of religion but it also has a good message to it whether people who religious liked it or not. But like The Passion you should look at it for a filmmakers point of view and not judge it on it's controversy.  The scene at the end where they are all on the cross and Brian just accepts what is happening and then another man behind him decides to sing `Always look on the bright side of life'.  I think that was the way of the Pythons to say to the world that no matter how much you take your life seriously you should always look on the better on things in life and that really kicks into me when the sing the song at the end.  Whether it was mean't to be like that I don't know but it makes you happy thinking it.   <br/><br/>Now to my favourite scenes, where do you begin with something so amazing. Well any scene involving the Roman emperor and his Big Dickus remarks will never stop being funny especially when he calls Brian `A Jewish rap scallion'.   And also any scene involving John Cleese.<br/><br/>A comedy marvel that gets funnier with every watch and if a comedy can do that then it must go in the books as one of the most inventive and original comedies ever which is what the Pythons were and what Life of Brian is and will be forever."

When well done, as here, there is not a moment when you can think of something potentially funny that the movie does not do - with the exception of the animated alien sequence which sends a chunk of the film crashing to earth with the flying saucer.<br/><br/>But the movie's laughs more than make up for that little lapse: the lone voice of dissent when Brian tells the masses that they are all individuals; the  crowd's wise conclusion that Brian's mother is a virgin, the crucifiction scene that manages to mock both Spartacus and every Christ story ever, the lisping Pilate, the People's Front of Judea - or is it the Judean People's Front...."

","A work of pure genius, this parody of the life of a humble carpenter's son, one Jesus Christ, was so controversial in its day that it was widely banned, resulting in some lovely publicity for what is a very tongue-in-cheek look at how messiahs are discovered rather than born.  Making the occasional serious point (honest!) 'those wacky Monty Python boys' produce a superbly crafted story of one reluctant messiah, thrown into a whirligig of revolutionary activity and Roman persecution.  The verbal and visual humour is fast and furious. Heartily recommended."
"acutler","9","0","3","14 February 2004"," Still underrated
","I love 'the Holy Grail' but it is still a very uneven film, which feels more like a set of good comedic sketches rather than a film. <br/><br/>
But Monty Python's ultimate success in the film genre is (in my opinion!) the Life of Brian.  It is easily the most satisfying film experience, a fantastic story, laughs all the way, but with a healthy dose of pathos and cutting observation that speaks as much to our weaknesses to-day as to the constant 'civilised' absurdities that repeat themselves throughout history.<br/><br/>So I was surprised to see that The Holy Grail is much more highly rated internationally than Life of Brian:  I assume this owes to its popularity in the States.  It is also fair to say that I am surprised that either film is rated at all outside of Britain, because comedy rarely travels well, and this is particularly off-beat, surreal juxtaposition of outrageousness with repression.  It is also Graham Chapman's finest hour, and the fact that this was one of the few times when he was entirely sober (totally the opposite of the Holy Grail) shines through in a consistent and moving performance that elevates the movie beyond 'just for laughs'.<br/><br/>It is often mistaken for having a dig at Christianity; however it (whether intentionally or not) lampoons fanaticism, faith, organisations, fate and historical accuracy.  I suppose if I was looking for a reason for it to 'offend' it would be that it implies that people needed a Jesus figure, and whether one existed or not, they were going to have one (even if it was Brian); but I am also certain that that was not the intentional message of the movie. I wonder whether it doesn't click with people who are keen on 'religious' TV channels, or the preacher culture? I certainly want to know others opinions.<br/><br/>Most importantly, however, is to not take this movie seriously, it is in the end a very funny comedy that can touch you, has loads of applicability (not allegory!), and improves with repeated viewings."
"EW-3","Null","0","3","30 January 2004"," A Very Funny Film, With a Couple of Flaws
","I recall how when this film first came out, it generated a lot of controversy. Being a devout Christian, I can easily see how it can offend someone, particularly if that person wishes to be offended. It not only uses the story of Christ as the basis for absurd comedy, it also alludes to a number of offbeat, and some would say sacrilegious theories about Christ (e.g., His mother Mary being raped by a Roman soldier, Mary Magdalene being His wife/lover). In fairness, however, the story clearly makes the point in the prologue scene that the character Brian is not Christ, if that should satisfy anyone.<br/><br/>Make no mistake- this film is a funny one. There are two scenes in particular that are absolutely hilarious. The first is the stoning scene, which I remember had upset some Jewish groups when this film was first released because of its repeated use of the word `Jehovah'. The second is when Brian is brought before a Pontius Pilate with a speech impediment, a role played with hysterically comic mercilessness by Michael Palin. I also liked the `What have the Romans ever done for us?' scene, and several others.<br/><br/>But the film is flawed, too. For one thing, the actors often go too heavy on the British accents, to the point where many lines are inaudible and many jokes are lost, at least to American ears. The Jones character (as the mother) starts to grate on you after a while, though he has some funny lines and moments. <br/><br/>The Terry Gilliam graphics, which were amusingly employed in The Holy Grail, don't fit in this story. The only thing that came to my mind when Brian was scooped up by that alien space ship was the theory promulgated in the early 70s by author Erik Von Daniken that many miraculous events discussed in the Bible were actually descriptions of encounters with extraterrestrial beings. Was that the point of this scene? If not, then what was the joke here?<br/><br/>Like in The Holy Grail, the troupe seems to have trouble finding a suitable ending for this film, although the ending for The Holy Grail was better than the ending here. While I am hard pressed to imagine how they could have suitably closed a story based on the life of Christ, a light ditty sung by a crucified chorus just isn't funny. I once saw an interview with Cleese who said that the point they were making in this scene was that maybe death isn't such a bad thing. I guess that comes through, but the scene doesn't work for me. But I can also see why they stopped the story where they did Â– making jokes about the crucifixion is bad enough; jokes about the resurrection would have gone too far in many quarters.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of these flaws, this is still a movie worth seeing. The extremely talented Chapman, Cleese, Palin, Idle, Jones and Gilliam, who adopted numerous roles in The Holy Grail, take on just as many, if not more, roles in this film. There are a number of perceptive story lines and gags injected into this story (e.g., the smoldering rivalry between the seemingly allied `People's Front of Judea' and the `Judean People's Front' guerilla groups). And the Tunisian sets ironically makes this one of the more accurate depictions of the Biblical era, as did The Holy Grail in its depiction of the filthy, disease ridden Middle Ages. All in all, The Life of Brian is worth a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon viewing."

","Life of Brian is clearly the Python's most solid feature film. Though it is still made up of sketches, each one is so superbly knitted into the next that a seamless strong narrative is the result. Terry Jones does a brilliant job at directing while all the members of the Python team seem to be giving their best performances ever. Graham Chapman is especially wonderful as Brian. <br/><br/>The Sermon on the Mount, the stoning, what have the Romans ever done for us and the Latin writing lesson scenes are my favourites. Some people at the time of the film's release condemned the film as blasphemous and so on, it was even banned in some countries. When one actually sits down to watch the film it is realised that it is nothing of the sort. Rather, it contains a very positive message of belief in one's self, to find the answers to life and religion without blindly following what others' tell us.<br/><br/>What a shame there is no modern day Monty Python around to give us even a hint of the greatness that those 6 guys did. Of course each has gone on to success as individuals, but as a team I doubt that they will ever be bettered. Comedy standards are so low today that the humour in Life of Brian is perhaps beyond the perception and understanding of younger audiences, who have all had their minds dulled by gross-out toilet humour 'comedy' films and tv shows. <br/><br/>And remember, ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy, now go away!"""

","As you know, when Life Of Brian came out in 79, there was a big hell storm of controversy and such, from churches and religious groups, shunning the ""anti-religious comedy"". And it is still looked down upon by religious groups to this day. OK, so there is a big musical number at the end of the movie involving people hanging on a bunch of crosses singing, but you will notice that in no way it makes fun of Jesus Christ. Crucifixion existed before Jesus did, so it's not fair to say that showing that scene is disrespecting Jesus Christ. It's all nonsense. And as for everything else in the movie, it's not like it's trying to say these events never really happened. Like at the very beginning of the film, the three wise men travel to Jerusalem to bring gifts to the virgin Mary's son, only they choose the wrong manger, the one next door to the infant Christ. Hmmm, no sign of any anti-religious message here. Or how about the scene when Jesus is giving the sermon on the mound, and a fight breaks out between two couples in the very back not being able to hear the message. Ummm, what's so bad about this???

As I write this 1979 is 24 years ago, and 24 years is a long time, but ""Life of Brian"" does not apply to that time scale anyway.<br/><br/>Monty Python stands out in history as the group bringing comedy to an entirely new level. Everyone seems to have at least one favorite movie, scene or one-liner that has stuck through the years. The TV-series are still aired at times as well as the movies, and every time I watch them they make me laugh as much as they did the fist time.<br/><br/>Numerous comedians and groups have tried to copy the very special Monty Python humor throughout the years, but no one even comes close of succeeding, I think not even the sometimes reunited Pythons themselves to be honest. Yes, the humor is both utterly stupid and silly but also intelligent and cunning at the same time, without using cheap slapstick tricks. It is, in one word: unique.<br/><br/>The story in ""Life of Brian"" is simple. A newborn in the stable next to the one where Jesus is born is throughout his life repeatedly mistaken for being the Messiah.

There are brilliant cliches such as Pilate's 'R' trouble(welease Wodewick!) and all the people never ceasing to follow Brian. Sure, it's based on the Bible, but so what? There's nothing in it that denotes Christ. I am a Roman Catholic, and I see nothing bad about this film. It's a laugh-out-loud comedy/satire and I suggest everyone see it if you haven't already.<br/><br/>There are many many jokes in the script, such as the names ""Bigus Dickus"", ""Incontinentia Buttocks"", ""Naughtius Maximus"", and ""Sillius Soddus"". Excellent choices! Just take the ""us"" off of the first and last names and you'll get a description of that person. I love the constant haggling, the part where the Roman soldier gives Brian a lesson on Latin grammar, and especially the part when Jesus is shouting the Beatitudes and Eric Idle keeps calling Michael Palin ""Big Nose."" ""Better listen, there might be a bit about 'Blessed are the Big Noses.'""<br/><br/>""Did you hear? Blessed are the Greek!"" ""No, it's the MEEK, blessed are the meek! Oh, that's nice isn't it?

It must have taken a while to have Terry Gilliam animate 3 minutes of film, frame by frame.<br/><br/>The food Brian is selling in the Coliseum (ocelot spleens, wolf nipple chips) is strictly labeled by the People's Front of Judea as 'roman tidbits' ""Why don't you sell proper food?""<br/><br/>I'd have to say that my favorite character, besides Pontius Pilate, is Brian's cynical mum, Mandy(he's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!).<br/><br/>As for the lot of you who in the '70s got really mad at the Pythons, i don't get your complaints.

"K-Slicer","8","0","3","12 December 2002"," Brian is a small satire with some bite
","It's about time I wrote my defense to what I stated earlier and in here spoilers will be contained.<br/><br/>I did watch the opening scene.  I thought it was hilarious and downright funny.  I loved the way the Wise Men mistakenly went to the wrong place. Brian's mother tried to keep the gold with minimal success.  I know that wasn't Jesus lying in that manger, it was Brian.  Throughout the rest of the movie, Brian keeps finding himself intersecting the path of Christ wherever he went.  His story is more of dumb luck/fated consequence unlike Christ's story.<br/><br/>Let me make this clear.  This is satire/comedy and I know it is satire/comedy.  For me though and me only, I was horrified by the last third of the film.  I personally hold Jesus Christ on a pedestal like many others do and they do want to see anything bad happen to him.  Imagine someone took a person, object or issue you personally held close to your heart and satirized it.  It could be very hard for you to view.  I love satire on organized religion as much as anybody else but I personally feel that the life and spirit of Christ cannot be contained in someone's interpretation (forming one's own religion based on teachings and life of Christ) so I find the satire hard to watch.  Christ has many, many, many followers and they dearly respect them.  I truly understand why they were up in arms back when ""Life of Brian"" was released.<br/><br/>I understand satire to be a creative commentary on some particular issue. The user who broke my comments down suggests that I didn't know that this was a satire.  Satire needs a basis and the Four Gospels were the basis for it.  Like I said earlier, it is hard for me to deal with that (I guess I am opening myself for being targeted, so fire away!).  On other subjects, I don't mind satire but when it comes to Christ's life as the basis and even though he is not the central character, I find it hard to swallow.<br/><br/>One more thing, I never suggested that we return to the Inquisition.  I would want to strangle myself I ever suggested that.  My point was along the lines of banned work.  Works like ""The Divine Comedy"" were banned because they suggested things that went against the Catholic Church and ""Life of Brian"" is a direct challenge (whether they meant it to be or not:  I am thinking not!) to the authority at that time if it had been released at that time.  Since ""The Church"" was in charge at the time, they did not have a sense of humor and people were savagely tortured to the point of death (the boys of Monty Python could have suffered like that).  I am suggesting that the world in our own time is more accepting of to the thoughts and words of satirists and comedians than ever before.  The Inquisition was retributive in ways I cannot fathom.  The methods they used that I can fathom make me want to die.  I would bury myself in a garden plot with a funnel over my mouth to breathe as just a small punishment for suggesting ""a return to the 'good ol' days of the inquisition'.  The Inquisition was as bad as those suffered under the likes of Amin, Pinochet, Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler (insert others here if you can think of any).  May The Inquisition Forever Stay Dead!!!<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I find ""Life of Brian"" to be a funny movie for the first 2/3 and it heads steadily south by the end on my above reasoning.  I think the boys of Monty Python have created a comedy/satire that will forever stand the test of time.  Many, many, many movie lovers love this movie. I think it is a great comedy myself in several ways (jokes, writing, direction, acting are well-done).  As a movie, it entertains but as a satire it fails.  I give this movie 8 out of 10!<br/><br/>PS:  Jesus Christ has whethered satire before and people have cheapened the Crucifixion and Resurrection in ways I cannot imagine and those cheapenings have been much worse.  All in all, ""Life is Brian"" is somewhat small in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>Here ends my rant!"
"hoorayformikereed","Null","0","2","30 November 2002"," Brilliant, One Of The Best Comedies Of All Time
","Here's something we don't see too often. A satire that is actually intelligent. Life Of Brian is thoughtful, insightful, transcendental and original. Oh yeah, and it's a laugh riot. You are guaranteed some good laughs from this movie, unless you are particularly dull or particularly religious, in either case you really shouldn't be watching it anyway.<br/><br/>If you are open-minded, however, you will find a movie that is as smart as it is funny. The movie opens on the eve of the first Christmas. The three wise men make their way across the desert to the small town of Bethlehem. There, in a lowly stable, they find a small child wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. Unfortunately, they got the wrong kid. Jesus is a few doors down, and they're kneeling at the feet of Brian.<br/><br/>The movie persues this question further as the movie goes on. What if, in mankind's search for a savior, we got the wrong man? What if we bestowed our faith and trust in someone who didn't want it in the first place? Through a series of events, Brian (Graham Chapman) grows up to join an extremist anti-Roman group, the People's Front of Judea. While trying to escape a group of pursuing guards, Brian disguises himself as a cornerside soapbox preacher. This backfires when a crowd gathers and quickly decides that he is the Messiah.<br/><br/>This concept is ripe for satire and the Pythons don't miss a beat. When Brian loses a shoe trying to escape, the throng instantly declares it a holy relic, and just as quickly gets into an argument on whether it's a shoe or a sandal. When told that they are all individuals, a large crowd agrees in unison. Brian's fans ask him how to think for themselves. The real message of Life Of Brian is that people should decide for themselves what to believe, instead of blindly following what is forced upon them. A message of peace is also delivered. As Python Eric Idle said on the release of this movie, ""Jesus said all these beautiful things about loving and caring for others, and people have killed each other for years about what he said, how he said it, etc.""<br/><br/>Of course, all this would be out of context without humor, which Life Of Brian dolls out in bowlfuls. Particularly funny is the character of Pontius Pilate, who speaks with a speech impediment that renders him unable to say the letter ""R,"" which of course, seriously undermines his authority. Also memorable are scenes involving a public stoning, a lesson in haggling, and of course, the unforgettable closing musical number, ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life."" That's good advice, and mine is to start by picking up Life Of Brian.<br/><br/>(****/****)"

As one grows older, the true nature of the comedy reveals itself however.<br/><br/>This is a movie with a message in it, and the message is ""beware"".... or rather, the message is think about your life, think about who you are and follow yourself. Believing in something is fine... just don't follow blindly.

","SPOILERS ALL OVER IT<br/><br/>Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" is one of the funniest (and smartest) comedies ever. It deals with the story of Brian Cohen, a jewish man, contemporary of Jesus Christ who, when he discovers the fact that his father was a roman, joins a group of roman-haters who are trying to bring down the empire. While he's trying to do this he's captured and gets confused with the Messiah and crucified.<br/><br/>It can be watched a hundred times you'll always find a new joke. What seems to be pure nonsense in some parts is instead a quite significant joke. And, of course, there's also pure nonsense (the sci-fi part).<br/><br/>Although it's a parody of the classic epic Rome movies, it's not built as a parody. It's actually a well-done epic movie turned into a savage joke. Some parts put your sense of humor in trial. Are you capable of laughing at Ben the Prisoner, or at the Jewish Suicide Squad? Python's message is: do it!<br/><br/>""Life of Brian"" is, for me, a cult movie and its teachings are my only religion.<br/><br/>SAY NO MORE"

","Monty Python are the grand masters of silliness, something they have elevated to an art over the course of numerous skits, shows and now a second feature film. For all the madness on display throughout this insane film, their greatest joke is that they have managed to create a genuine and priceless work of art.<br/><br/>Life of Brian tells not the story of Jesus of Nazareth, but of the kid down the street, born on the same night in one of many hilarious twists on the the gospels. We catch up with him in his early thirties, as he gets caught up in religious fanaticism, terrorist plots and Roman repression. This sounds like the outline to a gritty historical epic, and Life of Brian's greatest strength is that it sticks pretty closely to a certain formula while exploiting the utter fundamental ridiculousness of every single situation, with an all-encompassing generosity that leaves nobody unscathed: organized religion takes a heavy hit, as do the feckless occupying Romans.<br/><br/>The real genius of Life of Brian is that everything works on at least a dual level, and what is funny on the surface is often just as silly or even quite frightening at a deeper level. Consider one of the most classic scenes: women go to a stoning, a privilege their religion reserves to men, so they all buy fake beards in order to attend and participate... except all the actors playing women are played by men! So in that one representative example you have a biting indictment of religious double-standard, an unparalleled level of silliness, and some meta humor, all neatly bound together. The film glories in its own madness with such glee that it even manages not to rub your face in how clever it actually is, a very rare gift indeed!<br/><br/>In this age of religious tension and political correctness, it is all the more precious to have a voice cry out and throw such well-aimed mud in all directions without discriminating. To so while being so entertaining is even more remarkable. <br/><br/>This is essential viewing. Not only will it make you cry with laughter - one of the real pleasures worth living for - it will also raise important questions. And, however you choose to answer those, you will always have that unlikely staircase chase ending in an alien abduction, something so stupid even the Pope would have to crack a smile."

","A few comments on this movie while addressing the comments of a few other reviewers:<br/><br/>""Whether or not someone thinks ""Life Of Brian"" is a direct attack on Christ or just a really stupid and/or funny parody, if the Monty Python boys released this back during the Inquisition they would have been strung up by their toenails and whipped horribly.""<br/><br/>So, what are you advocating here? A return to the ""good ol days"" of the inquisition? This is PARODY/SATIRE. They clearly establish that this has NOTHING to do with Jesus from the very beginning. Pull your head out of your ass.<br/><br/>""Jesus Christ is the most revered person in all of human history and it is hard for me to watch a parody of his life.""<br/><br/>I'll say it again, this isn't Jesus.

","Don't let the more fanatical Python acolytes fool you that the duration of ""Life of Brian"" is ALL tea and biscuits, but it's certainly a more ORGANISED affair than ""Holy Grail"", and, like that film, contains some truly ingenious moments.  I have the nagging feeling that the production values were perhaps TOO good on this one, though, as such lending the film an inappropriately solemn feel even as you're doubling up on the floor laughing at one of the team's astute observations.  I suspect if the Pythons were at their peak today, the resulting 'spoof' would have been much sharper and less gentle.<br/><br/>  Still, who really has the right to complain when such gems as ""Blessed are the Cheesemakers!"" are still present?  It is this and many other classic moments that make this a joy to watch time and time again, even if its more devoted fans may have fallen victim to the very thing the film lampoons - hailing the wrong Messiah.  It's top drawer comedy for those who don't unrealistically expect the Second Coming before viewing."

"JumpingBean","Null","0","2","2 July 2000"," Great extras on this Python DVD
","THE LIFE OF BRIAN has remained one of my favorite Python flicks after the glow of the Holy Grail began to wear thin from overuse. If you're considering purchasing this movie, you've probably seen the movie already and are a Monty Python fan. If not, get ready for one of Python's most sacrilegious and hilarious movies of their collection! If you are easily offended, you might think twice. However, the satire here is equally distributed and is not aimed so much at religion itself but moreso at the amusing ways in which people can behave ""under the influence"" of zealotry.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed rewatching the movie, but it was a great surprise to find that this DVD comes packed with some great bonus materials. Several full-length, revealing interviews with the cast go into more Python history than just that surrounding this flick. And a rather large collection of scenes cut from the final release are also quite interesting.<br/><br/>The video and audio quality seem to be on par with most of the other DVD movies I've seen so far, despite the film's age.<br/><br/>All in all, a great addition to any Python collection."

","I remember seeing this film as a seventeen year old when it first came out. There were christians picketing outside the cinema, which just added to the notoriety. I was eagerly awaiting this film and I wasn't disappointed. I don't think I'd ever laughed so much in my life and i don't think I ever will.<br/><br/>This was the Monty Python team's masterpiece. Now, understandably as aging men they continue seperately making tame comedies, but this cannot diminish the laughter they created when they were at their zenith.<br/><br/>I too, am older, and the teenage rebellion seem a long time ago. But whenever I watch this film, it still raises a chuckle, not quite like the raucous laughter it induced when I first saw it, but enough to remind me of why I found it so funny. I have seen nothing approaching it, in terms of comedy in the ensuing twenty years.<br/><br/>It may not be as fresh and innovative as it was in '79, but if you still haven't seen it, you may still be able to detect why we laughed so much and why so many people commenting here regard it as the funniest movie ever made."

","The Life of Brian is one movie that is different from all the rest of Monty Python's total fair.  Not counting on the slapstick-ness of the Holy Grail, it puts in a new kind of satire on an old tale of time.  Then they make it offensive with their own wry satire and succeeding in it.  It's a triumph in those parts.  Here's an example of offensiveness: ""Do you think that there's anything wrong with the name, Biggus... Dickus."" -Pilate.  It has comedy in it's own game.  There's no other movie like it today, I still need to watch Dogma though.  But still, this is a great movie not to be passed up on at all.<br/><br/>Side note: As what controversy from Christian groups say that Life of Brian is offensive to them and Jesus Christ, Monty Python didn't have anything against Christians.  But that's another story."
"nebbin","Null","0","2","20 April 2000"," What happened?
","I saw parts of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" when I was younger, but couldn't get all of it. However, in recent times I have become more of an AD&D fantasy-mythology type fan, and since I had found a rare Monty Python book which I found funny, I decided it would be the best of both worlds and rented it. I really enjoyed it and rented ""Life of Brian"" when I returned ""Holy Grail."" I hate to say it, but something happened. Holy Grail was a series of related skits which met at the beginning and end to form a full story. Because of this, many wacky, outrageous adventures took place. They were all unbelievable silliness, like singing a goofy song in Camelot, killer bunny rabbits, a knight who attempts to fight even when all his limbs are severed, etc. But as soon as I began watching ""Life of Brian"" and got to the beginning credits, I knew I was in for something I didn't want. I tried not to let it get to me, and many parts of the movie were still funny, but not enough to keep the movie afloat. The only silly scenes in the style of ""Grail"" were the alien scene, which seemed more pointless than funny, and the singing crucifixion victims. There were a couple other scenes too, but the whole thing honestly reminded me of ""History of the World part 1,"" which I also didn't find funny.<br/><br/>I feel weird putting up a review like this amongst the flood of ""This is the funniest movie ever made"" reviews, but I'm stating my opinion. I will eventually re-watch it and maybe it will be better the second time(often this happens with me), but I really don't know how much it will hope. The movie simply seems to have the lost the magic and, well, what better word than ""zaniness"" the first had. Maybe it just had too much if a plot. Some of the other movies I've seen could well have used one, maybe they could have sold it to a more deserving film 8-)<br/><br/>All in all, I give it ** out of *****, making it slightly below average. I don't have it in my heart to give it any less, although I was going to give it *1/2, but that ranks it in the same rating with my opinion of Manos: The Hands Of Fate, and that's not very accurate. Still, if you are a fan of the Python troupe, you may as well check it out. I just wish I had known the public library is renting it for free when I paid for it."

However, it is unlike the gang's T.V appearances and Grail; it is not completely without plot! This film rips to shreds all religion and the stupidity of rulers I think that you must be atheist to be able to stomach the message.
