","Context.<br/><br/>You need context.<br/><br/>This review penned in 2017, some 12 years after the release.<br/><br/>In this period, Marvel and DC are at each other's throats, each trying to monetize every character, sub-character, plot device and dust bunny from their respective libraries. Regardless of merit. It is all about the dollars.<br/><br/>A story as pure as this one -- penned by Kevin Brodbin -- could never be done today because it lacks the setup for a dozen spinoffs and sequels, as well as the mandatory backstory and product placements.<br/><br/>Sporting two of the most charismatic and photogenic stars of all time, at the peak of their careers, we have a story with no bad lines, no lapses in the arcs, and no time wasted. Just pure, engrossing, film pleasure from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Yes, I know that it was not appreciated in its day. But the future is always the final judge."
"LAKERS34","8","115","137","25 July 2005"," Sorry...I liked it...
","This is a fable...it's not supposed to be so rooted in reality that we scoff at the implausibilities and the plot holes... We're not watching it to say ""look at how that happened"" or ""why is it all happening here in L.A. when we have these worldwide problems"" or...whatever... It has to happen somewhere; either you buy off on the fable and get into the story or you flush it...<br/><br/>While not being Catholic, through theological edification I was able to make sense of storyline, ironies, metaphors, etc... I liked Reaves' character and again, it's a matter of preference - love or hate - but he played Constantine's miserable demon-cop just right - Reaves continues to find rolls suited to his particular, dark style. Special effects were great, and I give the film kudos for not diving in and becoming an effects extravaganza...it remains online to the story and where we're going... Weisz as heroine and Peter Stormare as Lucifer himself were well-cast. What can I say? It was great diversion and a fun DVD to watch. Check it out!"

","This movie was really great in my opinion. If you like the horror/sci-fi genre then this is definitely for you. The effects are great and the make-up is exceptional as well. Keanu and Rachel really compliment each other in the roles they are in. I wouldn't expect something phenomenal but this genre of movies is rarely gifted with such a insightfully plotted movie such as Constantine.The character build is great and the background of the characters isn't completely clouded which is awesome, there's no feeling of confusion when it comes to whats going on. It seems in some scenes the director was going for a certain emotion which made it feel awkward but the action and reactions are nice. Keanu really came across as tough doomed and uncaring, while Rachel came across as determined and brave. There is no reason to not give this movie a chance, if it seems like something you would like, i recommend seeing it. The concepts and setups aren't something of the usual nature so its a welcomed change of pace. I don't rate this 10/10 because is was astounding and mind shattering, a movie of the century, I rate it 10/10 because it was enjoyable and i have watched it many times without feeling tired of it. The score and soundtrack are great as well, providing some depth into certain scenes. The contrast and colors are good, although looking a little too dark in some scenes. The movie takes you to many places, so there is no feeling that you are in one place, sometimes I feel that movies that take place in the same space create a feeling of urgency, not so in Constantine. Some enjoyable aspects is the historical tie ins and use of terminology. All in all, this is an exceptional movie, it moves from scene to scene with little dragging in one spot, and has a great ending."
"ivo-cobra8","10","88","108","17 November 2015"," The most highly anticipated supernatural horror film of my life!
","Constantine (2005) in my opinion is an underrated Comic Book Film and one of my favorite anticipated supernatural horror flicks of my life. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz reunite in this flick, after 9.years later when they both made together Chain Reaction (1996) one of my favorite sci-fi action flick. Anyway beside End of Days (1999) with Schwarzenegger in the starring role, Constantine is the only supernatural horror film that I know and like. After just watching this film I must say is a far way million times better than overrated The Exorcist (1973) that everyone highly praises that film. I love this movie to death and it is my fifth favorite best Keanu Reeves movie. John Constantine is iconic character that I think that Keanu Reeves did impressive acting performance, including way better job than he did in movies he is doing this days.<br/><br/>I love this film. It has nice, thoroughly believable action for this sort of supernatural fare, and attractive leads in the shape of Keanu & Rachel, supported by Tilda Swinton as god's right-hand, Gabriel (reprising her Orlando persona). It looks great too and does the merging of separate worlds (Earth and Hell) very well. Keanu plays an embittered exorcist with a 30 a day habit and some caustic barbs for anyone he runs into. Rachel Weisz enters as a cop with some private history of her own connected with the occult world, and soon the two of them are drawn towards apocalypse & hell on earth. It's a throughly enjoyable purchase if you like the big theme Good Vs Evil, with the usual blurring, devils, angels, and shotguns firing holy shot. The CGI is also up to scratch, which isn't something you can always say on films being made even in 2008. Very, very enjoyable so long as you appreciate the subject matter and don't expect massive gun-battles, stop frame kung-fu, bullet time etc. An absolutely superb film. Keanu Reeves plays his role perfectly to his characters identity. Interesting throughout I was gripped to this film from start to finish. One of the best comic adaptations without a doubt.<br/><br/>This is the type of comic book movie that I like to see; R rated, good action scenes, badass main character (and in Constantine case he sure is one considering that Devil himself will come to collect his soul), actors who actually do their job right, good direction, good score, no unnecessary bullshit subplots that are not needed and only extend the running time, great cinematography and visuals, and some decent practical effects. CGI maybe doesn't hold up but I personally don't have any problems with it in this case. My only problems with the film are again all the hate that it gets. I still don't get the hate for this film, I love the storyline , the action and the twists. Specially this is Keanu Reeves I see in here. 10.years ago he was a promise actor now he is a sold out washed up actor who just doesn't care about his fans any more. He keeps wearing long hair and he has a beard + he can't act anymore. Watch Knock Knock (20015) and you will see what I am talking about.<br/><br/>Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a man who has literally been to hell and back. When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister, their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.<br/><br/>That's the basic plot. It is more apocalyptic movie that means end of the world. Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) the archangel believes that by bringing Hell to Earth, humans can become worthy of Gods love through repentance and faith. The movie has everything, ghosts, demons, arch angels it even has Lucifer (Peter Stormare) in it. Rachel Weisz did a perfect outstanding job as female lead in this movie. I seriously love her performance and I love Keanu Reeves. Shia LaBeouf also did a perfect job as Chas Kramer, Constantine's friend and helper, I feel sad that he had to die by the end of the movie and his character was killed off.<br/><br/>Overall I am giving this movie 10/10 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it by critics or fans. The movie was fun and I have enjoy it!"
"Karilee","10","249","322","4 September 2005"," Constantine is another one of those movies that you either love or hate.
","And I loved it.<br/><br/>I just watched Constantine on PPV, and like all films, it does have its minor flaws, but overall the story was interesting, and the special effects were nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>Critics have been saying that Keanu Reeves' acting was horrible, but I disagree. Even though I can't deny that this wasn't him at his best, John Constantine is and angry and distant character, so Reeves couldn't display much emotion. All in all, he didn't do too bad. <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz was the star of the movie, giving a heartfelt performance. Gavin Rossdale was good, playing the bad guy card too perfection. And Djimon Housan, and Tilda Swinton were also great in their small roles. Shia LeBlouf, like Reeves, could have done a little better. Peter Stormare was perfect as Satan and my favorite character. He added a bit of humor to his demonic role.<br/><br/>There are some major differences between the comic book Hellblazer and the movie, like John Constantine was supposed to be British and resemble a rocker named Sting. But I've never read the comics, so I can't complain about these contradictions. But it seems to have the Hellblazer fans disappointed.<br/><br/>I do feel I should advise that this movie has nothing to do with Satanism. And to my knowledge, it was religiously correct. Save the part about demons and angels living on earth.<br/><br/>In the end, like I said before, you either love it or hate it. Simple as that.<br/><br/>my rating : 9/10"
"kingofchighs","9","36","44","4 August 2005"," Awesome Movie
","All the actors in it did an amazing job minus Shia LaBeouf who, as usual, did a crappy job in a crappy role. Gavin Rossdale has an excellent performance as Balthazar and plays the role to its fullest. Rachel Weisz also puts out an awesome performance. Heres where I will likely get flamed but...Keanu Reeves also played the part of Constantine to its fullest I believe. Many have said hes too ""Batman-ish"" however I disagree. Constantine is a man who knows hes doomed to spend eternity in hell. Anyone who's less giddy about it than Keanu acts in the movie would appear to be rather fake. I think he did a wonderful job and is still a great actor, even though he kind of flopped it in the second and third Matrix."
"bonnie91","9","196","267","5 May 2006"," Excellent fantasy/horror movie
","I've seen Constantine three times and I enjoy it more each time I watch it! It is truly well-done and extremely entertaining, and I can guarantee that if you like horror, suspense and/or fantasy you will love this movie! Keanu Reeves plays a very cool Constantine, who is a modern-day exorcist but most certainly not to be confused with a priest, as he has his issues and a burden of sins from his past that he carries with him. Constantine is a very realistic and human hero who is devoid of superpowers but has all the cool gadgets and the kick-ass attitude needed to survive in a world slowly being invaded by demons and scheming angels. He meets Angela (Rachel Wiesz) after she loses her sister, Isabel to the forces of evil. She comes to Constantine in search of an answer on where Isabel has ended up following her apparent suicide. Constantine journeys to other realms/dimensions in an attempt to get those answers, even paying a couple of visits to hell. Needless to say, with such a plot the special effects, acting, sets, script and even wardrobe have to be carefully conceived and executed to make it believable, and they are... in spades.<br/><br/>Constantine achieves what all great movies always do: it takes you into another world that makes you forget everything about your own world the whole time you are watching it. And really, in the end, isn't that what great cinema is all about?"
"kevinspaceysgrl","9","407","616","20 February 2005"," See it! You won't be sorry!
","""Constantine"" is a dark, yet dazzling film. A terrific story backed up by spectacular special effects and great cinematography pull us into a dark and dangerous world - a world where half-angels and half-demons whisper to us mortals as God and Satan use us as pawns in an apocalyptic game of chess. Cursed with ability too see these spirits, John Constantine finds himself right in the middle of this showdown.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves gives a fantastic turn as John Constantine. He infuses Constantine with a grim sense of purpose and dark humor. He is the ultimate anti-hero, and Reeves deftly takes Constantine from being someone we simply root for to someone we actually like and respect.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is terrific as well. Her tortured and soulful performance is the best of the film. Shia LaBeouf also blew me away.<br/><br/>I have not read the Hellblazer comics, but standing alone ""Constantine"" is a great film. This one is a must see!"
"lovtrekvist","10","143","209","28 June 2005"," Either you love it, or you don't
","Constantine is one more of those movies that are adapted from a comic series. Now, people in comics' stories often seem pretty wild in the eyes of watchers or readers. Just think of Batman. Isn't Gotham City crazy? Constantine, I think, is a most excellent picturisation of the comic stories. It is full packed with action, the story is quite entertaining, there is wit, the actors are amazing, the way of filming is great. Just watch these pictures and camera stills. Beautiful! Constantie is worth going to a movie theater. The pictures may blow you away. It is stunning.<br/><br/>Go and watch it, make your own point of view. ""My name is Constantine. Joe Constantine. ***"""
"marcos_oliva","10","156","229","16 May 2005"," Loved It!
","If you are a fan of Keanu Reeves then you'll love this movie. Of course, he plays a similar character to this other roles but so do most actors. I believe most actors are merely personalities and Keanu has a cool one at that.<br/><br/>The special effects were great and there were many picturesque scenes that will leave an imprint on your mind.<br/><br/>Even though I had never read the comic book I really appreciated this movie for it's religious theme. I think anyone can relate to the movie's notions of Heaven and Hell, good and evil.<br/><br/>The movie was funny, had just enough action, cool weapons, and breathtaking scenes. Most importantly, watching it, I easily felt transported into that world.<br/><br/>Great movie overall. I hope there is a sequel."
"CharmedAlice","8","291","456","21 February 2005"," Could've been better but still a fun ride!
","My first sort-of mistake was going to see Constantine at 11:30 A.M.; this would have been a much better experience in a nighttime atmosphere I feel. In fact, I'm thinking about going again this weekend at night.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoyed this movie immensely. For starters, I actually thought Keanu was quite good in the role, and it didn't take long to forget drawing comparisons to Neo. I haven't read the comics, but I thought Keanu did a great job with the role... I laughed and winced right along with him, not at him! All the supporting actors (yes, Shia LeBeouf included) were great, and my only issue is that they didn't get enough screen time to explore their characters further. Djimon Hounsou was especially cool as Papa Midnite... with a name like that, how can you not be?! Finally, Rachel Weisz deserves the ""better than the movie"" comments she's been getting in reviews. Yes, she is that good, and she's pretty foreign to genre work (but should definitely do more)! I can't believe I'd only seen her in About a Boy before this; her magnetism had almost got me to pick up Confidence and Runaway Jury at the video store (which I have not. Yet). For one, she does a damn good American accent - I had forgotten that she's British. I'm sure many other reviewers will put this in better words than me, but she really adds a whole new level to this movie. Her performance is easily the most daring and heartfelt of the bunch, and I'd even go as far to call it subtly exquisite... a phrase I don't hesitate to equate with the actress herself. If Rachel Weisz had not been a part of Constantine I wouldn't have liked it half as much as I did. Even if you're not a Keanu or genre fan, I'd still check this movie out if you (like yours truly ;) have a thing for gorgeous, talented under-the-radar actresses.<br/><br/>Onto special effects. Pretty darn impressive, if you ask me. NEXT! I'm definitely very tempted to check out the Hellblazer comics because I really love the mythology and style of the Constantine universe. I mean, Hell as a parallel dimension to our own world? How cool is that? Certainly less banal than most movie versions of Hell. The story is based around Catholicism, and it's just how I like my organized religion -- all twisted! All in all, Constantine was made up of a lot of things that I really love in my movies: detailed fantasy universe, fun characters, good effects and action, and of course, the vulnerable-but-butt kicking woman. Yay! The major problem with the film, I feel, was bringing all of its elements together. Throughout the film I kept thinking to myself what I would've done differently. There was so much crammed into it that every single character and plot point felt underused and ignored -- not one thing was explored deeply enough for my satisfaction. They should have chosen just a few elements of this complex universe and story arc for this movie and left the other stuff for subsequent Hellblazer flicks (which I hope there will be!).<br/><br/>So basically, the parts here are very interesting and cool and worth a look-see, but the whole just can't service all of them. Which is a damn shame. I left the theatre wanting MORE, wanting to know more about the characters and what living in their universe was like. MORE, darnit!! While Constantine is fun and nice in its own right, I would've really liked to see it expanded to its potential. Oh well! At least there's the fantastic Rachel Weisz, so I can't complain further ;) Last words: I want to see it again! Maybe not buy the DVD but definitely rent it. Oh, and those rumors about an extra (albeit short) scene after the credits are true, so STAY through them!"
"xBriarRose","7","117","184","26 March 2005"," Very well done, with great special effects.
","I have to say, I went to see Constantine because Shia LaBeouf is one of my favourite actors. This may have made me biased before I even entered the cinema, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film anyway! The plot is a little hard to follow especially if you don't listen and watch carefully for the clues. It centers around John Constantine (Reeves) who helps ""save the world"" from demons. He's not the usual sort of superhero because he is very reluctant to fit into that kind of role. The supporting actors are very well cast, and Rachel Weisz deserves all the praise she gets for her part. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel portrays the angel perfectly as not quite male or female. The film presents interesting views about heaven, hell and death, it's very thought-provoking. In a way, Constantine reminded me of I,Robot because it has a male lead who meets a female lead, and also has LaBeouf as sidekick again. But other than that this was a good film, and I think I will buy or rent it on DVD when it comes out. Here's a tip: wait until the credits ends, there is an extra scene!"
"kitormitsuug","4","327","568","8 February 2005"," OK eye candy but it's a disgrace to the comic book.
","Keanu Reeves plays the title character in this adaptation of the cult DC/Vertigo comic book called Hellblazer, and while the movie does have its merits, it's not very faithful to the source material that it came from. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a gumshoe whose specialty is in dealing with the occult. He specialty draws the attention of a police detective played by Rachel Weisz, who asks for his help in her investigation of her twin sister's suicide. A suicide that she thinks that is more than it appears to be. In due time, they both will encounter what lies under the surface of their world which is inhabited by both the angels of heaven and the demons of the underworld who are both fighting their own war for the fate of mankind. The movie is shot beautifully in the way it tries to capture both of the landscapes of good and evil that lives in this film's setting and the special effects does the film justice in its interpretation of hell that looks like an apocalyptic version of downtown Los Angeles, which is the setting of this film by the way. Unfortunately, the script is so unfocused that it hurts what this film trying to accomplish and the dialog itself lacks conviction for the material itself. The climax of the film is a major letdown because it just takes all the serious aspects of the film and just tosses them out in favor of a brief Matrix like a gunfight that undercuts the movie's tone and an incoherent ending that leaves more questions than answers. I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and he does his role well but his performance lacked something here in this film and it felt more phone in than genuine. Rachel Weisz on the other hand delivers a strong and moving performance that does deliver the goods but you will end up thinking that she is giving more to the film that it deserves because her performance is way too good for this movie. She's so good in fact that if the people who made this film wanted to make a faithful adaptation of the Hellblazer comic book, they could have cast her in the role of Kitt, Constantine's one true love. Now being a casual reader of the comic of whom this film is based on, the character of John Constantine is not well represented in this film and the script makes him look like a shill who wants to redemption which is the polar opposite of who the character is in the comic book who only served himself. The character also had a slick side to him that gave you the impression that he knew more than he let on while the character in the movie is flying by the seat of his pants during the whole film. Plus he relied on his wits to defeat his enemies while the character in the movie has a gadget man who makes him weapons (The brass knuckles scene in the movie is a joke because the John Constantine of the comic book can't handle himself well in a fight). The cancer subplot in the film only serves as a footnote while in the comic book, it had more of an impact and certain characters who show up in the film are just watered down versions of their comic counterparts. The most offensive of these characters is Chaz, who is John Constantine's best friend (and is a grown man with kids) but he is reduced to a street kid who is basically a lap dog for Constantine to pick on. The only character in the film that closely resembles the comic book is Papa Midnight, who's really more of an adversary in the comic than the friend he is in the movie. Judging this movie on it's own merits, It's a passable popcorn movie that has a better than deserved performance by Rachel Weisz. Judging the movie as an adaptation of the comic book, it's a letdown."
"angieray71367","9","24","35","26 July 2005"," Very Very Good
","Gosh, people spend so much time bashing Keanu Reeves. This film is actually quite good and the plot is quite good. Great special effects, enough religious creepiness to make to think, and a lot of action. Not quite as good as The Phophecy but damn close. Don't trust Keanu haters. It wouldn't matter how grand a film was, if he's in it they will trash it. Just rent the flick and judge for yourself. Yes, it's dark, and yes Keanu is wooden in his dialogue at times, but the movie is fantastic to watch. For anyone who has ever doubted religion, spirits, and our place in the world with them, then this is the movie to see. Great supporting cast, starting with Shia LeBouf who I like more and more with each role he takes on."
"jonathan-178","5","85","145","9 March 2005"," The Kind Of Film They Make You Watch In Hell
","3/9/05 As I sat staring at the screen, watching ""Constantine"", come to an end, I couldn't help but smile. Not because the film was just that brilliant, but rather it was that big of a train wreck.<br/><br/>This seems to be the time of year in which every studio agrees with one another to release their worst movies. So, I've spent the first two months of 2005 catching up on some of the Oscar nominees and other good films I missed from 2004. I passed up an advanced screening of ""Robots"" to go see ""Constantine"" at the theater with some friends. Sadly, this was probably the best choice out of everything playing at the theater, with the exception of ""Million Dollar Baby"".<br/><br/>Before I go into more detail on my opinions, let me preface by saying that I have never read the ""Hellblazer"" comic book(s) that this movie was supposedly based on. This review is a critique on the acting, directing, screenplay, etc of the movie, and it likely doesn't apply to the comic.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where to begin in recounting the plot of ""Constantine"". Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking, and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets. Rachel Weisz plays Angela Dodson, a detective who wants answers as to why her twin sister committed suicide. Through Constantine, she learns the truth about Heaven and Hell; Demons and Angels live on Earth in alternate space/time planes, always trying to win our souls. There's also shots mixed in every now and then of a random Hispanic guy wandering around Mexico and California with a staff that makes him invincible. This has something to do with the story, I think. Together they fight evil in a world where nothing ever makes any sense, and where Satan is a good guy who would never want to upset the balance of good and evil. It all comes tightly wrapped up with cliché after cliché and dialog so cheesy you will laugh out loud, and every now and then it transforms into ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves. We all know him, and we're all familiar with the standard roles he is cast in. This one is no different. He takes an unlikeable character and makes him even worse by being as dull and unemotional as possible. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel is just plain awkward, and the only somewhat redeeming bit of acting in this film is Rachel Weisz, who really isn't half bad.<br/><br/>This was Francis Lawrence's first try at directing a movie, and you'll know when you watch it. The root word in 'director' of course is 'direction', which was something this movie had none of. It was really no different than watching one of Lawrence's Britney Spears or Will Smith videos; just a bunch of random images thrown together. Characters came and went with no explanation of their relevance to the film, and there was no flow at all.<br/><br/>Visually, they got some things right. But how hard is that in these days when the right amount of money can make any effect you want? The depictions of Hell, Heaven, Demons, and Angels were good, and I suppose the Matrix style stuff was done well, even if it was unnecessary.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Constantine"" had a good concept. Appeal to those who want intelligence in a movie with religious theories and random babble. Appeal to those who want mindless action and dazzling effects by giving them just that. But in the end, there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention, and the depth the film supposedly had never showed up. It will have you trying hard to figure it all out, but I'm not so sure even the film's creators ever figured it out. There are certainly many movie out now that you could go see that would be much worse than ""Constantine"", but much of this film was nothing short of a disaster.<br/><br/>C- 5/10"
"cryingandlovingagain","4","206","371","11 February 2005"," Even with the strong and complex performance of Rachel Weisz, Keanu still finds a way to suck the life out of the movie.
","Decent yet very incoherent adaptation of the Hellblazer comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very bad performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. He not only sucks the life out of every scene he's in but manages to bring the film down to his level of acting in certain scenes. Director Frances Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it. I would have liked to have learn more about her character and her relationship with her sister, which would have been a much better movie than this film was if they just could have based the film around her character instead of John Constantine. Djmon Hounsou, who was so great in the film "" In America"" only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film. Peter Stormare, who was so great in the movies ""Birth"" and ""Chocolat"", gives quite an unusual take of the devil. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie very much at all. The special effects are good but the way hell is represented here is more a variation of the sets that was used in the film than something completely original. It's a decent film if you're in the mood for this kind of movie but I you will end up thinking that it could have been better once it's over."
"crisuslan","3","234","424","8 February 2005"," A major disappointment.
","I saw a press screening of Constantine a few nights ago in a screening room up here in Seattle and I have to say that the movie was a letdown. It tries to be a mixture of horror, suspends and action but it just ends up very incoherent in it's narrative and you just lose patience with it after while. Keanu Reeves is an OK actor but he's just going through the motions here and it shows by the glaring similarities it has to his work in the Matrix movies. It leaves you wondering on why he's even in the film in the first place because his character really adds nothing to the story other than the ridiculous climax where he turns the movie into a poor Matrix montage with him shooting up a hospital full of demons. Rachel Weisz on the other hand manages to give a very strong and realistic performance that could been used in a much better and serious film and Djmon Hounsou is decent in a glorified cameo that really does not use his talents to it's full potential. Shia LaBeouf is doing his lame and very unfunny slapstick to the hill and Satan himself looked like he just came from a lounge act in Vegas. The worse served by all of this is Tilda Swinton, who perhaps has the worse character in the entire film. A character that is not in the movie much in the first place but has a significant role in derailing the last act of the film with a plot twist that absolutely makes no sense at all. I do have to say that the special effects were pretty good and the hell dimension had it's charm but nether of them can compensate for a bad script that not only has some really bad dialog that makes some of the scenes in the film unintentional funny but has a plot development that makes no sense what so ever and has nothing to do with the story as a whole.<br/><br/>My heart goes out to Rachel Weisz, Djmon Hounsou and to a lesser degree Tilda Swinton for at least giving good performances that respect the audience but regardless of their grand efforts, this still remains a Keanu Reeves film and it's not very good."
"mrcrowjuction","3","237","432","1 February 2005"," Weisz and Hounsou do well with what they got but the film is a major letdown
","Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels. He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. So they both embark on a investigation that includes half breed demons strait out of episodes of Buffy and Angel, angels that look way too asexual for words and the devil himself, who looks like he just got back from gambling trip in Atlantic City. Now if you think that I'm being a tad over the top in my plot summery, think again. I'm actually being way too kind. Now it's very hard to start off with the good parts of the film with out addressing the very bad parts of it first and that's Keanu Reeves himself. I do think that he's a good actor with some promise but he's miscast in this role as a hardboiled and cynical private eye with supernatural connections and his sour face demeanor does not help him out with his character at all. There is a subplot that involves that his heath adds nothing to the overall story at all and his character borders between self important idiot to whiney bastard that cries to god when he does not get his way. His transformation into his Neo persona during the last act of the film takes away a lot from what the movie was supposed to be all about and just turns it into a sad parody of itself. The screenplay feels like a hack job in some places and some characters don't really serve a purpose at all other than to be killed off or to just be a part of the scenery. Some character don't really need to be in the movie at all like the character of Chaz played by Shia LaBeouf, who really adds nothing to the movie other than to be a really bad side kick to our sour faced hero and the angel Gabriel who is played by Tilda Swinton, who for starters is only in the film for about ten minutes and really adds nothing to it other than to have a really bad scene with John Constantine that will make you sit up and take notice on how bad this film really is and the last act, where her character is a part of one of the most stupid plot revelations in recent movies (it involves the devil, who is dressed like a pool hall gambler from Atlantic City.) I don't hold Tilda Swinton, responsible for this (she is a very good actress) as much as I hold the screenwriters who wrote her role because we don't really know enough about her character to be surprise with the sudden turn around that she does in the last act of the film. The screenplay itself feels like it does not know what it wants to be from time to time, switching it's tone from dark horror drama to dumb down action movie in the last fifteen minutes of the film and some of the dialog is so badly written that you are grinning your teeth to the bone when you hear it. While there are a lot of bad in this film, there are some bright spots that make the film somewhat bearable to sit though. The best of these is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which is literally holding this film together by a thin and dangling thread. She gives this movie something the script should have giving it and that something is called class. Her performance is gripping and soul searching and its what the film really should have been about if you had serious people behind scenes making it. Which is too bad because the movie would have worked much better as a standard supernatural thriller with just her character in it instead of the mind numbing mess that is presented to us here. Djmon Hounsou is great as well but he's not really in the movie much at all and his character is really just there for camp effect, not substance. The special effects are cool for what they are and they do have a visual impact but not even that is strong enough to make you forget how cheesy the film is after it ends."
"tigerandpoo","4","218","396","8 February 2005"," See it for the good and game performances of Rachel Weisz and Djion Hounsou but the film is more and less a rip off of the Prophecy films.
","Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a PI who dabbles in the supernatural. He does routine exorcisms and fights demons that try to enter our world. His reputation draws the attention of detective Angela Dodson, who is played by Rachel Weisz. She needs his help to solve the apparent suicide of her twin sister Isabell, who jump to her death while she was locked up in a mental hospital. Angela does not believe her sister would commit such an act because of their religious upbringing and thinks that there is something more going on than it seems. So like the rabbit from Alice in wonderland. Reeves takes the Detective on a wild ride though his seedy world. Which involves a man made up of bugs, demons that fly at you, an annoying smart mouth street kid and angels with secrets of their own. Which in fact all leads to a climax that involves the devil himself and a battle for a lost soul. If you kind of recognize the story, you would be right on the money. It's lifted from The Prophecy films, which stared Christopher Walken. Only this time with a bigger budget and a better cast at its disposal. (With out the great Christopher Walken himself of course but his character is in the film, HINT, HINT) The acting is good, particularly because it has a game cast willing to go with what ever is going on with the script. Unfortunately, not everyone gives their best and it leaves the others to pick up the slack for them. Keanu Reeves is one of the actors who don't really give a hundred percent with his performance. Yes, I know I'm talking about Keanu Reeves of all people but he's not his usual self in this movie. His character is basically a miserable human being during the course of the entire film and you don't understand on why would anyone even want to be bothered with him. Yes, he's the lead and he is playing a kind of rouge heroic character but he does not even have a likable side to him. You end up wishing that your able to know the other characters more than you get to know him. One of those characters is The police Detective played by Rachel Weisz, who not only bring a sense of steely determination and strong will to the role but also is a much better lead character than Keanu is. You actually care about her while you really don't care about Constantine or what is happen inside of him. The other interesting character in the film is Papa Midnight who is played by Djimon Hounsou, a demon hunter like Constantine himself but with a lot more charm and personally. I would have rather seen more of him than Keanu Reeves as well but he's only in the film for about fifteen minutes. Chaz, the street kid is just too annoying for words and is really only there to (I will not spoiled that for you, you have to see it to believe it). There is an Angel/ Demon called Balthazar, who is actually a real hoot and does give the film a real presence of evil in it. The angel Gabriel is in it as well but if you have seen the Prophecy films, you know what purpose he/she has (Big hint, Christopher Walken) and the devil himself comes in the last ten minutes of the film to cause a little havoc for our heroes.<br/><br/>The movie has it's up and downs in other aspects as well. The script in a sense does not know what it wants to be from time to time and the dialog is not really well done in some of the scenes in the film. The cinematography is very well done in portraying the grim aspects of the Los Angeles but it's too dark in some places and it seems to me that it was done that way in order to hide some of the special effects, which are not too shabby but not as well done as one might have hoped.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent film saved by the game performances of Weisz, Hounsou and the guy from Bush but you will get a sense of seeing this film before."
"foramomentintime","4","274","503","1 February 2005"," Despite a few good performances, the movie has way too many problems.
","I got to see this a few months ago at a preview screening and it decent nothing great but a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Constantine tells the story of a urban sorcerer (Keanu Reeves) who helps a cop (Rachel Weisz) look into her sister's death which was cause by supernatural forces that is trying to steal souls and cause a war on earth. They both must stop an evil that not only threatens their safety but the fabric of the boarders of hell itself, which threatens to break wide open. It's a decent movie with some pretty good effects but it's hindered by a couple of glaring problems. One of them is in fact Keanu Reeves and if you call his range as an actor a series of glum expressions and moments of him staring into space for no reason at all, than you pretty much got him nailed. The character he plays is just as bewildering as Keanu Reeves himself and is in fact the most underdeveloped character in the entire film.<br/><br/>Which leads to the next glaring problem, which is the fact that you don't really give a crap about his character. His character is really an asshole that does not treat people well and abuses himself to the point of death. The funny part of all of this (and the part that make absolutely no sense once you really think about it) is that he wants redemption and is willing to put himself in jeopardy in order to secure a spot for him in heaven, despite the fact that he still does not treat himself or others well. Even with the knowledge that he's not good health does not make you care about him and that's a real testament on how much of an asshole the character is in this film. Now I can understand the reason why the people who made this film wanted to have a character like John Constantine in it. People always love the reluctant hero, who is sometimes very shady and is not always thinking of others best interest but himself. But when he's needed, he always does the right thing when it matters the most. You know whom I mean, the Han Solos or the Captain Jack Sparrows that make the movie much more interesting than it is. Now the big difference between those characters and the character of John Constantine is the fact that you do see their humanity despite how shady they seem and you still want to spend more time with them regardless of their faults. On top of that, you had actors who knew how to show you those things when they needed to be shown and give you a reason to believe in their characters despite of their short comings. Keanu Reeves on the other hand fails miserably in doing that because he does not have it in him to pull it off and the fact that the script itself does not show any humanity in the character is a big problem all in itself. Another problem this movie has is the fact that the story is really something we have all seen before on an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with all the demons and half breeds that populate that show, but in a much bigger scale and with better special effects. The story is much more than an episode of that show but it still is in the same ballpark. There are some good things to say about the movie that does kind of outweigh the bad. Rachel Weisz's performance as the cop and her doom twin sister is much better than the film itself and much more realistic than the actual story. You really do root for her and hope she does overcomes the problems she's facing, which is a blessing when you think about it because of how much of a drag Keanu Reeve's character is to the film itself. The worlds of heaven and hell itself in also pretty interesting, giving you the impression of how close they are to themselves and of the actual world that we live in. There is a scene that has Constantine trying to get a demon out of a little girl that is a little scary and some of the demons do look creepy enough to give you a brief pause when you look at them, so it does have a good scare or two in the film but it's really an action flick with supernatural elements thrown in for effect.<br/><br/>The twist in the ending is pretty inventive but typical when it involves the lead character doing something noble for a change.<br/><br/>To put it all in perspective. It's decent for what it is but with Keanu playing a character as befuddled as he is as an actor, the movie is only held together by the great performance of Rachel Weisz and a few good scares that are few and far between."
"lexxaflex","3","203","369","10 February 2005"," Thumbs up to Weisz, Hounsou, and Stormare for giving their best efforts to this movie but thumbs down to Keanu and the rest.
","I saw this film a few nights ago here in Albany and in have to say that I was disappointed with it. The special effects are terrific but the story needed a lot more work and Keanu Reeves looked like he was sleepwalking during the entire film, and to say that he was miscast in the role is an understatement. The character of Angela played by the wonderful Rachel Weisz is actually a much better character than Keanu's and would have been a better lead as well if you had people who really cared about what they were doing in this film and Djmon Hounsou is also very good as Papa Midnight and I found his character also more integral to the story than Keanu's. At least you knew where he was coming from and he had a more lively personality than the bored stiff composure of Keanu's John Constantine and Peter Stormare gives a lively yet somewhat campy turn as Satan himself. The ending is OK but the revelation concerning a character is not well done because of the fact that we only see that character for about one scene during the course of the whole film and then suddenly you're suppose to believe that the character was a major player, which in fact the film really does not explain at all towards the end.<br/><br/>Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz, Djmon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare for giving their best efforts to this movie but thumbs down to the lazy acting of Keanu Reeves and to the movie itself for not trying to be better than what was on the script."
"valleyjerk","2","220","404","6 February 2005"," Rachel Weisz and Djmon Hounsou are great but not even they can't save this Keanu stinkfest.
","I was able to catch a look at this film a few weekend ago at a press screening here in Chicago. A friend of mine works for a free newspaper that is widely known in the Chicago area and invited me along to see it with him.<br/><br/>The movie starts off pretty good with a few good scenes of tension and drama that has some pretty nifty special effects thrown in but the special effects are few and far between and they don't get any better once the movie really starts up. Then the film does an about face after the second act and nose dives its way to a juvenile and over the top climax that contradicts the entire first half of the movie altogether. The ending makes no sense what so ever because it involves Satan of all people saving the day other than taken advantage on what was going on (Don't ask, you have to see it to believe It). That's just the tip of the iceberg of the inconsistencies this film has and don't get me started on the loose plot points that have no bearing to the film at all. The characters in the film are more and less the same characters you find in films of this nature and this problem is highlighted by the main character himself, who is more and less the character of Van Helsing with a suit on and an attitude problem. I think the script trying to make him look cool with his lack of authority and manners but it just ends up making him look like an ass instead. This could be just the way the character was written but I think it could just be Keanu Reeves himself with his dried and dreary way of acting, which can be found in all of his film. Ether way, the main character is not really interesting at all and is upstage by his co-stars Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou, who bring more to their characters than the script does. Rachel Weisz plays Angela, the cop who is partnered with Keanu's character in solving her sister's death. Her performances is a lot richer and much more deeper than the actual script is and she gives this movie a real sense of dignity and heart that it really does not have. Djimon Hounsou plays Papa Midnight, who bring a cool zeal to a modern variation of the voodoo priest of the bad black exploitation films of yesterday. He brings a fun sense of bravado that should have been capitalizes on much more than it is here in this film. Unfortunately for the both of them and us the audience, they are working with a script that is so riddled with inconsistencies and badly written dialog that you just end up feeling sorry for them for even being this film in the first place. Both Weisz and Hounsou are about the only good things that come out of the entire film while the rest of the movie feels like it was rushed into production with out a clue on what direction the movie should have taken. The cinematography is taken from the grim movies of the last ten years (which mostly stolen their style from David Finchers grisly classic Seven) but does not take it as far as those films do because it also has a kind of neon lighted Matrix feel to it that betrays the dark sensibility and mood that it's trying to inhabit.<br/><br/>It's a good way to waste your time if you have nothing better to do with it but if you need to seek out a good movie, I suggest you rent something from the video store instead. Maybe a better film with Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou in it that uses their talents in a much better way than this film does."

"prouddog","7","254","474","8 February 2005"," The anti-hero in us all.
","Constantine was the Roman emperor who recognized Christianity and made if possible for the Church to move from the underground into the public arena. He did it out of convenience, thinking that it would be easier to work with the Christian church than try to fight it. He lived most of his life as a ruthless leader who gave the orders to kill even members of his family. Constantine accomplished much good in his life, even though he had what most would say were impure motives.<br/><br/>But the Roman Constantine is not the same as the same-named title character of the new film, ""Constantine,"" from DC-Vertigo Comics and Warner Brothers Pictures. Or is he? John Constantine, from the comic novels ""Hellblazer,"" is doomed to hell when he dies. His situation may be hopeless, but he operates as if he could buy his way into heaven by doing enough good by removing enough evil from the world. He's a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, rude and uncaring man who is the hero of our film.<br/><br/>Angela Dodson is a pure-hearted, loving sister who is seeking the truth to her twin sister, Isabel's, death. It would seem she has nothing but the best motives, but conflicted people and incongruous motives are what make this movie interesting.<br/><br/>Interesting questions surrounding the death of Jesus Christ, the existence of demons on Earth, the ultimate destination of our soul when we die and even the perfect lack of all evil in angels are woven into a screen adaptation of a character and story with a cult following. It seems as though this ambiguity regarding good and evil may exist in film as well as real life. In ""Constantine,"" it is not good verses evil -- but rather it is good and evil taking turns messing things up and making them better. In life the rule seems to be strangely similar. John Constantine's ability to do good without pure motives may give hope to the rest of us who regularly do things for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The visuals and the sound presentation in this film are wonderful. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography and Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt's energetic soundtrack are masterful. The acting, however, is only adequate. Keanu Reaves has long since learned how to play Keanu Reaves. He continues with what he knows best. Shia LaBeouf, after a similar role in ""I, Robot,"" is becoming quite an accomplished ""plucky sidekick"" too. But the standout in this film is the emotional and endearing performance by Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson. The movie is one worth seeing aside from her presence, but Weisz's performance take it from a ""see it if you like action movies"" recommendation to a ""see it to admire Rachel Weisz's performance"" endorsement.<br/><br/>Constantine is rated ""R"" for demonic images and violence. It opens in theatres February 18."

I'm not a religious buff of the catholic faith, but I agree with another comment, and that is, that even though Constantine may not stay true to the faith and invented a few things- I liked the movie regardless...or maybe in spite of it. I also didn't feel that this film tried to beat me over the head with religion. Though, I liked the religious aspects...the demons, the idea of God, the depiction of the angel Gabriel (WOW), the possessions; the exorcisms...the list goes on, were well done. And yes, the depiction of Hell too. <br/><br/>Watch it; see for yourself. I know I was surprised, & pleasantly so.

Of course there are a lot of comments that talk about Keanu Reeves acting abilities, but I think he did a grand job. The character Gabriel in this film is so intriguing. I was a little disappointed with Gavin's role as Balthazar. His role could have been expanded a bit. But all in all eerie, and definitely interesting. People who bash Keanu Reeves are more upset with the fact that he gets paid $30 million a picture even when the film isn't so great! But this one is great. I own it and everyone I have shown it to has absolutely loved it."
"MinorityReporter","7","14","20","25 August 2005"," Fantastic effects + decent story = It works people!
","Despite what people say this film is actually quite good. Sure it had some flaws and the story kind of dragged on but the effects were very good and the acting (which is pretty amazing) didn't suck. Keanu wasn't as bad as he usually is and Rachel Weisz does a very good job with what I think is a well written part. The must annoying actor in the film is in my opinion not Keanu but Tilda Swinton. The actor who I felt brought most passion and enthusiasm to his role was Peter Stormare who obviously enjoyed playing Satan and the scenes with him are admittedly some of the most interesting in the film and even though he is only on screen for something like 5 - 10 minutes he should almost be credited as a main character thats how good he is.<br/><br/>Now story wise the film had some issues but they weren't as serious as many people claim they are. As I stated previously the film does drag a little and it does take a long time for the film to actually reveal its point but its the little things that are really interesting. The exorcism scene is very well done and the effects are generally very well made. Effects doesn't make a film, however, and in spite of the issues the film actually succeeds in telling the story it wants to and the ending is indeed a climax.<br/><br/>I haven't read the comics so I didn't really have any expectations when I saw the film. I have heard that the avid fans of the comic books complained that Keanu Reeves doesn't fit the role. That might be true but to me he really didn't seem that bad. He still has a very clear well defined body language which I feel makes up for his monotonous voice (at least to some degree). I went in to the cinema and saw the film with an open mind which is what I advise future viewers to do and not rely too heavily on what the critics say.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent film <br/><br/>8/10"

","One of my very favorite movies, I have watched ""Constantine"" numerous times and still appreciate it. Perhaps I enjoy it so much because I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school -- the movie contains many religious themes that any former Catholic will enjoy and relate to. Old-school Catholics may not like this movie at all but anyone who has questioned beliefs (which this movie does not do)and has questioned God's Will or asked ""Why?"" or ""Why Me?"" is really going to like this movie! As I said this movie does not question beliefs but builds on them in a very cool way. I'm not sure a non-catholic can appreciate this entire aspect of the film though.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Keneau Reeves at all, but I thought he did a very good job in this role, he was believable in the part except that he looked far too young and healthy for it. The acting in the movie was excellent and the actors (and actresses) were very well cast.<br/><br/>Guys will love Rachel Weisz' wardrobe, indeed, all the wardrobe was excellently done, not something I usually care about or notice particularly but in this movie most viewers will agree.<br/><br/>The only negative about this movie is the bathtub scene (seen in trailers).

He suited perfectly in the character (John Constantine), a sarcastic, black-humored and supernatural detective that fights against demons to receive his salvation from hell.

The best scene in my mind, is when John goes through the hospital lobby, shooting and kicking ass as he goes. I would fully support any sequel from this film as I believe any film that can work Lucifer and the Angel Gabriel into its plot deserves a high mark from its viewers.One niggle is that it has a little too much build-up to its action-packed climax but that doesn't detract from this masterpiece of cinematic craft.

Even in the era of Jesus Christ himself.

","I just came back from a sneak preview of the movie Constantine up here in California and to be honest, I'm glad I did not pay for it. <br/><br/>The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a supernatural private eye who helps a police detective played by Rachel Weisz into inquiring about the strange suicide that was committed by her twin sister. As the movie progresses, it turns out that there is a war that is brooding between the forces of Heaven and hell and the suicides that are plaguing the city is some how connected to it. As in all movies of this nature, there are twist and turns that can be seen a mile away and it all leads to a climax that involves weapons of holy origin. Keanu brands a holy Shotgun and in one scene uses holy brass knuckles to fight against one of the main baddies. While this was decent eye candy, you can't get over the bad acting of Keanu Reeves, who is just playing the character of Neo and The rest of the actors don't fair any better in this movie with the exception of Rachel Weisz and Djmon Hounsou, who both manage to stand out in this mess despite the fact that the script does not do them or their performances any justice. I was more interested in their characters than Keanu's attempt at drama and in my opinion, it probably would have been a better movie if they just focus on their characters instead of his. The look of the film is a little too dark in some places and the script in question lacks focus, not to mention any real dialog to go with it. The special effects are decent but with how dark the film is, you could not really see any of them too clearly and when you do see them, you can see the bad CGI in all it's glory. <br/><br/>The trailer was much better than this."

","This movie was an interesting, well directed and well written. Even Keanu beefed up his acting for it, showing the occasional scowl. Rachel Weiz opted to ditch her British accent for an American one, which can be a big mistake sometimes, but she did it flawlessly. This movie asks the age old question of, who would win in a fight, heaven or hell? Throughout the movie, Keanu Reeves' character battles demons and so forth with the greatest of ease, while the director takes the audience through an amazing adventure of direction excellence. I would recommend this movie to people who liked the idea behind the movie Dogma and the film-type of Stigmata."

I'm a fan of the comic and I wanted to keep an open mind but the movie was a real wasted of time, and some of the effect look really cheesy in parts of the film. Keanu Reeves is not John Constantine and no matter how many cigarettes he smokes and how big his trench coat is, he still not John Constantine. He acts more like Archie Bunker than the sorcerer we all know and love who likes to add more fuel to the fire in the battle between good and evil. Rachel Weisz and Gavin Rossdale (Yes, the same man who is married to Gwen Stefani and who was the lead singer of the band Bush) were the only actors in this pile of wasted celluloid that actually turn in good performances. They at least looked like they actually gave a damn about what they were making while Keanu, the director and the scriptwriters seem like they had no idea on what they were trying to put a cross. Certain scenes in the film were just way too dark to take notice on what is going on from time to time and most of the dialog ranges from corny to so-so. The movie wants to make a statement about heaven, hell and the human spirit that is struggling in-between but the subject matter was not handled with care and it felt like it was watered down in order to commercialize this film to the brainless masses who can't really think for themselves (Dare I say the religious right?) If you are going to tackle this kind of subject matter, go for the jugular and pull no punches. Don't take a great comic book and turn it into a supernatural fluff piece that is more in tune to the Left Behind series than of the comic that it was based on. It only hurts the film in the long run and it does."

Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film.

For one, it would have cut about half of the unnecessary characters that is in the film but also might have made the movie more focus in its plot because her character has more of a reason of being in the movie than Keanu's, who is just there for the mandatory overblown climax, which in itself incoherent because it raises more questions than the movie wants to answer.<br/><br/>I agree with the majority, see it for Rachel Weisz great performance only but I suggest you wait for DVD instead because the movie is not as good as she is."

Rachel Weisz is with out a doubt one of the most versatile actresses of our generation, and in this movie, she is quite literally carrying the huge acting weight from Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in his role and gives a pretty lousy performance. She holds the audience attention with her strong and gutsy performance and she does give this movie a lot more than it asked from her. Peter Stormare only has about eight minutes of screen time and does more with it than Keanu does in his whole performance. He gives a funny and down right scary realism to his portrayal of the king of the underworld. This role should prove to people on how versatile an actor Stormare is and it should give him the respect he deserves. Djimon Hounsou is a great and charismatic actor who also does more with his role than Keanu does. He brings a strong sense of bravado to his underwritten role and makes the audience have fun with him while he chews up the scenery with is great performance.<br/><br/>Weisz, Stormare and Hounsou are great actors who give more to the audience than the film does, and for that, they should be commended.

Like his mom was on the set telling him "" you better do it or else young man!"". His performance was less than the Matrix and it seemed incredibly long. I found myself wondering what time it was during the film. I like Reeves, just not in this movie. His performance was a 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>Gavin Rossdale (singer of Bush, married to G. Stefani) seemed like he was really into it and gave it a lot!! I found that Rossdale with Weisz's GREAT performance helped aid this film but not even they could save the film from becoming a blazing inferno of syrupy boredom. I think someone, at some point, told the writer that he could write and HE BELIEVED IT!! That someone should have been honest with him. "" You suck dude, try harder...""<br/><br/>The movie itself seemed too hmm how can I describe this in one word..piece-y if that counts as a word. It seemed the director kept tripping over a wire while trying to balance champagne glasses and forgot this little thing called (suspension of disbelief). which is where the audience tends fall into the movie and stick with it all the way through. The second you get snapped out of this ""suspension of disbelief"" you find yourself at a theater with a bunch of people you don't know.

I didn't get 'lost' because I didn't know how the comic book goes - or anything of the sort. The script goes through a story which is easy to follow and understand. I can understand being upset at a bad following of a comic book, ( for example what happened with the 'X-Men' movies I believe were horrible movie attempts in relation to the comics ), so I can relate and understand viewer's comments to that fact. Still, looking at this movie from a point of view as 'the only thing I have ever seen about this, it's characters, and story,' I thought it was very well done.<br/><br/>The movie is a sort of 'end of the world' ( or the beginning of the end ), where demons from Hell are trying to enter this plane of existence and rule on earth. Being the point that they cannot enter this plane, we are presented with 'half-breeds,' half demons/humans, and half angel/humans, whom can enter, and though they cannot directly interfere with humans, can influence us to make the wrong, or right choices. The Devil's son, Mammon, wants to rule on earth, this plane, ( Hell on earth ), and the half breed angel 'Gabriel' is trying to help him to accomplish just that with the finding of 'The spear of Destiny.' ( I did find it 'strange' that both the movies from 'The Prophecy' and this one use Gabriel ).<br/><br/>Constantine is a great seer, whom after treated as insane as a youth, which eventually leads him to suicide, grows up to be a master exorcist and knows all related with the Bible and Occult in his battle, and keeping of, the balance between both good and evil - Whilst trying to do these things hoping to 'buy his way back into Heaven' for the life he took - his own, and evade his sentence to Hell.<br/><br/>Twists and great graphics make this movie a must see.

Trailers for this kind of movies show you all the good stuff and making you want more. The only problem is there isn't anything else. First of all, Keanu Reeves was miscast. After his Matrix sequels disasters he should have known this wasn't the right choice for him. He re-enacts his Matrix character on a level that you don't really see a difference between Neo and Constantine. The movie itself is boring, aside from maybe the first scene. The cgi, as seen in the trailer, is good but without a good story it is useless. The same problem happened with Van Helsing. No matter how good the effects are, if the story is uninteresting, people aren't going to like it.

","Now first off I do not like comic books ( Except: Gary Larson's Far Side comics), but I absolutely LOVE comic book movies. Comic book movies have given me some of my favorite films (Hellboy, All three Blade films,Daredevil,Punisher, and Constantine are my favorite adaptations, but I love all adaptations except the Batman and Superman movies.)So in my being a comic movie junkie a was super pumped for this movie, and became even more excited when I saw Keanu Reeves(ONE O' THE BEST ACTORS EVER!)was in the lead. All the actors in this movie do extremely well for themselves. Racheal Weiz gives a great performance as Angela Dodson, bringing a very interesting performance which I have not see, nor did I expect,from Racheal. Djimon Hounsou played a uber cool Papa Midnite. Shia LaBeouf did better than I would have even dare expected from him.I do not hate Shia like many do, but neither do I think hes great, but this is easily is best performance.Even though Beeman is a small character I gotta give him credit. Beeman was my favorite side dish(dish=character)and was well played by Max Baker. And Reeves gave one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Many complain that the writers changed the script just so Reeves could play the role, but the truth is the script was denied until the Constantine was changed to an American. That being said Reeves just nails his part right on the head. Plus I am big Reeves fan and enjoy how he pulls his parts together and I really enjoyed John Constantine's dark humor thrown here and there. The film is visually flawless, since this film is slower than most big comic adaptations it is littered with effects. And boy are the effects beautiful. This film is flawlessly directed by newcomer Francis Lawerence who brings a whole new style to the screen. The musical score is also virtually flawless. Pay extra attention to the score. Finally the story is why I give this movie 90% instead of 100%. It has a great story which is very imaginative, but is constantly confusing. Several things are unclear and poorly explained. The ending was the most confusing part of the entire movie and takes several views to understand the ending. But it did not cause critical damage to my enjoyment of the film. in short I will see it a thousand times and buy it on DVD and enjoy it for years to come. And you should too.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. Keanu Reeves can't act if his life depended on it and his performance here proves that in spades. The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","Lousy and extremely moronic Keanu Reeves sinker is as dumb as they come. Keanu is awful in his role and his performance is a real joke and most of the movie is as bad as he is. The only actor who does give a good performance is Rachel Weisz and she is really giving her all to this film but she's let down by a script that is really badly written and a cast that does not rise above the horrible writing. I think the movie would have been better off like many suggested before with her as the lead and it would have worked better if that was the case but its not and we have this film. A special nod does go to Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou for at least trying to do their best with their lousy characters but nether of them are in the movie very much.<br/><br/>Not much to celebrate now isn't it."

","Bad special effects superhero movie that has possibly the worst performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance. I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and they do it with style. Both Weisz and Stormare work miracles with their stock roles and bring a level of professionalism to this other wise unprofessional movie. For that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for DVD and Video instead."
"rsmith24","8","11","17","6 March 2006"," MUCH Better movie than I expected...Both entertaining & makes you think..
","Contrary to other posts I think that this is a well done movie well worth watching more than once. My review is based on 6 viewings over 2 months.<br/><br/>What may put off viewers is that the whole movie is based on the Catholic belief that if you kill yourself you go to hell forever. If you believe that or can get past it, and the other religious themes, you will enjoy the movie a great deal more. If you'r not religious or can't be bothered with the basic premises, then of course you'r not going to like it. Enough said. The movie is loaded with a very talented cast, from Oscar winner Rachal Weisz, who's performance makes the film to Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabrial and Djiamon Hounsou as Papa Midnight. Keanu Reaves is his usual wooden self, but is better than average here. It's not the first time that Keanu has messed with the devil, as he also starred in the excellent DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. In that movie he played the son of the devil, in CONSTANTINE he plays a man trying to stop the son of the devil from taking over and destroying earth.<br/><br/>The movie is rich in Christian beliefs and Myths such as the Spear of Destiny (the spear that pierced Jesus side as he was on the Cross - and carries the blood of the son of God on it). So rich in fact that if you can't get past accepting the religious aspects, you will never find yourself enjoying the movie. Remember folks, this is just a movie, and not a religious conversion (I mean did you really think that we could upload a virus to an alien computer that would destroy their primary weapon in INDEPENDENCE DAY, or that a star traveling civilization could figure out how to open locked wooden doors in SIGNS?) The special effects are decent, particularly the images of hell (not a fun place), and the devil's minions.<br/><br/>This is yet another of the many movies based on comic books, but is certainly better and deeper than most of that group.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to watch it with an open mind, and I believe that you will find it entertaining and perhaps a little thought provoking.<br/><br/>I give it 7.5/10 or 3 stars.<br/><br/>RES"
"plu4085","8","11","17","26 January 2006"," Good one for genre fans
","I really liked ""Constantine"". I think it was a worthy addition to the Daemonology genre, kicked off by the Exorcist and Omen back in the 1970s. These movies often promise a lot, but too often fall apart due to poor internal logics, failure of realization, or just plain old cheesiness. ""Constantine"" evolved along a clear narrative path, where all characters had a certain consistent part in the storyline, yet still surprised here and there. The Daemon & Occult motif was well done, bringing in the typical paraphernalia in a working way.<br/><br/>In addition, it was a delight to see Peter Stormare as the big L, a match made in heaven. Keanu Reeves was solid as always in his stone-face non-acting ""Neo"" style.<br/><br/>I gave Constantine an ""8""; I think it was clearly above average for the genre."
"cool_as_ice14","10","11","17","28 December 2005"," See it for yourself
","On this site, everyone is bashing Constantine but I can't honestly understand why. This is a wonderful movie, which I have seen twice. It relys mainly on fantasy which leads the movie to have the tag line, hell wants him, heaven can can't take him, earth needs him. This is entirely true in this movie, John Constantine has been dead for minutes and had experienced the displeasure of hell. Now Constantine is trying to buy his way into heaven, by doing acts such as exorcisms and battling the half bred demons which walk the earth.<br/><br/>This is actually a very interesting movie, which will keep you guessing. Keanu Reeves does a good job acting as John Constantine. It may be Constantines character which lets him down as he is the untypical anti-hero. Yet Keamu delivers his lines convincingly and his performance is stellar throughout the film.<br/><br/>This movie is very good and I would recommend seeing it."
"tugboatbless","2","65","131","20 March 2005"," Lousy horror film.
","Pretty bad special effects opus that insults more than entertains with a script that is full of clichÃ©s and inconsistencies. Keanu Reeves is a OK actor when he's not faced with something challenging but he's criminally miscast as the detective who has a hand on the pulse of the supernatural. His presence lacks credibility and the reading of his lines of painfully funny in the wrong kind of way. Rachel Weisz on the up side does more with her character than the movie does with itself, giving a haunting and powerful performance that is WAY too good for this movie. She almost does too much for this film, while the film really does not do anything for her at all, that's how good she is. Shia LaBeouf is alright but his overdoes his comedy stick way too much for his own good, making him more annoying than useful and Djimon Hounsou is criminally underused in a stereo type role and he's way more talented than Keanu himself. The special effects were decent and some of the cinematography was great in showing the aspects of hell but with out a good a script or a real leading man, the movie is only held together by Weisz's performance but she like the audience is let down by the climax, which really pulls the rest of the film apart and makes it into a three ring circus.<br/><br/>Wait for DVD instead."
"wistomandsuch","2","69","140","17 March 2005"," The movie was terrible.
","Moronic and down right boring Keanu Reeves vehicle is an insult to your senses. The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happening. It makes no sense but that's some of the inconsistencies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now. That would have worked much better and been much more effective than the overblown special effects movie that it is now and probably would have been much scarier to boot. I would have rather paid to see that then this film right here."
"BrandtSponseller","7","33","62","21 February 2005"," There's always a catch
","When a Mexican finds the Spear of Destiny (aka the Spear of Longinus) amidst ruins, it sets off a chain of events that could lead to a Hell-fueled Armageddon on Earth. Enter John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), freelance demon-hunter, and Los Angeles detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who are to play roles in the ongoing ""battle"" between heaven and hell.<br/><br/>Judging Constantine on visuals, style and attitude, it would easily earn a 10. But as we learn in the film, ""there's always a catch"". The catch is that the story is a bit of a mess. It was problematic enough to earn a 7 out of 10, or a C, and just barely. For much of its length, I was prepared to give it a 6.<br/><br/>Scriptwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello seem to want to throw in everything, including the kitchen sink and a lot of other water receptacles, and they want to do it without having to explain very much. So the beginning of the film takes us from the Mexican to an exorcism to a woman in a mental hospital to a detective who looks oddly like her, and so on. During all of this, there are numerous ancillary characters. It takes a long time to be told who anyone is, what they're doing, and what their relationship is to any other characters. It doesn't help that this is one of countless films where the dialogue is mixed at about negative 5 to the sound effects' 11, and where actors are encouraged to mumble. You finally learn that the mental patient and the detective who looks too much like her are twins, but it takes awhile to figure it out.<br/><br/>And it's not just the beginning of the film that is like this. Throughout its length, Constantine keeps introducing new characters, settings, subplots and ideas, with nary an explanation for any of them. Many you eventually figure out, and that led me to believing that I might enjoy the film more on a second viewing, now that I have a half-completed scribbly score card, but I can't guarantee that. There were far too many characters who could have been excised (and probably exorcised) with no ill effect.<br/><br/>The production design, though incredibly attractive and intriguing, is also extremely dense and bizarre but unexplained. Why was Constantine living in a bowling alley? Was he living in a bowling alley, or did he or his friend just have an office there? I couldn't tell for sure. What were all of those odd jars of stuff hanging from the ceiling? What was the deal with the nightclub, anyway? What was all of that stuff they had stashed in the back? What was the deal with the tattoos and the other occurrences of those symbols? No one ever attempts to explain any of this stuff. It's just there and seems important to the story but we're not told very much about it. The film plays a bit like a joke that you're not in on. Like eavesdropping on the middle of a conversation from a group of people in turmoil, where you needed to hear the beginning to put the delectable gossip into context.<br/><br/>I would guess that the problem is that Constantine is based on the Hellblazer comic books, which are already up to number 200-something. John Constantine is a character with an extensive mythology surrounding him. I'm sure a lot of it is fascinating. Unfortunately, I've never read the comic so I'm not familiar with the mythology, and the film isn't about to explain it to me; it thinks I should know what everything means already. Films, at least those that aren't later entries in a series, should not have prerequisites for understanding.<br/><br/>From what I could gather, the basic scenario in the Hellblazer universe is that Heaven and Hell exist as parallel worlds to the universe that most humans know. Full-fledged angels and demons are not supposed to directly interfere with humans, but there are ""half-breeds"" that can exist in our world and indirectly try to influence events. The basic idea is that God and Satan have a sort of wager going to see who can get more souls. Like a metaphysical game of poker. Occasionally, demons cross over into our world, like interdimensional illegal aliens, and John Constantine acts as a sort of superhero Immigration and Naturalization Service agent with a bad attitude. In the film, beings are crossing over who don't usually, and it's portentous of doom. Much of the latter half of Constantine starts to closely resemble the Prophecy films starring Christopher Walken. The problem with that is that I like the Prophecy films a lot better. They have good stories.<br/><br/>It also didn't help much when I read some of the comments from the filmmakers that resulted from their promo press junkets--for example, in Fangoria #240. Apparently, the stuff that looks like hell in the film--the mostly reddish, very hot, nuclear-fallout-wind-with-demons-chasing-you-and-trying-to-eat-you stuff is supposed to be Heaven. That didn't make sense to me, and not surprisingly, no one bothered to explain why that's supposed to be heaven. I also don't remember anyone mentioning that in the film, but admittedly, I couldn't make out some dialogue. I don't mind heaven looking that way, but when it's so unusual--basically the opposite of what we'd expect, it seems to deserve some explanation.<br/><br/>Still, Constantine is worth a watch for the fantastic visuals and for individual scenes--most of which are very good. Some are even breathtaking, like the opening where the Mexican is hit by a car. Or the beautiful exorcism scene that follows. The film deals with a lot of serious subject matter. It's very visceral. Occasionally it's funny and a bit campy. It has great effects. Reeves and Weisz turn in excellent performances. It's just a shame that director Francis Lawrence didn't ensure that it would make more sense and have more significance as a whole."
"pyrocitor","4","48","95","13 June 2005"," A decent premise let down by Reeves' typically wooden acting
","Adapted from the DC/Vertigo comic book ""Hellblazer"", Constantine details the life of John Constantine, (Keanu Reeves) a detective of the paranormal who spends his life saving people from supernatural occurrences in an attempt to commit enough good deeds to buy his way into heaven after trying to commit suicide at a young age. <br/><br/>Sounds interesting enough - but Constantine really lets itself down by taking a decent premise and trying to pass it off as just another Sci-Fi Keanu Reeves vehicle. Because of this, the script underwrites and confuses all the more interesting parts focusing on the supernatural and the dirty dealings done by those from and/or associated with Hell, and puts more of the focus on Reeves' cynical detective. Unfortunately, Reeves doesn't seem up to carrying the picture, playing the same wooden action character as always. (I believe he changed his facial expression once throughout the entire film, and it was during his ""death"" scene) It's obvious that there was an attempt to break the mold - John Constantine is a thoroughly despicable man, being the chain smoking, reclusive, sarcastic cynic that he is, but in the less than capable hands of Keanu, who seems to think he is still playing Neo, it doesn't come across truthfully. When we, the audience, try to ignore the film's star and concentrate more on the dark, moody visuals and excellent supernatural CGI effects, we get Keanu Reeves' (never changing) face plastered on-screen again, and we are barely allowed to get a glimpse of the more appealing aspects of the story.<br/><br/>As one would come to expect, most of the actual acting talent comes from the far more interesting array of supporting characters. Rachel Weisz struggles hard to actually bring some emotion into the story, as a homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of her twin sister, and she succeeds for the most part, but it couldn't have been easy given her co-star. Djimon Hounsou is great as Midnite, a mysterious fellow demon hunter who refuses to take the side of either light or dark, but remains neutral between them, sharing his talents with the highest bidder. He proves a far more interesting, if equally undeveloped character as Constantine, but his lack of character development actually works to an extent, adding to the mysterious mood of his character. Underrated Swedish character actor Peter Stormare plays a wonderfully sinister Satan, practically dripping malice while still only flirting with hamminess. And then we have the necessary ""annoying sidekick who acts as comedic relief and serves only to further introduce the main character"" character, played by Shia LaBeouf. If there was ever one of these such characters who you would gladly watch suffer a gruesome death, there has never been one more so than here. Constantine's 'intern' Chas is one of the most irritating and patronizing characters ever to grace film, and it's a sound pity that he fails to suffer the 'death by killer bees' schtick that one of Constantine's other associates is dealt. <br/><br/>With a different lead, the dark imagery and supernatural conspiracies might have proved to produce a decent film. As is, the gritty visuals and sweeping, moody CGI supernatural effects set the mood correctly. But every time Keanu Reeves walks on screen, with his single facial expression, we start to find looking down at our watches is much more interesting than staring at another grimace which was undoubtedly meant to convey emotion. When we can, we take refuge in the much more appealing performances of the supporting characters, especially Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou, but they aren't given nearly enough development to retain our interest. Picture Constantine with a different star, and you can imagine yourself having an enjoyable, if still, not all too profound time. As it is... you may want to pass up Constantine for something more interesting.<br/><br/><ul><li>4/10</li></ul>"

","Lackluster and mindless Keanu Reeves film not only lacks a story for most of the stuff that happens in this film to make any sense but has some of the worst dialog known to man. Keanu is Keanu, don't expect much more than that and the special effects are decent but not superb. The script is a huge disservice to most of the cast and the climax of the film has no rhythm to it. The only actor in the film that manages to transcend the lackluster material given is Rachel Weisz, who gives a deep and rich performance that the film is not mature enough to handle and does far more for this film than Keanu Reeves and the special effects combined.<br/><br/>Other than her great performance, you can skip the entire movie."

","Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.<br/><br/>Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
"ereinion","6","42","83","2 March 2005"," Solid and entertaining, but cliché ridden
","I went to see this movie last Sunday and my expectations were not too high, so I got what I expected, perhaps even more. ""Constantine"" is another Keanu Reeves fantasy vehicle, but this time it's about demons and angels and not a parallel world aka The Matrix. It's hard to judge Reeves' acting as it shifts from poor and uninspired to solid and credible all the time. Perhaps the scriptwriter or the director are to blame. The direction really could have been better. The effects are on par with what one can expect from a big blockbuster flick, yet they tend to get overwhelming and exhausting.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is undoubtedly the film's strongest point and her performance is excellent and as good as it can be in such a film. Her character is also among the few well-crafted ones in the movie. Djimon Hounsou doesn't make much impact this time and Peter Stormare's cameo as Lucifer is...well, entertaining. Although one can wonder what he's doing in this movie. Tilda Swinton's bizarre incarnation as Gabriel is just weird, hard to comprehend. I'm against all this ""womanising"" of archangels, it's so absurd and cliché-ish, typical product of the 21st century culture. Like ""why can't a woman play Gabriel?"" Well...because Gabriel was a male, not some androgynous creature.<br/><br/>The biggest downside with this flick is the inexhaustive arsenal of bad jokes and typical Hollywood clichés which never seem to cease. Constantine's finger to Lucifer in the climax of the film is perhaps the only joke that is tasteful. The exorcism scene in the beginning was very intense and is among the better parts of the movie. All said, this is probably as good as a movie based on a comic can get, so I think it deserves a 6."

","This movie is actually pretty good. The story is not bad and the acting is not really as bad as people make it to be. Keanu Reeves plays a decent Constantine and manages to maintain the mysterious aura about the character. The only thing wrong about this movie, and it's a big thing for a comic book movie, is that it completely goes against the comics it was based upon...<br/><br/>The movie was designed to depict Christian catholicism and make John out as some sort of exorcist slaying demons and talking to angels. If it's true that in a mainly Christian USA that may attract more audience, it also goes against everything the comic stands for. John is nothing like that, he's never been a Christian in his life, he's a magician.<br/><br/>No religion has favor in the comics, John is capable of talking to angels one day and find himself in the Aztec hell talking to some weird Aztec demon the next day. He doesn't have superpowers and in no way is he a regular hero, he's capable of killing his friends to survive... He's only human, that's what made the comics so compelling.<br/><br/>If it's true that the movie is rather good in his own right, it's also true that it should have no association whatsoever with Constantine or Hellblazer and I'm surprised that the authors allowed them to place Constantine's name in the title..."
"fidomail2002","9","7","10","6 August 2005"," Thought provoking for the moderate believers
","It is likely (as I've read from past comments here) that this movie does not necessarily do the original Jack Constantine series justice. But for those who have not heard of the original Contantine series they might find the movie somewhat acceptable when judged on its own merits.<br/><br/>The target audience, however, is not easily discerned. Perhaps a direct relation can be made to relapsed catholics and moderate Christians. I found the story interesting even though I know of more extreme constituencies that would readily claim to be offended by everything portrayed within the movie.<br/><br/>It speaks to the daily struggle that believers have to reconcile modern lifestyles with their fledgling faith and their own state of health and mind. Even though the believer's reality is cast in a more literal, exaggerated form, the main points are not lost in my opinion. Here are some of the important ones: No one great or small should claim to know the true will or pretend to understand God. If they cross that threshold where they truly believe they have a personal understanding of God and His wishes, they are rightly deemed to be quite mad and should be confined to a small padded room as soon as possible. No exceptions.<br/><br/>There is a purpose and direction in everyone's lives. Death is not necessarily the final goal or destination.<br/><br/>Attentions are still bestowed upon us all on an individual basis even while globular events both bad and good are occurring all the time. The individual pieces of the world mosaic are not overlooked or forgotten. An accounting will inevitably be made of each of us because that is the way of this world. If we allow the fear of personal failures to overwhelm our lives and let addictions however insidiously fixate us to the point of complete immobility, the cost may still be our very soul.<br/><br/>The waves will still smash down on the beaches regardless of who is still within them or on top of them. And that, my friends, is the true meaning of life. The forces of God and nature can not be refuted by man."
"dfranzen70","8","7","10","2 August 2005"," Moody, vivid occultothriller; Reeves does a fine job
","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) can see things, you know. Demons, angels, stuff like that. Oddly enough, though, people believe he can - mostly because he moonlights as an exorcist, trapping demons - who shall not stay in his plane! - in mirrors and smashing them to teeny bits. World weary and constantly sucking on a coffin nail, Constantine is beleaguered and burned out, a noir detective for the afterlife, if you will. But he's alive; he's just cursed with the gift of seeing demons and angels. And he's a suicide, having been clinically dead for two minutes once upon a time, a time during which he literally saw Hell.<br/><br/>Cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) just lost her sister, a patient who jumped off the top of a mental hospital; Angela thinks her sister also Saw Something, and so she goes to John for help. Did Isabel know something? Where is she now? Can Angela see, too? Well, she can, actually, because Isabel was her twin sister, and as we all know twins share everything. So, using Angela, Constantine learns that the Bad Guys (demons), who are supposed to stay in Hell, have been crossing over to the plane of the living, presumably to raise hell. But Constnatine knows there's something else afoot, something only witchcraft, voodoo, and other otherworldly things can uncover.<br/><br/>If there was ever a role that the adult Reeves was born to play (besides that of Neo), it's that of John Constantine. Constantine wanders hither and yon, doing good deeds and helping with crimes involving the occult, and so forth, all with a resigned and - pardon another pun - rather soulless attitude. Constantine knows he's doomed to a lifetime of doing this, partly because he tried to kill himself and partly because he has The Gift. It's this kind of dispassionate nihilism that plays perfectly to Reeves' own dull, emotionless acting range. He's perfect for the role, based on a comic book called Hellblazer.<br/><br/>Weisz is pretty good - believable, at least - as the clumsily named Angela, but the real standout among the supporting cast is Peter Stormare as Satan himself. Incredibly creepy; he looks like a kindergarten teacher but behaves like a pedophile. The hair on the back of your neck will rise when Stormare enters the picture about three-fourths through.<br/><br/>Two other things the movie has going for it are a rather simplistic plot and some fantastic special effects (for example, a demon made up of bugs). Movies based on comic books tend to overburden themselves and the viewer with far too many plot twists. It's not tough - you have a good guy, you have a bad guy, and the first must defeat the second. Throw in some ethical and moral conflicts, give the good guy a power of sorts, and you're off and running. Constantine does this pretty well.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the film is riveting as well, with effects special and otherwise transporting the viewer to Right There, whether it's a voodoo bar, Hell, or the mean streets of the city.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie with the idea that it's a filmed comic book, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with the result. John Constantine lives in a world in which he sees unspeakable evil on a daily basis, and he himself has literally been to Hell and back on more than one occasion. His lot is to suffer for his sin; can he find redemption in a cutie named Angela?"

"cgbrill","10","8","12","1 September 2005"," Just my personal opinion
","I thought Constantine was a great movie, because it was not your ordinary horror movie. It also showed a person's issues with death and loneliness. What I also found interesting was the choice of Keanu Reeves for the title role. I think he made Constantine classier than the original character from the graphic novels. I think that since the actor himself has had tragic experiences in his life, he brought a lot of depth to the character, it's not something you can just fake.<br/><br/>The overall choice of cast was superb and the special effects were first class. I loved watching how the effects were achieved (the DVD set is fabulous). One can truly appreciate the effort and craftsmanship."

","Looks like our world is in peril again. It would seem as if The Incredibles and Spider-Man didn't rid us of all the evil in our midst last year and we have to turn to ole stand-by Keanu Reeves to again come to the rescue of us mere mortals.<br/><br/>This time round, Keanu plays title character John Constantine, a supernatural detective who is anything but your quintessential hero. John drinks, chain-smokes and generally is not the most approachable person in the world (think of him as like your in-laws on valium). But John does have a gift  the ability to see the demons and angels walking amongst us, and John uses this gift to try and gain acceptance into Heaven by deporting these evil spirits back to Hell.<br/><br/>See, God and the Devil seem to have made a wager for the souls of mankind. Their only real rule is to have no direct contact with humans, just influence. That meant that demons and angels are our neighbors, our cashiers and our business partners. They are all around us.<br/><br/>It also just so happens that the son of the devil himself is attempting to encroach our world by using the demons to directly impact the lives of certain humans required for the rebirth of Lucifer Jr. As they say, rules are made to be broken.<br/><br/>This plan is brought to Constantine's attention through detective Angela Dobson (Rachel Weisz) who is investigating the suicide of her twin sister. Angela is in denial about her sister's decision to jump off the roof of her hospital and solicits the aide of reluctant Constantine to help assist with what was obviously evil intervention. Or something like that. The two then put together the evidential pieces bit by bit which leads to the eventual climax full of shouting, screaming, shooting and suicides.<br/><br/>Sounds exciting, huh? Wonder why it wasn't.<br/><br/>Constantine is a mess of a movie that gets by on style and special effects. Based on the comic book 'Hellblazer', it is yet another movie based on a hero of the illustrated page that you would be excused if you had never heard of it (following Hellboy and Punisher). The problems with the film are that it seems as if there is one scene of action followed by an explanation followed by another scene of green screen madness then more revelations as to why what just happened happened. If the film isn't explaining itself it is preparing and setting up another scene of our enlightenment. And when things can't be explained, well, then there is the Devil's bible which contains passages not found in the standard King James version or high level angels and demons that seem intent on revealing important plot points without as much as a feather to the underfoot as necessary truth inducing torture.<br/><br/>All this made it more confusing than a film of this nature should be. With strong roots and references of Catholicism I couldn't help but think anyone without better than basic religious knowledge might be even more confused or uninterested than I was. It was kinda heavy fare for a movie who's trailers lead me into the theatre expecting to see great action and demonic exorcisms.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the action sequences were above average. In fact, the introduction to Constantine as he exorcises a demon from a young girl was high tension and very well crafted. So to were other scenes of fright and fancy that you can get the gist of through any of the commercial advertisements. The design of hell, the ripping of Angela through an office building and a demon made of cockroaches and snakes were all original which allowed me to forgive the mass annihilation of demons at the local hospital which seemed ripped directly from the first Blade movie.<br/><br/>Giving a movie two and a half stars out of five means we could go either way with our verdict. With Constantine, I am giving it a small recommendation even if there seems to be more negative words than positive in the review above. This 'recommendation' is based on the performances (specifically Weisz who looks to be pretty interested in the material even if it probably made no sense on the scripted page) and the special effects. That doesn't mean that Constantine is a good film, but you could do a hell of a lot worse."

","Horrible Keanu Reeves's movie is a real disaster of epic proportion with Reeves perhaps giving the worst performance of his career with a character that is as one-dimensional as they come. I don't know if he was trying to copy Clint Eastwood's delivery from Dirty Harry but he's comes across as a parody of that character and he makes the film into a mockery with it. The special effects are lackluster and the screenplay is a joke with atrocious dialog that almost painful to the ears. Some characters and subplots don't really coincide with the overall story and the last fifteen minutes of the film makes absolutely no sense at all. Rachel Weisz does give too much to this movie with a complicate and deep performance that is way too mature and complex for this film. She almost single handedly redeems the movie but while she is doing her part in covering up the many flaws this movie has, the movie itself has way too many for even her great talent to forgive."

Yet, when watching the movie, I can't seem to draw the connection. I understand Reeve's isn't the GREATEST actor in the world, but I thought he fit role very well. The CGI was awesome on my DVD; I fail to see the problems some people may have had. And when it comes to the plot, sure it may have been a little confusing, but the Matrix's plot was confusing as well! After I figured it out, I thought to my self, ""Wow, cool story"".<br/><br/>I don't understand what's up with all of the bashing. I'm a REALLY tough critic as well... I hated the F4 and RotS.

This movie is full of contradictions (if Heaven and Hell can't enter Earth, why does Lucifer just walk in when Constantine dies? Why doesn't John just get the last rites, if that'd send even a demon to heaven?), clichés (the alcoholic priest, the teenage sidekick) and rip-offs (anyone else had the feeling they were watching a bad Exorcist remake in the beginning of the movie?).

"christian123","6","17","31","9 May 2005"," A Very Entertaining Film
","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a die-hard cynic with the unwanted childhood gift of being able to see angels and demons that walk the earth. When a police detective (Rachel Weisz) comes to him for help finding out why her twin sister committed suicide, the duo is thrown headlong into a war between heaven and hell.<br/><br/>Constantine is a very enjoyable and exciting film to watch. The execution of the premise was done pretty well. I found the film to be engaging even though I was unfamiliar with material. I liked the way director Francis Lawrence handled the movie. He made it stylish but he also added plenty of substance to back it up. The majority of the first half was just talking and the film did a decent job of introducing the characters and story. Actually, the first half featured a bit too much talking and it was a little dull. However, the second half was very nicely done with a lot of cool scenes and dialog.<br/><br/>At first, the running time of 121 minutes seemed to be really long but the second half was wonderfully paced and the film just zoomed to the end. The script was a little weak but that wasn't the movie's main draw so it wasn't a major flaw. The script wasn't too original but I wouldn't say the entire film was derivative. Also, there weren't too many characters so it wasn't hard to figure things out. The special effects were awesome though and it was the best thing the film had to offer.<br/><br/>I think Constantine worked so well because of Keanu Reeves. A lot of people have blasted him for being a bad and boring actor. However, I think his mundane personality suited the role perfectly and he did a fine job. Rachel Weisz also played her role well and she's kind of underrated. Shia LaBeouf gave an awful performance as Chas. He was just annoying and over-the-top. I liked Tilda Swinton's performance and I think she's also a pretty underrated actress. Surprisingly, Gavin Rossdale gave a good performance. It wasn't amazing but it was much better than I expected. I think Constantine is a love it or hate it type of film. The movie will either wow the viewer or bore the viewer with it's story and effects. In the end, Constantine is a pretty good movie that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10"

","Horribly written and poorly directed horror movie that takes the source material of the comic book that it's based on (The excellent Hellblazer) and literally destroys it with a script that is so badly written that some of the dialog will make you grunt when you hear it and plot points that has nothing to do with the story at all. The story itself make absolutely no sense because it says one thing and contradicts itself latter with another, so you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. Some characters serve no purpose what so ever like Constantine's kid sidekick who is as annoying as they come and the angel Gabriel, who is involved in one of the stupidest plot revelations to come out in recent cinema. A revelation that turns this movie's second half into a bad joke. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is pretty bad because instead of trying to help the story along, he just resorts to copying what was done before in order to get an effect and relying too heavily on the special effects to tell its story. You can see the influence the movie ""Seven"" had on him because of the way the lighting is done in some scenes but what he forgets is the fact that ""Seven"" had a compelling story that scared and held you in your seat until it's shocking climax while this movie will have you thinking on why so much had gone wrong with it in the first place. Acting wise, I will have to join the majority in praising Rachel Weisz for her performance because with out it, the movie would have been a bigger disaster than it is. Rachel Weisz give too much to this film with her performance and gets too little from it. Her performance literally keeps this movie from going under its own stupidly and she does make you think about her character as a real human being who is going though a crises of faith and a corrosion of the soul. She's so good in fact that she makes you almost forgive this movie but unfortunately for her and the people paying to see it, she is the only actor who is able to rise above the bad script and lousy direction to give a compelling performance. Keanu Reeves, who plays the title character of John Constantine is a decent actor when he is motivated but he looks like he's on some kind of drug in this film and does not come a cross well in his role. You don't really believe his character at all by the way Keanu plays him and the movie loses credibility because of it. You can't blame him for his lack of interest because of how bad the script is but he could have done better or they could have gotten a better actor to play the character instead.<br/><br/>I suggest you see this film for Rachel Weisz's better what this film deserved performance only because the only good thing this film really has."

","Muddled horror film that lacks not only credibility in its convictions but lacks a leading man that could make you believe in what is going on. Keanu Reeves is miscast to the point of it being a crime against cinema itself and he's so bad in this role that you wish he was playing in those Bill and Ted's films instead of being here in this film. His presence in this film makes it a cruel joke and that's pretty bad considering the fact that it did have potential but with a director who does not seem to know on what he is doing and a screenplay that is so horrible that you do end up cringing at some of the dialog spoken, the movie was destine to fail. The other actors in this film are just as bad Keanu himself with the exception of Rachel Weisz, whose great performance goes way above and beyond on what this movie really deserved and to Tilda Swinton, who does do wonders with her very badly written role. Other than Weisz and Swinton, the movie is more juvenile than compelling and that really the fault of the people in charge because they wanted to have their cake and eat it too with out taking account that the subject matter deserved better than this."

And overall, have your miserable story with unexplained scenes and unintentionally funny moments? Darn right! Seems like the same formula here.

""Constantine"" is spectacular and gorgeously visual looking.<br/><br/>""Constantine"" can be simply described as a mix of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Blade"" because well...John Constantine is a Blade like exorcist. For some reason this movie was poorly advertised. From the advertises and trailers I couldn't really tell what for a kind of character John Constantine was and what this movie was about, also since I never even had heard of the comic books this movie is based on. Had this movie been better advertised, I'm sure it would had attracted more people to see it.<br/><br/>Maybe best thing about the movie are the special effects. They are truly most excellent, scary and gory at times. It makes this movie visual wonderful to look at. Also the atmosphere is better than expected. OK it ain't really a comic book kind of atmosphere but it's a good dark, almost horror like atmosphere. This movie works fine as an horror as well as an action movie...and as an anti-smoking campaign. The movie has more than a few spectacular and scary moments.<br/><br/>The story is a bit too complicated at times. I don't think that the story itself is that complex but it's just the way it is told. Rookie director Francis Lawrence still has obviously some things to learn about movie-storytelling but nevertheless this is an impressive and most certainly entertaining debut movie from him.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves of course wouldn't had been my first choice as the hero but he pulls of alright. At least he isn't laughable unbelievable in his role or anything but he also ain't exactly cool enough. Rachel Weisz also pulls of alright but her performance certainly isn't worth all the praise she is receiving over here. In my opinion she really isn't believable as a cop. Can you just imaging her arresting a big tough criminal? Really good were Djimon Hounsou (finally in a 'normal' role, I was getting sick of seeing him playing typical Africans like he did in for instance ""Amistad"", ""Gladiator"", ""Stargate"" and ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"".) and Peter Stormare as the greatly sarcastic Lucifer. Shia LaBeouf is also a good young actor with already an impressive CV. Surely a name we will hear a lot more about in the near future.<br/><br/>Don't let all the negative press scare you off from watching this movie.

I did feel however that the character of Chas, played by Shia LaBeouf, could have been better explained. He sometimes seemed a bit out of place. I know it's different to the comic book creation in that it has been moved to LA and changed the appearance of Constantine himself but I feel that the essence of who he is and why he does what he does is kept intact.

But really, how would you feel as an artist to see your creation butchered by someone else in such a way? Don't believe me. The creators of the book fought hard to have their names removed from the film. Sound like someone who's happy with the representation of their work? Not at all. Constantine is an over blown action flick without the intelligence and depth of the actual book.<br/><br/>When are we going to stop putting up with such crap that has such disdain for the original material like the Punisher movies, Constantine, Spawn, Catwoman, and the last few Joel Schumacher Batman disasters before we actually stop going to see these movies? Am I crazy or aren't movies like Spiderman and Hellboy better films because they respect the original material and their creators. After all, their has to be a reason they're making a movie after the comic book. The original had to be good enough for them to want to make the movie. And it's usually because of the writing and the detail the creators pour into their creations.<br/><br/>I never saw Constantine in the theatre. Instead I saw a bootlegged copy my friend got to compare to the book. I didn't even want to watch it with him except he talked me into it. I couldn't in good conscious, and with respect to it's creators, line the pockets of people who would butcher someone else's work so easily and without regard.<br/><br/>I of course will be first in line to see Sin City when it comes out. Frank Miller himself was in charge and the comic used as story boards. I bet my life it'll be much better, make more money, and garner better reviews than Constantine will on it's best day.

","As movie viewers are plagued every year with comic book stories being turned into films it shouldn't come as a surprise that the efforts are becoming more and more pathetic and desperate. This film is arguably the worst and it's one of those projects that clearly wasn't made for the purpose of entertainment and instead it's churned out by studios for a reason to try and make money. Story is about a demon fighter named John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) who chain smokes and coughs up blood because of lung cancer but he also starts to notice that the demons he is combating are trying to cross the line from Hell to the living on Earth.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) goes to Constantine for help after her twin sister supposedly jumped to her death but she believes that there is something else going on and needs help investigating it. Constantine explains that there are half breeds living on earth and that a good balance is needed to keep them in line but with a half demon named Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) and the treacherous angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) looming around Constantine's instincts turn out to be true after the Spear of Destiny is found.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Francis Lawrence who has never made a film before and has only directed music videos which would account for the look of the film. If you saw the trailer than your not going to be surprised by anything this film delivers except how ridiculous this really is. About every 10 or 15 minutes Reeves has to explain what he's doing and how he's going to do it and you start to think that he's making it up as he goes along. I can't describe just how much religious/supernatural mumbo jumbo that takes place here and if the story wasn't silly enough the dialog is also a joke. When Constantine is talking to Gabriel about trying to end up in heaven viewers are treated to some real pearls of wisdom as Gabriel looks at him and utters ""your f****d!"". Reeves is not a bad actor but he seems truly uninspired and if anyone can show me the difference between his performance here and his performance in the Matrix films than I welcome the feedback because it seems to be the same one note effort. Peter Stormare is a wonderful character actor but his Satan comes across as anything but daunting as he wears a white suit and has a thick lisp like Tennessee Williams. I never read the comic book ""Hellblazer"" that this is (supposedly) based on but it has to come across better than this CGI laden film. If the thought of Reeves pulling out brass knuckles and punching a demon trying to cross over intrigues you than maybe you'll be entertained by this. But for more discernible film viewers this is a nightmare come true and represents the very worst of Hollywood."

","I knew from the very beginning that this would be a little different from the title sequence. It uses a font that is put together in an odd way. It is a rather jarring effect, just in that one word denoting that we'll have ordinary things presented in extraordinary ways.<br/><br/>This told me before the movie started that they had some professional help in the production and art design... and they gave those folks power. They are the people who gave us that dancing bag in ""American Beauty"" around which that whole movie is constructed.<br/><br/>This movie is getting panned, and I wonder if folks are seeing the same thing I saw. Yes, the characters are unengaging and superficially drawn, sort of  well  like in a comic book or a music video. Yes, the story is a bit incoherent. Some script doctoring is apparent, but the important thing in stories like this is the part they get right: the cosmology makes sense. At least it makes sense if you have exposure to biblical cosmology: I think it true that in all the key regards this is much more biblically accurate than Mel's adventure in pain and blame.<br/><br/>What we want from things like this is the ability to tap into another world. The details of the story are superfluous. There are three ways to do this, all exploited here.<br/><br/>1) Use folding. In this case, the fold is us seeing something which has a story about people seeing things that others do not. It seems a simple trick, but it has profound power. It is not done very well here, but it is done ambitiously. We assume subliminally that what _we_ see is something no one else can.<br/><br/>2) Be novel in the design of the alternative worlds. In other words, make it look like we are seeing something no one else has. That's rough in movies where everything must refer to a prior vision. That's the way our minds work. So they have to show us something we have already seen in other films but make it seem different.<br/><br/>3) Use at least a few actors that have the ability to link for us the folds among the four worlds: ours, the ""real"" world of the movie: the real world of the movie but with demons (Men-in-Black-like); and hell. I suppose they thought at first that Keanu could carry the weight merely by association with the similar layers of ""The Matrix.""<br/><br/>But it is the amazing Tilda Swinton that does the heavy lifting in the folds here. She's another redheaded Australian-influenced actress that can do folding. You may not know her; she gets few parts I think because her appearance is so striking. But if you have a chance you may want to see her in ""Orlando,"" where she plays much the same character (also ambisexual) and ""Conceiving Ada"" where she literally conjures up an alternative world. She's been a talisman of folding in other films: ""Vanilla Sky"" (together with Alicia Witt) and ""Adaptation,"" where she is the ultimate customer of all the folded worlds. <br/><br/>For this character, I believe she channels Jenny Runacre's ""Queen Elizabeth"" in the punk folded ""Jubilee,"" which is one spooky movie. She's the real thing and I hope we see more of her. In true folding tradition, both her and her character trigger the folds here.<br/><br/>Who cares if the thing doesn't flow well or is poorly constructed in how any of the worlds forms a story. I think it is a point of honor that it doesn't in this case. For a point of reference on this: I thought ""The Hulk"" was cinematic.<br/><br/>Hell is never really shown. What we see is a vision as it would be translated to someone without the tools: a ruined road in a desiccating landscape. Seems apt. Same thing was done to similar jarring effect in ""Songs from the Second Floor,"" from which this borrows artistically. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

The guy who wrote the script ? my son could have done better . I got totally lost with the plot ,was there one ? did I miss it ? There were too many holes . Why oh why do films like this make so much money ???? It makes me sad to think that only a certain amount of people will go and see superb films like Hotel Rwanda - a film with a real story to tell . And with the added bonus of people who can act in it !!!. There will never be any accounting for taste . Of coarse I know this film is made for a certain type of audience. but surely there aren't people out there who thought this was a good movie ? please don't waste your money , go and be entertained by a good sci FBI or fantasy film . Oh I forgot Lord of The Rings has been and gone and Star Wars is losing steam - so maybe they'll just have to carry on with the Matrix saga and hope that Keanu gets more acting lessons."
"fransway","10","22","48","25 February 2005"," Constantine, A Heroic Journey
","Most of the viewers of this film, like myself, will come to Constantine having never seen the comic, Hellblazer, which it is is based upon. Be assured this film stands on it's own; in fact, viewers are probably better off not to have read the comic and to encounter Constantine without expectations. Also, beware of the usual critics: Don't go hoping to see The Matrix or The Exorcist. One could say this movie is like ""Dogma"" with less comedy and more eye candy, reminiscent of The Prophecy but darker and cleaner, or like Blade with demons instead of vampires. But it's more than any of these, and rises above the sum of its parts. One could most accurately say Constantine is like no other movie. You may expect a hero's spiritual journey, strikingly interpreted through an action/religious/horror medium. <br/><br/>The leading character, John Constantine, a lay exorcist haunted from childhood by half-demons only he can see, is tough and self-interested, exceedingly churlish, hopelessly ill but not to be pitied, a lost soul who, while not particularly noble at the beginning of the film nevertheless grows even as he loses hope. Constantine rides from one gruesome scene to another in a yellow cab driven by his slave/apprentice, a wannabe exorcist named Chazz, played by Shia LaBeouf, who adds a necessary touch of brightness and innocence. Constantine makes a rather self-interested decision to help Angela, an LA cop who wants to know what really became of her dead sister, who leapt from the roof of the Catholic insane asylum she was housed in. A suicide, she cannot be buried in sacred ground. Angela--and only John Constantine knows there's much more to Angela than we know, and he's not telling--believes her sister did not really jump. The exquisite sexual tension between these two main characters, Constantine and Angela, is enough; to clutter this film with bedroom scenes would have been a mistake. Rachel Weisz is wonderful in this role; actually, the entire main cast is top notch. <br/><br/>The charismatic Keanu captures the essence of the saturnine John Constantine; he is a terrific actor, and you'll appreciate the frequent close-ups which reveal every facial twitch, throat palpitation, bleak curl of lip and bead of sweat. Pruitt Taylor Vince is wonderful as a drunken priest, friend, and helper of Constantine. I was captivated by the scene that runs from morgue to liquor store, carried completely by Vince. If you like him in Constantine, be sure to catch him in ""Trapped,"" a suspense sleeper with another all-star cast. Tilda Swinton was strong and stately in her small but key role as the asexual Gabriel, and Peter Stormare should win top honors as the most original Satan in the history of cinema. You don't know whether to laugh at him for being so pitiful or shiver in disgust at his evil, which brings us to the black comedic elements. This film is really not funny, and I'm glad because that would spoil the intense mood, but what comedy there is for the most part so black as to be nearly unrecognizable; some viewers won't get it. <br/><br/>The director, Francis Lawrence, honed his skills in the field of music videos. That doesn't mean this film is anything like a music video, the score is varied and subtle, used to add ambiance to a scene rather than the other way around; but Lawrence seemed to have applied the simplicity necessary in music videos to the screenplay. The cinematography is clean but not lean, with many close ups that make it more immediate; each scene a work of art. There is no more dialog than necessary, leaving the story to be told mainly by well-paced action. Often a film running more than 2 hours can bog down, but not this one; in fact, even with it's 135 or so minutes it is one of those films that seems to end too quickly; I wanted it to go on and on. <br/><br/>The theology plays some known themes alongside new ones: concepts of hell, of balance, human purpose in spite of itself, and redemption are presented freshly, and in some cases blasphemously, with one surprise after another. As an open-minded Christian, I had no problem with it.<br/><br/>The sets are incredible, and their juxtaposition ingenious. You get scenes from of a nuclear-style hell in all it's hideous glory paired with some of the noir elements--the LA apartments of the main characters--as well as the bright but sterile sets of the Catholic hospital and back rooms of a shopping center, where much of the action takes place Then there's the red-hazed strangeness of an underground bar cliented by half-angels and half-demons, juxtaposed with more noir--rainy night street scenes in downtown LA. And then there's a secret set, background to a brief scene that you'll miss if you don't stay through the end of the credits. When I saw the movie, almost everyone left during the credits except someone sitting up in the lofts and myself--we were the only ones to taste the final treat!<br/><br/>Within the main action are many vignettes, adding spice--watch for the half-angel blowing on water glasses, watch for what minor characters do in the background, making this the kind of film that is always fun to see again to catch something unnoticed in an initial viewing. While the dialog is lean, there are some good lines; my favorite is one of said by Constantine: ""That's pain; get used to it.""<br/><br/>The R rating is for scenes that will definitely frighten children, and blasphemy that might concern some religious folks. There is violence, but it's not sickening. It's the intensity of what is there that makes it unsuitable for the young and impressionable. <br/><br/>Do see Constantine and enjoy. This film is sure to become a classic in its genre. Putting it in a genre would require a whole new article."
"cgfry2000","8","19","41","20 February 2005"," A fun, thought-provoking ride
","The comments provided here on Constantine demonstrate why IMDb, and similar websites that post messages without editorial filters, are losing any real usefulness. Although this movie was receiving favorable ratings, the initial comments were quite negative. This makes no sense, except as a posting board for irresponsible adolescents (of all ages).<br/><br/>Constantine is a very well made movie, with an engaging story, strong acting, and excellent special effects. Strongly negative comments about the movie are nonsensical: some viewers will be unhappy with the strong horror elements (the movie plays early on with the Exorcist theme), and others may be dismayed with some of the religious portrayals (e.g., the angel Gabriel, especially in her first scene). But there is nothing about this movie that deserves strongly negative comments. For those few that read the comic book and have commented here in that regard, get a life; no one else cares about those comparisons!<br/><br/>The movie opens with a very well done, if somewhat short, exorcism scene; scary enough to keep my wife, and those like her, away. Keanu Reeves does an excellent job playing Constantine, who can observe demons and angels on earth. A big part of the storyline has to do with how Constantine can ""earn"" his way into heaven. He is cynical about the religious perspectives on heaven and hell, but has serious pressure put on him to overcome his cynicism, and figure out how to escape immortal damnation. Adding to his angst is the fact that he knows heaven and hell exist; he has visited hell on more than one occasion, and one of the many excellent scenes in the movie is when we first go with him to view this movie's vision of hell.<br/><br/>The casting of the movie is absolutely top-rate. The angel Gabriel is extremely engagingly done by Tilda Swinton, a classic beauty that is somewhat androgynous in appearance, but whose voice is all female. This combination, along with some very abrupt and surprising dialog provide as memorable a character as I've seen on screen in a long time. <br/><br/>Peter Stormare's portrayal as Satan provides another very, very memorable character; two big reasons this movie deserves serious attention. Stormare's characterization of Satan is absolutely surprising, but at the same time very believable. Gabriel and Satan are both given subtle costuming and makeup that strongly assists in their unusual and memorable performances. <br/><br/>These two characters, so strongly deeply embedded in our society, will provoke very mixed reactions across the audience, and many of you will not be as awe-struck as I was with Swinton and Stormare's performances. But I do believe that all of you will agree that the portrayals are engaging, surprising, and very well directed. <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz also is extremely good in the lead female role. She is a police officer that has to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, leading her to asking for assistance from Constantine. The story provides significant tension and moral questioning for her character. <br/><br/>The movie, in my opinion, is most interesting in how it takes all the elements of well-made modern movies (excellent special effects, plays on classic movie scenes, crisp action, and strong storyline), combines these with the fun of a seemingly (at first) comic-book-level storyline and extremely unusual takes on religion (especially with the first meeting between Constantine and Gabriel), and ties these together at the end of the movie into a truly unusual, engaging and memorable finish. <br/><br/>The end of the movie makes some important statements that I believe any open-minded Christian would be engaged and interested in. But it does this in a way that allows non-Christians (such as myself) to be equally as engaged and thought-provoked. This is a movie I'll see again (soon), and be thinking about and talking over with friends and family for a long time. It isn't that the movie is truly important in a religious sense, but rather that it is so entertaining, and presented in such an unusual and engaging way. Movies like this can be thought-provoking and engaging at many levels.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 stars, as all elements of it are extremely well done, and very entertaining."

","Oh dear. Keanu Reeves has shown us once again just why he will never win an Oscar or indeed give a believable performance in any film. His moody stares and wooden delivery of lines are laughable. Its a miracle he still gets work, I suppose the makers of the film were appealing to the same kind of people who believed the hype surrounding the final two Matrix films and cast him because of this. The story was also weak and dull but it tried so hard (and failed)to be cool and gritty. I urge everyone reading this to save their money, sitting through this film will make you want to cry with the waste of both your time and money. Look out for a very good Dr Evil impression near the end of the film (my personal highlight)"
"Baraxis","7","6","10","4 September 2005"," Great film, but too religious for some...
","Constantine is a great movie, though most people do not respect it in the way that it should be. It has a very deep religious background, that is difficult to catch onto if you have little-to-no religious knowledge. The DVD speaks of the religious aspects of this film, so if you are someone who didn't necessarily enjoy it in theatres, I highly recommend you check it out.<br/><br/>With religion out of the way, the film itself could have been quite a bit better. I have never really read the ""Hellblazer"" comics, so i can't really judge the film on its loyalty to the comic's themes and plot lines. The script wasn't the best, but the special effects were wonderful. The background of the main character ""John Constantine"" could have been touched on a little more, but the character development was still well done. Though very dark and demonic, the film is quite enjoyable unlike many other horror-esquire movies.<br/><br/>As said before, this film is very well done, but is much more enjoyable if you have a knowledge of religion. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in demonology, Christianity, or just want a little thrill. Check out the DVD for the background of the film and comic."
"iluvmovies33","7","6","10","22 July 2005"," Constantine
","Wow, this is definitely one of the most strangest movies I've watched in a long time. It's between Devil's Advocate and Exorcist. I must say the special effects were incredible! Rachel Weisz played a good part in this. I'm not that big of a Keanu Reeves fan, but it always seems like he's always in the ground breaking special effects movies. The part when the glass shatters and when he walks through it, hitting the glass, is so awesome. <br/><br/>It's a film that you should really take a peek at. I wouldn't count it as one in my top 10, but in the special effects column, I would definitely rate it a 10+."

","no matter what you think about the comics beware : there' s no big liaison between them and the movie.<br/><br/>Somehow dark but nice filmed overall, Constantine is an exercise of visual art. Amazing shooting angles and stylish Fx. Sound is medium but not disturbing at some moments even exceeding expectations.<br/><br/>Now the plot is far from excellent but i think this movie can satisfy it's targeted audience. Forget what you already knew about sanctity and biblical laws, sit in your favorite chair and watch a decadent world where everybody seems to have another goal than declared. Reeves may not be the perfect ""John Constantine"" but it fairly good in its part. Weisz seems perfect here where she compensates reeves's mistakes. Nice finale, where you could unexpected raise your eyebrows by cause of an interesting turn-back. Overall catchy movie although possibly not what you really expected when you first saw the trailer. But, as said above the movie is the right thing for the targeted audience( far above any van helsing & Co. )"
"allison-35","10","19","42","23 February 2005"," Loved It!
","I really loved this movie. I've never read the comics, or even knew there was a comic, so I wasn't comparing it to them. I think people that don't like this movie are mostly fans of the comic. On it's own merit, it as very entertaining and exciting. I thought Keanu Reeves did an excellent job in it. He had lots of personality, and was just perfect in the role. I plan on seeing it again. I could have watched this movie longer, it was over before I even knew it. I loved the character of John Constantine, he was so dark, yet I couldn't help but like him. There wasn't anything that I would have changed. All the actors did a great job. Loved It!"
"donnieocean","10","19","42","23 February 2005"," Like it or not, Keanu IS multi-dimensional
","As it is with any actor who becomes notorious for playing a major role that spans a trilogy or so, it is to be expected that he or she will carry a certain stigma that stays with that person for a while. Well guess what? The Matrix movies are long since passed, and Keanu CAN act, folks. I'm sorry to be the one to bust your bandwagon's bubble, but start loving yourself and realize that he can pull it off. To be quite honest, if you are even considering watching this movie, do it. I knew about what to expect, but once things got moving, the movie went places I never thought it could or would go. Kevin Brodbin is a genius; the script was healthy, not forced and very robust in not only dialogue but in giving the actors and actresses something to work with unlike some recent ""dark"" flicks as of late (see ""SAW""--I felt so sorry for Cary Elwes--good talent gone to waste on a crappy script)(yes and I bow at the obvious pun). Keanu knocked one out of the park with this one--trust me, it's not a reprisal of Neo in any shape or form....so please, don't go into the movie looking for him. You won't find him."
"manicv","7","20","45","21 February 2005"," Very good, could have been better
","I thought this movie was very good. The constant close-up face shots of the characters often made me uneasy, but always kept me in suspense. The fleeting moments of humor couldn't have been timed more perfectly in a movie like this.<br/><br/>Though the film has heavy catholic undertones, you don't need to be a scholar of the religion to understand what is going on. The script does a good job of being a sort of ""Cliff's Notes"" on catholicism. But if you are catholic, or are at least familiar with the religion, you will probably have a better understanding of the film compared to those that aren't.<br/><br/>Keanu's acting was hard to digest at times. He simply does not play a good bad-ass. A smart-ass maybe, but not a bad-ass. This goes back to my mention of the humor. Keanu has a few quips in the film, and it was these times that I found his acting to be the most believable. It was cool to see Keanu with a quick-witted rudeness.<br/><br/>Rachel's acting was superb, as always. She is an excellent actress and really knows how to pull off a character. Though I found it hard to attach myself to her character. I wish they would have given more of a background on her earlier in the film. She's just sort of thrown into the story without any real explanation on who she is. This made it hard to feel scared for her when she was in danger.<br/><br/>Constantine is definitely worth seeing. It's a great film to see with a large group of friends, I wouldn't recommend it as a date movie."
"SigmaEcho","9","25","59","18 February 2005"," Leave your prejudices at the door
","People love to pick on Keanu Reeves. Even before this film came out, people were bashing his performance without even seeing the film, and now that the film has been released, these people are letting loose even more  despite the fact that the film is extremely well made. There are also the people who think the film is bad simply because they're obsessed with the source material. ANY adaptation, now matter how well crafted would not be enough to satisfy them. These two groups hated the movie going in, and hated the movie going out. The rest of us can actually enjoy the movie, and see that it's a cut above the schlock that gets peddled in theaters these days. Now I'm not saying that you have to like Keanu Reeves, but why are you still seeing his movies if you hate him so? Just admit that you're prejudiced and deal with your own problems  you can at least TRY and be objective. Keanu certainly isn't going to stop acting, now matter how bad you think his movies are - It certainly hasn't stopped the Waynes brothers. And in the end, Keanu still wins, because you still went to see his movie. These criticisms are absurd, because the last thing John Constantine is supposed to be is flamboyant and exaggerated. Reeves' performance is completely appropriate. I loved reading Hellblazer, and I'm well aware Reeves isn't the most over-the-top actor in the world  but I still enjoyed Constantine a hell of a lot.<br/><br/>It's a great movie, despite what all the haters will have you believe."

An action horror with a superb protagonist played by a similarly impressive Keanu Reeves, the screenplay has got it all right: the action, the characters, the scares, the visual effects and many more things. It's different from a contemporary movie even in terms of tone and execution. If you like supernatural action movies, this one won't disappoint!"
"lord_zantrix","7","5","8","6 January 2006"," A fun filed ride
","Constantine may not be the greatest film ever made but it is still very good and a enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter on earth who, when he dies, is destined to be rejected from Heaven and instead spend eternity in Hell, due to something he did in the past. Now he sees demons and angels everywhere and, in the hope of being allowed back into heaven, has taken it upon himself to rid the world of the demons.<br/><br/>He soon meets Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who's sister has seemingly committed suicide. Angela does not believe that she killed herself and turns to Constantine for help. This sparks a chain of events that lead to the pair discovering that the end of the wold is approaching.<br/><br/>Constantine boasts Brilliant special effects and a very god story. It is let down by being a little too bitty (it is sometimes hard to follow what is happening) and Keanu Reeves isn't at his best. However Rachel Weisz is as brilliant as ever.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film to watch at home that is enjoyable and brilliant on screen then this film is for you. Don't listen to the others - Constantine is good. Not great, but good."
"anvourl","7","5","8","11 September 2005"," The eternal archetype...
","Since a lot of friends have already submitted their comments on the movie in details (I mention very briefly that I enjoyed the movie and both Keanu's and Rachel's acting), I'd like to comment on a different aspect of ""Constantine"".<br/><br/>I found the movie extremely interesting, because it shows us the eternal and mot popular archetype: The man who goes even to Hell, to the world of the dead, for the woman he loves. Like Odysseus did for his Penelope or Virgil for his Beatrice...This archetype lives through the centuries and has inspired every form of art. ""Constantine"" revives it once again in the 21st century. John Constantine may have saved the world but this is only a side effect of his decision to save Angela, the only ray of light in his dark and lonely life. We can clearly see Constantine's motives when Midnight prepares him to use the chair. Midnight asks John to tell him that this is not about the girl and John replies: ""Definitely, mostly not about the girl"" in the most unbelievable and ironic way. So, John Constantine was never interested in saving the world-the only thing he wanted was to save Angela from Mammon. He even chooses to offer his life so her beloved sister would go into Heaven and Angela will be happy and relieved of her qualms of conscience for abandoning Isabel.<br/><br/>On a second level, John Constantine knows how Hell looks like-it's not something theoretical for him like it is for us. He has seen the eternal tortures his soul will suffer. He also knows that he's going to Hell no matter what he does, he's condemned (Gabriel doesn't give him any hope at all, on the contrary (s)he confirms what Constantine already knows). Finally, he knows that he's dying young and he doesn't have much time. However, Constantine never gives up hoping and fighting for his place in Heaven. All that gives a sense of deep tragedy throughout the movie. The scene where John Constantine puts out his cigarette in his own blood is the ultimate definition of a desperate anti-hero.<br/><br/>Well, I guess not many people will find these comments useful, but I'd like to share my thoughts."
"mjw2305","6","5","8","31 July 2005"," I wanted so much More
","Everyone at work was raving about Constantine, saying how groundbreaking it was. So on the strength of that I went out and bought it, I wish i'd have checked IMDb first.<br/><br/>My initial impression when i first saw it was pretty good, tinges of The Excorcist and Blade with a few new ideas and some great visuals. The story seemed pretty involved and had some interesting twists, and overall i felt that Constantine was pretty good, but not half as good as i had been led to believe.<br/><br/>When i sat down again with my wife and watched it again i realised that the movie is actually pretty tedious the second time around. Now i wouldn't say it is a total let down, is does have some good moments and the story is OK, although not as deep as i first thought. The performances from the cast are adequate, and the visuals are top notch, but there is nothing here that justified the money i spent buying it.<br/><br/>If i knew then what i know now i would have rented it instead.<br/><br/>6/10"
"lockhart509","7","8","15","15 March 2005"," Not Bad
","Not too bad, definitely worth watching. The story goes that God and Devil are not allowed to contact humans, only influence them. Therefore, some halfbreed Human/angels walk the earth to help, while halfbreed demon/humans walk the earth for evil purposes. John Constantine was born with the ability to see demons and angels for who they really were. He hates the ability and leads a sinful life. He is headed for hell and does good deeds in a bid to buy himself into heaven. Not a bad movie and worth watching. Not always as good as i thought it would be, but still pretty good.

The female protagonist of the film is what really drags it through the mud. If the plot was not revolved around her so much this movie would be much better in my eyes"
"Leofwine_draca","7","3","4","14 May 2016"," Not perfect, but still an entertaining apocalyptic horror yarn
","The latest comic-book offering from Hollywood is this dark, depressing supernatural thriller which sees Keanu Reeves as a Neo-like hero, this time employed as an exorcist to prevent half-breed demons from entering our plane. The plotting and back story of the film is impressive, with plenty of technobabble to delight the viewers, and the acting isn't half bad either. Reeves is very good as the laconic, chain-smoking star, giving a relaxed and mature performance, one of the reasons I like him more and more as the years progress. Rachel Weisz is also effective as the heroine, proving to be more than just a woman-in-peril, and her natural beauty shines through many of the odd sequences in which she partakes.<br/><br/>Further down the cast, we have a trio of outstanding performances from a) Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite, a voodoo practitioner with buckets of style, b) the singer Gavin Rossdale as impossible suave demon Balthazar, and c) Pruitt Taylor Vince, he of the bizarre eyes, as a sympathetic clergyman. Other, odder performances come from androgynous Tilda Swinton as the archangel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare, looking weird and repulsive, as Satan, although this latter portrayal is ultimately disappointing.<br/><br/>One flaw is that the film does feel lengthy, with some repetition, and is let down by a last act which is dragged out to the extreme, with anticlimax after anticlimax. Saying that, it struggles admirably with religious conundrums, and isn't afraid to shy away from violence and blasphemy to achieve horrific effects. The film is not really action-orientated, like THE MATRIX series, instead acting as more of an acopalyptic horror, and there are plenty of jump-in-your-seat scares, especially one at the opening. The best thing by far are the special effects, especially those of the demons and the glimpses of Hell we get, which are simply fantastic and surpass anything else seen recently.<br/><br/>The film does feel somewhat corny in places, and there are familiar elements from THE EXORCIST and HELLBOY which crop up in a clichéd light. It is also pretty dark and depressing, dealing as it does with death, destruction and sin, so don't expect much in the way of enjoyment. Instead, sit back and watch as this visionary ride offers something new and half-original, and ignore the shortcomings which are easily made up for by the good stuff."

","I had read something in a magazine and I thought it would be a good moviebut what a waste of time, money and talent. It's an horror-thriller movie about exorcism, Satanism and stuff like that. It has a great cast with big names like Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou (the guy from Gladiator, Amistad, In America,) This may not be my favourite genre but I liked Stigmata, so I thought this one would also be good.<br/><br/>But this movie is to surrealistic, to unbelievable,I just didn't liked it. If you want to see a Keanu Reeves- movie, rent The Matrix or Point Breakwhateverbut don't go see this one. The only reason I could stay watching, was because of the beautiful Rachel Weisz, but that's the only reason What a disappointment! 4/10"

","Hey it's just another movie and it wasn't too bad really. Thought it would be a suck fest since Keanu really isn't right for the part, but hey, it's based on a comic book, so in a funny way, he fits the part. And yes I have read the comics. Shia does his part of the wanna be well. Rachel does a great job too. But you have to remember it is a comic book turned into a movie. The effects are great and there are a few parts that blew us away. The first part when the guy gets hit by the car is especially well done! I think the effects add so much more to the movie and make it worth the rental price even if you don't like the movie itself.I say watch it and form your own opinion ;)"

","I can't believe there's people who actually liked this thing. The plot seemed like it was made up as they went along, it was boring, and the characters were shallow. You can take moments from any film to create previews which make a person think, ""Hey, this looks cool!"". In this case, you'd be better off sticking with the previews. If you want to see Keanu Reeves, rent ""Matrix"" or ""Bill & Ted"". If you want scary, rent the original ""Exorcist"". This wasn't scary, suspenseful, or thought provoking. I've heard actors say that you can't tell if a movie's bad until after you're finished making it. I'm thinking that was the case with this one. That fact that some people enjoyed it disturbs me. If people are that shallow that they thought this was a good movie, then society's in trouble. It's just that bad."
"haslup","9","19","44","20 February 2005"," Despite Keanu Reeves, this movie is awesome.
","When the credits began to roll at the end of the film, there was a pause and then my friend said to me, ""I really don't get what the critics are complaining about...I really liked it."" And I immediately agreed.<br/><br/>Although avid fans of the comic book will surely complain about the changes made, having never read the comic, I'm inclined not to care about that. Keanu Reeves was surprisingly tolerable and the supporting cast, particularly Rachel Weisz, was wonderful. The story, although taking some liberties with Christian mythology, was very compelling and surprisingly logical. I was particularly pleased with the portrayal of angels in this film. It was delightfully entertaining without being cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say this was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a long time."

Not even like the comic book, but if anyone can justify 10 dollars to go see this garbage it was probably me considering that I go to see just about every movie thats in theaters when its out. The only upside to this film is that it has good special effects, but thats about it.

"vampirezombiegirl","10","17","39","25 February 2005"," Constantine is visually stunning; Dogma and the Matrix without the same flaws.
","It was sort of a mix of Dogma, the Matrix, and something else that was better. I know nothing of the original comic, so I can't say it kept to the story, but damn, it was good. Keanu did his Keanu thing (""DUDE!"" and ""I know Kung Fu.""), but to a lesser extent than usual. Mostly little things like flipping off Lucifer (who was at first just called ""Lu"", which through me off for a second) and saying to a demon that was in a little Spanish girl's body, ""I'm Constantine. John Constantine. Asshole."" Some have said to me, ""I was confused in the beginning."" Well, if that's they're only complaint, then it's a pretty damn good movie, because you never know what's going on in the beginning; if you do, chances are the movie sucks (unless you were previously exposed to the story). There's no point to being confused; just be curious. It's obvious throughout everything that they're going to reveal it all in the end, and all the loose ends do come together. Hardly a moment is wasted on anything not absolutely essential to the plot in Constantine, save some character development (like the first scene were we see Shia LaBeouf's character, Chas, and he's imitating John by looking in the mirror of their taxi and saying over and over, ""I'm Chandler. Chas Chandler. Asshole."").<br/><br/>The Dogma part was largely, of course, due to the film's religious aspects; John Constantine is a man who went to Hell in the few moments he was dead after trying to kill himself as a young man because he could see demons in our world. Since he knows that Hell is real, he's trying to ""buy"" his way into Heaven by sending half-breeds (half-demons and half-angels on Earth, who trying to influence the balance) back to Heaven or Hell. Since he has a selfish agenda, it's not a very effective method of getting into Heaven, but he continues on anyway.<br/><br/>The Matrix I mention mostly because of the way it was filmed. There are a few points in the movie where the angle shifts when there is no motion, but this actually makes more sense than it does in the Matrix, as it's used to show time stopping for all but one or two characters. Visually, the movie was amazing -- I'm not one who's easily entertained by images alone (not to suggest that this movie is images alone), but if I were to comment on nothing but the visuals I would have still found the movie amazing. From explosions of water to flesh burning off of demons and visions of hell, everything was realistic enough to make me jump or gape at the screen.<br/><br/>Constantine did not, however, have the interference of a rather bad love story. While one could, possibly, say that there are more than a few suggestions of romance between John Constantine and Rachel Weisz's character, Angela, whatever there was was not enough to shout ""sexual tension!"" and definitely not enough to distract from the storyline, which occurs all too often in movies today. Their connection was mostly one of being two of the few humans on Earth who know the truth about Heaven and Hell, at least to some extent.<br/><br/>If an intricate plot based on religion, amazing visual effects, and Constantine's flippant attitude towards his fate (as he dies of cancer) while still understanding the seriousness of it all, then Constantine may not be for you, but you'll be missing out."
"furious_george13","9","17","39","23 February 2005"," Extremely good. Highly under-rated.
","I saw Constantine the other night and, to be honest, was somewhat skeptical, as I had read many negative reviews from this site and others. The trailers that I had seen had many the movie look incredible and incredible it was. I was pleasantly surprised. Keanu Reeves, despite getting slagged for everything he does, brings realism to the cynical, hard-boiled and ruthless role of John Constantine. Rachel Weisz is also excellent in her role of Angela/Isabel Dodson.<br/><br/>The movie was unlike any other movie I have ever seen, mixing and bending numerous genres to create a sleek, dark, and chilling film. The images of Hell depicted in this movie are incredible and the CGI is as good as it gets, overshadowing the horrible CGI effects of the drear-fest Elektra.<br/><br/>The ending in itself was incredible and completely surprising, reminding me of the conclusion of ""Neon Genesis: Evanelion"" in its philosophizing of Heaven and Hell and the human soul.<br/><br/>All in all, I was highly impressed, and this dethrones any other movie for my personally favorite comic book adaptation movie as of yet. Die-hard whiny Hellblazer purists may sob and complain of slight changes from the comic books to the screen and shallow movie-goers looking for nothing but mindless killing may be confused and befuddled by its conclusion. However, if you enjoy something other than the ordinary, you will love this movie.<br/><br/>It's worth the price of admission four times over. See it."

As someone who likes to read about the many religions there are in the world I'd like to comment that the good/evil-thing in Christianity was nice portrayed in this film (although I have to do some reading in the history book called the bible concerning angels). In all the movie is definitely worth watching... and I hope the sequel tells the tale of a comic book-story arc like Pryde & Wisdom where a succubus is having a baby and John promised to help (who knows what sort of baby is going to be delivered!}.

It is playing just the day before the Chinese new year, which I am having a long holiday, so decided to watch it the first night showing. But what a great disappointment! All the best parts are already shown in the trailers. I never read the comic, but I thought the Constantine character is supposed to be a heroic type of character, but the character in the movie doesn't show it at all.

I don't agree with the many comments that found great the special effects. I have seen much better than these ones and all in all there were only cartoon monsters to see. I don't know why such a good actor as Keanu Reeves still chooses so bad roles as in the MATRIX series and now this garbage. Okay, at least he transmitted a clear message to all the smokers.

"dan_delago","7","10","21","11 March 2005"," Strong Acting but Story is too ambitious
","First, I would like to say that any movie that deals with Satan and Hell is a large undertaking in any script. What usually happens is that the screenwriter needs to resort to stereotypical images of what Satan might look like to the human eye. This is the case in Constantine.<br/><br/>Peter Stormare who plays Satan is a great character actor. He pulls off his role but I feel that he was kind of set up in a way. They made him wear a white suit. I don't know about you but the white suit was a bit laughable. As Donald Trump would say, ""Wardrobe, You're Fired!!"" I beg to differ with the other reviewer. I thought the actors were the strongest part of this production. I love Rachel Weisz. She is an amazing actress on the same scale as Kate Winslet. What I also like about her is that she is in many films but she is not a name brand. This makes me feel like she is my secret treasure when I go to the movies. You know what I mean. I don't have to share her with millions of other movie fans. Ever since I saw her in ""Confidence"" with Edward Burns, I've been hooked. The sad part is that she is going to be famous very soon and the masses are going to enjoy her as much as me.<br/><br/>I'll see anything with Keanu Reaves in it. He was excellent as Neo in the Matrix series and he is excellent in this film too. He's the strong, silent type of actor. You either like him or hate him. I chose to support his roles and I am glad he chooses to take on ambitious roles that are risky. Actors should take risks. That is why film is art. If it were conventional, it would be boring and not creative.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story falls a bit flat at the end. I will not give anything away because I do feel that this movie has some bright moments and is worthy of a screening. Let's not blame the actors. I would blame the screenwriter for taking the easy way out and using stereotypical images of heaven and hell to wrap up this story."
"Nicol_Bolas","6","6","11","23 August 2006"," How a main character can ruin a movie
","A movie, like most other artistic media built as a union of other media, is about balance. A well-crafted movie provides a good balance between acting, writing, cinematography, effects, music, sound effects, etc. A poor movie often has a lacking of one of these elements, or overemphasizes one element improperly over another.<br/><br/>Constantine is an example of what happens to a movie when you only get most of it in balance. The cinematography is good, the acting out of most everyone is good to excellent, the writing works almost all of the time, etc. The main thing that is out of balance in this movie is John Constantine. The main character.<br/><br/>Just about every other character you meet, even the angle Gabriel who is in 2-3 scenes of the movie, is ten times more interesting than Constantine. Angela, the second lead on the movie, is a far deeper, more interesting character than Constantine will ever be. It's not just that Constantine is a jerk (and at no time is he ever not a jerk) to anyone; he's just not an interesting character.<br/><br/>His motivation is weak. He's constantly being told that what he's doing has no effect on him going to Heaven or not, but he does it anyway. And it's not like we're talking about helping old ladies across the street; he's fighting demons and stuff, having to special-order holy water and have appropriate weapons and such built for him. This is dangerous work, work that has already earned the ire of much of Hell's population. And since that's where he's destined to go, why honk off the locals who are already going to torture you for eternity anyway? We're expect to believe that he is developing certain feelings towards Angela through the movie (though she doesn't seem to return them. Probably due to the aforementioned jerkery). We know this because he kisses her once. And he considered asking her to get naked. That's it; that's the totality of the character development in this direction.<br/><br/>Which leads to the question of why the character fails. All the other characters are played by skilled actors and are well written. Constantine fails as a character either because the actor (Keanu Reeves) can't pull the character off, or because the writer didn't do a good enough job to make the character work.<br/><br/>It's easy to blame Reeves; he simply can't act (his performance in The Devil's Advocate not withstanding). There were times where I'm sure the writer expected Constantine's actor to give Angela furtive looks, or speak certain lines in such a way as to suggest a growing attachment. Reeves failed miserably at this task; when the aforementioned kiss comes up, it feels totally out of character for him. At that point, you imagine that Constantine sees Angela as just another one of the people he's helped before.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are lines of dialog that I can't imagine working from true masters of the thespian arts, let alone a hack like Reeves. Yet this is the same writer that gives Rachel Weisz (Angela), Djimon Hounsou (Papa Midnite), Tilda Swinton (Gabriel), Peter Stormare (Satan), and even Shia LaBeouf (Constantine's sidekick Chaz) license to deliver performances that range from strong to excellent.<br/><br/>Now, I believe it's entirely possible that the various writers could make the other characters interesting and fail with the main one. So, unlike most of the other reviews, I'm not going to pin Constantine's problems solely on Reeves; I'll accept a 70:25:5% split. It's mostly Reeves's fault, but the writing fails him sometimes. And the director gets 5% of the blame because... he's the director. Problems in the movie are always his fault. If Reeves was a problem, the director shouldn't have cast him.<br/><br/>Though John Constantine is a constant weight around this movie's neck, the other characters do make up for it for the most part. The plot is interesting, and the world is well-crafted. There's CG, but it only enhances.<br/><br/>The only other issue with the film not previously discussed is the ending. While, at the time, I didn't have problems with it, I do understand and acknowledge that the plot twist at the end may not agree with everyone. Having Gabriel turn evil at the end was strange and out of left field; she only had one scene before this, so having her be the main villain could be jarring. However, I found it to work well enough, despite not playing fair with the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie to be good, despite its faults."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","6","11","3 September 2005"," Well, if you take it for what it is, you'll definitely be entertained
","There are more than enough reasons this movie should suck: it's directed by a music video director, whose done no other movies so far, not even for TV or direct-to-video. It's based on a comic book, and from the looks of it, only vaguely based on it(despite the original comic being at least seemingly highly popular). It's got religious undertones, making it seem heavy-handed and/or ridiculous to many viewers. Yes, there are an awful lot of very good reasons this movie should suck... but it doesn't. It just requires you to suspend disbelief and take the movie for what it is... the story of an anti-hero battling demons and keeping the balance between good and evil. Nothing more. A fairly by-the-numbers save-the-world scenario with Keanu Reeves playing off his Neo role, killing evil creatures, usually with ease. The plot is pretty good, though at times, it's unnecessarily confusing. The pacing is pretty good, the film isn't too long for it's own good and you're fairly rarely bored. The effects are the definite high point in the film, looking exceptionally well. The action is somewhat seldom in the film, and it's mostly very quickly over with... but it looks damn good, and it's usually intense and involving. The biggest problem with the action is that Constantine says he has fought the half-breeds all his life... yet he has an easy time of killing the actual demons as well. The acting is pretty good, with few exceptions. The dialog is well-written at times, and there are some great one-liners. The great thing about the tone is that there's all these undead and demonic creatures he has to fight... so he uses holy weaponry. A Holy Shotgun, holy brass knuckles... good stuff. One of my biggest problems is the entire motivation of the 'bad guys' though. We never understand why these people(uh, creatures) do as they do. Apart from the few shortcomings, the film is quite entertaining, and surely worth the rental. I recommend this to any fan of this kind of movie(bloody action with there 'hero' saving the world) and possibly some fans of the original comic as well(just be prepared for a lot of unwanted changes from the source material). 7/10"
"Red_Yashar","6","6","11","17 August 2005"," Constantine Salvation or Damnation
","The First thing about this movie is its extraordinary visual beauty. The Hell itself is good place to draw a beautiful painting. The few action scenes are acceptable. Lightening and Photography is surprisingly nice and Francis Lawrence has the promise of an intelligent director with perfect sense of scene creating. The Fall of the twin Dodson both in hell and in the rooftop is visually crazy. John's pursuit of devil-son is perfect special effects scene.<br/><br/>The performance in Constantine is standard, with an exceptional work from Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton, and Peter Stormare. Choosing Peter Stormare as Satan is perfect. unlike dragonic or demonic figures of Satan shown in other movies, this time we have a the body of a normal but extremely ugly and disgusting person who has all unmoral and devilish features of mankind.<br/><br/>Constantin's philosophy can be viewed from different religious aspects. Muslims do not believe in angels free will as other religion do. That matter and free will itself (wether human or not) are the subject here. If you believe in this movie's philosophy you have to believe in Gabriels choice. But if Gabriel really believes in that way of redemption. Why she shoes so much interest in John's redemption(Which is in her happiness for his moral ascension in the end).<br/><br/>""The Road to Salvation Begins here tonight"". Before Gabriel tells this to Constantine she smiles to John's anger. There is kindness in her eyes, tone, and aura. Her Breath and blow throws john away. The way she does it is kind but to John its painful (He crashes into the wall).<br/><br/>I really had to write the part above because it meant something more than the film it self. The way Tilda Swinton acts as Gabriel (especial;y in this scene) is rare performance. She uses her innocence ,charisma ,and facial reactions to tell a fact. Whether acceptable or not, it is striking and mind using. <br/><br/>John has a chance of going to heaven but Devil brings him back here. After his return he hits Gabriel but doesn't try kill her and on the rooftop he tells us about his new way of believing and understanding and finally he brings a gum instead of a cigarette out of his pocket and starts chewing it. For him and us chewing a simple gum can be redemption and all those heroic efforts(such as exorcism)can be damnation."
"Captain_Amazing","8","6","11","16 March 2005"," I disagree
","OK.<br/><br/>First off, I have never read the comics and to be perfectly honest I knew little to nothing about the film before I saw it. I didn't even know the story or much about the characters.<br/><br/>I saw the film because it looked good. Turns out, very good. The special effects are top notch, and the whole portrayal of Hell looks really nice. I slight twist on an underground cave of fire and brimstone (but still keeping traditional elements). I don't want to go into much more detail because it might spoil it, but trust me, it is a visual treat. Also, look out for the glass.<br/><br/>As far as the storyline goes, its quick, I think the whole film is contained in the time-span of one week or so, but there's a few flashbacks and conversations that explain the back-story. It really isn't hard to pick up, and it isn't that complicated, but it serves the purpose well. I'm not really sure what genre this film sits in, but it isn't really a horror, or a thriller, or an action movie (and it definitely isn't a drama). I guess its got aspects of each, but I'm sure its probably been classed as something weird like COMIC BOOK PYSUDO-RELIGIOUS EXERCISM ACTION-THRILLER.<br/><br/>If you're religious and think this film may be blasphemous (appologies for poor spelling), it isn't. It does have a catholic theme, but only slightly. It is fiction. Remember that.<br/><br/>The acting (except for the chas) is good, and Keanu proves he can do other roles than simply neo or ted. Kudos to him anyway for smoking all those cigarettes. If he ain't a smoker, that'd be quite nasty. Oh, and he ISN'T a detective as far as the film makes out. He's an exorcist.<br/><br/>Its nice to see a DC comic made into a good film, and I hope it will continue with batman begins. Also, they took a risk making it a 15 certificate, to my recollection there isn't that many comic-film crossovers that do that (except the blade series), and it worked well. I think with the theme and the content, it would've sucked if it was made for little kids.<br/><br/>This review probably isn't of any use to anyone, but I just wanted to rant on while I'm on my lunch hour. I'm gonna see it again. You should see it at least once."

","Reeves did his best performance in this film portraying a selfish, debilitated man, caught somewhere between the throes of good and evil and seeking retribution for his prior sins. He makes the comic book hero John Constantine believable. The film is especially entertaining as it doesn't contain an enormous amount of gratuitous special effects, and has actors like Tilda Swinton of ""Orlando"" fame, bursting through the scenes with excellent performances. The film works as a whole, whereas all of the actors compliment each other, bringing forth a sense of a good old-fashioned action flick. Though the plot may have been generic, it has enough twists to make well worth the price of a movie ticket."

","Constantine is the worst movie I have seen in theaters since Maximum Risk. The acting is horrible. Keanu Reeves must've taken some anti-acting classes. It's almost surreal how bad his acting is at times. Were those really the best takes?! Wow. He's like a combination of William Shatner and...himself. The film is filled with a bunch of relative nobodies, and it shows. The interaction between characters is awkward more often than not, and even the attempted humor in the film barely qualifies as funny.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS BELOW* The plot is even worse. Nevermind the blasphemy and religious inaccuracies, the movie contradicts itself and never really explains much. But what really gets me is that the movie is one giant anti-smoking ad. The director makes it a point to accent every time Keanu lights one up. Then, the he gets lung cancer and coughs up every 12 minutes. Yet he keeps smoking. Finally, at the very end of the film Satan lets him live by removing the cancer from his lungs, just so that Constantine doesn't get to go to heaven. John promptly starts chewing nicotine gum in the last scene of the movie. They might as well have slapped the ""Truth"" label at the end of the movie. Horrendous.<br/><br/>Having said that, there were a couple of decent moments. The shock factor with the car at the beginning, the hell scene, and Satan himself were the few bright spots in the movie. Yes, I said Satan was a bright spot. He is, after all, also known as the Morning Star."

This movie actually kept my attention pretty well if with the Ted Theodore Logan in the lead. He did well and I think it is definitely better than if Nicholas Cage had been in the lead. Reeves will be contantly remembered as the guy who never showed any emotion in anything he ever did. While watching the matrix I kept waiting for him to whip out a wild stallions reference or maybe melvin the oracle. Oh well maybe he learned too much from Lawrence Fishburn about how to be to serious. Back to Hellblazer here, it was worth the watch and takes itself just serious enough to have fun. The graphics weren't real commercial and the characters were engaging. The story was easier to follow than I was expecting and you actually find yourself cheering for certain characters at the end."

","Dull supernatural thriller than has Keanu Reeves playing a modern day ghost buster who helps a police detective (Rachel Weisz) in a race against time to prevent the end of the world. Now this is an interesting premise but the biggest problem this film faces in the casting of Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the hill. It also does not help that his performance is as wooden as ever in this film, not to mention the fact that his character is more of a selfish jerk than a person that you can root for and not to mention the fact that he is also the most underwritten character in the entire movie. You don't really care about him at all and you really don't want to spend any more time with him as well. His leading lady Rachel Weisz steals the movie from right under him and the rest of the so-so cast with a tight and strait forward performance that is soulful and gripping but the movie unfortunately is not as deep as her performance and it tilters between juvenile and self parody. The screenplay at one point of the film does an about face and contradicts all that was explain earlier in order for certain thing to just happen for the sake of the climax, which is not very good to begin with.<br/><br/>If you want to see it, you will not be disappointed with the great performance of Rachel Weisz but you will be disappointed with the movie as a whole."

I'm also not familiar at all with the comic series or whatever that its based on, so I'm not going to be influenced at all in that aspect as it seems a lot have been. I actually rather don't care if it was a good adaption or not, on its on its a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>At first it seems like there's a lot of different random occurrences that don't seem to connect and just feel like their out of place and totally irrelevant and some of these scenes end up being so. But I find that them as a whole work together to sort of give you the crash course of entering into this Occult world. A little ways into the movie I was slightly put off by not really fully understanding some concepts, but by the end I felt things came together very nicely.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by all those people saying this movie is terrible, its not perfect but it is still a worthwhile endeavor if you are in anyway fascinated by the concept/topic or 'fantasy movies', but if you're just looking for a pure non-committal action movie you might look else where."

His delivery is wrong on so many counts that it just hurts and he's with out a doubt the worst actor for the role because we don't believe in him or his struggles. The rest of the film is almost tailor made to fit Keanu's horrible acting like a glove excerpt for the great performance of Rachel Weisz, who not only gives this movie more meaning than it really deserves but gives the only good and solid performance with a character that has more dimensions than the movie itself. Weisz's character is the only credible character in the entire script and that's a real godsend because the rest of the script not only lacks believability in its story but lacks accountability in its execution as well because the story really does not make any sense at all.

","This is a well-crafted example of formulaic story-telling. The hero has abilities that separate him from the common fold, yet he pays a steep price for them. John Constantine is the classic flawed hero. Many formulaic movies end up being predictable but in this movie the characters (and film makers) keep their cards close to their chests, so there are several surprising twists to make this an exiting ride. The beautiful cinematography and costumes make this visually stunning. I gaped several times. And even when I went to see the movie a second time, just a week later, I was still impressed and awed by some of the sequences. The acting was appropriate. Keanu Reeves delivers solid enough work. He portrays an emotionally stunted man, and the script does not ask for great displays of either affection or guilt. John Constantine is bitter and cynical - and Reeves brings that across. Rachel Weisz had a bit more to work with and did so satisfyingly. Her character is more than damsel in distress. Tilda Swinton deserves extra mention for her portrayal of Gabriel. Her scenes are particularly memorable. She brings a fascinating androgynous and transgressive flavor to this movie.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with the comics this movie is based on, so I don't know if it's a faithful adaptation or not, I can only say that I really enjoyed this movie and that I will rush out to buy it the moment the DVD hits the stores."

","It should have doomed from the start. A comic book movie, Keanu Reeves playing a British detective of the paranormal, angels and demons battling for the souls of mankind. Sounds like another day in Hollywood alright. Not to mention the fact that the movie was going to be helmed by first time director Francis Lawrence who had only music videos in his resume before this. Another Michael Bay? Thankfully no, and yes. No, that he doesn't cut up his movies till the inch of their lives, and yes that he has the ability to create box office gold from near impossible odds.<br/><br/>What's surprising about Constantine? To begin with, everything. Somehow the movie that should have failed as another attempt to cash-in on comic books and the phase that Hollywood is going through right now, actually brings us a thought out, action packed but still smart supernatural thriller that never makes a parody of itself, but neither takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The actors play their parts splendidly. Keanu is in top form in his first big post-matrix film, and while momentarily Neo shines through, Keanu proves himself as a good leading man once again. His Constantine is not the Constantine from the books, but rather a more human and vulnerable version of the character. A man who knows he has no time left and is doomed to Hell. Rachel Weiz plays a dual role as twin sisters Angela and Isabel. Though underused, Weiz plays her small role with conviction and subtlety. In other roles, Tilda Swinton is a marvel as the Angel Gabriel, even to such extent that it's a shame that we see so little of her character. Djimoun Honsou is Papa Midnite, the owner of the bar where demons and angels can take their own time out every once in a while. Convincing, but his part is more of a macguffin than fleshed out character in this part. As for the killer, Peter Stormare is possibly the best person to play the Devil himself. Morbidly hilarious, constantly threatening and oozing with evil, he is the manifestation of the most charming man you've ever met, and at the same time the most evil.<br/><br/>Action, some fine moments of actual thought, great set design and some wonderful acting make Constantine a great kick off for a hell of a movie year. It's the summer blockbuster of this late winter.<br/><br/>*****"

","After watching the movie, I realised that the producer really made a thorough research prior producing the movie. This is because through my own experiences, I have seen some scenes in 'live' and it is truly happened, very logic. My personal favourite scene is through the first scene where Constantine was summoned to get release a teenager from a demon. The set up was very real where I have seen with my own eyes before, the mirror and the ritual.<br/><br/>I think Constantine is the best film in its category and I feel that most scenes could happen in our real life. The sound effect made the whole movie more interesting. More intriguing! Even though there was no obscene scenes or even love making scenes, it is still a very good movie and worth watching.

Although when I actually saw it in the theater I was pleasantly surprised that it was as smooth as it was. Visually it looked great and the director did a great job with it, especially since I believe since this was his first full feature motion picture. On top of that I thought Reeves executed the character of John Constantine quite well. For those of you that don't know John Constantine is English and blonde in the comics but his attitude is what was important and Reeves nailed it down.

The Matrix Sequels were a little worse than this one, but that's not saying a whole lot. For a comic book version of angels and demons, Rachel Weisz is okay at best, and the remainder of no-name talent is a waste of a very big budget, like Chris Rock mentioned opening the Oscars show last night. Directors should make choices, or don't make a movie at all. Keanu himself can barely, shakily carry a movie, but its an entire waste when the supporting cast isn't quite mediocre at all- Cate Blanchett has the same convincing angelic look as the Gabriel character, but she wouldn't fit well with this director because she can actually act and carry out a part."

The Matrix and Bill and Teds are the only successful films starring Keanu Reeves which were not ruined by his really, really, really bad acting. The only reason that Bill and Teds wasn't ruined by his acting is because he was just being himself.

"sushiandrice","8","5","9","10 October 2005"," Not exactly faithful, but I'll be damned
","Constantine is a curious little creation. Prior to release, odds were definitely stacked up against it. Sworn followers of the graphic source material were slitting their wrists over character and location changes, Keanu was seemingly pulling a hat trick of duds following the Matrix sequels; and the last time Akiva Goldsman was let anywhere near a comic book movie the results were too dire to even contemplate (file under: Batman & Robin).<br/><br/>Then praise be the gods the final product delivered and then some. Constantine is a rugged, bumpy ride, an entirely different breed of blockbuster that hits you like facer's to a fan. Commercial films like this don't come along very often. Just the fact the main character smokes incessantly is a breath of fresh air. It's this undemanding, all-demanding, irony that elevates Constantine above the crowd, a gnarly marrying of ideas that somehow manages to pull together into a comprehensible chain of events. <br/><br/>John Constantine has been through hell and back. A cynical exorcist who only does his job to reach heaven by banishing half-breed demons that walk the Earth back to the fiery chasms from whence they came. When he is summonsed upon by a LAPD detective investigating the 'suicide' of her twin sister, the two stray between this world and the next, realising the balance between good and evil we've enjoyed is coming to an end.<br/><br/>As flimsy as that premise sounds -and with no apparent villain until the third act- Constantine still barrages across the screen, director Francis Lawrence unafraid to get his hands dirty and put the camera in the middle of the action. Some scenes are simply beautifully done. The opening scene springs to mind, or the slo-mo job in the bathtub, challenging the realm of acceptability in what's essentially an 'action movie with supernatural overtones'. Of course this means some things get lost: we could without a few needless special effects, for example, or lose a silly voice now and again.<br/><br/>But let's just say John Constantine is one, ahem, hell of an anti-hero. Exorcising demons is one thing, sticking your feet in cold water and staring at a cat to go to Hades for a casual acquaintance is something else entirely. Think what you like about Keanu Reeves' acting abilities, he's always there to make your time enjoyable, and here he makes the unlikeable relatable, despite pronouncing every syllable he's given. His tone is offhand and bleakly hilarious (not a far cry from Neo) and keeps us distanced enough to stay rapt for the duration. Rachel Weisz however is something of a revelation, her quiet, introspective role is the best in the film and she really keeps us anchored throughout. <br/><br/>The hard sell of switching former blond Liverpuddlian John Constantine into a well-toned Los Angelian is no biggy; the vast backdrop adding much-needed depth to a thin story which needs to be layered with caricatured priests, sidekicks, and wacky side characters to maintain any form of lucidity. Still Constantine is very much a love/hate movie, and even those on the negative side of the camp cannot fault it for trying. <br/><br/>In fact, I enjoy the roughness of the movie. Its black, bleached, dare I type Gothic, creations are something you wouldn't expect from a studio system that is becoming increasingly reliant on the cheap sell or Jessica Alba in a bikini. Through all of its detouring and fantastical set design, the film is about people. One man trying to find some form of redemption. The ending is just so brilliantly done, everything left unsaid, and if something this blustering doesn't get a sequel when the likes of Anaconda and Agent Cody Banks do, it makes me want to cry."

","Constantine <br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has been seeing terrifying demonic visions all his life, but has mostly kept them to himself. In his adulthood, he uses his ""gift"" to send ""half-breeds"" back to where they came from, using whatever means necessary to do so. When Isabel Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a mental patient who has also suffered from similar visions, kills herself, her twin sister Angela (also played by Weisz), a police officer with an uncanny ability to distinguish friend from foe, as well as a devout Catholic, refuses to believe that Isabel was responsible for her actions, and seeks out Constantine for a more supernatural investigation. Constantine is at first reluctant to help, but then realises that there may be more to Isabel's suicide than meets the eye.<br/><br/>While 'Constantine' is a highly successful comic book film, it's interesting how this is very similar to the Wachowski Brothers' 'Matrix' trilogy. For starters, both are produced through a continuing collaboration between Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow in Australia, both tinker with the opening studio logos, both star Keanu Reeves, both have a slightly green tinted colour scheme, both have dazzling special effects, and both are very enjoyable. The film contains a smörgåsbord of characters and ideas, but music video director Francis Lawrence, in his first film, holds it all together, and also makes the film quite chilling at times (take for example a scene where Angela's phones start ringing all around her apartment). Keanu Reeves is his usual stony self here, but he is aided by memorable supporting performances from the likes of Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as witch doctor Papa Midnite, and Peter Stormare as none other thanwell, I'll let you find out.

","I went along to Constantine in the expectation of seeing a car crash. I have been a long time fan of many Vertigo titles and Hellblazer was always one of the best. Therefore when I saw that a movie was being made of this very dark, very English character and it was to be set in LA and starring Keanu, I saw a movie with a potential awfulness approaching Gigli-like proportions.<br/><br/>What surprised me was despite the oddities of casting, budget and location, just how true it was to the spirit of the original. This is a very dark, very unpleasant and, yes, very funny film.<br/><br/>Whilst the 9/10 I have given this film possibly exaggerates its quality, there was so much to like, because there aren't many mainstream movies taking these kind of risks these days. How many films in the past 20 years have dared to have a ""hero"" character so unpleasant to all around him and with such a dark sense of humor? When the final battle between good and evil hits what does the hero do? He slits his wrists and dies Sure, it's all part of his plan, but this is the kind of thing that Spiderman is not likely to do.<br/><br/>During the screening I went to two wonderful things happened: Firstly, there was a staggered stream of people leaving because they were confused or offended or angry. This hasn't happened in too long that I can recall. Movies are being market researched into oblivion to stop this kind of phenomena occurring. I was glad to see that some movies can still have that power.<br/><br/>Secondly, of the people that remained about ten laughed heartily throughout the film, the remainder laughed occasionally or not at all. This film is a black, black comedy and unless you realize that you will just be sitting in the dark thinking ""what are they on about?"".<br/><br/>Any film that has conversation as dry as Archangel Gabriel responding ""But you've seen him, that doesn't count"" to someone saying that they believe in God is worth the admission.

"bg2lover","10","14","34","26 February 2005"," Definitely underrated
","Constantine is not very faithful to its source material, but it is definitely an entertaining movie on its own merits. It seems liked they crammed a whole lot of content into such a short period of time, leaving the film a a little underdeveloped plot wise. But, the special effects, style, and neat little metaphors, jokes and philosophical twists definitely make the movie worth a watch.<br/><br/>Many reviews I've read say that the philosophical aspects are a joke, and that good and evil are made arbitrary. This is far from the case. Example: In this movie, the true good, 'god,' acts in truly mysterious ways and is uninvolved directly. (Did you expect some righteous control freak?) The true evil, 'satan,' acts without regard for the desires of his evil and simple minded minions (would it make any sense for the devil to have camaraderie with his minions?)Satan wants to corrupt men's souls, not kill them like some video game with rocket launcher toting demons (his son's and minion's plans). Everyone except the ultimate evil and the ultimate good are in shades of moral grey. Constantine's ""assholeness"" is purely superficial (wow a few cuss words PRETTY MEAN). He has seen more of the big picture than most and just wants to know what to do (first conversation with Gabriel). Seemingly not relevant to the source material, but imo more entertaining. Though perhaps they should have changed his name and forgot hellblazer altogether.<br/><br/>Movie gets a 8.5/10, but i gave it 10/10 because of the Keanu bashing. It seems that ever since the corporate sponsored critics bashed Keanu's serious demeanor in Matrix Reloaded, it has become quite popular to call him wooden. He is perfect the role. This movie would suck horribly if Constantine crapped his pants every time he saw a demon, if he looked shocked after every time something supernatural happened, if he cried and laughed and emoted and his faced changed randomly like some sort of fractal graphics program. SERIOUS ROLES NEED SERIOUS ACTORS. There is no leading man in Hollywood who could have pulled off THIS role as well as Keanu does (maybe you want Colin Farrel or Tom Hanks? ) Sometimes you just need a cool looking cool acting guy to act coolly (like Arnold Swarzeneggar). Leave the dramatic actors to their dramas, and the action heroes to their action movies."

","Constantine isn't so much a comic book film, however, as it is a morality play set in modern times. Considering his namesake, this should come as a surprise to no one. What is surprising is how well it works within the context of the hellish world he lives in.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), an irreverent, surly occultist, finds himself in the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell. He meets Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a detective from Los Angeles, determined to find out why her sister was murdered. Together they uncover a plot to bring about the Apocalypse and strive to stop it at all costs.<br/><br/>Pretty standard fare, right? Again, surprisingly not.<br/><br/>In many ways, this film is like Marvel Comics' BLADE franchise, in that it took the clichéd horror genre that's been done to death, and breathes new life into it.<br/><br/>The people largely responsible for this are director Francis Lawrence and producer Lauren Shuler Donner. By remaining faithful to the core of the literary character, they reinvigorated Constantine and made him appealing to old and new fans alike. In forcing him to take a more proactive role in the war between Heaven and Hell, Constantine is less stagnant and reactionary and as a result, more dynamic.<br/><br/>Relax, comic fanboys, no mention is made of Constantine being an American, (he is British in the Hellblazer comic) nor has he been redesigned into a Jerry Bruckheimer hero. Even the wry humor of Garth Ennis (whose long run as writer on Hellblazer is arguably the best of many) is sprinkled throughout the film. No one is safe around Constantine, and the filmmakers did not tap dance around this important aspect of the character. They nailed the character of John Constantine perfectly. So, what else can be said about the film? It's an impressive debut from Lawrence. He does not over rely on the CGI to tell the story, nor does he shoehorn in an out of place song. If he plays his cards right, Lawrence could be the next David Fincher by having his own unique visual flair without being too obtrusive.<br/><br/>Likewise, the cast puts their own stamp on the characters without giving campy and over-the-top performances. Reeves puts in a decent performance, and it's obvious he enjoys playing the character. Tilda Swinton, turns in a particularly inspired performance as the androgynous archangel Gabriel. Likewise, Peter Stormare channels both Hannibal Lecter and Charles Manson in his role as Satan.<br/><br/>Even the minor characters, Chas (Shia LaBeouf), Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) get equal treatment and a believable performance out of each. Each performance hinting at a rich tapestry behind each character. From Papa Midnite's club (where ""neutrals"" from Heaven and Hell meet) to Balthazar's demonic manipulations of earthbound dwellers, every minute is filled with the series' mythology.<br/><br/>If one is expecting a pure action film or non-stop screams, they may be let down. Constantine has its share of genuine scares and inventive action sequences but, they serve to add to the film, not supplant it. The same goes for Stan Winston's contribution (makeup) and the CGI in the film. Everything mixes together to create a competent morality play for our times.<br/><br/>A minor flaw with the film would be with the pacing. The necessity of introducing the mythology and large cast create a slow build, atypical for a horror or action film. However, by the end it all comes together nicely.<br/><br/>Having read Garth Ennis' DANGEROUS HABITS storyline, it's very on par, only a little more darker. There is even nods to past story lines, such as Jaime Delano's Gary Lester encounter with Mnemoth to Rick the Vic and his ultimate demise and the themes that went with it.<br/><br/>All in all, a high recommendation to fans of the horror genre. This is a comic book film that rises above the trappings and becomes something more widely appealing. If you like X-Files, chances are you'll enjoy this film. It's a solid film from start to finish and is well worth the time spent viewing it."

It just kind of flopped a little. It was disappointing, but compared to everything else, that barely counts as anything. The graphics were just awesome. Once again, the graphics were awesome! The demons and other 'supernatural' beings just seemed to ""come alive"" on the screen and it literally stunned all my friends and I who went. Reeves didn't perform the way we wanted him to, however.

John Constantine's journey toward heaven or hell is effectively portrayed as the human journey we all have to take, with of course the requisite explosions and great special effects. Shia LaBeouf's character is as fun to watch as he always is, though I wish he had more screen time; hoping that that will happen in the inevitable sequel. The opening scene is particularly potent, and a warning that the usual rules of a horror movie will not be followed. A great deal of fun for those looking for a good time."

The world depicted in the movie is reminiscent of the world in the RPG Kult, where another world lives in the shadows of our own. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves acting fits well in to the mindset of the character (at least what you would expect someone thats ""doomed anyway"" would act like). Most acting can be described as OK, but two actors stand out: Peter Stormare is probably the best Satan i have seen in a movie in quite some time and Tilda Swinton is excellent as Gabriel.<br/><br/>I liked this one a lot, mostly because of the world described in it.

Keanu Reeves pulls Constantine off perfectly with a stoic, completely jerk-like character from the beginning, with enough biting wit that makes any girl swoon. (Constantine could exorcise me anytime. C'mon, who wouldn't like that black suit and loosened tie?) Rachel Weisz is also wonderful as Angela and Isabel, and she is a perfect compliment to Keanu's quiet, frustrated Constantine.

","I saw an interview Keanu Reeves did for the movie. He talked in depth about the philosophical aspects of the movie! There's a lot more to this movie than just the flashy digital effects- although the effects are awesome.<br/><br/>The film has to do with the whole catholic (in both senses of the word) belief in redemption and forgiveness. Constantine, the main character, is on a mission to 'earn' his way into heaven, by casting demons into hell.<br/><br/>This movie has depth and there was great acting on the part of the leads. (I've never really considered Keanu the best actor, per se, not like De Niro- but in this movie- Keanu is brilliant-. He makes a perfect John Constantine!) I don't want to give away too much.

","Constantine is a great-looking movie that's never-the-less firmly rooted in the occult thriller genre. It's got beautiful sets, pacing, dialog and lightning.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a bit too set in the genre - it's similar to Hellboy, Angel Heart and Ninth Gate, among many others - but it competes very well with those, with both moody shots and tense action scenes.<br/><br/>It doesn't fall into the comic-book-adaptation trap of ""yet another origin story retelling"" - we're just thrust into Constantine's world with only as much explanation as is needed, neither less nor more.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton does an absolutely outstanding job playing Gabriel.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the ever-uneven actor Keanu pulls of a good performance in this one. He plays this mostly in his ""distanced"" mode, which works well for the enigmatic arcanist Constantine.<br/><br/>Long-time readers of the comic (I've read all issues, I'm a big fan) should note that not only have the story been moved to Los Angeles and JC made American, the theology is also altered and is far from ""canonical Vertigo continuity"".<br/><br/>Never-the-less, this movie neither pulls any punches, nor is it dumbed down.

"BigHardcoreRed","Null","13","32","24 February 2005"," Constantine Is Better Than At Least 2 Of The 3 Matrix Movies.
","Constantine is about a man who has the ""gift"" of being able to see elements of the supernatural which are all around us, just not visible. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is able to see what he calls ""half-breeds"", which are either angels or humans which walk among us, living as humans. Unable to live with the burden, Constantine commits suicide and is successful, for a short time, until he is revived against his will. Being clinically dead for a short time, he went to Hell until he was revived and brought back. Having now experience Hell, Constantine knows he definitely does not want to go back, describing the 2 minutes he spent there as ""a lifetime"". From that point on, he is trying to make amends with God (I guess that is the best way to put it). He does this by sending half-breed demons back to Hell through exorcisms or other rituals.<br/><br/>Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who is investigating the suicide/murder of her twin sister, Isabel (also played by Weisz). The numbers do not add up because Angela knows Isabel was a devout catholic and by her committing suicide, she condemns herself to an eternity in Hell.<br/><br/>Along the way they meet and eventually team up, crossing the paths of many demonic and angelic characters (mostly demonic), with Angela trying to solve the mystery of her sister's death and Constantine basically helping her and everyone else who needs him at the same time.<br/><br/>Now, admittedly, there are many plot holes and, as many would and have said, factual errors among this story. With that being said, it is still a pretty fun movie to watch. To those who say the special effects are not up to par, I do not know what movie they watched but it was not Constantine. This movie was on par with the Matrix trilogy as far as special effects go. My favorite being the demon he faces made entirely of bugs, snakes and other creepy animals. This movie left a better impression on me than I thought it would and I was entertained pretty much throughout. I rate this movie at about an 8.5/10, as it could have been a little more thorough with the storyline. Other than that minor complaint, this movie is worth seeing because of the special effects alone."

"Rezneo","10","4","7","30 April 2006"," Don't believe the naysayers! This movie is AMAZING!
","Fantastic visuals. Hilarious dark humor. Great Performances. What exactly is so bad about this movie? NOT A DAMN THING. I've read a lot of comments on here saying that the movie has tons of plot holes, or doesn't make any sense. There's a simple explanation for this: You people saying that DIDN'T GET IT. I never read the comic. I'm not defending the film for the hell of it(But judging from many of the carbon copy comments degrading it, I'd wager that many of you are hating on the film for the hell of it). I've seen it twice and everything in it makes sense just fine. Unfortunately, this film seems to be going over the heads of a lot of viewers, as it does require you to pay attention. Shame, eh? Many themes or story developements are done visually or minimally, or both. Lines whispered or grumbled are often important plot points or hilarious punch lines. It's a film that, upon multiple viewings, I find myself enjoying more as well as noticing more. From what I can gather the title character does differ from his comic counterpart quite a bit- but that's just too bad. They have crafted a fine story and character, and seeing as how it's an ADAPTATION that is alright by me. Keanu Reeves does it well enough, I'm probably not a very good judge of ""Talent"" as I generally enjoy Reeves' films, as well as the likes of Ben Affleck. Then again, I doubt too many of you could judge a good performance if it bit you in the ass- or unless there weren't already 100 other reviews saying ""Rachel Weisz is great but the movie sucks."" For the character needed, Reeves nails it. The absolute scene stealer is Peter Stormare as Satan.... his turn at the end is magnificent. A fine example of the humor in the film is when Satan playfully hangs a lighter in front of a damned soul trying to light a cigarette. The person can't light it on their own because of their slit wrists. Satan tells the suicide, ""You cut the tendons too deep. Finger movement goes right out the window."" He waves it back and forth for a few seconds before grinning and lighting it for the soul. Hilariously dark stuff. The film defies a single genre, excelling in all areas. Don't believe the herd of negative sheep slandering this movie with unfounded comments like ""it makes no sense."" See it for yourself, judge it for yourself. You will be dazzled, in every way."
"unakaczynski","5","4","7","25 April 2006"," Keanu Reeves farts a stinker on the Bible.
","Constantine, Action-Horror<br/><br/>Whoa.<br/><br/>Look at all the demons. I guess... Constantine. Been there, done that, but generally better than this.<br/><br/>Constantine follows Keanu Reeves as Jon Constantine as he once again attempts acting. This time, Reeves plays the savior of humanity fighting off demons who are trying to get into the world. With the plot revolving around... well, many of the same ideas we've seen before. Prophecy, End of Days, even Dogma all had similar stories to this. So let's get on with the specifics.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--Demons versus angels in a battle for earth. Fun stuff.<br/><br/>--Decent amount of demons shown off.<br/><br/>--Hell looks pretty cool.<br/><br/>--Lots of violence, lots of action.<br/><br/>--Excellent cinematography. A lot of flair.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--Constantine is just like the savior in other films of this nature--one way or another, they all have the special necessary gift required to save humanity from demonic/angelic invasion. His is that he can see demons and angels and knows all the right people to help him fight them. Also, he has the typical ""just now fell into this ordeal"" sidekick in Rachel Weisz. So it's getting to be a tad cliché around here.<br/><br/>--Decent music, a bit better than I was expecting.<br/><br/>--Very little cursing, no nudity.<br/><br/>--Somewhat average gore, but all of it pretty heavily CG.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--Keanu Reeves. His, ""I'm the ultra-cool egomaniacal badass"" meandering acting is once again a downside. Cliché to the max, if you will. He's as hard to take as ever. Seriously, why does this guy keep getting work?<br/><br/>--Some very cliché moments and predictability. For instance, Keanu Reeves' smoking is killing him, but of course, he's too much of a badass to quit, until the inevitable moment of inspiration when he finally finds reason to quit smoking and to quit being the selfish badass. Which, of course, happens to coincide with the film's climax. <br/><br/>--Wildly overabundant CG. Every single demon, no matter the capacity, is done with computer graphics. <br/><br/>--Ridiculous over-use of CG-assisted blurring and distorting of backgrounds and visuals to make ""transitional"" effects.<br/><br/>--Awkward pacing and a lack of character development.<br/><br/>--Some excessively cheesy dialog.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--""Been there, done that"" story.<br/><br/>--Again, Keanu Reeves. Trying to act.<br/><br/>--The film seems to be flashy for the sake of flashiness. As in, things were done for the ""oh wow"" factor rather than to benefit the story or create intensity.<br/><br/>Memorable Scene:<br/><br/>--Keanu Reeves flipping off Lucifer. Because it was f*cking stupid!<br/><br/>Acting: 4/10 , Story: 6/10 , Atmosphere: 7/10 , Cinematography: 8/10 , Character Development: 5/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 6/10 , Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 , Violence: 7/10 , Gore: 6/10 , Dialog: 5/10 , Music: 7/10 , Direction: 5/10 <br/><br/>Cheesiness: 5/10 , Crappiness: 3/10<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10<br/><br/>So, this film is really nothing too special. It's a decent romp, but Keanu Reeves and the dialog are really holding it back. More so than even those overly CG special effects. If you simply can't get enough Keanu or Biblical-Demon/Angel-Apocalypse movies, then you may get a kick out of it. For the average movie-goer, it falls short of being anything really memorable. <br/><br/>www.ResidentHazard.com"

","I don't know why so many people hear are ragging on this movie, I thought it was tons of fun. Plenty of cool special effects action, a taciturn cool guy hero and all that silly demon and angel stuff the Catholics are so in love with. Also a couple of very good performances from Peter Stormare as Satan and especially Tilda Swinton as Gabriel.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if the criticisms have anything to do with the odd way people react to religious themed movies. After all, the Exorcist was really dull but people loved that because somehow it clicked in the public mind, perhaps because it took demons more seriously than Constantine, which simply uses the excesses of Catholic belief as a hook for an action movie. I've also seen really dreadful, syrupy religious movies get rave reviews, once again I think because it just connects with people's spiritual needs. So maybe it helps to watch Constantine as an atheist. Anyway, I had a lot of fun."

For some reason, I gave it a shot, namely because that the theme is always intriguing and tempting.

","Since there are so many bad user comments about this flick here I decided to do my personal opinion about the movie.<br/><br/>First the movie is mainly about the comic and thats why you should bring the right alignment to it. Adapting a comic is never easy because you get a high chance of pissing the die hard comic fans off.<br/><br/>As for me I never read the comics but enjoyed the movie. Personally I found the most popular comic adaptions very boring. Spiderman, X-Men, Hellboy and so on were very boring stuff. Batman 1, The Punisher and this movie here are definitely the better ones. As for Keanu Reeves it's not his best role but he does a OK job about the careless chain smoking Anti Hero in this flick. I would say he plays as usual. The part of Mr. Lucifer himself is probably the best part in the movie and also pretty funny. Another thing I noticed being positive is the soundtrack. You will mainly get instrumental music which suits the film. And you won't be annoyed by pointlessly placed cheap pop music from the category ""product placement"".<br/><br/>In the end it seems that mainly the religious US people have problems with the movie and therefore give em bad reputation. For me it's mainly a comic adaption and with that aspect in mind this movie is pretty entertaining and worth your time."

The main good point is Weisz, she is fantastic, shes so underrated and should be an A-List actress, she has a perfect voice she does over or under do her parts, The Mummy 1 & 2, Runaway Jury, Constantine you name it she pulled her parts of flawlessly.<br/><br/>The actual story i found real interesting, i have ever read a comic luckily never realised till after i watched it, cause if i had known i would have started on a downer cause there's just so many comic to film movies i would have just passed by this film, but i didn't, and even though Keanu was terrible i did enjoy the film to a certain extent The plot was clever, i thought it was put together well, scenes were amazing, special effects are some of the best in this category of film I've ever seen.

Come on, it's a freaking superhero movie, for God's sake. For me, it's simple... just entertain me! Cool special effects, mad explosions, crazy fight-scenes... whatever, as long as the film keeps me glued to my seat.<br/><br/>Constantine succeeds as a movie of its genre, because it catches my attention from the start and never lets go of it. The film is well-paced and its action scenes are pretty well-executed. Keanu Reeves is definitely a surprise choice for the lead character, since he is so different from the comic book version. Many die-hard fans may feel that he did not do the 'real' Constantine justice, but to me he is a suitable choice. Who else can personify superhero coolness as much as the post-Matrix Keanu? You can find traces of Neo in his John Constantine, which may not necessarily be a bad thing since John shares the same 'chosen one to save the world' character as Neo. In fact, I find his 'world-weariness' even came across as quite convincing... considering how much of an actor some critics think of him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast probably do not deserve any mention since acting-wise they're pretty average. But this doesn't stop this flick from being one helluva enjoyable ride. Just concentrate on being entertained.<br/><br/>Who should watch: Casual comic book or superhero movie fans <br/><br/>Who shouldn't watch: Satan... he might get inspired<br/><br/>Rating: 7.8"

","Just because Constantine was based on a comic book, doesn't mean you have to be a comic book fanatic to enjoy it. I don't read comics, have never read THAT comic, and I LOVED the movie. Everything you EVER see, remake or not, is going to be ONE PERSON'S version of those events or story, that is what makes it interesting. I really hope for a sequel and can't wait to buy the first when it hits DVD. I thought the effects were great, the story was just like jumping into their lives, if you could do that, you wouldn't always know every detail of their life going in, as in this film, some things about them would remain a mystery. Anyway, loved it, hope you'll see it. Thanks for your interest FTA2004-"
"Tuxxer","9","13","33","27 February 2005"," Just became one of my ten favorites
","Shazam. Sometimes, a crew, cast, and director come together and just get it right. <br/><br/>I'll confess to having a bias towards occult and supernatural flicks; if the quality material is there, I'm all for it. I have never read a Hellblazer comic, but I certainly want to now. <br/><br/>The movie was great. If someone who's never read the comic it's based on can enjoy it as much as I have, then it definitely has something. <br/><br/>The reason it made my top ten? A few reasons, in no particular order: #1. A quality supernatural element. It took itself seriously, had good 'rules', and the look to it was original; a hard thing to accomplish these days. #2. Great script. There were one or two moments of lacking dialogue (Balthazar just wasn't threatening and this showed it off), but the rest of it really shined. #3. Special effects. They were terrific. The look was unique, and the tricks they pulled off haven't been done a dozen times over. #4. Great characters. Keanu Reeves as a bitter anti-hero. Rachel Weisz as a woman thrown into the supernatural with unbelieving eyes. Shia LaBeouf as the plucky apprentice looking to prove himself, with GREAT comic timing. Shia has a gift, and he got to show it off. Well done, Shia. Peter Sormare as the Devil himself, who couldn't have done a better job. #5. The details. Keep your eyes open when you see this flick. So much heart and work went into the small work of detail that I was beside myself, I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. Go see it. Go. See. It. It won't win many Oscars, but it certainly won a place in my movie collection. Now to wait for the Director's Cut..."

","Not knowing that Constantine is an adaption of a comic book, I can say I enjoyed watching the movie.<br/><br/>It was scary but not to scary. It was funny but not to funny. The movie was dark, but again not too dark.<br/><br/>The demons trying to get into the world, to get the balance between heaven and hell out of balance where realized well.<br/><br/>The scene where the devil takes out the tar of John Constantine's lungs and tells him ""You will live"" was really good.<br/><br/>Because I don't know the comic book an which the movie is based on I can't make a statement of how good, bad or neutral the movie is. But I can recommend the movie."

","I don't know what's the critics' problems are, maybe they recall ""St. Augustine In Hell"" from Sting and realise from David Foxx' monologue/soliloquy that critics are part of Hades' heavy diet, but for me this movie rocks as much as the first Matrix and the 1st half of the 2nd Matrix (the rest stunk plot-wise, but that's another story)! This was a great way for Keanu to break away from the encoding of that technobabbble, something far more organic yet just as philosophic...<br/><br/>Can you really blame the character of becoming a lung cancer victim before he reaches 40? After seeing all of the demons that he has? They say the cleft on your top lip is an angel's finger-imprint to remind you not to let on what you were taught in Heaven before you came to Earth, but while John may have that cleft they forgot to repress his knowledge and it nearly drove him insane - in fact, his parents thought he was and he nearly lost his life for it.<br/><br/>This movie is heavily Catholic, so those who get offended by that kind of dogma, run, OK? On the other hand, if you are Catholic this flick may offend you, too, it requires some real open-mindedness! For me, Rachel Weisz is highly over-rated, she lacked the oomph of sexual tension that was supposedly implied with Keanu/Constantine - she did a better job in ""Runaway Jury"" and the ""Mummy"" series - what she did show is that she can be a great replacement for the current actress handling Witchblade...<br/><br/>Keanu as the tortured exorcist is excellent (I understand the original character was British, so what? Sometimes ignorance is bliss! I know the original Blade in ""Tomb Of Dracula"" comics and the upgrade in film is WAY better) and his dismissive attitude to demons even under attack is astounding yet hilarious - the usual reaction to any Garth Ennis endeavor! Garth created ""Hitman,"" ""Preacher,"" among others in the comics and their content usually makes demons blush, and if he's handling the translation of his character from book to screen then step back and give him some slack! Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite was good too but under-utilised and i hope he's exploited more if sequels are in the offing, as there should be! I liked how Hell is ruled by ""Lou"" who looks like a Sopranos-reject, but the classic part and essential Garth Ennis was when Constantine was floating to heaven and he gave Lucifer the finger! I would watch the movie over and over just to savour the irony of that part of the picture, LMAO/ROTF This picture is also a great way to scare people into stop smoking, I say it's a great picture all around and get out and see for yourself today! http://www.tinyurl.com/3464k/"

","A well done movie. It was exactly what I was expecting: a cool supernatural-hero movie with a film noir feel. Reeves did a good job at playing a character most don't seem to do right.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a comic-book called Hellblazer I believe. I have not read the comic, but I have heard about it. As far as I can tell, this is a LOOSE translation (which would make sense why they changed the name) of the comic books, but a well done movie in it's own right. Unfortunately, with only a 2 hour running time, and a lot of material to cover, most of the supporting characters feel thin and placed for the convienience of the main characters. If you look closely however, those supporting character do have a good amount of depth in what little screen time they receive. A good year 2005 start in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>P.S. Of course the movie is cheesy. Hell, Star Wars is cheesy, Indiana Jones is Cheesy, James Bond is cheesy, E.T. is super cheesy. Who cares if it's cheesy; this movie was well made, well acted, good looking, and cool (if a tad thin on plot details)."

"Homeric","8","12","30","27 February 2005"," See it if you like the genre.
","Depending on how you view the subject matter and films based on comic books, this is either a movie you will love or hate. I've seen it twice already so you know where I stand. I thought the special effects were well done and the dialog to be above par for this type of movie (comic book). As for the acting, there are some very good performances which have been mentioned in other comments. However, regarding Keanu Reeves, I think that there must be some sort of hate club out there that has no other goal in mind other than to denigrate his acting. Granted he is not of the Robert DeNiro school of acting. Keanu is Keanu much the same as John Wayne was always John Wayne, Eastwood is always Eastwood, etc etc. And that is fine if you like his screen persona. I do, and I think he plays the title role with the right amount of sarcasm, fatigue, and a world weariness that comes across just fine. For those who continue to hammer on his performances, well everyone to his or her own opinion. He is of the stoic acting school and that is just as legitimate as the over-the-top-emoting school that you see from most actors nowadays. As I said in the beginning, if you like the subject matter (hell, damnation, demons, angels, etc) and like movies that are based on comic books (impossible yet engaging) and aren't a Keanu hater, then you will probably enjoy this film. PS there is also some very good chemistry between Keanu and Rachel Weisz."
"JohnnyLighting","8","12","30","27 February 2005"," Its great for what it is
","This movie is great for the special effects, the comic based plot, the acting of many supporting characters, and the fact that the only character Keanu plays well (the sort of Neo-esque troubled bad-ass) is a great fit in this movie. <br/><br/>Don't go to see this movie for drama or comedy, cuz that's just foolish. <br/><br/>Those that have some knowledge of the comics I imagine would enjoy it more since limited background is given. Ultimately, I went in curious to see what people were calling ""an even more religious Matrix"" and came out glad I saw it and planning on buying it on DVD eventually.<br/><br/>It is very Matrix-like in the sense of awesome special effects, Keanu playing a character who fights characters that are stronger than human, and some interesting fight scenes. But that's a good thing, not a bad thing."

","I really did enjoy this movie. For real reasons I don't know why, people might say it's like the matrix, but so what. Keanu Reeves is a great actor, and fit perfectly for the role of John Constantine because of his 'cool' attitude. The sense of 'jerkness' seemed natural, making it more believable. The special effects were outstanding, I was very impressed. But whatever, I enjoyed the Movie a lot. But then again I liked the Hulk and a lot of people didn't. Look at it this way... Both movies likely to be made into a sequel... Both open up the character, introduce him... and the sequel will be like BAM BAM FLA WAM!!! awesome you know?"

","I don't know what all the negativity is about concerning this film. I'm a comic book geek and a comic book artist and writer and I had no problem with the film or any liberties taken in reference to the book. I thought it was a good interpretation and above all that, I thought it was a pretty cool flick. Very different. Not quite an action pick, not quite a thriller and not quite a horror film... but more like a good mesh of the three. The pacing could have been better, but overall I liked the style of the film, I liked the dialogue and I even think Keanu Reeves did a good job (in light of being miscast). Same kind of feel Michael Keaton gave us in Batman... He did a very good job, but he's NOT Batman, no matter what. Anyway, it was worth my money, worth my time and I'll probably buy the darn DVD as well."

","If everyone hates Keanu so much, how come the movies hes in do so well at the box office? Every actor has their own style, creativity, and talent. And heres to all the people who complain about his role in Constantine, ask yourself this, could you have played the part better? Keanu has a very unique acting style, natural like,subtle humor, believable. He doesn't act like hes full of ****. Its hard to explain. He just really gets in character. So he may not be 100% like the John Constantine you all know of in the comics, but hes Hollywoods John Constantine, and how it was pulled off, NOT COMPARING TO THE COMIC, but as for a movie, was done really well. Its not so much about comparing, but more like change, taking the ideas and story, and making it more real-life, like Constantine is a real person. I defend this movie because I feel the director and Keanu worked real hard and did a great job. And people today are way too cocky and cant appreciate anything creative. I don't call it criticism, I call it people who expect to see a movie they have in their own mind, and it isn't, so they bash it. Just step back and take a look at the movie, the characters, the scenes, settings, lighting, special effects, ideas, colors, music, story, details (from the water jugs of holy water in his apartment all around the perimeter, to the hair of the scared guy turning gray and freaking out). Everything in the movie was well thought of for its own good. All together the movie is an full 10."

Maybe if I were familiar with the comics.<br/><br/>The photography was not as bad as some modern horror has been (such as House of the Dead) but the direction was trying a bit too hard to do something that looks 'cool.' Luckily, this sort of direction only lasted for certain sections, mostly the beginning.<br/><br/>The potential for the story could be interesting, except the lack of explanation and the minimal dialog approach makes this impossible.<br/><br/>The cast is capable.

","I understand why Catholicism is so popular in Hollywood - it looks majestic, it has strange rituals and exorcism, it has Popes and big cathedrals, it contains some very contradicting moments and it does pay much attention to such things as daemons and so on. This movie is a typical Hollywood mishmash of it all, plus some crazy Hinduistic ideas and plus some wild ideas of mojo, talismans and so on. Keanu Reeves looks so tired, pathetic and vapid here as if he was dragged to play here against his will. Tilda Swynton does not help, either, and even great Peter Stormare looks very badly here. Anyone, did you understand the main idea of that film? Me not. I consider this film a total waste of time, celluloid and money. The video effects are so bad, too, that they merely made me laugh. Did they? Anyone who liked this, please, say why it was made, in the first place? And I especially abhor the very idea that Satan may be stronger than God, like he was in this brute of a film. Surely, Hollywood has very poor ideas about the Bible. Learn it, guys!"
"ghoulieguru","5","5","10","29 December 2005"," Keanustantine's Excellent Adventure
","How do you take an amazingly simple concept like HELLBLAZER and turn it into a ridiculously mundane and uninspired movie? Just cast Keanu Reeves. Evidently, Warner Brothers thought that the success of the MATRIX was due to Keanu's acting. They failed to realize that most of the credit should be going to the Wachowski brothers for having the keen insight to cast Keanu as an emotionally vacant Kung Fu master. Keanu is really good at looking emotionally vacant. But when it comes to a character like John Constantine, it would have been nice to cast someone who can actually act.<br/><br/>For anyone that doesn't know it, this movie is based on a long-running comic book series by DC that revolves around John Constantine. Constantine is basically a modern-day incarnation of an old Raymond Chandler gumshoe that chases down demons instead of criminals. It's a great concept, which is why the comic book has a huge cult following. In the comic, John Constantine is a tortured, craggy, rugged man with white/blonde hair. The way that he's drawn usually makes me think of Rutger Hauer and Roy Batty. <br/><br/>This thing was doomed the moment they cast Keanu Reeves. It's not just the fact that Keanu's hair is black. I'm not that much of a purist. I didn't have a hissy fit when they cast Tom Cruise as Lestat. A little peroxide will do wonders for the hair color, but what Tom had going for him was the fact that he can act. Keanu, unfortunately, cannot. He's like the male version of Tara Reid. Keanu should really just resign himself to being a bimbo. He should just stand around and look pretty, that's about all he's good for. His acting is always flat and boring. The only movie where I remember actually liking his performance was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. And that was probably because he was just playing himself... a stoner. And it was also probably because I was also like 6 years old when I saw it. <br/><br/>The movie itself has some good moments, and the storyline is vaguely interesting, but I really just couldn't buy Keanu as a tough guy. It's impossible for me to say whether this movie could have been better if they'd cast someone else as Constantine, because Keanu is on screen for most of the movie. His stoner voice is so distinct, it's really difficult to ignore. The storyline had potential, and the guy that played Papa Midnight was perfect, but every time that Keanu was on screen the movie just lost all of its momentum. So, whoever decided to cast Keanu as Constantine should be fired. He or she is single-handedly responsible for destroying what could have been a huge franchise for Warner Brothers."

","it was an OK film i suppose but after reading a lot of good reviews i was looking forward to an early blockbuster hit. i was wrong. OK admittedly the special effects were quite impressive for a february release and the acting from rachel weisz was very good. keanu reeves on the other hand was awful. does he just act off of a teleprompter? it may as well be like he's reading a book or off a piece of paper. he is a diabolical actor and doesn't deserve the high standard of actor. he is worse than his sidekick chas in the film. chas (real name Shila laBoef) was quite good as a sidekick. he was a good entertaining character. but john constantine was dull and dreary. very borin. I've seen laBoef in a few other films such as I, Robot (bit part) and Holes. (i think that was him). and he really showed potential in I, Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen. like Colin Farell cos he sounds like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he acts. this boy has a great deal of potential and talent. he shud go far. but the film is entertaining in parts like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window. literally. there was many plot holes. very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the Gothic tales of hell and the devil. 6 out of ten for the graphics"
"lcfrontenac","9","15","41","16 February 2005"," What movie did YOU see?
","It seems most of the people posting comments here saw a different movie than I did. <br/><br/>Although, I suppose if they went in expecting a typical horror movie as produced over the last 25 years (an over-the-top gore/splatter-fest whose primary purpose is to showcase the dubious ""talent"" of the makeup and SFX techs, linked with a weak excuse for a ""plot"" and chock-full of equally gratuitous nudity and profanity that serve no purpose other than to distract viewers from noticing there is no real story), they would be obviously disappointed. The makeup and SFX in ""Constantine"" exist in total service to the story, and not vice versa.<br/><br/>""Constantine"" is an intelligent, well-written, well-acted, fast-paced and visually stunning apocalyptic story, which also offers (as an added bonus to those with an attention span longer that that of a gnat) an exploration of metaphysics and Christian theology. The plot is coherent, though intricate, and it definitely helps if the viewer PAYS ATTENTION to what's going on.<br/><br/>The film takes the rather standard plot of ... ""Dark forces are gathering. Something Big and Bad is about to happen. It's up to Our Hero to figure it out and thwart the Villain's plans"" ...and does interesting and unpredictable things en route to the resolution. <br/><br/>Plot twists abound, the pace is quick, and dead spots (no pun intended) are virtually nonexistent. And the characterization of the Devil's chosen Earthly manifestation in the climactic scene was the scariest/creepiest portrayal I've ever seen. <br/><br/>And my initial trepidation about Keanu in the title role was put to rest when I attended the preview panel at San Diego ComiCon last summer. I watched the montage of scenes and clips that were presented, and heard Keanu Reeves, co-star Djimon Honsou (Papa Midnight) and director Francis Lawrence give their views and insights into the characters and their motivations, and left feeling much more comfortable about their approach to the project. I'm pleased to report that the confidence in the success of their endeavor that I felt when I left the presentation proved justified when I attended the screening last week.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a real 'thinking-person's"" horror movie that's effective on multiple levels, look no further than ""Constantine"". <br/><br/>But if you're just looking for the typical blood-and-guts flash without the bothersome sizzle of an actual story, keep on moving. There's nothing for YOU to see here."
"stu9003","7","11","28","22 February 2005"," Dude, this one ain't bad
","A pleasant surprise. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ordinary guy who leads a very extraordinary life dealing in exorcisms and the occult. According to the story, both heaven and hell are real, as are demons and angels, both of whom not only exist, but they even walk the earth. Most people can't see them, but for some reason John Constantine was born with the ability to see demons and angels for what they really are. After a suicide attempt briefly sends a young Constantine to hell, John learns more about heaven and hell than your average everyday guy was ever supposed to know. He also knows that, as a suicide, that he's damned to spend the afterlife in hell so he devotes his life to earning his way back into heaven by performing exorcisms and protecting our world from demons.<br/><br/>The movie gets marketed as a sort of action-horror film, but the truth is that it's neither. First of all, it's not scary. There are no real frights involved and hell is presented in too much of a matter-of-fact manner to be considered scary. And the movie is all about ideas, story and dialogue, rather than action. In situations where you'd usually expect a knock 'em out action sequence, you instead find a compelling conversation. Some people may be put off by this, but I liked it.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me was Keanu Reeves' performance. I've never been much of a fan of the actor and I walked into the theater expecting to find Keanu lacking as Constantine but I really got into his portrayal of Constantine. I suppose if I were to nitpick I might say that he looked a tad too healthy to be playing a man dying of lung cancer. An actor with a more rugged complexion might have been more believable. It's a minor complaint though.<br/><br/>On the down side, there's a few dangling plot threads that are never really explained. Also, the ending wasn't bad, but Constantine seemed way out of character. I just couldn't see it happening.<br/><br/>Overall, though, a good movie. 7/10"

","Warning: Mild Spoilers. I will admit I had doubts about seeing Constantine. However, on the advice of a friend I saw the film and left the theater feeling quite content. I thought it was definitely above par for a comic book adaptation and for most fantasy action flicks. The acting is actually quite good, even Reeves delivers a character with believable depth despite what others might say. However it is the supporting cast which delivers the best performances, the characters played by Weisz, Hounsou, Swinton, and Stormare where enough to leave me wanting to see more of them on screen. The writing was also clearly done by a Hollywood outsiders: it didn't follow very many clichés and I was surprised when characters and plot twists surprised me with things seldom seen in Hollywood movies. Last but not least the special effects where excellent: the demon effects, breaking glass, bullet time-like effects when time stops, and Hell itself were all excellent. Hell is especially cool looking so it is fortunate it is visited quite a bit. I definitely recommend seeing this film if you can go with an open mind."

It would have been better set in England with and English actor (Paul Bettany for instance), but for an americanized version it was good. I disagree with a lot of the comments I have read. The plot was well thought out, based on some of the comic stories, and the characters (except Chas) were well done. For the complainers, Constantine is supposed to be an jerk. If anything he was much mellower in the movie. I hope it does well. Even with it's flaws it's more intelligent than many horror or action movies produced today."

"Quinoa1984","7","3","5","3 May 2008"," certain things- like an uncommonly bad-ass Keanu Reeves- make this better than it has any right to be
","I'm not sure if Francis Lawrence is really up to par to make any kind of great movie, having now seen his first film Constantine and his mega-hit follow-up I Am Legend. But he can make a pretty entertaining spectacle of the dark and supernatural, and add a certain edge that comes most likely for those who are thirsting for it after being out of the desert of Man vs. Satan pictures. In this case John Constantine- inspired by a comic book from the 80s (which had the hero looking like Sting and Satan looking like David Bowie)- is a demon hunter, an exorcisor, and also a hardcore chain smoker who will probably kill himself from lung cancer before getting snuffed by some out-of-the-dark demon. He is called upon by a cop (Rachel Weisz) to investigate what appears to be a suicide of her sister (twin, not too oddly enough) but is really murder. How will Constantine find out? How will she? What will she be needed for? <br/><br/>If you don't put a whole lot of thought into some of the logistics, obviously, Constantine is a very fun movie, and chock-full of ultra hellish special effects, some keen one-liners (""Everybody leave now... go to hell.""), and an unusually cool and on-spot performance from Keanu Reeves. While he might've given more of his somewhat limited worth for the Matrix movies, it's here that one sees him trying, and nearly succeeding, a Dirty Harry imitation in the form of a kind of Christopher Walken ala the Prophecy character. It helps since there's some very good supporting work from Weisz, Tilda Swinton as a vengeful angel, and Dijmon Honsu as a witch doctor (Shia Lebouf appears as a driver and is probably the weakest link). The coup is casting Peter Stormare as Satan, however, appearing in only some make-up and a heavy ham-bone performance.<br/><br/>So for all you looking for plenty of action with those that come from hell, this is a good flick to catch now that it's showing a lot of cable. It's fast-paced but takes its time as a story, and it has atmosphere coming out of its ears, probably the best gift that Lawrence can bestow (he also has it in spades with I Am Legend, albeit the visual effects are actually better HERE than in the Smith vehicle). It would be a guilty pleasure to rank with Ghost Rider if it weren't somewhat pretty well crafted. 7.5/10"
"Rekallism","9","3","5","13 January 2007"," Constantine versus the (Dare) Devil.
","This film, along with other worthy adaptations such as Hellboy and Sin City, does do the comics/graphic novels some justice.<br/><br/>It is understandable that many a comic collector may find that Keanu Reeves was not the correct casting to play a Blonde Liverpudlian Chain smoking Sting lookalike, but can you honestly find any other Actor that could possibly flesh out a character such as this? I cannot understand however how this film can be so criticised. I like to base my film viewing/appreciation/opinion on firstly watching the film, appreciating it on merit, enjoying for films sake before wanting to rip it to pieces. I ENJOYED THIS FILM! I say this because if you compare Constantine to the abomination that was Daredevil (2003), you can honestly say that Constantine is vastly superior.<br/><br/>I try to base this comment also on the fact that many people who may have seen the film (and other comic book movies in the past and the very foreseeable future) have never read the HELLBLAZER comics themselves...so what do they have to base THEIR opinions on?? Peter Stormare also gives a blistering performance as 'Satan', it is just a shame he seems to be so typecast in many movies."

","Just to think that such battles are going on everyday around our lives makes you think that there's a whole other dimension that is fighting tooth and nail for your soul. Your soul is so valuable that a war rages around you fighting for it.<br/><br/>If you are an agnostic, surely a film like this would open the door to the possibility of such a conflict. <br/><br/>Here's some background information on angels and demons that helps to better understand the motivations of the characters in this film:<br/><br/>Satan, the most beautiful angel God ever created, so much wanted to be ruler of the universe that he convinced a third of God's angels to join him in polluting the world God had created.<br/><br/>Satan showed these fallen angels the forbidden act of sex. And not with only with humans, but sex with every conceivable animal and insect. Satan promised them pleasure and to make them rulers of the universe. They could have and control whatever they wanted and didn't have to worship God any longer.<br/><br/>Satan failed in his mission to became all master and decided in taking it out on mankind, he did everything he could to drive a wedge between God and humanity. For every soul Satan gets, he celebrates and lets his demons (former angels) torment these souls night and day, hurting them in every possible way. Physical and mental pain.<br/><br/>God gave us a way out of Satan's tricks but few take the path. Films like Constantine remind us the horror that awaits us all if we choose the wrong path. While Satan is brilliant, he thought that God was sending Mankind's savior on earth and that if he could get the children of Israel to reject this person called ""Jesus"", most of the battle would be done and God would have to give up earth to Satan's control where he would own mankind and do with them as he wished.<br/><br/>But God is smarter. He knew that there's no way He could send Jesus to earth and allow man's freewill to accept Jesus. It just wasn't going to happen. Satan knows Biblical scripture as well as does God and felt that God was wasting his time.<br/><br/>The only chance God had was to allow Jesus to preach the word and and heal the sick and bring back the dead. Satan was ready for that. He drove the Temple Jews to ask the Romans to kill Jesus thus ending this whole problem.<br/><br/>But what Satan missed was that Jesus acted as a final sacrifice for all of mankind, forgiving them all of their sins and anytime the people of God sinned, they could call to God for his forgiveness as hi final act of mercy on earth.<br/><br/>Satan didn't see this coming and was beyond angry. Now, mankind had a way out and Satan would have to fight a new battle on a new battlefield, making his job much harder. Gone were the silly stupid phoney Gods of Zeus, etc. now he would have to square off with the Son of God himself.<br/><br/>The film had a lot of great visuals but veered from the Bible in a number of ways that could easily have been fixed. Gabriel should not have been portrayed in that manner and should have been played as a female. <br/><br/>The film is definitely better than the comic book with its' rambling storyline and theological universe. In the comics, Constantine lives in a world where all the gods and their pantheons exist simultaneously.<br/><br/>The film-makers came very close to making an excellent film. Nevertheless, it's still scary and I recommend it."
"AlecWingerd","7","3","5","2 February 2006"," Cinematographically very solid, but lousy adaptation
","First off, I'd like to say that Keanu Reeves is terribly miscast. Not because he's a monotone-voiced ham actor a lot of times, but because he looks nowhere near the guy he's supposed to depict. John Constantine's a blond, often poorly shaved, trench coat wearing mage. Yes, mage. He does perform exorcisms on a regular basis, but it's nowhere near his main line of work as this movie would illustrate.<br/><br/>I love the graphic novel, like I do with other things coming from DC, Alan Moore's work in general, like the 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', 'From Hell' and John Constantine of course. Especially with Constantine here, we have a case of Comic Book Genocide on our hands.<br/><br/>In this movie, John Constantine is a compulsive smoker destined to end up in hell, who lives a life replete with good deeds in the name of the Lord in order to try and secure himself a place in heaven.<br/><br/>I think the movie nails things right on; it succeeds pretty well in showing that the man in question is trying his best to come over altruistic, although at heart he is self-centered. Needless to say, Keanu Reeves seems to fall slightly short (despite an.... okay performance) as the cast supporting him consists of actors with greater talent. The first name springing to mind would be that of Rachel Weisz, who had showed her great aptitude for acting in films like 'the Constant Gardener', which is actually slightly newer than this one. Hers is the power to show a multitude of emotions with her eyes alone. Then there is Peter Stormare, who has an aptitude for playing Russian bad guys. His Lucifer was carried almost with divine evanesce. No joke. Gavin Rossdale, the pompous half-demon Balthazar, did a great job. Rossdale, a composer at heart, has great heart for rhythm, his was the power to implement slithery, almost flamboyantly 'homosexual' flair to his character. He had little screen time, but he was a love to behold.<br/><br/>My favorites however were Tilda Swanton's Gabriel and Shia LaBoeuf's Chas, the first scene with both granting the movie a bit of comic relief. Tilda really makes a suit look good, and she knows what she is doing. You might know her from hits like 'Vanilla Sky' or 'The Beach' and you'll be able to see her again in the new adaptation of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' too. Shia is a wonderful young actor that uses his boyish charm to the max in order to play the role of slightly gullible sidekick. One might recognize him from I-Robot, where he wants to borrow Will Smith's car to seduce his 'fine ass yummy ass hot spankable'.<br/><br/>Constantine has a complement of fine actors, it manages to spurt a good amount of character development; the actors have something to play with and they are not afraid to do so. Yes, there are some 'cringe-moments' when Keanu is forced to speak his character's past, but those can be forgiven. Unfortunately, the heart of the film relies a lot on visual effects. Fortunately however, the CGI and the FX guys seem to actually have an idea what the heck they are doing, because these effects are mostly pretty good. Especially the scenes that involve 'hell' are very beautiful and one of my favorite new movie moments. Also, and this is mostly a very bad thing, this movie is full with conflicting stylistic elements, but somehow in Constantine it works pretty fine, although some locations look forced and much too sudden.<br/><br/>There are also references, maybe, probably even, to other movies. The Spear of Destiny that was lost after World War II also had a mention in the 2004 hit Hellboy, where Adolf Hitler allegedly obtained the 'Spear of Longinus' (a different name for the same thing) after which his strength increased tenfold. In Constantine, this spear plays a crucial role in the plot. Stylistic elements include, but are not limited to, biblical references in the shape of set pieces (a painting showing the skewering of Jesus with the Spear of Longinus for example). All in all, this movie delivers a complete, intricate and captivating universe. Some of it is nonsense, but that doesn't really take any of the fun away.<br/><br/>My only problem, the movie's only problem, its obstinate negligence of the Alan Moore's source material, can only be solved if you are willing to brave it yourself. For example, if Constantine is your favorite Graphic Novel character and you cannot bear seeing him transformed in - pretty much - some other character with similar name, you need to give this movie a very wide birth. If you're not too bent on seeing a truthful adaptation, you might want to try this out. *** out of ****"

","Costantine is yet another Hollywood attempt to adapt a comic book into a movie. I myself have never read them so I am speaking for the majority of you who have not read it.<br/><br/>First, the acting in this movie was good and bad at times. Rachael Weiss is great as usual and Keanu Reeves is fair in this role because his character doesn't have to have emotions. However, when his character is supposed to have emotions, Reeves is wooden. This is an acting and/or directing flaw. Some of supporting cast outshine him, but if you're a casual movie watcher, you won't notice.<br/><br/>Second, the dark atmosphere is good but it's a little too dark at times, meaning hard too see. The photography has been done in Dark City and The Matrix already. The graphic are good but not anything new. Some fight scenes are good, but some fall flat. The plot is confusing for those who don't pay attention to details.The characters are somewhat sympathetic. It is entertaining and sometimes intriguing.<br/><br/>My Rating 6/10"

","I must admit that I am totally unfamiliar with the comic book that inspired this movie. However, I found it enjoyable in a Sci-Fi, supernatural way. Reeves plays Constantine with the same demeanor that he played Neo in ""Matrix"" after he figured out that his power was only limited by his imagination. Here, as John Constantine, he is the best fighter of evil spirits. When a priest is not successful exorcising an evil spirit, they call in John Constantine. He has no fear, he understands the evil spirits, because he was once among them.<br/><br/>John Constantine had died briefly in a state of mortal sin which, according to Catholic theology, sends him straight to Hell. But he didn't stay dead, it was one of those near death experiences, but he still knew that he was eventually going to end up there, and he devoted the rest of his years to keeping the evil spirits away.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays Angela Dodson/Isabel Dodson, Djimon Hounsou plays Midnite, Pruitt Taylor Vince is good as Father Hennessy, and versatile Peter Stormare is Satan . I can't say that, when the movie was over, I understood everything. But the visuals are so good, it made the movie a worthwhile watch for me.<br/><br/>My wife just thought it was a bit strange."

","Chances are they are die-hard fans of the Hellblazer comics/graphic novels. Chances are you've never even heard of Hellblazer. Even less likely is the chance that you've ever even seen one and/or are familiar with the story and its main character, John Constantine.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining movie. It's a very cool story done very well -- regardless of what Hellblazer fans say. I don't care if the movie is true to the comic and I don't care if Keanu Reeves plays the role of Constantine accurately -- and neither should you.<br/><br/>Reeves isn't Russell Crowe or Geoffrey Rush. He doesn't have to be -- especially in a movie like this. Much like his work as Neo, he does enough with John Constantine to give the average movie-goer an enjoyable experience. This movie was a pleasant surprise and much better than I thought it would be -- considering the many critics. 8/10"
"bob-rutzel","7","3","5","24 July 2005"," It was okay
","Constantine (Reeves) committed suicide (Catholics go direct to Hell when this happens) when he was a boy and was brought back in a deal with Heaven to send demons who have crossed the line (to our world) back to Hell. By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven. Why he was brought back is not known but he has the ear of both Heaven (Gabriel) and Hell. Now, too many demons are crossing over and Constantine believes the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God.<br/><br/>The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that Christ died when he was speared by the Roman soldier. Whoever holds this spear controls the world. The spear was lost, of course, and found for this movie. It's impact was short lived and it's easier to name a sequel Constantine 2, rather than the Spear of Destiny 2. You may remember Constantine, but not the short lived spear that really didn't have the impact I thought this story would give it. This story was too much concerned with sending demons back to Hell. I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny. I can't wait. Can you? <br/><br/>If the sound on my DVD version was any better I might have enjoyed this more. Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said. You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have helped, but it didn't' the countless times I rewound. Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with ""what did he say?"" But, I got the idea and that is enough, I suppose. Maybe I just had a bad DVD. Maybe.<br/><br/>However, everything was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was outstanding and a few demons startled me when I least expected it. Those I heard clearly wouldn't you know. The story got more complicated when Lucifer arrives on the scene near the end, almost like it was another story entirely and I got lost for a moment (sound, remember?) or two, but I got the idea, I think, maybe. Now, if I told you why he appeared that would not be any fun.<br/><br/>But, all in all, not bad. Not scary, and the suspense was not really there for a suspense movie. Is it just me or is Keanu Reeves getting better? He did a really good job. But, no ""whoa."" I missed that."
"Rob_Taylor","7","3","5","9 June 2005"," Constant...something or other.
","Although I have a confession to make - I actually found this movie passably entertaining - I have to say that it does have its faults.<br/><br/>The first is Keanu Reeves. The character he plays here is almost a carbon copy of Neo from the Matrix - even Robot Chicken makes fun of his acting range. There's almost no differentiation in his acting between the two movies. Whilst this may work for some actors - Arnie, John Wayne etc. - here it only serves to make him him appear, much like the comic this movie is based on, as two-dimensional. If you had to look at a list of Hollywood actors and pick an action-hero from them, Keanu is surely not going to be your first choice. He's more like an accountant than a hero.<br/><br/>Despite his miscasting, the movie, thanks mainly to the effects and pacing, moves along quite well. Also, supporting parts do a lot to make this movie more enjoyable than it should be, with Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djmon Honsou all giving far better showings than poor old Keanu.<br/><br/>The story is forgettable religious clap-trap involving heaven and hell. Apparently Hollywood can only think of Christianity when it comes to good and evil. What that says about Hollywood I don't know, but it's a theme that constantly resurfaces time and again. Suffice to say, ignore acting, plot and dialogue and the movie is enjoyable. Think too hard about any of it and the irritation will creep in.<br/><br/>Summary: Switch of thine brain and go forth and observe this film. Thy will be done (out of a few quid, anyway)."

"mercy740","10","24","75","7 February 2005"," Disturbing, dark and ultimately rewarding
","This is an extremely disturbing movie....and I can understand why many people don't like it. It's not crowd-pleasing and it contains some topics that would make a Catholic blush. But it is a movie that will stay long in your mind. <br/><br/>I won't go into what the story is all about, there are going to be plenty of people who will be doing that. <br/><br/>But I'll list what I like (spoilers ahead): 1. Keanu Reeves is great here. I've read some issues of the comic Constantine, and Reeves does make the character come across. Note that Constantine is indeed a cynical, arrogant, jaded, mostly unlikeable character with a spark of humanity hovering just below the surface. This last is most apparent in his later dealings with Angela. <br/><br/>I have to say this is Keanu's best performance to date.<br/><br/>2. Rachel Weisz - she's absolutely great. It's a very human performance - the everyman foil to the brooding Constantine.<br/><br/>3. The CGI - fantabulous. The images you see here will be seared in your brain long after. I found myself wishing for prolonged scenes of hell. <br/><br/>4. The soldier demons and the bee-demon - marvelous creations.<br/><br/>5. The angel Gabriel - Tilda Swinton in a completely scene-stealing role, as the angel who decides to take matters in his own hands. <br/><br/>Things I thought could have been done better: 1. The storyline. A little confusing at first. Then more and more is revealed, and it all comes together.<br/><br/>2. The climax - it's a dogma climax, of discussion and theology, not a shoot-em-up explosion climax. <br/><br/>3. The supporting characters have too little screen time - Chaz, Papa Midnight, Beeman. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a very unusual and disturbing movie. Well worth your time, to challenge your dogma, if nothing else. It's steeped in Christian lore about redemption, suicide, heaven and hell. I've personally never seen anything like it."

","I haven't read the Hellblazer comic books by DC/Vertigo, so I do not know much about the John Constantine character, or how the show deviates from the comic books.<br/><br/>However, without background knowledge, this is one excellent movie, with great characterization of biblical characters like Archangel Gabriel, Balthazar and even Lucifer himself, plot and subplots, special effects and music. The movie starts literally with a bang, and it never lets up after that with its even pacing.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves has proved that once again he is master. To his detractors, I'd say hold your horses, watch this show, and chances are you'll be a fan convert. Rachel Weisz, wow.<br/><br/>Hell has never looked as good (!) as what's shown in this movie. The effects are world class, and brings forth to glory and life, the demons and damned creatures from hell.<br/><br/>The Constantine Theme provides the noir, a dash of suave and attitude to the movie and when it's on, you just know something awesome's about to happen.<br/><br/>Stay till the end of the movie, it'll show you the aftermath of one of the characters."

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys supernatural films and a bit of tongue in cheek scripting. Well done Keanu;) Also the portrayal of the devil at the end and the scenes of hell as he is bounced back and forth between death and the living is pretty weird as it portrays suicide, if done correctly, does not have to be life ending."

The way Keanu is introduced at the beginning is ingenious with the top angle. I also like the demons, they are pretty cool spectacles. For being a first time movie direct Lawrence shows some great potential.

Reeves seem to bring Neo into this movie, which was a bad. Some of his acting went bad, when he tried to be too serious. Shia LaBeouf's character Chas Chandler was good, very good acting from him. Problem? Yes, he dies in the movie for not much of an explained reason. Tilda Swinton's character Gabriel kills him by slamming him into the ceiling 2 or 3 times!? I am not too sure why, I guess it was to allow Lucifer's son to come to our earth. But LaBeouf's character was very enjoyable; I am not too sure why he had to be removed. Also the ending kind of sucked, Rachel Weisz character Angela Dodson ignores Constantine proposal to date him. She walks away, and then the audience booed her. Why would she walk away after he sacrifices his life to save her? Now for Peter Stormare, as Satan he was kind of cool, but they could of given him the classic devil goatee look and a black tux instead of white. He looked more like a God like character then the devil himself. His acting, perfect and humorous, Lucifer's licking on Constantine was very funny and disturbing at the same time. So all in all it was a great movie, but very hard to understand if you haven't read the bible."

He fit the role really well, or maybe he made the role fit him, since I know that the comic book character is a little different (eg- the comic book Constantine is British).<br/><br/>Anyway, overall I thought the movie was pretty great, and I'll probably head out to see it again with friends when it comes out in theaters."

I changed my hair and no one thinks I'm any smarter. I told her to shut up about the haircut, already.<br/><br/>I said how that was so he would not totally distract the audience with his clown hair, and we could all focus on how pathetic Keanu Reeves is.<br/><br/>Even with him supposed to being dying, he was still old and lame and a very bad actor, hard to care about. He was really boring, so I was just waiting for him to die. And waiting, and waiting! I couldn't stand it.<br/><br/>Somebody should have had a chainsaw. Early on.<br/><br/>The girl in it was not bad.

","With due respect, watching this film in theatre for nearly two hours is kinda torture to the mind and eyes. I'm not a fan of the comic book, in fact I never read them; I only saw the movie for Keanu Reeves since he is one my favorite actors. And to tell the truth, it is the most intolerable Keanu film after ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"". It's not that he acted badly here, he tried his best to play a character who is nothing like him (a patient of chronic pulmonary emphysema all well-built and handsome?), it's just that the film is so baseless and crazy and monotonous and filled with unnecessary gore and unrelated action sequences, the overall effect is unsatisfactory. And the ending? so cheap and mindless. It's a relief after all that there's no romantic interest between Constantine and Angela.<br/><br/>I know I'm not supposed to criticize the original comic book which the movie is based upon, but it can't be avoided. Why is Keanu wasting himself being in such B-grade movies? This role loosely resembles his role in the Matrix trilogy-- savior of mankind, that white shirt and black suit, the haircut, the accent... all the same. And for Rachel Weisz, she is brilliant in this film. But that's not the point. It's not good to see these two fairly good actors of our time in these kind of mindless action/horror junk. We like to see them in quality films, not always drama, romance etc but in all genres.<br/><br/>Points to see this movie:- Good special effects, fairly good acting throughout, nice background music etc. Let's not discuss the points that are not in favor of it. They are plenty!"

","It seems like every ten years or so, there's a rush of comic book movies. Lately, those films have been closer to the source material. Then there's Constantine, a movie that most movie fans may not realize was a comic and also a film that fans of the original comic will instantly not want to see because of how different it is. I always wonder, why even spend the money to license the story if you're just going to make your own movie?<br/><br/>Based on DC Comics' Hellblazer, with plot elements taken from the ""Dangerous Habits"" and ""Original Sins"" stories, this movie is all about John Constantine, a magician who can see demons and angels. The character originated in the comic Swamp Thing and was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bisette and John Totleben. Yes, this is another Moore creation that was made into a movie that he probably despises.<br/><br/>I have a weakness for Keanu Reeves showing up in supernatural films, as he always seems bemused by the action that surrounds him.<br/><br/>In Hellblazer, he's helping Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), an LAPD detective investigating the suicide of her twin sister. This, of course, brings him to Hell and into the orbit of Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel, who wants to unleash demons on Earth and Peter Stormare as Lucifer.<br/><br/>This movie is packed with some recognizable actors, like Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's student Chas Kramer, Djimon Hounsou as nightclub owner Papa Midnite and Bush singer Gavin Rossdale as a demon named Balthazar.<br/><br/>The Spear of Destiny used in this movie is more than just the same occult object mentioned in Hellboy. It's the same physical prop, too. That said - the Spear - which was used to stab Jesus' side - has great significance to the DC Universe, as it was how Hitler was able to keep the superpowered heroes of Earth-2 from attacking his country, as Superman should have been able to stop the war with a few punches.<br/><br/>The demon Ellie, who was Constantine's lover, was shot for the movie but is cut out. She was played by Michelle Monaghan.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence would go on to make I Am Legend, three of The Hunger Games films and Red Sparrow."

","I came into this outside of the comic book it is based on (or any comic books), so I had no expectations. I love the movie The Devil's Advocate, which also stars Keanu Reeves, so thought he might also do this justice, even though his acting skills are somewhat limited. And I love Rachel Weisz, although she has never trumped The Constant Gardener, and has carried that character forward, unfortunately. Here, she really tries on a different acting persona, leaving behind that defiant, earnest young woman thing. But it doesn't work and just seems like she is trying to be Reeves' character. I think she probably is a one note actress. I enjoyed, mostly, the basic movie, effects, and makeup. It kept my interest, but the acting was sometimes laughable and the ending is fairly clunky. All the plot/script holes came together for it and it ruined my opinion of the whole movie. It was really horrid. Without the ending, I would give it 7-8 stars. I don't watch a lot of comic book movies, or read any, but it was better than I thought it would be and not a bad way to spend time. Doubt I will watch it again; doesn't have the depth, on any level. I read that it didn't follow the comic it was based on, Hellblazer, very much, but incorporated plot and characters from other comics, and perhaps that is what allowed it to be the movie it is. Not sure a comic could do much but form the stub for a movie plot. I would consider watching the sequel, when it comes out, after checking the reviews."

But something is happening, something that is altering the balance of the world, and John is the only one who stands in the way of it happening.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is perfect as Constantine, a careless but brave man who tries to keep the Earth in balance with power created by God and the Devil. Rachel Weisz is good as Angela, the detective whose twin sister supposedly commits suicide, but the plot thickens as demons try to cross-over onto our plain of existence.

"tburke85","7","2","3","6 June 2009"," Constantine A Decent Comic Book Movie
","Constantine is a decent movie based on the DC/Vertigo comic book Hellblazer from director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend). The movie tells the story of John Constantine a supernatural detective gifted with the curse to see half angels and half demons living amongst us disguised as humans who is mankind's only hope for survival against the sinister forces that threaten their world. Keanu Reeves is solid as the title character portraying a man whose trying to buy his way into heaven for a past mistake by ridding the earth of demons because he doesn't want to damned to hell for eternity. Reeves may not get any nominations for his performance but he does a good job with the role of Constantine. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive as detective Angela Dodson who's investigating the mysterious death of her twin sister and joins forces with Constantine to find out the truth. Weisz continues to show her talent in this movie. Well done. The rest of the cast including Shia Labeouf, Dijimon Honsou, Pruitt Taylor Vincent and Max Baker are admirable in their roles but none of them get much to do and lack screen time. The same can go for Tilda Swinton, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Storemare in a brief cameo role as Satan himself who are decent in their roles but they like some other characters get the short end of the stick. The pacing of the movie did seem a little slow at times too but other then that Constantine is an above average comic book movie brought to the big screen. Its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly not like Spider-man 3 or Punisher War Zone. The special effects are state of the art and the few scenes where hell on Earth is shown are magnificently done. It's a nightmarish landscape overrun by demonic creatures from the darkest pits of hell. The music seemed to match well with what was going on the screen and the tone of the film. This film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is some character development, suspense, a few surprises, solid acting, an interesting story, and cool special effects that make for a good movie to watch. It may not be a classic or a masterpiece but the movie is better than some other ones that failed to entertain."
"rab40","8","2","3","21 September 2006"," A generally entertaining movie
","Maybe some people have a problem with this movie not following the comic, but the fact of the matter is the comic is lame. Comic-Constantine spends more time bitching about social issues than developing any sort of plot, and frankly, if the movie had contained that goofy scene from the comic where he and the demon go to heaven via the internet I would have puked in the aisle of this one. The comic is a cool concept and even though it doesn't take place in London the movie still conveys that idea. Maybe it got toned down through commercialization from its original form, but this movie was entertaining, which is far more than I can say for the comic, which reads more like a socialist propaganda pamphlet than a true story. This movie has cool effects, acting that ranges from good-enough to very good (Gavin Rosdale is excellent), and good plot and character development. If you want to enjoy 2 hours of your life, see this film, if you want to learn why capitalism and nuclear power are evil, read the comic, 'nuff said."
"MrGKB","7","2","3","26 May 2006"," I'm probably too generous in rating this...
","...but it does feature an outstanding performance by the always appealing Rachel Weisz, as well as worthy turns by Djimon Hounsou, Peter Stormare, and Tilda Swinton (as the Archangel Gabriel, no less!) Unfortunately, it also stars Keanu Reeves as our titular antihero, perhaps his worst miscasting since Coppola's flawed ""Dracula."" Reeves struggles manfully to convey the world-weary angst of a man condemned to hell for the sin of suicide, battling demons for the chance of redemption, but it just doesn't play all that well. John Constantine comes off as some sort of Catholic version of Neo from ""The Matrix."" Weisz, bless her, acts circles around him, carrying the film to its somewhat suspect climax. I don't dislike Reeves as much as some on this site, but Constantine is not a Neo, and he and his tyro feature film director, Francis Lawrence, late of some not-unmentionable music video fame, just don't seem to get that. (Side note: it's with great trepidation I anticipate Lawrence's helming of the Will Smith vehicle, ""I Am Legend."") I'm not overly familiar with the comic book on which the messy plot is based, but I gather it's so much more than this movie. Listening to the DVD commentary confirms that the ""Constantine"" screenplay is a committee affair, and it definitely suffers accordingly. Still, the effects and overall production/art design are top-notch, which at least makes the film fun to watch. The visualization of Hell is effective, and there are various eyecandy treats like a demon formed from bugs and other icky things. The theology is very Catholic, requiring a great deal of willing suspension of disbelief from all but the most devout, and the numerous plot holes yawn almost as wide as the gates of Hell itself.<br/><br/>If it's pseudo-religious rock'em-sock'em action you want, I'd recommend ""Hellboy,"" which keeps its tongue firmly in cheek, avoiding the pretentiousness of ""Constantine."" If you're looking for an excellent adaptation from comic book sources, try ""V For Vendetta,"" which does everything right that ""Constantine"" does wrong."

","I realise this film does have a cult following, and I myself actually enjoy watching this. That does not mean I love it and think it's the best thing since sliced bread...it isn't. Demon hunter John Constantine gets involved with Angela who believes her twin sister was murdered instead of committing suicide. The two undergo a personal journey together where reality may not be the only world that exists. It's pretty much any investigative crime thriller but the suspects are angels and demons. There is so much religious jargon that it rather hurts my brain. Spear of Destiny, Gabriel, Satan's Son...the list goes on. Even though I myself am not religious, I found myself intrigued by the plot and its religious context. Yes, some parts are fictionalised for dramatic purposes but I never became bored. The plot is completely overstuffed with wasted supporting characters, an antagonist with an ambiguous motive and a few plot conveniences. But in saying that, it's just entertaining and intriguing. Plenty of slow motion visual effects and a visceral stylised version of hell keeps this film feeling fresh, even when watching it today. The stand out though, is John Constantine himself. A jaded, experienced and tired individual that consistently questions his destiny. Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice to portray this character, his serious monotonous line execution was sublime. Rachel Weisz was slightly underwhelming but was functional. Everyone else? Wasted potential. Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare, heck even Shia LaBeouf just needed more screen time. The film is solely focussed on Constantine. For 121 minutes, is there enough substance to the character? Yes and no. I found the scene editing to be slightly rushed. No real transitions for the most part, where some scenes just feel like they were stringed together with no real thought. A good adaptation for a comic, I just wished there was more substance and a more intelligent approach."

Angela becomes aware that John can see these spirits, and she wants to see them too. John reluctantly grants her wish. John and Angela must deal with representatives of both Heaven and Hell to save humanity. The film had some good action, but it was a little too dark in several places and the script was a little lame.

I only wish I had read the book to better appreciate the plot and the lines, for I didn't quite understand what had been said in the movie. It may be a little slow every now and then but is coherent to me. But again, it is one of the BEST horror/spiritual films I have seen in many years. It felt like watching Keanu's action films + exorcist III in a combo. For those of you who want to get a better appreciation for the details, I would say go read the comic beforehand. I will buy the DVD when it is out. Two thumbs up! BTW I have never seen what hell looks like until this film :)"
"kgw216","8","10","29","10 February 2005"," A surprisingly good ride.
","Honestly, after the last two Matrix movies, I never thought I'd be able to see Keanu Reeves' face without crying. My heart had been pulled out and stomped on. To say I had reservations going in to see this movie would be putting it *rather* lightly.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised. Knowing a little bit about the comics, I had some idea of what to expect from Reeve's character, John Constantine. No, of course he doesn't do the character complete justice, what movie based on an incredible literature ever lives up to the expectations of the fans? However, Reeves manages to pick up on quite a few of Constatntine's more endearing traits, making his performance more than stomach-able (shocking, I know).<br/><br/>A surprising show of talent in support, from fellow actors Rachel Weisz (Constantine's female cop sidekick), Tilda Swinton (the archangel Gabriel), Pruitt Taylor Vince (the priestly sidekick), and even Shia LaBeouf (the cabby sidekick), Djimon Hounsou (bartender extraordinary), and Peter Stormare (good 'ole Satan), ties this tale together in a weirdly haunting occult mirror world which dominates the mood of the movie, hovering over the presence of reality with a very thin vale.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie was a treat. Visual effects, yes, but not obtrusive (well, most of the time) or garish. Supprising cinematographic choices that helped the mood of the movie, keeping up it's sweeping, fast-paced story. Just when you think you know how the movie ends, you don't. And then you still don't. And- oh, wait, guess again.<br/><br/>As for sexual themes, well, while they don't dominate the movie, the tension runs a fine line just this side of corny, and plays into the movie's theme, actually, quite appropriately.<br/><br/>A definite see for any horror movie fans, action movie fans, or just plain 'ole weird crap movie fans. It tries to be all, and winds up somewhere in the middle- but in a very good way. A unique movie in many ways. Let's hope the sequels hinted at don't screw-up the series like other ill-fated Reeves productions."
"leejohnson-nwuk","1","6","15","16 April 2005"," Truly bad
","The fact that Mr. Reeves is one of the most wooden actors to have ever graced the screen in recent year, doesn't help this truly bad film. He merely coughs, smokes and does a Clint Eastwood impression throughout with the occasional fight thrown in. I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their money watching this pile of garbage! The plot which loosely centres around him fighting demons that have made it onto out 'plain' could have been executed in 30 minutes. Terrible characters and dialogue and scenes added to simply pad out a story that could warrant a full length presentation. It is quite obvious that this film is just another example of Hollywood rushing out substandard fare to earn a quick buck. In short, life is too short to waste precious minutes watching this."
"movieman_kev","4","6","15","5 March 2005"," why bother??
","John Constantine (a supremely lackluster Keanu Reeves), is caught between a war with Heaven and Hell after the Spear of Destiny is found. Spear of Destiny and no Nazis to be found? Blashemy! How can a film be convoluted and dumbed down at the same time? But this film succeeds at just that. . If you read the comic ""Hellblazer"", DON'T go see this movie. It strips the character of John Constantine of pretty much everything that was cool about him in the first place and anyone would have made a better choice to play him than Keanu Reeves. That said, if you're a fan of Keanu (which I'm not) you'll fine this to be passable. For me it was more like ""The Prophecy"" than anything else. And the last scene is yet another proverbial gut-punch to any of the fans of the comic who actually sat through the whole thing.<br/><br/>My Grade: D+"
"wsamuelm78","7","6","15","28 February 2005"," Better than expected
","I had heard and read all sorts of negative reviews about Constantine, but I was unexpectedly surprised that it wasn't as bad as I'd feared. Yes, Keanu Reeves is a little stoic in the movie, but that's true of most of his films; he is, in essence, a good character actor. We know the type of person he's going to portray, and I don't think that should be a strike against him. Rachel Weisz is, as always, lovely, and she at least delivers a credible performance in her role.<br/><br/>I thought it was interesting that the angel Gabriel was played as a rather androgynous woman, and Satan was appropriately creepy without being overly demonic and horrifying. The special effects were, in my opinion, well done; nothing looked shoddy or unfinished. I think this movie contained some of the most visually arresting interpretations of Hell I've seen in film; I doubt anyone that sees Constantine will forget them."
"SmithWrite","8","8","22","26 February 2005"," Much more interesting movie than the trailer
","If like me you saw the trailer a number of times and thought this film was going to be another ""Exorcist"" or ""Omen"" wannabee with Keanu Reeves sleepwalking through the part, you might want to reconsider. I ended up seeing it because my husband thought the special effects looked great (they are quite interesting), and came away pleasantly surprised by the interesting mythology, quirky dialogue, and Keanu's take on the character. (I've had no exposure to the underlying comic books, so I have no idea what the ""true"" John Constantine is supposed to be.)<br/><br/>In particular, I enjoyed the way the film blurred the typical good/evil distinctions even when describing an epic battle between the two forces. The ""good"" characters do things we question, while the ""bad"" ones occasionally do good (or at least are seen as more honest about their intentions.) This highlights Constantine as a man caught between two worlds who must sometimes visit the dark side in his attempts to do good.<br/><br/>Because the film raises interesting questions about good/evil, theology, and even psychiatry in dealing with people of visions, this is one of the few movies of its type where I walked away looking forward to the sequel."
"Bigprisc","8","8","22","24 February 2005"," Wise cracks galore!
","After reading the many reviews here. I am seriously baffled by how everyone is dissing the movie. It seriously seems to me that everyone commented on how Keanu suck for the sake of commenting... Truth is, i truly enjoy Keanu's performance. His sarcastic remarks and wise cracks really got me tickled and laughing. His performance was really commendable. I would never have imagined another person in this role.(I did not read the original comic) The other characters were super too. Rachel Weisz was good(I am sorry, i don't share the extreme views of her being really great and stuff). But i somehow think that if she wasn't so serious, it would be a whole lot better. Tilda Swinton(Gabriel) was hilarious, i totally love her serious look when she wise cracks. The one thing that bothered me was each character seem to be 2-dimensional... like Lucifer, seems so conveniently planted there at the end to serve as a happy ending.<br/><br/>The CGI and dialog makes up a really good movie. Helps with great cinematography and directions. There are a lot of loop holes though... there were a few things that went unexplained and therefore baffled viewers. Can anyone explain to me... HOw does the half-breeds come to this world? And there were facts that were distorted rite? Great movie.... I watched it twice. I admit it could have been better. BUt i Definitedly enjoyed it better then matrix or LOTR."
"bittrsweet","9","8","22","24 February 2005"," one of the best movies in a long, long time
","Definitely catch this movie while it's still in theaters! I don't often say this, but Keanu does some wonderful acting. The comedy was fit in perfectly, I thought. The special effects aren't overdone, in fact they're good too. Casting was overall really good. The actress chosen to play Gabriel is perfect. Gavin Rossdale's character could have been casted better. Granted he did a good job, for him; but I think they should have picked someone more deceiving, with a boyish face to fit the part. Probably the best reason to go see the film would be the script and the story.<br/><br/>The song Passive by A Perfect Circle only adds to the film ;)"
"Comicboy9","8","9","26","19 February 2005"," Better Than Expected
","I'm sort of in and out of comics these days, I know plenty about them but I'm not the die-hard fan I used to be. Hellblazer or Constantine was comic I knew but didn't exactly want to see in theaters, until I saw the trailer. After seeing it, I felt the movie had turned out better than I had ever expected, even with a newbie director and a team of actors who normally delivered performances that were nothing short of abysmal, but managed to pull out a pretty good performance. Keanu Reeves actually delivered just this, as well as Weisz and Labeouf, But by the supporting acting was what brought the movie together. Throughout there is a share of horror, humor, and a plenty of action, though not much of either genre. and while the movie has its share of cheesy moments (And is fairly predictable, though this predictability is wiped away thanks to a few plot twists), they are realistically cheesy, like you'd expect any real person to be just as cheesy. And finally, the direction Francis Lawrence provided was a high-point on his resume (At first, a new director worried me, but I'm pleased by his performance). In all, this movie is a sort of hardcore blend between the Exorcist and the Matrix, only with some humorous backing from Keanu's portrayal of Constantine (Perfect playing the smart-Aleck side of Constantine, but also playing the bitter, angry side as well). This movie doesn't deserve any harsh comments, but at the same time it isn't a classic, it's between the two only shifting more and more towards the ranking of a classic, perfectly balanced between the genres of horror, action, fantasy, and humor. Good movie, I'd see it again in theaters."
"netgrazer","4","5","12","4 May 2005"," Waste of time!
","A lot has already been said about Keanu's inability to emote, in this film as well as his previous ones, so I'm not going to waste too much time on that subject. But it sure was a drag to see him 'act'. Again.<br/><br/>So that's one character I couldn't identify with at all. But I didn't feel much for any of the others either, and several times I found myself wondering why I was still watching.<br/><br/>It helped to learn on IMDb that this movie was based on a comic book series, so now at least I can understand how they could write such a fragmented script. It's just a very lousy conversion to the silver screen, that's trying to introduce too many characters without telling you their background, which probably took the comic book writers years to establish.<br/><br/>The CGI was alright, I guess, nothing that really blew me away despite all the simulated violence being blasted towards me.<br/><br/>I can find good things in most films I watch, but I wouldn't know how to advertise this thing to anyone."
"phaed69","Null","5","12","23 March 2005"," Read The Comics
","Constantine was a comic first.<br/><br/>Hellblazer is a great comic. Brilliant, intelligent writing backed up by awesome artwork. Why does Hollywood have to make changes that aren't necessary when the original provides enough proved material? A simple example of the pointless changes is that J Constantine is English. Is it really impossible for Americans to believe in a lead character that isn't American? If this isn't a problem for the majority of Americans then why do the studios consistently replace foreign leads with U.S. versions? The story is set in London, not LA. This entirely pointless change is not quite as bad as casting a witty, cynical, intelligent, cunning and determined character with an actor who is a one trick pony. What a shame. The casting for the rest of the film was inspired. The film looked good, and was written and directed very well."
"jiujitsu_jesus","5","5","12","5 March 2005"," For the hell of it
","CONSTANTINE is, in essence, two separate movies. One is a thrilling and sophisticated horror film, acted by a vibrant and well-selected supporting cast and directed by a young and promising new feature film director. The other is an atrociously written and clumsily executed action turkey, a shameless ego platform for a schlocky actor and for some big-name producers looking to make a quick million at the box office. When they are presented as a two-hour film, we see elements of both, often in alternation, sometimes simultaneously, but never coherently. The entire movie feels unbalanced, as if the scriptwriters worked in total independence of one another during the writing process.<br/><br/>CONSTANTINE is an adaption of the Hellblazer comic book series - which regrettably, in the wake of stinkers like DAREDEVIL and THE PUNISHER, only detracts from its credibility. It is set against the background of the eternal struggle between Heaven and Hell, which has reached a detente of sorts - the servants of both kingdoms may no longer directly combat one another on the mortal plane, a condition referred to as ""the Balance"". Enter John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), an exorcist who has dedicated himself to banishing all the demons present on Earth in violation of the Balance. If you thought Reeves was intolerably wooden in THE MATRIX trilogy, you ain't seen nothing yet. This is, without a doubt, his most uninspired performance to date. His lines are mumbled and incoherently modulated, his delivery is lifeless and unconvincing, and his attempted smoker's cough is the fakest and most irritating I've ever heard. It doesn't help that, apart from a few ingenious smart-arse remarks, his character that might have been scripted by a six-year-old. Constantine is a role that requires the gritty sophistication of someone like Ray Liotta or Wesley Snipes, and it is searingly euphemistic to say that Keanu Reeves was miscast.<br/><br/>Perhaps all that saves this from becoming a glitzy ""Keanu stinkfest"", as valleyjerk so appropriately expressed it, is Rachel Weisz. She transcends the limitations of the half-baked script, which sometimes feels like it was thought up at three in the morning, to put on a brilliant characterisation as Angela Dodson, a deeply religious detective whose twin sister commits suicide under chilling circumstances. Desperate to arrange her a Catholic funeral, she seeks Constantine's aid. Thankfully, most of the dialogue is left to Weisz hereafter, while Keanu sticks mainly to the demon-shooting as they unravel an Infernal plot to begin a reign of Hell on Earth, orchestrated by the unhinged angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). While, upon reflection, the plot is quite well-written and entertaining, the incoherent script, which ranges in quality from mind-numbingly cretinous to incisively lucid, means that it unfolds rather jerkily. It's a bumpy ride, to say the least.<br/><br/>Despite its crippling faults, CONSTANTINE is certainly a beautifully-presented movie, with creative and immerse cinematography, a good soundtrack by Klaus Badelt, and stunning special effects. And, although the screen-hogging Keanu is woeful, the supporting cast is excellent. Djimon Hounsou, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gavin Rossdale and Peter Stormare, who almost single-handedly steals the show as Satan himself, all act brilliantly. Shia laBeouf gives us yet another energetic performance as Constantine's neglected young sidekick - he is beginning to shake his teen-star sensibilities and come into his own as a supporting actor. Regrettably, they all have too little screen time to breathe life into the film. Rossdale, Vince and laBeouf are killed off; Stormare doesn't appear until the end; Hounsou and Swinton make appearances close to the beginning, and are then simply forgotten for forty minutes or so.<br/><br/>While CONSTANTINE is not just another schlock-horror action flick, it may prove to be the downfall of Keanu Reeves' career, and it's been an embarrassing start for director Francis Lawrence. While Lawrence's skillful direction cannot quite rise above the appalling script in CONSTANTINE, hopefully he will have another chance to prove himself in the near future. Hopefully, this film has garnered some well-deserved Hollywood attention for Peter Stormare and Rachel Weisz, and forced the big production companies to think twice before rolling off another comic-book adaption. Overall, it's a higher-brow VAN HELSING - it should entertain you for a Saturday afternoon, but as a serious film, it stinks. 5/10."
"3rd-row","6","10","30","18 February 2005"," Enjoyed this horror film that is more in to themes and ideas than violence
","I enjoyed this movie. It's a toned down horror movie more akin to Stigmata than Event Horizon. I haven't seen the comic book, so the movie was new and fresh to me. I thought the acting was good. I usually find Keanu Reeves a little stiff in his acting, but here he moved well and brought the right ambiance to his character. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the police detective who refuses to believe her sister's death was suicide. When we first meet Rackel's character Angela she is confessing to a Catholic priest that she has killed yet another man. She can't understand how she manages to kill so many criminals when most police officers go three years without even drawing their guns. Angela always knows where the criminals are going to be and she always kills them. I was hooked. Tilda Swinton puts a nice twist on the angel Gabriel.<br/><br/>Sets are suitably dark and oppressive (I thought if they'd just added rain it would have looked like Blade Runner). The story is thoughtful within the universe it has defined."
"hep_daddyo","9","10","30","17 February 2005"," Great movie hands down
","After seeing the previews and going to the pre-screening of the film 2 days ago I'm still talking about it. That's the sign of a good movie. It has the darkness of another Keanu film: The Devil's Advocate, while keeping a XXX (Vin Diesel) attitude and the intrigue and mystique of the occult similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark. I enjoyed not only the action/fight sequences, but also the special effects that give the movie such depth, such as the director's view of John Constantine, the circles within which he travels and the mannerisms he uses. Between the effects used, the continual fast pace of the movie and the mystery behind the screenplay really make for a fun movie to watch. Other movies of the same genre are either done quickly with tacky costume design, slow moving (leave gaping holes from action sequence to action sequence) or are good for the first half hour and then die. Constantine does not have that. It does not make one ask ""if"" there will be another action sequence, just when and where it will occur.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-see!!!"
"theurgist","10","7","19","5 March 2005"," Very underrated
","Watched this movie tonight and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised, after reading reviews I was expecting another disaster like 'Hell Boy'. My word, how wrong some people can be, Constantine was an intelligent and thought provoking take on the whole heaven v's hell scenario. Sure Keanu Reeves is fairly wooden he still delivers one of his best performances so far and the work of a strong supporting cast helped drag this film to a very good standing in my opinion. My one criticism would be the length of the movie, at times it felt like more dialogue was needed but was cast aside in favour of more special effects scenes. That said though the cgi was very good, understated as all good cgi is, far too many movies are spoilt by overuse of glaringly obvious cgi work these days so it was nice to see a major movie that knew how far to push the envelope.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is well worth the entrance fee, don't be put off by the critics and a few poor reviews on IMDb, anything with Keanu Reeves in gets slammed regardless and it is mostly justified, however I can happily recommend Constantine as one of the best films at the cinema right now. If you don't catch this one on the big screen then make sure you grab the DVD on rental, then you will see that the critics aren't always right or fair."

I remember not wanting to see this while it was in theaters and now I know that I have good movie judgement because this was just a waste of my time. It was overly hyped as a good movie with a story line easy to follow! ALL LIES! i think the only reason this movie got made was because Tilda Swinton and Keanu Reeves were in it. I like Tilda Swinton and I think she is a good actress but Keanu Reeves just got worse and worse and worse.

The story is one big ""who effing cares."" It's not clever, chilling or fun. It's just drab and painful to watch certainly because it tries so hard to be clever and original.<br/><br/>It's obvious the producers were inspired by THE MATRIX to do this film but they failed at every level. I can't imagine a more pointless story than an action adventure religious movie. Who came up with this really unpleasant concept? The makers of this film know nothing about horror, religion or action. It's a shame Keanu decided to star in this disaster, his mere involvement green-lighted this ill-conceived thing and the world is not better off because of it. This is a movie they'll show in hell."
"bob the moo","Null","4","9","11 August 2005"," A nice dark try with good effects but the writing and uncertain delivery is a problem
","John Constantine is a gifted man  he can see demons and is responsible for sending them out of our dimension when they break the rules. When he tackles one exorcism where it looks like the demon is actually trying to enter the earth rather than just possess the person, he feels something is up. Similar incidents start him asking questions and finding answers that he doesn't like. Living within the demon underworld and knowing that his only destiny is hell thanks to his attempt at suicide earlier in life, John is bitter and angry. Meanwhile police officer Dodson looks into the suicide of her gifted twin sister and finds a path that leads her to Constantine and into his world.<br/><br/>I got the chance to look at this film recently and was looking forward to it because it looked like it would be a dark, cynical thriller with action as well. For some of the time it gets close but it never really hits the mark with any consistency. The plot is simple but the manner of delivery didn't help it; it had far too many moments where it wasn't clear what was happening. I wasn't being thick, a few moments where you are left with questions are fine but to have it happen quite regularly was off-putting and broke up the flow of the story. Without this flow the impact of the story and the scenes is reduced. It is still interesting but it can't settle on a mood that helps. The dark, cynical edge is good but it doesn't go far enough; meanwhile the action misses the Hollywood mark by not being that exciting, despite it mostly looking good and being stylish.<br/><br/>The strong effects do help this and they were impressive across the board, supported by some nice touches from Lawrence. At times it gets close to being style over substance but this was a problem that I go into any comic book adaptation expecting to have to forgive (or try to anyway). The cast suffer a bit with the story and also the script, which really doesn't support the dark vision of the director. I don't care if Reeves doesn't look like the comic book character, but I do care that he tried to play it like a darker version of Neo, I wanted more bitterness, more bile, more self-hate  Reeves could say the words to suggest these things but he couldn't convince me he believed them. Weisz is better but she isn't given that many chances to shine. Support from Hounsou, Rossdale, Vince, Stomare, Swinton and others is all OK but the material is where the problem is. I give it credit for being darker than your average comic book Hollywood film but it isn't thorough enough and often it only looks dark, rather than being ingrained through the characters and story.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't get close enough to what it should have been. It is dark and impressive on the surface but the story is badly told and the characters are not convincing enough within this world. I still enjoyed it due to the tone but I can fully understand why many people also dislike it and see missed opportunity, because there is plenty of that around too. Worth seeing but you will be asked to forgive a lot as well."

","Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.<br/><br/>For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars.

"Thrashman88","5","4","9","16 July 2005"," Confusing and non gratifying
","For people who haven't read the comic book (like myself), CONSTANTINE might be a bit tough to sit through, but apparently, from reading other user comments who are FANS of the comic book, their situation is the same as mine. CONSTANTINE deals with the doings of John Constantine, a ""detective/exorcist"" who battles demons from possessed people. John has a ""special"" gift, in that he can actually see these demons and prevents them from ever crossing into ""our"" world. The premise is very interesting during the first 20 minutes or so of the movie. Then, John's path's crosses with Angela (Rachel Weisz), a detective who has recently lost her twin sister in what seems to be a suicide. Angela firmly believes that her sister could not have committed suicide and that she was ""possessed"" when she jumped off the roof of a building. She contacts John for help and the rest of the movie is a battle between renegade exorcist Constantine and the forces of evil. The interesting aspect of the story is that, according to John, God and the Devil are playing almost like ""chess"" with mankind and that they are ""betting"" who will turn out evil and who will be saved and join the kingdom of heaven. Since I don't know the comic book I can only assume that it is a better read than a better watch, since CONSTANTINE drags on for too long without any defined action sequences or defined antagonists. Keanu's performance was poor to say the least. True, his wooden persona sometimes fits a certain movie (I believe he was great in THE MATRIX), but in CONSTANTINE he appears to be asking the question that drives us, ""Where The Hell Is The Matrix!!!"". Rachel Weisz' performances was more gratifying and it was nice to see former grunge rocker Gavin Rossdale as an evil demon. All in all, CONSTANTINE is nice visual candy but story wise it confuses the viewer with its heaven and hell philosophy. It's NOT the movie I expected and I seriously doubt there will be a sequel for this."

Most films based on much loved comic books are disappointing for a variety of reasons. I think this film delivers on all fronts. I'd rate it as high as Blade and far better than Daredevil, the Fantastic Four or the Hulk.<br/><br/>Keanu Reevs is sometimes regarded as a wooden actor, but I think he is fine in the central role. All the other characters are distinctive and impressive. I especially rate the performances of Peter Stormare as SatanGavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Tilda Swinton as Gabriel.<br/><br/>The script is fine and resonant if you're willing to accept the premise of a film where Hell is a reality. As far as I could tell the theological logic is sound enough leading to a satisfying resolution where Constantine wins and loses. I'd say there's far more sense in this film than in the Prophecy trilogy.<br/><br/>I am more than satisfied with the film's creatures and the vision of the Inferno. The production values are high and the art direction is superb. I'd very much enjoy a sequel to this film."

","I walked out of the movie and thought ""WTF was that? Is there any sense? Do I actually like the movie?"". But the more I thought about it, the more I liked it. It's not only well acted, but also well done. <br/><br/>The movie's plot line is interesting and somebody did really think it through (as I don't know the comic I don't know who). And it really takes the biblical/religious myths into account. I myself am not a religious person but Constantine is obviously very connected to this thinking, so I believe that it's very important to keep it real.<br/><br/>Summarizing: it's not a movie you would like to watch just as a distraction or for pure entertainment. It kind of makes you think, not about some great philosophic things but about the movie itself."
"christopherheady","7","3","6","17 December 2005"," Constantine not as bad as originally thought
","Watching the trailer for Constantine, I originally thought that the movie would be another Matrix ride. More time watching Keanu Reeves having ""whoa"" moments. Instead, I was happily surprised with Keanu's performance, I had to grimace every now and then at his lines but overall Keanu is not what makes this film go sour. I think there can be something said about a film which uses more than necessary swear words. Writers will add them in thinking that they'll sprinkle up a sentence just right whereas they're killing the script. On the other hand I found Constantine a little intriguing the idea that the devil and god were fighting each other only 'influencing humans.' Another thing they did true to Constantine's original story idea is they have Keanu right from the start dying of cancer. How many heroes start out with such a handicap? Perfect for a blockbuster rental, whether or not to buy this is up to you. <br/><br/>~Chris"

","The Joe Cool Review For Constantine(2005) <br/><br/>Starring: Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson, Shia LeBeouf as Chas, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Tilda Swinton as Gabriel <br/><br/>Plot: John Constantine, a man who smokes like cigarettes are going out of style and generally has a ""don't care"" attitude is a supernatural detective who performs exorcisms and sends demons back to hell. He soon learns of a plot for Satan's son to conquer the earth and only he can stop it.<br/><br/>Openers: First off, let me say I have not read any stories of Hellblazer or Constantine before seeing this movie. Constantine is originally based on a DC/Vertigo comic book. Apparently that John Constantine is blond and British. So he's not Keanu Reeves. I don't see a problem but that's just me. Anyway let's get to the review.<br/><br/>The Good: The best thing about Constantine(and I'm going to get crap for this) was Keanu. The man nailed the part and made Constantine look like a severely cool dude, who won't take crap from anyone and just has his own general problems too. Mainly he's trying to buy his way into Heaven by sending demons to Hell. Because he committed suicide and that's against the rules so he's doomed to go Hell, thanks to the lung cancer(does not stop smoking though). Keanu takes this role and makes it his own. I can't say I related, but I felt for the guy and wanted to see something, anything, good happen to him in the end. But Keanu's not carrying the movie on his shoulders. He's got some talent supporting him. Rachel Weisz carries herself well as Angela. She had a good chemistry with Constantine that thankfully didn't fall into the a-typical ""lead guy and lead girl fall in love"" category. Shia LeBeouf surprised me as Chas, mainly because I'm used to seeing him in family-oriented stuff. He did well and I liked his character. Constantine also had the dreary look and feel to it. Hell looked GREAT. Well, in terms of the effects and the look in general...not saying I'd want to stay there. The movie had it's fair share of gore too: A bashed in demon head, organs ripped out of ones body, blood, disintegrating demons and a slit wrist. Special considerations go to Djimon Hounsou(Midnite) and Peter Stormare(Lucifer, Satan, The Devil, etc) for bringing life to their roles when they were on screen. Who knew Satan was a funny guy? <br/><br/>The Bad: Tilda Swinton was pretty bad as Gabriel. First off, isn't Gabriel supposed to be a guy? Not that it matters. I just didn't like her character even before I found out more about her. The CGI, while when it small doses was effective got to be a little much. For example Constantine performing an exorcism and seeing a demon in the mirror, the demon looked a little cartoon-like. Same with the ones in Hell. They worked best hidden in shadow. Also seeing a blown off chuck of face talk isn't exactly what I'd call good. Plus running in at 2 hours, this movie can tend to drag or repeat itself in spots.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Gavin Rossdale(Yes, THAT Gavin Rossdale, of Bush fame) seemed kind of, well, gay as Balthazar. But maybe that's how the character was supposed to come off(""Finger licking good!""). He hammed it up the entire time he was on screen and left me shaking my head. Unintentional comedy at it's finest.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Overall, Constantine was a fun ride and I'd gladly pay to see it again.<br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"

","The eponymous hero of the piece John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) walks the line between Heaven and Hell, trying in his own way to tip the cosmic battle towards the light. Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) crashes into his world after the suicide of her deeply devout, yet disturbed identical Twin sister Isobel.<br/><br/>On the story, I'll write no more as being a spoiler junkie myself I have ruined many a film by reading the synopsis/ending before watching a single minute, and also I am sure greater minds than mine have outlined it more succinct terms than I.<br/><br/>My comments on this film come from a relatively uninitiated point of view. I knew nothing of John Constantine before the release of this movie and to be honest I would not have looked at it if the actors involved had not interested me.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves has always been on the receiving end of criticism, but lets be fair to the guy He has been around for quite a while now and, although he is no Tom Hanks or Harrison Ford, I don't see his star fading anytime soon. The John Constantine he portrays owns a lot to his Matrix Neo (in my opinion) with the ascension at the end providing some Matrix III deja vu shivers. He is cold, emotionless and distant. He is dammed and so wishes not to communicate with mankind in general because he knows his fate unlike the rest of us poor souls. I like his character and his portrayal of the situation. Rachel Weisz's character is not given room to do anything. I must admit I read the novelisation before seeing the film and missed the background scenes used in the book to flesh out Angela and her sister. Saying that, this was an OK film for her but I feel she could have been given more room to make an impact.<br/><br/>Over all, I liked this film. You like, you don't there seems to be no halfway house and makes no difference to me. All I would suggest is that if you liked it, read the book it will make you appreciate it more."

","Firstly, i'd say if your a Christian and you don't quite have an open mind, don't bother. this movie firstly debates the death of Jesus and the birth of the 'son of Lucifer'mammon. from my perspective, the movie was very very creative in the fact that it has such a broad scope.. the holy water, the picture of Lord Krisha, it complies all religions and i only recommend it for one with maturity of thought. the setting is in the modern day, where angels and demons make their way into earth as half breeds. when they cross the border, its up to john Constantine to send em back-... simple story line but carried out really well with an edge of the seat finale.. Good vs Evil, God vs Devil at its best. many ppl are skeptical bout keanu's performance but thats the symbolic path. he doesn't like his job but he has no choice as he has to buy his way outta hell. hence the wet blanket like approach by keanu. also he's quirky one-liners without any expression should be watched out for. this movie provides a very open idea of the depths of film making with an abstract idea even introducing the antichrist bible.. very very interesting for the audience. not for gramps or kids man.. also watch out for papa midnite, the guy in between god n the devil.."

","If you are peaceful and rather knowing that you are not part of the stereotypical crowd that discriminates this movie, you should find it very inspiring. From beginning to end is a lot of fun watching. The acting is great and inspiring from every character without a doubt. Its features are very interesting and the scenes are delighting. I hope the rest of you new buyer's would come to these terms rather than being part of a negative society against Keanu which did excellent acting and great following up which made me have him being a role model for me for a while. Many has thought that Keanu ruined the movie's taste but Keanu's taste made me watch the movie around 12 times within a week. I loved it. It brings a good suspense to thrills like given to the other classics like Fallen and Keanu's other star in Devil's Advocate. Indeed, an interesting movie. Take your shot and make it worth it with good optimism. A great movie and love it!"
"flashbeagle","7","10","31","14 February 2005"," actually quite good for a comic book action movie.
","Based of the DC comic book Hellblazer, Constantine is the story of John Constantine, a supernatural detective who possesses the rare gift of being able to see the demons and angels that walk amongst us. Constantine teams up with a skeptical policewoman, Angela, who is trying to uncover the truth to her sister's suicide. Their investigation leads to the uncovering of an otherworldly attempt to transform the world into a harboring for hell's demons. The two must defeat the demons and make peace with peace with themselves and of course save the world.<br/><br/>To be honest, when I first saw the trailers for this movie, I had pretty low expectations. Very low. The movie pretty much looked like any other big action comic book movie, and with Keanu Reeves, it just looked too much like him following the same formula of the matrix. However, I was pleased to see that the movie was better than expected. I actually walked out liking what I just saw.<br/><br/>I found myself very interested in the story of an agreement between heaven and hell, that they would each control their respective domains, but could not control earth, just attempt to influence it. That story and the separate stories and lives of Constantine and Angela were rather interesting, and, in my opinion, pretty well developed for a film of this nature.<br/><br/>The acting is decent. Keanu is, wellKeanu. If you've seen any movie with him in it, you know what that means. But this role doesn't really require him to make any big stretches. Rachel Weisz does a good job as Angela and as my friend Alex says, ""She sure is nice to look at."" And in my opinion a very good job was done by Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's young apprentice Chaz Kramer. Shia LaBeouf, famous from Even Stevens, does a good job as the comedic relief but also puts in his share of dramatic acting. And, I just like Shia as a young actor. Also look out for in the movie, Bush frontman, Gavin Rossdale as the demon Balthazar.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this film, other than the story, was the fact that the movie was believable. Many of the big blockbusters coming out, especially those based of comic books, seem to really push the computer animation. While there was plenty of CGI in the film, the makers of the film didn't over do it, and made it look much more believable than other films. I was never distracted by any fakeness of the film and was able to sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>I call Constantine a mix between the Matrix, Lord of the rings, and the Passion of the Christ, and you'll have to watch the movie to fully understand. Constantine pulls of the big comic action movie better than most. Constantine gets 4 stars, and, be sure to sit through the credits for one final scene."

Honestly take it from me, i enjoyed other films with Mr Reeves, like the Matrix Trilogy and Speed. <br/><br/>They had gripping edge of your seat drama and action but this is like edge of seat to tie your shoelace kind of drama action horror rubbish whatever you may call it."

He gave it the spice it needed. I thought that the women in the movie could have been a lot prettier though. And her attitude could have changed. Whoever made her pick the hair of her dead sisters face like that, seriously needs to rethink affection. I thought the movie was exellcent and that they should defiently make a second.

"Becklin","8","6","16","1 March 2005"," Not what I expected.
","Going into this movie, I thought, great, some stupid comic book movie. I was surprised, really. While the movie did lack in some in the plot area, the scenes of Hell were fantastic and the actors were all very interesting in their respective roles. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of criticism for his sometimes wooden acting, but if you think about it, there are a lot of actors that play the same roles all the time and rarely stray into challenging roles (Orlando Bloom for example). Here as Constantine, Reeves, as a chain smoker who is sick, is very convincing as someone who has the weight of the world on his shoulders. Rachel Weisz was also very good as a sister grieving for her dead sister and her quest to find out what happened. A surprise for me was Gavin Rossdale, who I just assumed would be really bad, but he was amazing as Balthazar. So, to see this movie or not? Well, if you like Keanu Reeves, religiously based movies, or even just have a few hours to kill, I'd say ""see it"". However, if you like to nitpick at every little fact, are insulted or offended by movies of religious nature and hate Keanu Reeves with a passion, then obviously, don't see it."

Its one of those movies where you have to appreciate the topic to like. Even though I'm agnostic I enjoy all those religious bible stories. I enjoyed how it was portrayed, with the half breeds and the planes. Its one of those movies where you leave the theater with your mind whirling with thoughts, it makes you think. And while everyone keeps saying Keanu cant act I enjoy watching him play the cool composed hero. Not much tension but a few scenes made me jump in surprise. And hell looked beautiful in a destructive way, though I guess that would be a downside since hell shouldn't look beautiful. Overall I loved it and want to see it at least 5 more times."

It may sound strange, but that's what I like. I love any movies that involve god vs. Satan. This is one of the only ways that you would love this movie. If you aren't into that, you'll find that movie was alright. It does have some flaws. The story may be hard for a few people to understand, but it isn't hard. I don't think it's necessary, but I know a lot about religious objects, angels, and demons before I saw the movie. So, just to recap, if you don't like movies like Dogma or others like it, you'll find this movie mediocre. If you're like me, you'll think this movie was the greatest of 2005."

","I was impressed with Keanu Reeves for the first time as a lead character in this movie. I don't know if he is a smoker in real life, but he only looked ""wooden"" when he was lighting up a cig... which is only 98% of the time in the movie. Other than that, he definitely had the ""tortured soul"" vibe working. Also, the co-star, Shia Labeuf(sp?), is funny and looks like Shia could be the next Romantic Comedy star if given the opportunity. Then, we get to Rachel Weis(sp?).. she is beautiful in this movie. Tons of close up shots, a lot of them when she is crying. She has an insanely immaculate face, just gorgeous, so she makes it easy for us men to sit through any ""talky"" parts. One of the things I liked most about this movie is that there is no love scenes between Keanu and Rachel. Usually, like in The Matrix, the hero always beds the girl and it takes the movie down a love story road. In this movie, they don't even kiss... they come close, but Keanu isn't really interested, he'd rather melt a demon. It's a cool movie, with good acting and leaves it open for a sequel... so go see it!! And, if anyone comes across Rachel Weis' phone number, please post it for me. Thanks in advance."

However, if you're interested in more than frightening yourself silly, I thought that the plot was really good - I had no idea in which direction the storyline was going at some points in the film. I also found the scenes of hell to be really effective, especially with regard to graphics, there's even a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, and of course there is the essential love interest, Rachel Weisz.

I am a hardcore drama lover who occasionally sees something else in the sphere of ""having a good time"" with my daughter. Well, I just loved all the black, sarcastic humor being cleverly tucked into the film. Reeves timing in this was perfect! And what about seeing a grown man sitting with his feet (shoes on) in a bowl of water staring into the eyes of cat on his lap in order to enter hell for a while. Hilarious!. The awkward things you have to do as a supernatural sleuth!! Reeves had no problem portraying the awkwardness and reluctance needed for the role. That's why I thought he was perfect for the part! Rachel Weisz was just great and convincing as the skeptical partner, who learned to ignore her own supernatural gifts and became a earthly hard fact finding policewoman. The other characters in the movie did not leave a lasting impression on me except for Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel (mainly because of her gigantic wings and what's been left of it in the end). Their parts were too small and underdeveloped. Suppose the director Francis Lawrence with his music video history is used to focus/popularize only the leads while ""the extra's"" provide the background only. That's a pity. He made up for it by giving us fantastic visual images of hell. They made me shiver and sweat at the same time!!!! The end left me no doubt. It suggests that we are going to see more of Constantine in the future. Great! Hope it will have plenty more of devilish, dark humor to lighten the further portraying of the darker side of the here and there!"
"loserA","7","9","28","12 February 2005"," Much better than expected
","Constantine is a surprisingly good movie if you don't have preconception about what to expect. The movie is a cross between Matrix, Exorcist and Prophecy. Unlike many other movies adapted from comic, Constantine has a decent story and the writing quite good. The visuals and FX are done quite nicely except that the demons sometimes look a bit cheesy.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does not fit the description of John Constantine from the comic but that is totally fine with me because the movie does not write the character the same way anyhow. It would be really scary if Keanu tries British accent, dye himself blond or use sarcastic remarks liberally. He plays up the weariness and vulnerability of John Constantine, not the heroic aspects. Not a conventional approach but it suits the movie quite nicely, just like Parker in Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>Other actors are good too but Tilda Swanson's Gabrielle has too little screen time to establish her importance in the whole conflict. Apart from that, Lucifer acting like some guy from a casino in LV is such an old trick and a bad fit when they portrait Hell as a furnace with alien-like demons. I much prefer a quiet, menacing Lucifer with contempt for mankind like Viggo Mortensen did for Prophecy."
"tmcnabb104","7","9","28","10 February 2005"," Good action movie with a nuanced presentation of the nature of faith
","I'm never sure what to expect when I go to see a movie like Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachael Weisz. Hollywood, in my estimation, does not understand Christianity and spends a great deal of time and effort not understanding it.<br/><br/>However, looking at something sometimes require a magnification of the greater themes. Stories that illustrate big themes require big characters and big actions, an exaggeration one has to expect. Christianity is all about the fight between good and evil, but the battle for the human heart is more interesting if one uses computer-generated demons and gleaming gold guns in the shape of a crucifix.<br/><br/>I commend the director for not squandering screen time with gratuitous sex, though this is not a movie for kids. I wouldn't recommend anyone younger than 16 seeing it. It is very violent and scary at times.<br/><br/>As an action movie, Constantine is pretty darn good if a bit pedestrian. Reeves in the title role is Reeves as he is in every other title role but in this case it is just what the movie needs. John Constantine is a conflicted man who, through a series of events, becomes something of the James Bond of occult warriors. He dispatches otherworldly creatures who violate the uneasy truce between God and Satan here on earth.<br/><br/>John Constantine is a cynic, and believes that he is doomed to an eternity in Hell, having been there after a suicide attempt in his youth. On his return, he's fruitlessly tried to redeem himself by crushing Hell's minions, but his cynicism toward God blinds him to grace. An interesting twist that  Constantine believes in God, just not in God's goodness. The resolution of Constantine's conflict with God is remarkably sophisticated in light of Hollywood's chronic problems with comprehending faith.<br/><br/>I believe that God's protection is more akin to that enjoyed by Marva Munson in the 2004 version of The Ladykillers than anything proffered from Latin incantations and holy water. Nevertheless, Constantine navigates the logical incongruities of warring against principalities and powers with bullets forged from religious charms well enough to not be distracting. This is ultimately not a movie about the finer points of theology but rather a man at war with himself and God. The liberties are forgivable, in my view because they actually hit just the right note in the end.<br/><br/>I am not a reader of the Hellblazer comic, a D.C./Vertigo imprint on which the movie is based, so I cannot speak to the faithfulness of this adaptation. On its own merit, Constantine is a top-shelf action/occult thriller with great special effects. It illustrates broad themes of good and evil particularly the internal conflicts. There are good thrills and a respectable smattering of laughs. I very much appreciate the relatively thoughtful rendering of the struggles any man would have when facing the world's pain. Watching one of Old Scratch's foul servants get punched in the head with a set of cross-inscribed brass knuckles is just an added bonus.<br/><br/>Tim McNabb <br/><br/>www.fivehundredwords.com"
"HeavensMee","8","9","28","10 February 2005"," Dark, rich film (no spoilers)
","Wow. Trite, I know, but the word captures how I feel about Keanu's performance in ""Constantine"". ""Wow"" describes the whole movie. Wow.<br/><br/>I just arrived home from an advanced screening in Toronto. I wasn't prepared for how adult Keanu's newest film is. With John Constantine's birth taking place in the pages of the ""Hellblazer"" comic book, I was expecting at least some comicesque touches to the movie adaptation. There were none, with the exception perhaps of the darkness -- literally and spiritually -- that I've heard the comic book is beloved for. Leaving the theatre so impressed with the script, the performances, the cinematography, the special effects and, of course, the direction, I was perplexed as to why Warner Bros. hadn't marketed the product more to the adult moviegoer.<br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, it's my opinion that Keanu gives one of his best performances as John Constantine. Even more laudable, he gives his most natural portrayal I've seen yet in any of his roles. His acting wasn't the least bit forced, he didn't ever reveal any subconscious discomfort. He was sublime. His world weariness. His sardonic delivery. His walk and posture. I don't care about the comic book character. Keanu was John Constantine.<br/><br/>Before I say anything about the film's other actors, I want to share my belief that Keanu's mastery of this role -- especially his emotion-charged scenes near the end of the story -- herald a new direction for his career. I'm not referring to an increase in his earning power, but an escalation in respect from the movie critics who haven't always been kind to him. Undeniable, wide-spread recognition within the industry of Keanu's higher plateau of acting. I wish I knew what new lessons and insights helped Keanu unleash the powerful actor within himself for this dark role. Francis Lawrence's direction may have been a factor, but after being brought to tears at Keanu's stunning performance in the most pivotal scenes of the movie, I think Mr. Reeves must have reached a deeper place in his soul and consciousness to serve up such a perfect disease-ridden, spiritually bankrupt, hard-bitten loner like Constantine.<br/><br/>To sum up the performances of Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Max Baker and Tilda Swinton: wonderful. The female lead was confident in her delivery: strong when needed, vulnerable at times, conveying a deep pool of emotions with her eyes. Her second on-screen pairing with Keanu is far better than her first. A great script and excellent direction makes a big difference. Shia gives a solid performance that promises more meaty roles ahead for this young actor. Max Baker. What can I say except ""superb""? His facial twitches, eye contortions and laboured breathing are subtly delivered and perfect. The very talented Tilda is a work of art, thanks to her heavenly bone structure and feather-light performance. Warner Bros. is done well by this talented ensemble, lead by the no-longer-so-inscrutable Keanu Reeves."
"harry55t","7","9","28","9 February 2005"," Good
","I have just come out of the movie theatre (9.2.2005). Constantine is a good movie in the sense that it is highly entertaining and it looks at religion (and beliefs) from a different perspective while keeping faithful to the doctrines of Christainity. The wars between God and Satan, Heaven and Hell, Good and Bad are all evident here. There is a juxtaposition between the supernatural and the natural. When I go to see a movie 'adapted' (even if loosely) from a comic book, I always watch it with an open mind and not make comparison with what has been in print. This also applied to the movie, Elecktra. In the same way, when I go to see a movie made from a bestseller or a classic, I do not make comparison either. Why? Because both are made to be enjoyed - in different ways, perhaps in different times and in different environment."

A good try in the special effects though but this you can find in any movie now days so it is nothing special either. Screenplay was OK. If you combine this with some but acting then you get something like ""costantine""..

It really made me laugh at times (in a good way) and I think you all should go and see it! At its best moment this movie is brilliant and at its worst it just simply is a fun action flick. Another thing I want to add is that as a Zippo enthusiast (for lack of a better word) i enjoyed every time that John Constantine would whip out his trusty Zippo lighter to light yet another cigarette. (I honestly do wonder if this movie is pro or anti smoking movie, I presume its just neutral...)"

","Constantine is a very enjoyable movie where anyone who is interested in hell,heaven and religious movies may like to see. The actor playing John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has got great skill in acting, he did a great job on Mr. Constantine and should do more movies like it. His filmography is quite impressive and shows that he is a skilled actor.His colleages in this movie are quite impressive also.<br/><br/>Constantine is a great movie and anybody who says otherwise should let their readers decide what they think for themselves without having to believe one person's opinion.<br/><br/>Anyone reading this right now that hasn't seen the movie Constantine go see it for yourself and form your own opinion."

","Unfamilair with the comic book from which this film is based, I was simply interested in seeing it from the trailers. From the feeling the trailer gave me I wasn't sure if the film would disappoint or not but thankfully it did much of the opposite. Keanu is not one of our greatest actors but the story is interesting and Rachel Weiz is pretty incredible the whole time. The special effects are fun and what made this action flik better then most was the fact that you actually gave a damn about who would actually live or die (which you are not entirely sure of when you watch it for the first time). I give it a ""good to go"" for anyone interested in it."

He wasn't the best choice for the movie, someone with a rougher looking face and a deeper voice should have been picked but that's not his fault.<br/><br/>I won't give any movie info away as it's not needed to say how I felt about the movie.<br/><br/>All you need to know is the action is fast paced, the story makes sense, the computer animation isn't the best but it doesn't bog down the movie, it uses religion nicely without being preachy and not being overly offensive to conservatives (how many times do I have to see a movie where the only person mentioning God is a deranged pervert/psycho etc...).<br/><br/>I will state that although I own a comic book store I have never read any HELLBLAZER comics but loyal readers at the screening told me they loved the movie. I heard a few ""it was OK...."" but nobody thought it was garbage.<br/><br/>I saw 2 free early release movies in the past week, #1 was BOOGEYMAN (I was excited to see this) and it was HORRIBLE! #2 was CONSTANTINE (I was a little wary of this one) and I was surprised how good it was compared to the latter! I will march into the Boogeyman page and destroy that one shortly! I'm still upset about my 2 hours wasted with that one :-("

It is always sad to see an actor that cannot really act become victim of that fact when the movie he plays in actually requires the actor to carry the movie instead of having the movie carry the actor.<br/><br/>Seeing Schwarzenegger embarrass himself like this was something I did not need to see happen with another great movie hero like Keanu Reeves, it kind of kills even the memories of the good movies they starred in.<br/><br/>I am making a big point of me expecting the worst here, as I believe this fact made it possible for me to have a very positive surprise. I found the movie to be quite entertaining, and if you do not expect a new Matrix sensation this is a worthwhile movie to spend some money and time on.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cartoon'ish feel of the movie, and the special effects were on par too. Many complained about Keanu's acting, but honestly, could he ever really act? His stone faced character is one of the traits making him a bit mysterious and macho in the first place, do not expect more or less than before from him.<br/><br/>All in all, good entertainment and a worthwhile break from reality..."

","For all of you geeks that follow the comic, first of all, move out of mom and dads basement and get a life. Secondly, it isn't possible to properly reflect a storyline such as this to film. I supposed it would be possible if the powers that be in Hollywood would produce 10 hour movies. This doesn't happen because we as humans don't have the attention span. Screenwriters must pick out what they feel (I said they, not you) are the most important points of the story, and each character. Take it for what it is, not what you think it should be. This was a decent movie. For everyone that does not follow the comic, don't get lost in the wanna be film maker/ film critic rhetoric of those who say don't go see it.

No development whatsoever, no back story and what there is it utterly useless. Mr. Reves plays his traditional, ""I really have no idea what is going on"" role and is unsupported by any of the other actors. Plot fails to engage on any level, and the lack of emotion is almost painful. I found myself not caring at all what happened, just as long as it ended somehow. <br/><br/>Just awful overall.

","Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie."

","I absolutely LOVED this film. It was different, original, and off-beat from most clichéd hero films. Keanu's acting was spot on with John Constantine personality from the comic book by playing him as an introvert which his character really is. Rachel Weisz played awesomely well with her character along with Gavin Rossdale and Shia Lebouf. This movie stayed true to the comic version of Hellblazer unlike most other comic movie made out there like Spider-man, X-Men, or (how could I forget the worst movie of all time) The Hulk. For many people that want originality and dark humor go STRAIGHT to your local store on July 17 and buy Constantine.

The way water is used in the movie, as portals and such, was a very interesting and unique idea. I was satisfied with the ending, hopefully it'll be followed by a worthy sequel. The only complaint I have is Satan... he's not scary, and he wears white. That just kinda baffled me. Perhaps it was meant to be ironic... perhaps not. I guess that part is for you to interpret. Either way, the comic book scene is becoming bigger now and there's bound to be more movies made based on comics. I recommend this movie to anyone who like bad ass heroes with almost no remorse.

There is nothing more in this movie. The contents have been told millions of times, it is terribly annoying, i risked to sleep many times during the movie. I know that there are people who appreciates the movies because of those fantastic special effects and beautiful actors, and because of this trend, many stories are made in function of the special effects and actors that the director wants to show.

"tomwitzky","10","9","30","24 February 2005"," Of course this is just my opinion...
","...as I realize that everyone has one, an opinion, that is. It seems that everyone is missing the point to this movie. I've read you all complain about everyone from Keanu's performance, to the plot having holes, to the way he smoked. Being a good reviewer' you need to be unbiased and non-judgemental either way; if truth be told and we wrote/directed/produced the movie ourselves it probably would've stunk even worse than you guys are making it out to be.<br/><br/>However. That aside. The point behind the smoking was to portray our weak human nature. How we accept that we're dying and weakness of our character to fight against that sometimes. Here we have our main character, John Constantine, feared demon-slayer & occult-expert extraordinair'. John see's things. Bad things. Demons. He acknowledges that a lot of them our within ourselves, every day, at every moment. Our own temptations damn us. At such as early age he commits suicides from being unable to 'deal with such knowledge.<br/><br/>Eventually throughout the course of his life he turns the tables. Demons fear him, with true fear and hatred. Demons, okay? Not some whining little pansies in a street corner gang. Battling the inner-demons while still KNOWING that one day, you're going to go to Hell itself for his own sins, being told by God Himself, hey dude', you're going to Hell. How would any of you react? You'd probably take up smoking and drinking while turning into a total recluse. All the meanwhile only being accepted in a small circle of friends who know you're not crazy. Exactly what happens to our hero, John Constantine.<br/><br/>A cross between ""The Matrix"" and ""The Prophecy"", this story brings into light a continuing battle between angels and demons with humans in between. Glancing, for a brief moment, over to John Carptener's ""Vampire$"". Two of the characters are getting drunk, probably already were, and talking about God and Vampires. They said they believed in Vampires, but they also know there's a God, however, 'We just don't understand Him.', they stated. The essence of being human. To fight evil while still questioning ourselves inside, asking ourselves if we're being ""all that we can be"". So as far as those of you go criticizing this film, are you really criticizing this film, or your own fright in looking within yourselves?<br/><br/>I've spoken my piece. For ""God's Sake"", it's a story. So like my title states, of course this is just my opinion, take it or leave it."
"DarthLuckiness","9","8","26","21 February 2005"," Constantine, John Constantine
","I saw this flick opening night with two close friends, and we all enjoyed it. Although it was not the frightening movie I had expected, I was pleasantly surprised with several aspects. The depictions of hell and the demonic possessions are extremely chilling. I felt that the casting directer did an excellent job, although, admittedly I know nothing of the original comic book. I was most impressed with the casting of Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. Given that angels are beautiful, yet sexless creatures, her lovely features and obvious talent lend way to the magnetic androgyny this classic character exudes. Much the same with Gavin Rosdale's portrayal of Balthazar; he is unmistakably attractive- beautiful, even- in the way that so many things tempting and evil often are. Keanu Reeves gives a fine portrayal of a soul, lost, but not yet ready for surrender, that has made only human mistakes with the supernatural hand he has been dealt. Rachael Weisz, one of the most strikingly beautiful people in the world, gives a lovely performance as the woman who inspires the great John Constantine to, once more, save the world from the minions of hell. By their very nature, movies made of comic book stories require a certain amount of cheesy one liners and over the top moments, and this film delivers in a way that only adds to its appeal and keeps it from being as scary as it had the potential to be. Lastly, Kudos again for the casting of Peter Stormare as Satan, he gave a deliciously evil performance; and to the costume designer(s), who did an excellent job, proving that they are truly studied students of the theater."

The animations of demons and angelic wings were fabulous, and the story line was pretty good. I absolutely love Keanu, and this part fit him well. Though you may expect this movie to either be cheesy or terrifying, I found it to be neither. In fact, it was quite funny. The humor and the placing of the humor was hilarious. The angel Gabriel was well played and had a kind of weak, pathetic personality, which was so funny! The demon Belthizar, played by Gavin Rossendale was great and Constantines friends were quirky. Rachel played twin sisters easily, and I always love her presence on camera. She always tends to project this cool, collected sense no matter what. Go see this movie. You will love it.

","I had heard about this movie, but really was waiting to see it on DVD. I went with a friend last night and was really surprised to see that it had a decent story and the effects were pretty cool. Not too overwhelming, but just enough to make its point. I thought Balthazar was HOT!. I read some of the comments and it still amuses me to this day how most people in this society are so needy to have a stereotypical image of what Gabriel, or God or devils or demons look like. It's so lame that it's hilarious. Yes, Lucifer was supposed to be a BEAUTY, but the producer thought Peter Storare (sp) was the best to depict Satan. The beauty behind this is that if I am putting up millions of dollars to make a movie, I will make the characters look how I want them to look, not just because mullein of church teachings, say that the Devil has a red face and horns. Give me a break people. This is the 21st century. This movie is worth watching twice, because I really trying to keep up for a while in the movie, understanding what was happening. It seems that it has a little of the Dogma movie rolled into it, the way Gabriel is punished for his/her transgression.<br/><br/>My point is this, enjoy movies because of their creativity, its insight and its originality. If you go to a movie, expecting something to appear that way you have formed in your little minds, you should save 10 bucks and stay home. That is why I love movies, the enjoy the brilliance of those that create them. If we were all such experts on the damn things, we would be making them ourselves.<br/><br/>Constantine is a good movie.

"demonic_baboon","8","7","22","23 February 2005"," A film that gets (almost) everything right (NO spoilers)
","This is the first comic book film I have ever seen that actually gets the feel of the comic it's based on right. The irreverent darkness that was contained in the Hellblazer series is ever-present in the film. Be warned, the subject matter of both the comic and the film in inherently over-the-top and melodramatic, but that's the fun of the film. The film takes itself and its subject matter seriously, and it's much better to just go along for the ride, no matter how outlandish it is.<br/><br/>There had been much fanboy griping about the casting of Keanu Reeves for the title role, but honestly, they were idiots. Reeves absolutely nails Constantine. Ever vocal delivery, facial expression, and body movement is not only completely loyal to the comic book character, but is appropriate for the on-screen character and his development. The supporting cast is universally excellent, never descending into the realm of cheese or ham-acting, but at the same time, adds to the excellent over-the-top feel of the film. To be fair to each actor, I would have to go into a dozen performances and no one would bother to read that.<br/><br/>Some have stated that the film has an insufferably slow pace, but I disagree. At worst, the film's pace is erratic, showing something suspenseful and exciting for a few seconds, then a few minutes of just dialogue, then something exciting again, etc. The film could have been much slower, however, as the Constantine/Hellblazer mythology is extraordinarily complex and explaining it completely would have taken up the entire movie. Instead, the film takes the wisest approach and gives the audience the need-to-know basics. However, this causes some details to be tersely explained which may cause confusion for people unfamiliar with the comicwhich is most people. Still, the film the exceedingly enjoyable and should be more that worth the ticket price to anyone with an open mind."
"film-critic","9","7","22","23 February 2005"," A film for those that loved The Prophecy...
","I must begin by saying that I have not read the Hellblazer comics, nor did I know anything about Constantine before viewing this film. So, perhaps I went in blindly and that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. I will say that upon viewing this movie I am very interested in reading the Hellblazer comics and learning more about our unpopular hero, John Constantine, especially since he is mentioned in some of the Sandman series (which is one of my favorite Neil Gaiman stories). I think one of the reasons I thought that this movie was ""utterly uber cool"" was because it focused less on action, more on a defined story. When you see the previews for Constantine and you are a fan of The Matrix, you will be very disappointed. This is not so much an action film as it is a character study with themes of religion and compassion. While there are some powerful scenes of violence, the central focus is around Constantine and his plight to enter Heaven. He embodies the everyman's struggle to get into the pearly gates at the end of our great journey through life. Even though he has done so well fighting for Heaven, there are outside forces that fight against him. That is the central struggle of the film. It wasn't Constantine vs. the Devil as I think several of our fellow critics think. This was not The Matrix, but instead a film that stood sturdily by itself.<br/><br/>I am an enormous fan of the series The Prophecy. I thought that Christopher Walken brought a completely new spin on the angel character as well as screenwriter/director Gregory Widen expanded the playing field of Heaven and Hell and showed us a new creative story that seemed utterly real. This is the same as I felt with Constantine. Here we have a growing and constantly changing world, above and below us, that feeds on our souls. While they do not interfere directly, there are elements of our day to day life that will guide us on the path of destruction or salvation. It is the great gift of free will that gets us to our ultimate destination. That concept of free will is also detailed in this film. Christopher Walken grappled with it in The Prophecy films and the amazing Tilda Swinton dwelled heavily on it in this one. It was great to see the consistency of the Gabriel character. It is hard to explain, but this is the concept I loved the most. The idea that Heaven and Hell do really exist and it is ultimately our choice which one we will end up in. Also, director Francis Lawrence's vision of Hell was disturbingly original. I loved the concept that it is just like Earth, except more terrifying. The two times that we visited it in this film my jaw was on the floor. It was amazing just to see another viewpoint on an age-old concept.<br/><br/>I thought casting for this film, especially the high budget production that it was, was exceptional. Tilda Swinton nearly stole the entire film, if it hadn't been for Peter Stormare's turn as Satan. I was also very impressed with the acting ability of Gavin Rossdale. When I had first heard that he was going to be in this film, I had my doubt, but he pulled through and was a great choice for the sleazy demon named Balthazar. While I just didn't enjoy Shia LaBeouf's character portrayal in this film, it was the coupling of the other actors that kept me going. Keanu did exactly what I wanted him to. He played this really cool anti-hero that had been to Hell and back while not being afraid of what was to come. He embodied the struggles that Constantine had to deal with while also bringing out that sense of humanity that I don't know if other actors could have done. He also was able to capture some great chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who was a strange choice for a big budget film, but turned out for the best. If the story doesn't impress you as much as it did me, then at least you can be happy with the acting. I thought that it stood out as one of the better lineups in this year's cinema releases.<br/><br/>Finally, the last aspect that I enjoyed were the small details that if you were not paying attention you would miss. The cultural mix of fantasy and reality was perfection. The Nazi flag in the beginning coupling to the character of Papa Midnight (possibly Father Time) just seemed to click with me. I know this story arrived from a graphic novel, but I thought that director Francis Lawrence did his homework and should be very proud. The colors and tone of the entire film never became light nor was it ever positive. This is a dark work, and Lawrence showed it. The only down side to this entire movie was the Hollywood influence on the final cut. There were two scenes that I could just feel that big studio bosses forced Lawrence to make either to get a laugh or to have some sort of completion. Either way, the two scenes were pointless and really felt forced. You could tell that they just were not meshing well with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed. I cannot wait to get my hands on some of the Hellblazer stories and read more about this hero from beyond. This film got me psyched about watching The Prophecy and see the war between Heaven and Earth fought again. I have to warn you through, this is not an action film. This is a character study of one John Constantine, which is more dramatic than action. A perfect blend of CGI and modern culture, Constantine is exactly what I needed to tie me over until Sin City.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

All of the scenes are wonderfully crafted and serves a purpose in the film. Its worth watching a second time as you really need to pay attention to its details.<br/><br/>I'd compare this with Matrix, not because of the similar fighting scenes or because of Keanu Reeves, but because it is a movie that keeps you in the dark most of the times, and present a world and an idea that you never seen before.

I only gave it 2 stars, but I don't hate it: hate gets zero.<br/><br/>What is exciting? Well, in the first action scene John Constantine exorcises a demon from a hispanic girl in a slum bedroom, capturing it (presumably according to some unmentioned traditional superstition) in a mirror which he then throws out of the upper storey tenement window so that it smashes on the street outside, freeing the girl. Perhaps because this was near the beginning, we were only given the briefest glimpse of the demon; it seemed interesting, so it would have been nice to have a proper look at it.<br/><br/>Next, after Constantine meets up with the surviving twin Angela, she says she doesn't believe in the devil; the street lamps are then gradually extinguished, and a flock of winged demons attack and are demolished by our hero setting light to a bit of rag (we are not told how this works). Again, we get only the briefest glimpse of the demons, almost at subliminal level.<br/><br/>Not exciting but visually and conceptually interesting are scenes where Constantine enters Hell. It looks like a city slum Blitzed then fire-bombed, with added crawling (because this time wingless) demons. The scene is not so brief as the attacks in the everyday world, so one gets a proper chance to look at it and take the special effects in; but it isn't exciting, just interesting --- but only to a movie art critic.<br/><br/>What of the story? Well, in the comic book Constantine's origin is Liverpool. That explains the theology, perhaps, for this concoction could perhaps only come from minds preoccupied with Roman Catholic mediaeval mythology. Pictures and action plot could have come from science fiction, but as with Hellboy the ontology is straight out of the darkest era of the Spanish Inquisition.<br/><br/>In that context, this is a very frightening movie, simply because of the world-view presented of hell, of demons, and of the Roman Catholic view of ""the hereafter"", including the belief that (in Constantine's words to Angela about her sister Isabel) the fate of a person who commits suicide is to have her body torn to pieces amid everlasting fire, to be in excruciating agony that will be repeated again and again throughout eternity. I do not mean it is frightening to us all if we do not believe such superstition; rather that it might frighten us how many of those without critical intellectual faculties who see this movie could go away impressed by the world-view presented. Let us hope that most of every audience realize it is just as much fantasy and mumbo-jumbo as the plots of out-and-out fantasy stories such as Legend (1985), Dragonheart (1996) or The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Our hero's own life story, fate, mission, and destiny are equally terrifying. As a teenager, we gather, he was sufficiently unhappy to attempt suicide, from which he was rescued (as presumably quite often happens) in an Accident and Emergency ward. In this movie's theology, he is therefore condemned to an eternity in hell for the mortal sin of self-murder; and even though he dedicates his life to tracking demons that have escaped into our world, in particular demons that ""possess"" unfortunate human beings in the classic manner, and to sending them back to Hell where they belong, Constantine can never redeem himself from his ultimate fate. Now, any impressionable teenager with a Christian religious upbringing who has not yet shaken it off could take this plot line as meaning that if you survive attempted suicide you will go to hell however hard you struggle to live a good life afterwards; such a teenager could, accepting this counsel of despair, resolve rather than leading a good life to be as wicked as possible, just to spite the angels, as it were. This is a very bad message for a movie with the pretensions of this movie to be giving to the young and impressionable. And it is perhaps likely that, apart from the small audience that are mere connoisseurs of the Gothic horror comic book genre, much of the biggest audience would be impressionable adolescents. One can only hope that it did not actually affect anybody in this way.<br/><br/>Finally a bizarre thread of the plot. We are told that angels and demons cannot cross into the plane of reality, and that those figures who do are some kind of half-breed. Are we thus to understand that the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) and the demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) portrayed here are the result of inter-world breeding between humans on our plane and pure-bred angels or demons from the plane of heaven and hell? Yet that is impossible because obviously living humans cannot meet pure-bred angels or demons until after death, and then those humans are souls in the bliss of heaven or the everlasting torture of hell. The whole idea is a nonsense. Let's hope all members of all audiences realized that the ideas in this story are merely a load of macabre garbage masquerading as mysticism.<br/><br/>Of course, to the rational empiricist mind, all mysticism is merely macabre mumbo-jumbo and superstition, concocted to frighten and control the gullible. Some reviewers who refer to the serious side of the movie appear to buy this religious theology; certainly without it the movie is just a rather boring tale with a few very brief flashy monster bits. I think my lasting impression of it will just be how very ghastly, horrible, are the parts of the city of Los Angeles in which most of the earthly scenes in this movie are set."

","This has truly to be one of the worst comic-to-screen adaptations I've seen in many years - if not the worst.<br/><br/>Firstly: the casting of Keanu Reeves as John Constantine literally boggles me (I'll say nothing about the hair or accent).<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than a series of CG demon encounters wrapped under 110 minutes of a movie that bears little, if any, resemblance to the comic. It has none of the wit, cleverness, or any of the character of the Hellblazer series. It's just an insipid and weak money-making device and nothing more.<br/><br/>It's that terrible. Reeves' acting is typically wooden, although - bless him - he does try to utter those Constantine lines with such conviction - and fails miserably. Of all the actors available, why the directors chose him is literally - well, I can't even find a word for it, but it's something way beyond unbelievable.<br/><br/>This is such a complete and utter shambles of a movie, I find it hard to say anything nice about it. As a general movie - it's bad; as a Constantine movie movie, it's simply appalling.<br/><br/>It bares little, if any, resemblance to the comic. In fact, it was so bad, it reminded me of that hideous Doctor Strange movie of the 70s, where clearly, the producers had never actually read the comic strip.<br/><br/>In summary: Constantine is living proof that everyone has their price. The creators of Hellblazer are clearly comfortable with their universe being hacked to pieces for a few million dollars.<br/><br/>A travesty that should be sent back to hell."

(from ""Pod People,"" by the way).<br/><br/>This film brought me to one conclusion about mortality, however: I really have to stop trusting the recommendations of people who liked ""Resident Evil,"" for that film and its kin (""Constantine"" most definitely included) do nothing but leave a hollow hole of regret in my brain at 2 potentially productive hours put to waste.<br/><br/>Anyway, the perpetually stoic Keanu Reeves (who certainly looks good, even if he still can't act) is a cheap ""Noir"" demon-dispeller named John Constantine; early on, he performs an exorcism on a girl bound to a bed while Max von Sydow leads a chorus of ""The Power of Christ Compels You!"" Later on, when one of Constantine's in-the-supernatural-know buddies is consumed by killer flies, Rod Steiger drops by with a message of: ""For God's Sake, Get Out Of The Bowling Alley!"" Non-actor Gavin Rossdale shows up a few times, proving that there IS life after Bush (he also looks smashing in a suit!). People sprout ostentatious CGI 'wings' or rotting faces in an attempt to remove all metaphor from who is 'good' and 'bad.' Near the end, Constantine massacres a bunch of demonic minions in a hospital in what looks like any given screen shot from ""Doom""; shortly after, Satan himself shows up, and you almost think director Francis Lawrence (who, by the way, is a music video auteur by trade) is going to pull a ""Joel Coen"" out of his seemingly limitless bag of cinematic tricks...but of course, he doesn't. The cinematography is initially unique, but quickly deteriorates into obtuse, showy obnoxiousness and whiplash edits. Rachel Wiesz plays a cop whose twin sister commits suicide...or does she? And more importantly, do I care? Not really, which means the style ""Constantine"" so tenuously floats on gets old and disingenuous fairly quickly.<br/><br/>Now, I usually allow a certain amount of leeway for comic-book-to-film adaptations, especially in light of recent triumphs like ""Sin City,"" which went to great lengths to reproduce the printed page. Logic and backstory doesn't have to be forthcoming (or necessary at all) if the characters are at least somewhat well-drawn and the story possesses a modicum of interest. ""Constantine"" is a mumbo-jumbo mess from start to finish, with a story that seems to have been lost (or at least truncated) in translation, an overkill of CGI effects, and a running time that drags like a one-legged zombie in a science lab..."

","Not only can Keanu Reeves NOT ACT, but he has to demean himself with a trite and badly written script. Rachel Weisz was the only redeeming quality that the movie had to offer.This movie had to have been one of the worst ""good vs. evil"" genres ever written. It started off with a bang and soon whimpered out. At first the plot line seemed to take off, but then it was all so predictable. The special effect was one of the only reasons I kept watching and didn't turn off the movie mid-stream.. I could not get over the ""cross-shaped"" automatic weapon and the pitiful attempt at a ""Van Helsing"" type action sequence.

I was surprised that anyone could make a movie that would have me raiding the fridge more than sitting in front of the TV.<br/><br/>Perhaps the actors were on cue, but it seemed like something was missing... maybe content? I know if I had it do over I would not have wasted money on this movie. I think I would rather watch Gigli (Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez) a dozen times (have never seen it), than Constantine once. At least the prison scenes in Gigli might be a bit more realistic than the heaven/hell scenes in Constantine. Of course we all have our own opinions, but that's mine!"

"icurusfish","1","3","7","22 July 2005"," Truly terrible film but my opinion doesn't really matter
","I watched this film with no expectations of it coming even close to the comic book so decided to take it as an original idea. Even so this film was even worse of a hell than the one Constantine visited. I can't think of worse adaptation then League Extraordinary Gentlemen. but the this film wasn't based on the Hellblazer comics but ""Inspired"" by them. Keanu Reeves yet again acts like hes a block of wood then a sentient being, which, in action flicks or comedies is fine, but come on for Constantine it just doesn't work. It seems the character has had his entire personality stripped away and even his nationality. In the comics ( I know, I know I said I'd judge it as an original idea than based on the Hellblazer comics but unfortunately I can't) John Constantine is a complete asshole but here in the movie the worst I can remember him doing is not holding the elevator door open for someone. As well as that Chas is his best friend not his lackey. I suppose I can look away at the character not being British but not the fact that he uses a gun shaped out of a crucifix. I can keep going and going and going but then nobody would read this comment so I'll wrap it up quickly by saying that the makers of this movie seemed to have taken the whole complexity, depravity and wit of the Constantine universe and characters and raped them repeatedly. They then diluted the essence of them down enough so that they appeal to the most amount of people and come out at the end with a standard piece of clichéd action garbage. Once more Alan Moore must sit by and watch one of his creations take a beating by movie execs. I'm just glad that he decided to distance himself entirely from this movies making as the end result is pitiful. But really it's very easy to point out the mistakes of others with the advantage of afterthought. So my one good thing to say about this film was that they had the stones to make it and really my comment doesn't matter,or anybody else's, see for yourself whether it's good or not and screw anybody who tries to force you to see it there way. If you think its good I won't hold it against you"

","Overly-long, plagued by an uneven script and relying too much on fantastic special effects, Constantine also suffers from Keanu Reeves' acting  maybe his worst ever.<br/><br/>Reeves is a sort of supernatural detective, who goes about pulling demons out of little girls. Teaming up with Rachel Weisz to try and save her hell-bound twin-sister, he ends up needing to save the world from Satan's son. Yep, you read it right.<br/><br/>Constantine is nicely dark, and full of action...it starts strongly, and occasionally has some nice set design, but quickly flops into a mire of CGI. That looks great, but it's pretty obvious the producers saw the rushes and decided to try and blow the audience away with special effects, to distract from, and make up for, the awful acting and script.<br/><br/>Oh, and why try to be 'unusual' or clever when depicting Satan? His appearance was possibly the worst part of the movie. No, wait - that was Reeves' acting. My mistake."

","A detective, John Constantine (keanu Reeves), has been to hell and back once, since he tried to commit suicide as a youngster because he was able to see things. That trip gave him the complete ability to ""see"" and now he's getting rid of demons that have crossed over from hell and sending them back to hell. Because of his trying to take his own life, Constantine cannot enter the gates of heaven and furthermore he's dying from lung cancer. He encounters the cop, Angela, who, like Constantine, sees the same things. Her sister has just committed suicide (or has she?)and now Satan's very own son needs Angela to arrive on earth reborn and inflict a lot of pain onto the human race. But he needs divine help.<br/><br/>It's a good thing if you know your religion before seeing this movie, but most of the religious plot is carefully explained throughout the movie. Great special effects and a lot of humor are important aspects of this movie but unlike most other action/adventure movies it doesn't destroy the movie.

","I had been excited about the movie since I first started seeing previews for it on the internet and in theaters last year. I wasn't overly thrilled , this-is-going-to-be-the-best-movie-ever sort of thing, but I was looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Being an avid reader I picked up the literary adaptation of the movie (aka the Book: Constantine) considering I had nothing to read and the story, the more i had read about it, seemed like a solid one. I had never read the comics, and although not an avid comic reader, I have read a few.<br/><br/>When I went into the theater last night, I already knew the plot line, and understood the characters. Although there was more development in the book (which is understandable), I could easily follow along the story, as could my companions, without any foresight. The world was similar enough to our own (it is set in modern day LA) that you immediately can see the likeness of the world. The existence of demons and angels on Earth helped to describe some of the oddities of everyday life (""insane"" people mumbling of the devil and God) which further solidified the setting as believable and probable. With a story paced more upon the discoveries of Angela, a detective who is seemingly surrounded by odd circumstances, it sometimes seemed a bit slow - however I was entertained with the world and the plot line. I could see, however, others become disinterested or bored.<br/><br/>Reeves character, John Constantine, is portrayed as a pessimistic, pragmatic, cynical occult specialist armed with a special 'curse' (or 'gift') to perceive the other-worldly. Having experienced Hell, and aware of his damned soul - he makes his way through life trying to buy his way into heaven. His smoking and drinking habits - along with his negative attitude lead to a very refreshing anti-hero. His 'bad-ass' nature and obvious flaws paint an image of a very normal man with issues dealing with his life. Such a character makes the character development obvious and (perhaps) more meaningful.<br/><br/>The movie portrays a world that is dark, gritty, and (arguably) sacrilegious. Although dealing with a Christian world-view, it is a dark, cultist version. If you are one to be angered or turned-off by such presentations, this movie may not be for you.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is presented in a realistic and believable world with unique and stylized characters. The plot is intriguing although seems more of a pace-setter for a very character driven story. The sets are well done, and the cinematography is superb - somewhat akin to a comic book, yet not over the top like other recent films have been (Hulk, anyone?).<br/><br/>If you go in dropping *all* expectations, I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.

","Keanu Reeves fights demons, in a movie with Shia LaBeouf, that sounds terrible. But this movie is a fine contrast of terrible, Reeves does the melancholy jackass type with perfection, his inability to show emotion does him favor as John Constantine has the same trouble. The theology of the movie is perfectly done and everything is adequately explained, even though at some points the theology is read in dialog form and it doesn't work to entertain enough. The performances and the casting are done with great excellence, my only two problems in that department were Rachel Weisz's reading lines of her background story and Djimon Hounsou's accent changes, the first couple of lines he had were in cockney and I was excited as hell to hear that, but it faded to American English then back to the creole accent. The story unfolds beautifully with twists and turns I didn't expect, and the direction is spectacular. The scene in midnight's club with the half-breeds and the perfect circle song playing was a cool element, and anytime Balthazar(Gavin Rossedale) was on scene there was a burst of awesomeness in the style of the legendary movie bad-asses. But the Prize of the entire movie is the scene between Satan and John Constantine, Peter Stormare brings in a devlish form of the timeless carachter never seen before. Every time you look at him you get the feeling he's about to burst from his skin, he has an unusual eccentricity that is almost sick, it's totally deranged, almost a Kubric like monster. And any scene that an angel was shown, there was a lightening and outstanding presence on screen, most notably was Tilda Swinton's Gabriel, she played it spectacularly, the angel knows no feeling or emotion but she made a feeling of attraction to Constantine that was delightful, as small a screen presence as she had, it radiated throughout the movie. Shia LaBoeuf's carachter hadn't much use but a failed comic-relief and was lost throughout the movie. Pruitt Taylor Vince was perfectly cast as alcoholic father Hennesy, a psychic priest, his creepy, one of a kind eye movement utilized in Identity served amazingly in this one. All in all I loved this movie, I've always loved theology and history and this was a great touch to that sweet tooth, it's with defiance worth seeing more than once."

The story is very good, and over the movie is just cool. It does not make you question your faith, if you have a particular faith but poses more of what if questions to believers.

Sweet November, I suppose, was contractional. But he just doesn't do any movie. He made a very good choice with this movie. Keanu did a bang up job with this movie. He was Constantine.

Sure, as anyone may have noticed, rachel's performance is outstanding. and too much at that. for this sort of film anyway. reeves delivers quite good one may say(despite all you phony critics out there that have nothing but contempt for the guy), i especially like the ""one last show"" grin towards the end. glad i caught that cause that was beautiful. need i say anything about the dude in the white outfit? a more suited actor for this particular vision of Satan is impossible to find. in 5 minutes of screen time stormare blew even little miss dodson out of the water. again surprisingly great acting. fan or no fan. you should watch this. the powerful actors and great skill on the filmmakers part come together using the strangest choice for a story, and everything just to make you feel like a kid again."

My only complaint was against Rachel Weisz. I felt that for the character she portrays in the film she needed a lot of work. Keanu Reeves' style was, as always, Keanu Reeves' style, and I thought he did a beautiful job at being a demon hunter (or whatever that job title is). I think that the title role was given to a talented, competent actor who captured a complex character without making me annoyed. Shia LeBeouf was the perfect idolizing side-kick. I should point out Peter Stormare as Satan worked excellently with such a limited role. He makes a very swift entry and exit but does so with such a seduction that gives the impact that Lucifer himself needs. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel needs a little getting used to but gives a sexual ambiguity to her part which is completely necessary, in addition to which, she made it look easy.<br/><br/>As for the story line: I personally liked it. I felt it was funny (okay, fine, so I thought A lot of the movie was funny) in the right places, quick in the right places, slow in the right places. There are several different struggles within the film which the different characters deal with and I felt that each was executed and resolved wonderfully.

","Keanu Reeves is the coolest looking guy around. Take for example in his newest film, Constantine, where Keanu Reeves plays the title character John Constantine, a chain smoker, dying of lung cancer, and is one of the few who can see the demons and angels that walk the earth. He walks with an internal brooding, for he is a man who committed the ultimate of sins as a a young man, and has spent his whole life since trying to redeem himself in God's eyes.<br/><br/>Jon Constantine is one of the most interesting comic book characters I have seen in some time, The Character has a complex and troubled past, and does good deeds only so he can somehow buy his way into heaven. Now Keanu Reeves may look the part of John Constantine, but he most definitely can't act the part. Any scene where he is simply walking around, he's wonderful. Pick ANY scene where he actually has to talk, well, that's a different story.<br/><br/>The one character that I just found to be annoying as heck would be Shia LaBleof, who basically plays and even DRESSES as the exact same character he plays in I, Robot. Here, Shia acts as Constantine's private taxi driver and wanna be apprentice. He's your stereotypical wise guy, given the funny lines, and always left behind till the final act where he proves himself. the movie would have been better without him.<br/><br/>What really saves this movie from total disaster is the awesome visual effects that are used. There are genuine creepy moments in this film, such ads the demons themselves, or the hell that Constantine enters several times throughout the movie. the world Constantine lives in is utterly cool, dark, neutral. You have to be tough to live in a place such as this (here, LA). The plot comes off as somewhat trite, in that it never fully grabs your attention and en cloaks you in its story. there's no plot holes, per say, but there is a definite lack of meaning behind what happens to these characters and how the viewer only observes them but can't really relate.<br/><br/>Constantine is a total guy movie, boasting a cool character, and placing him in a world full of danger and action. The movie is mostly that, with an ending that takes its sweet time concluding and a hot chick (Rachel Weisz) who for most of the movie wears wet, low cut shirts. Can I recommend it?

","I though the plot was good; not only did they take the elements of the comics and being creative, but the mystery that they go was intriguing, not to mention the movie was exploring to the cult world of John Constantine. Some of the action sequences trilling and engaging, except for Constantine giving the Dirty Harry routine. The design was great, while some of the effects were okay. Good cast and characters (except for Shia Labeouf) and while Keanu Reeves was not the iconic Constantine, I still believe he did an okay performance."

","I'm not sure if this movie is boring, so bad it's good, or a genuine cult classic. This movie introduce side character just to kill them off. Chas, Berman, and the priest aren't much more than fodder for Keanu to almost get upset about. Rachel Wrisz is almost emotionless throughout this movie, but Peter Stormare chews scenery like candy and his time on screen is one of the most enjoyable 15 minutes in cinema."

"rdvljunk","5","2","4","6 January 2018"," very basic stuff, but Tilda Swinton is worth watching
","What this movie made clear was that Keenau Reeves is far, far away from even Tilda Swinton's shadow when it comes to acting. The role of Neo in the Matrix was more or less written for him, but it is actually all he can and in this movie it is out of its palce and annoying. Rachel Weisz, who played a great role in the constant garderner in the same year is total flat out and uninspired. This movie is however rescued by the (too few) appearances of Tilda Swinton as Gabriel gone mad. She puts al lot of fun in the role, you see she enjoys it and she sparkles from the screen. 
Now I have to admit the scipt doesn't allow the actors to really excell, all is pretty basic and predictable. Ofcourse Constantine will sacrifice himself to go to heaven. But the holes in the script are also obvious... if Isabel sacrificed herself by commiting suicide, why is she in hell if constantine goes to heaven for the same deed?
Well there are some silly demon attacks, we get some ugly make-up, holy water saves the day in some moments and well thats about it."
"vinnieboards","9","2","4","17 September 2010"," He can't act but who cares?
","Now let's be about right. Keanu Reeves is never going to win an Oscar or a BAFTA. Which is exactly why this film works so well.<br/><br/>John Constantine is basically a bit of an arrogant arse which seems to suit Reeve's acting style for once. Short on expansive dialogue, emotion, light and shade, this film was made for him!! The plot is essentially based on a comic book (which I might add I have never read), so I have to judge the film it's own merits. And its a really great roller-coaster ride with some fine performances. Rachel Weiss is on top form as the police officer with a hidden gift (and an impeccable American accent). A very young Shia Le Bouef as Chas Kramer is quirky, geeky and at times very funny. But the stand out performance for me is Satan himself, Peter Stormare, hilariously sinister and scene stealingly brilliant.<br/><br/>The plot is intriguing, the pace of the film is relentless and the special effects and action sequences are out of the top drawer. Add into the mix Tilda Swinton as Gabriel (and lets face it she does 'weird' better than anyone), a surprisingly good Gavin Rossdale as Satan's henchman Bathazar and the ever reliable Djimon Hounsou as Midnight and we are treated to a Gothic chiller which never lets up.<br/><br/>Its the first and probably only Reeves film that I haven't wanted to see more acting panache from him. Because his appalling acting style actually fits for once. Which is why this movie is a winner."
"g-bodyl","7","2","4","13 February 2010"," Exceeded Expectations but Needs More Work!
","I never wanted to see this film in the first place. Originally, I thought this movie would be a piece of thrash and that's rare coming from a generous reviewer like me. But, I was pressured to see this film by a few friends of mine. I decided to take the risk of wasting two hours of my life. Well, I was slightly surprised that this movie turned out to be somewhat decent.<br/><br/>Basically, this is about a guy who's in charge of sending demons back to hell. But all he really wants to do is go to heaven. Unfortunately, he can't go to heaven because of what he does. Now he has to face off with Satan and his demon cronies.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves was not impressive in this film. In most of his films, he just has the same expressionless look. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare carry this movie. They were the ones who acted well.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat confusing. There were some scenes that did not make sense to me. The story could have been better, much better. The visuals are pretty good. This movie seems similar to a movie that came out recently, Legion. Overall, this is a film that exceeded my expectations but I would not watch it again. I rate this film 7/10."
"pontifikator","7","2","4","24 May 2009"," Contains a spoiler
","""Constantine"" has the best Satan I've ever seen (in a movie). Peter Stormare (also in ""Fargo"") brings true savoir faire to the role of Lucifer. Keanu Reeves plays the hero, John Constantine, and my initial reaction was that he couldn't carry it off. I pictured Constantine as a hard- bitten dick like Sam Spade, and Reeves just doesn't have it. However, his attempt to be hard- bitten grew on me -- maybe Constantine is really a gentle, caring guy trying to play tough. I think it works.<br/><br/>The plot is taken from a comic book that I've never read. I think it's called ""John Constantine: Hellblazer,"" or maybe just ""Hellblazer."" I don't care. Most movies based on comic books suck pretty bad, and I had low expectations on this film. But ""Constantine"" very much exceeded my expectations solely because of Stormare and Tilda Swinton - more on her later.<br/><br/>Okay, the plot. Angela Dodson (Weiss) is a Catholic woman whose sister appears to have committed suicide, a big no-no in the Catholic Church. This means the sister (Isable, also played by Weiss) is refused a Catholic funeral and will burn in hell for all eternity. The name Angela is obvious, of course, but it turns out that Isabel means ""God's promise."" Constantine has a reputation as a sort of supernatural private eye, so naturally she seeks him out and puts him on the case - did she fall or was she pushed? So Constantine and Angela pursue the case in this world and the next, learning there's a plot to let Satan and his minions overrun earth. Can they foil it? Of course.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence keeps the film moving, lots of action and special effects (although I though his depiction of hell was mundane), unburdened by boy-girl sparks between our hero and his client (it is a comic book, after all). Two pieces of casting makes the movie rise above its comic book status: Stormare and Swinton.<br/><br/>Swinton plays Archangel Gabriel. I have no idea if the role was written with a man in mind, but if so, no concession was made for Swinton to play it. At one point she's seen in a mannish suit, and I don't recall references to Gabriel's gender (and I may well have forgotten -- what gender are angels, anyway?). She plays the role to the hilt. At one point, Constantine says with all sincerity, ""Gabriel, you are insane."" Best line in the movie, in part because it's totally true. Gabriel has definitely gone off the deep end, and Swinton plays Gabriel not as a thrashing lunatic but as utterly sincere.<br/><br/>Stormare plays Lucifer with all the panache of a mafioso who's got a job condemning to hell everyone that he can, he's good at it, and he likes the job. Total confidence, total competence. There are a couple of special effects hinting at his satanic powers, but it's pretty much just Peter Stormare giving Satan character. I really liked his work."
"ded_meet","9","2","4","28 April 2008"," Dark and fantastic!
","I actually just saw this movie for the second or third time recently and decided I must come here and give it at least a nine vote. It really hasn't been given the credit it deserves although over time the IMDb scores seem to credit those movies that deserve it. This movie almost came and went without any publicity at all in 2005. I had not heard of it and neither had any of my friends. And yet it is the best movie in this field. It is the best translation of a comic (Sin City and others have nothing on Constantine), and it is the best ""battle between heaven and hell on earth""-movie I have seen so far. But make no mistake - it is a very dark movie. Perhaps that is the reason some people don't seem to like it that much. But the darkness is also the strength of this movie, it gives the movie a special atmosphere and air that is an essential part of the plot and the characters in it. It is magnificent.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good and Keanu Reeves acting style fits the role of Constantine very well. There are lots of special effects in this movie and I must say they are very well made most of the time. They also play a role in the plot and aren't just cut in there as show offs... Some of the effects feel somewhat subdued but honestly that was alright by me - I feel it was probably a deliberate choice they made out of artistic reasons. They certainly had a budget for this movie but I think they spent it wisely.<br/><br/>For this is a VERY well made motion picture. The plot is not all that original, but the atmosphere and darkness and characters and motivations all come together to make this movie a very special one.<br/><br/>I can only say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Don't miss out on it!"
"atajiri","Null","2","4","28 April 2008"," Gooooood Movie :)
","I loved the movie! In fact, I watched it three times in 24 hours, because they had reruns playing on TV... and i finished exams a few days ago. I genuinely thought that every actor was awesome in their role..<br/><br/>One thing I didn't quite understand was whether Isabel was actually used by Balthazar/Mammon/Gabriel. I get that she didn't willingly kill herself, and that they had urged her into doing it.. but why? In that scene where Balthazar's head gets blown off, he says their main target was Angela.. so does that mean they 'killed' Isabel in order to lure Angela over? If they needed the help of a mortal/psychic woman, why didn't they just use Isabel? hmm.. if someone can answer this it would REALLY make me happy.. thank you!<br/><br/>Oh! I do agree that Keanu Reeves is a bit expressionless, but I think that's the essence to his acting style. I like it! And I found his acting in this movie probably the best I've seen out of all other movies he's starred in. <br/><br/>But yes! If someone can provide a possible interpretation of Isabel's unwilling involvement with the conspiracy, it would be much appreciated!"
"potc_fan360","9","2","4","26 April 2008"," Bloody Brilliant
","Constantine is based on the comics. This movie is about John Constantine, a man who can see demons and deport them back to Hell. He is approached by Angela Dodson, a woman whose sister died. However, she doesn't believe that her sister killed herself. I found this movie, while a bit dark, was compelling and thoroughly enjoyable. I felt that Keanu Reeves was excellent in the role of Constantine. However, there are a couple of icky bits, so be prepared for that. Rachel Weisz does a good job opposite Reeves. I thought the plot was good and so was the script. Everything builds up more and more as the movie goes along until the climax, with a good ending.<br/><br/>If you're okay with a little bit of horror involving demons and things of the like, then I recommend you watch this."
"a-362","7","2","4","13 August 2006"," Good movie with a bit of popcorn cinema
","When i've seen the Constantine DVD cover with Keanu Reeves i just expected him as a kinda crisis-ridden, hard-boiled addicted person who's doing his job as a matter of routine. And thats what i got. You see what's necessary, nothing about John Constantines past, nothing about how he knows all the stuff, just that he's an exorcist with nothing to lose, but with a weak point - his health.<br/><br/>What i liked about this movie is the camera work and some good shots, sunlight in the morning for example that's shining trough the windows. As well as the scriptural but not too religious storyline. On the other hand the movie failed in shock moments and had a part which was way too unnecessary, it gives Angela a touch of melancholy which is not bad at all, but more or less unimportant, i don't know if this is good or bad.<br/><br/>I think it was a good movie. It really reminds me of Hard Ball, in which Keanu Reeves had a similar role.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, good plot with a bit of popcorn cinema and some everyday occurrences which makes you laugh. I think it deserves 7 out of 10 stars"
"dameer","8","2","4","13 August 2006"," I had an enjoyable evening
","I was surprised. I never would have bought the film if I had read the cover before. Cruzifix-machine guns etc. are not my favorite. I just took the DVD to check my beamer after a calibration. I forgot the calibration and had a very enjoyable popcorn-home cinema evening. Keanu Reeves is perfectly fatalistic and Rachel Weisz does a super job. The film is a good mix of Dogma, Blade Runner and Matrix. I think in this kind of genre it is obvious that not everything is logical and you cannot expect it in this movie, too (is Matrix logical ?). But it doesn't matter here, it does not spoil the story. I like the story, the mood of the film and Keanu's coolness. If you want a relaxing evening just lay back, set the volume as high your neighbors can accept, and enjoy. BtW.: the soundtrack is also very good (watch the trailer and teaser on the DVD!)"

","No, ""Constantine"" is not part of a trilogy including ""Troy"" and ""Alexander."" It's not about the emperor at all, but about a man who can see the world behind the world, and is waging war against the scavengers of the damned. There was a nice documentary about emperor penguins, however, at Sundance this year. The males sit on the eggs all winter long in like 60 degrees below zero.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays Constantine as a chain-smoking, depressed demon-hunter who lives above a bowling alley in Los Angeles. Since he was a child, he has been able to see that not all who walk among us are human. Some are penguins. Sorry about that. Some are half-angels and half-devils. Constantine knows he is doomed to hell because he once tried to kill himself, and is trying to rack up enough frames against the demons to earn his way into heaven.<br/><br/>There is a scene early in the movie where Constantine and his doctor look at his X-rays, never a good sign in a superhero movie. He has lung cancer. The angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him, ""You are going to die young because you've smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 13."" Gabriel has made more interesting announcements. Constantine has already spent some time in hell, which looks like a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover. No doubt it is filled with carcinogens.<br/><br/>The half-angels and half-devils are earthly proxies in the war between God and Satan. You would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win. Constantine's lonely mission is to track down half-demons and cast them back to the fires below. Like Blade, the vampire-killer, he is surprisingly optimistic, considering he is one guy in one city dealing on a case-by-case basis, and the enemy is global.<br/><br/>Constantine has a technical advisor named Beeman (Max Baker), who lives in the ceiling of the bowling alley among the pin-spotting machines, and functions like Q in the James Bond movies. Here he is loading Constantine with the latest weaponry: ""Bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the Pope, holy water from the river of Jordan, and, you'll love this, screech beetles."" The screech beetles come in a little matchbox. ""To the fallen,"" Max explains, ""the sound is like nails on a blackboard."" Later there is a scene where Constantine is inundated by the creatures of hell, and desperately tries to reach the matchbox and get those beetles to start screeching.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays Angela Dodson, an L.A. police detective whose twin sister, Isabel, has apparently committed suicide. Isabel reported seeing demons, so Angela consults Constantine, who nods wisely and wonders if Isabel jumped, or was metaphysically pushed. Later in the film, to show Angela that she also has the gift of seeing the world behind the world, Constantine holds her underwater in a bathtub until she passes out and sees the torments of hell. No bright white corridors and old friends and Yanni for her. You wonder what kind of an L.A. cop would allow herself to be experimentally drowned in a bathtub by a guy who lives over a bowling alley.<br/><br/>Together, they prowl the nighttime streets. At one point, Constantine needs to consult Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), a former witch doctor who runs a private nightclub where half-angels and half-demons can get half-loaded and talk shop. There is a doorman. To gain admittance, you have to read his mind and tell him what's on the other side of the card he's holding up. ""Two frogs on a bench,"" Constantine says. Could have been a lucky guess.<br/><br/>There is a priest in the film, the alcoholic Father Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), whose name, I guess, is product placement. Strange that there is a priest, since that opens the door to Catholicism and therefore to the news that Constantine is not doomed unless he wages a lifelong war against demons, but need merely go to confession; three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and he's outta there. Strange, that movies about Satan always require Catholics. You never see your Presbyterians or Episcopalians hurling down demons.<br/><br/>The forces of hell manifest themselves in many ways. One victim is eaten by flies. A young girl is possessed by a devil, and Constantine shouts, ""I need a mirror! Now! At least three feet high!"" He can capture the demon in the mirror and throw it out the window, see, although you wonder why supernatural beings would have such low-tech security holes.<br/><br/>Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking. Eventually he confronts Satan (Peter Stormare), who wears a white suit. (Satan to tailor: ""I want a suit just like God's."") Oh, and the plot also involves the Spear of Destiny, which is the spear that killed Christ, and which has been missing since World War II, which seems to open a window to the possibility of Nazi villains, but no."

","Damned P.I. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) helps cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz ) solve the mystery of her sisters suicide only to discover a hellish plot to install the Son of Satan as Lord of our mundane plane. This kind of mystic-mercenary battling Evil shtick has been around the block a few times, so don't expect anything new as the conflicted hero battles hordes of CGI with theologically-inspired (and silly-looking) weapons (such as a drum-fed holy-water firing cruciform hand-cannon). As usual Reeves is as wooden as a piece of the True Cross, but (again as usual) still manages to make his gloomy, cancer-ridden, Hell-bound character entertaining, Weisz is routine as the skeptic cop who is forced to accept unreality, the ever-malleable Tilda Swinton makes an intriguing androgynous Gabriel, but if you are expecting some awesome manifestation of the Lord of the Flies himself, you may find Peter Stormare's arrival a bit of a letdown. The film is full of images that aren't really explained (apparently sometimes due to expository scenes being removed in editing) and the plot dances around the concept of redemption, which plays a role yet generates a massive plot-hole. Typical for the graphic-novel inspired genre, 'Constantine' is long on imagery and short on pretty much everything else, but remains fast-moving entertainment (but more for the soul than the brain)."

","Heaven and Hell are in eternal battle for souls, but angels and demons are prevented from staying on Earth. ""Half-breeds"" are living among humans, and by them Heaven and Hell affect people, but they are also prohibited from direct influence. They can only direct people to good and evil and provoke situations in which the real human nature of nature will show itself. If they violate the rules and thus disturb the balance of good and evil, John Constantine, a man with a gift to see the world of angels and demons, is there to stop them and ""send them home."" Keanu Reeves is satisfying as Constantine, but in my opinion he is lousy actor who reduces quality of any movie he's in. I do not like Rachel Weisz in the main female role neither, and there is no chemistry between them. Tilda Swinton is also lousy and the only actor who really leaves positive impression in this flick is Peter Stormare in the role of Lu(cifer). Story is interesting, directing and special effects are good and movie holds attention. It's worth watching, but don't expect too much.<br/><br/>7/10"
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","20 April 2015"," Not quite 'Hellblazer,' but still quite good fun
","In case you don't know 'Constantine' is actually based on quite a famous cult comic called 'Hellblazer,' but had its name changed when 'Hellboy' came out the year before and the film-makers were concerned with non comic book fans getting the two confused. So, Step 1 of how to alienate your core fanbase is change the name! The fan boys were not amused. They were even less amused when other changes were made to the script and story in general. It was fair to say that 'Constantine' was off to a bad start.<br/><br/>But it's certainly not that bad. Keanu Reeves plays the titular (John) 'Constantine' – a man who's soul is damned to hell for all eternity, but hopes he can get out of the inevitable afterlife in hell by doing God's work and sending as many Earth-dwelling demons back to their fiery origins. So it's a kind of action/horror/demon/supernatural affair. It certainly has elements of all of those genres, just don't go expecting much 'horror' in this horror movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps producers were aware that many people wouldn't recognise the franchise from its comic-based roots and decided that one way to get bums on seats would be to make it pretty tame. Yes, if you're really afraid of possessions and general monsters you may find this scary. It's hardly a kids' film, but its primary market is probably fully-grown men, many of which expect a little more gore and darkness from the big screen.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is hardly known for his acting, but he does his best and for whatever he lacks in dramatic ability, he makes up for by simply being Keanu Reeves. He's instantly able to be rooted for and you don't have to be a genius to recognise that he's going to fall for Rachel Weiss' character (sporting a not-so-great American accent).<br/><br/>So Keanu generally goes about the place, despatching one demon after another. If you squint at the screen you'll probably help yourself fail to notice how much CGI is used with each baddie he slaughters.<br/><br/>Constantine isn't a classic. It won't be remembered in cinema's history books. However, if you're generally in the mood for a little monster-bashing (and not a die-hard fan of the comic books it's based on) then put this on. You probably also check your phone a couple of times during the run-time and still known what's going on."

","I don't know if someone would not like Keanu Reeves and his outstanding acting. Before gettimg into the comment of the movie I would like to talk a bit about him and his life first of all he is all about donating he donated millions of dollars to different charities he nearly always uses the subway because it is never about money for him. You can easily understand that this is true as he has declined the offer for Constantine the series without even lokking at it nor accepted a sequel for a second movie. One of the things I personally love about him is that he shares his food with homeless people and eats, speaks with them. It must be good to be listened to when you are homeless. Still what I love about him is that he came from a humble background as a farmer and his shyness. Well lets begin talking about the movie. Constantine is by far one of my favorites of its genre the acting of Keanu Reeves is so natural that you begin believing that the world he is living in is real you see angels, demons, people with unnatural power and the line between hell and the world getting thinner and thinner although this fantasy world is something hard to believe you find yourself inside the story identifying with the character and its flaws somehow your childself begins doubting and asking if it the fear you once had was real and all thanks to Keanu . Watched it multiple times, would watch again and again."

","I watched it recently for the first time and I don't know the Hellblazers comics very well but I expected a dark but funny movie - similar to Hellboy, a bit edgier and more subtle humor. It was dark and overall a good, also the lines weren't bad, but dead pan delivery is not something Reeves can do and thus the whole thing suffered. Weisz performance was great and I liked the story and the visuals, but again you only see a lot of wasted potential when it comes to the lead performance. His tick with the Zippo is getting annoying really fast and his lines come off as something a juvenile brat would say. Which is again a lot of wasted potential considering the intriguing premise for Constantine's character, with a Machiavellian approach to find redemption and ultimately salvation."

","--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--<br/><br/>Constantine has had a bad rep in the world of comic book movies for quite some time now; and in some respects it's rightfully so, but in many more ways it is much more than that. Constantine represents a sort of comic book movie that isn't made often anymore, a comic book movie more for the middle of the road movie goer than the blockbuster audience. The movie makes more sense when it blends the screen and the pages rather than bridging the gap between them for non-fans.<br/><br/>As it's well known, the comic book world translated to film is basically ""Marvel"", ""DC"" or bust; then there's ""Vertigo"". Vertigo comics provides a home to more subversive and less accessible series such as ""Swamp Thing"", ""Sandman"", ""Doom Patrol"", and in this case ""Hellblazer"". However, even more curiously so is the rarity that a film based on previously established material caters so much to it's fan base rather than capturing a whole new audience; and that's what Constantine does. Rather than rally in new fans, the film tip toes around giving pivotal information and making sense of it's world in favor of letting it's already loyal viewers relish in some artistic license. Some of it may not make sense to those unfamiliar with the Hellblazer series, but it's this closed off, insiders club mentality, that helps push it into a more unique and testing territory rather than feeding all the answers to a new crowd.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film doesn't add to it as mere eye candy, but rather serves a more necessary purpose to accent the film or lend a helping hand to parts that would've looked out of place or dated if created using props or backdrops. While the script serves up a cautionary tale that is perhaps the only solid turns off, while it's dialog and interactions from actor to actor, mainly leads Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, light up the screen all the way till the climatic confrontation conversation that sees to the films to it's near end.<br/><br/>If there is one thing Constantine lacks, it's a clear and original imagine in which it utilizes to encapsulate the viewer. Everything is more or less a glorification of ideas already set in place by other films, and it's marvel is in the world it lets you into and the story it tells rather than the blockbuster look it sports. I see time being good to this movie as it's relevance in the 2000s has given way to later viewings by newer fans of the series or avid movie goers looking for a film showcasing the battle between good and evil; almost like a more serious ""Dredd"" or less campy adaptation of sorts. In all it's generic casing, lays a true gem of film-making in Constantine."

","Got to say this film is one of my favorite fantasy sci-fi films which enlists spirit world exorcist John Constantine batteling demons of brand management extraordinaire. Unflappable in one of his more interesting roles Reaves brings style and tenacity to the role. Well cast and well acted across the board the story is engaging with interesting characters bringing humor and a touch of the finger to the spirit world Although this is deadly serious business the demons are in a serious corner with Constantine. Never a good idea to corner demons though as one might imagine. The result is entertaining and never tips its hand. The journey in this one is where I get the kick, however."

","To find an all around entertainer, that has elements of horror, action and fantasy, and has a great cast and has a good story, and leaves you excited and on the edge of your seat, is probably not too easy. So there comes 'Constantine'. <br/><br/>This is one of those films that doesn't give you, what I call a 'bathroom interval', which is basically those few scenes that you can afford to miss, because its just a little extra and not much really happens. The whole way through Constantine, we meet characters who are likable and believable, supposedly in the world we share, except there are demons, and angels and there's God and hell and heaven and psychics and half-breeds. They also give us a young dorky Shia LeBeouf driving cabs and speaking in Latin. <br/><br/>This is a fun, no-brainer that needs to be completely enjoyed and not given too much thought. Reeves and Weisz share excellent on-screen chemistry and the fantasy element is sure to excite. It's definitely worth watching if in mood for some fun."

","it would seem most people that watched his movie in early screenings seem to miss the point, or just dislike this style of movie. I must say firstly, i've never read the comic, or even heard of it before this movie, but i found the movie most interesting, the characters well developed, and an ending not only that i could believe, but left enough that a sequel or two (Blade style) would be possible. Keanu is always going to come in for criticism for his acting, but i can't think of anyone better for this film (especially Nicolas Cage, as was first suggested). i haven't been this pleased with this genre of film since the original Crow movie."

","This movie had awesome effects, and an terrific performance by Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiz. The comic book genre are more popular then ever, with the upcoming BATMAN BEGINS and FANTASTIC FOUR are on the way. I found this enjoyable, the story starts with John Constaine(Keanu Reeves) who is a demon slayer, dresses almost like a film noir detective. John can't seem to get his way into heaven, because of his suicide years ago, that he had a near death experience. But a detective(Rachel Weiz) comes to him for help, to find out why her sister killed herself. But John soon learns that demons are after her for reasons unknown. I shore up there will be sequel in the future, This movie had great action and great suspense. Don't miss it."

"jogntheorem","8","8","29","8 February 2005"," A great movie. Very entertaining
","I've never read anything about the comics nor have i seen any of the trailers in full. So the expectations were for an action movie with little content.<br/><br/>In short it's entertaining. The pacing is excellent in this movie. Very even with no over the top dramatic scenes like in matrix revolutions. The only time it became draggy was nearing the end where the confrontation between the 2 angels could've had a little more excitement. Keanu Reeves is excellent in his portrayal of john Constantine, a tortured soul with a need for redemption. The other characters didn't quite have enough screen time, which would've made the film a lot longer. They could have added a few more scenes where Constantine shows Angela more of the other world, or more fight scenes, but it's pared all the way down without any useless subplots. It's actually quite difficult to portray Constantine's relationship to the side characters without really extending the movie and possibly boring the audience, which is good for those with short attention span, but i wouldn't have minded a much longer movie. So as it is, everyone else except the main characters gets short shrift.<br/><br/>The closest comparison that can be had with this film is Spawn,with effects and the heaven hell slant, but really this film cannot be compared to Omen and Prophecy because with the growing amount of computer wizardry brought into the movies from 2000 upwards, everything else before then is just too unrealistic.<br/><br/>Without the use of an omnipresent adversary, as is usually the case with these films, the enemy is time, and it's a little unfortunate that the screenplay didn't play up the role of the hidden adversary, which would've made the film a lot longer, but would've made the final showdown a lot more satisfying.<br/><br/>This film is great. In a season when there's a lot less action films and a lot of hotel Rwanda, this is a welcome thing indeed."

","Just seeing this movie, it made me more a believer then passion of the Christ ever did, this remark will probably make some people jump. Stepping away from those remarks such as, what a samy matrix performance, what a matrix gunfight, what a matrix sizzle and last but not forgotten, what a matrix dazzle. Keanu fits this part a a glove, he is egocentric, uses a lot of catchy lines and so forth, but that is exactly how the character is in the comics, and as a avid reader i am exceptionally pleased with the outcome of this movie. I liked the fact that evil and good was mostly universal, and the most powerful character, besides the gods and so forth themselves, is an practitioner of voodoo instead of a catholic priest. And that it is no scared of calling the devil and god less than pleasant names. It is nice for once to see a bit more of other religions, no matter how little, in religious movies, a much needed respite from the dominating Christian movies about good and evil. The effects are nice, although hell is to little a sequence, and the battles are entertaining. And lastly, remember that we all have a perfect version of whatever we read or see, transmuted into a movie, in our head, and these visions are NEVER the same as the movies, so be content, and one day you will See THE movie that is the closest realization of your imagination, so that you may die a happy person, wouldn't that be nice :)"
"Rza427","5","7","25","23 February 2005"," Constantine
","First off, since the Xmen series, practically every other comic book movie has been garbage. The only worthwhile comic book movies are the Xmen series and the first Spiderman. Just wanted to make that a point. As for Constantine, I think it was mediocre. The plot was way too pretentious and in combination with Reeves' acting the entire movie just kept sinking and sinking. Now, I am not one of those critics that jumps on the bandwagon for hating on Keanu. He's a sub par actor - thats as far as it goes, no exaggerations. His only real problem is his lack of versatility with expressing emotion - that emotion being believable on screen. Constantine was meant to be a dark movie and it was...but that alone does not define a quality movie. A quality movie has a lingering effect on the viewer as well as what I like to call the ""WOW"" effect. The lingering effect refers to the feeling the viewer gets after watching the movie, you leave the theater and constantly relive parts of the movie in your minds eye. The WOW effect is that once leaving the theater upon reflection of the movie you cant help but really scream, ""WOW that movie was amazing!"" For example, the Kill Bill Volumes and Pulp Fiction. The problem with Constantine is kind of the same problem SAW had. The writer/director/producer, whomever, built up the movie way to much and had so many ideas being thrown around and when on screen was hard to put together well. They killed the movie. Also, the running plot of the movie was diminished at the end by an unlikely character and it ruined the movie even further. Aside from that, the special FX were good...but I feel like that has become so commonplace in movies now. If you have nothing to do one day and you feel like wasting about an hour and a half or so of your life I suggest you watch Constantine."

I thought it was different, meaning good, it was a fresh take about heaven and hell and earth.

If you are ready to introduce yourself to a new story and a great movie, take this review seriously and venture into the scripting talent of co-writers Garth Ennis and Jamie Delano and the directorial influence of Francis Lawrence. Keanu Reeves usual monotone in his acting and voice suit this morose character well. Prepare yourself... This is not just any motion picture, like that mundane movie you're dished on the daily. Open wide... Absorb and chew on the concepts being presented, and you will have the fortune to savor what is one of the most mind-rousing realities and awe-inspiring impressions of dark fantasy pinnacles to date.

"hard_core_blaze","9","7","25","19 February 2005"," Constantine Was Great. Critics Need To Enjoy Life More.
","I liked the movie Constantine. I don't know why people don't like him but i think Keanu Reeves is awesome. The man is just trying to make a living people come on. Why do people not think he is a good actor? People who criticize actors are people who have no imagination. If they had an imagination they could see what the actor was trying to portray as well as pick up on the deeper meaning of the movie and if very talented each individual scene. Those with no imagination don't like the actors, don't like the plot, because they are too concerned in believing the only thing that is real is the world we see. You have to try and put yourselves in each of the actors places on screen and see what they are feeling according to the situation to truly enjoy a movie. An actor can't please everyone because everyone doesn't do the same things for each emotion. Example, someones happy one person may jump around in circles, another might smile a little, and a few could laugh ecstatically. An actor can't please everyone so show some respect and be open to different acting styles. You have to be open to different aspects of each individual to enjoy life. The only people who won't get this concept are the ones that have been socially challenged and haven't been around enough people to realize that one person can't please everyone and everyone has different ways of showing things so ace pt what they do as they will accept yours. In closing I would like to say next time you people go to a movie, remember what i said and ""challenge"" yourselves to feel what the actor is supposed to be feeling in the situation. Don't go to a movie for acting quality either, that movie was very spiritual, and had some life lessons and philosophical questions hidden in it. Open your eyes and look at things for more than what they seem, you'll be surprised how much greater your life will be. And another thing, don't criticize if you couldn't do any better. Sure Tom Hanks could talk down to Josh Hartnett, thats because he has been in the game longer and has a lot more acting experience making him better, Anyone who criticizes an actor must think they are better than the actor themselves and if so, why aren't they on the big screen. Graphics were believable but not as good as Lord of The Rings or anything. I give it a 9 Great plot, awesome acting, believable graphics. Graphics is what made it a nine. otherwise is would be a 10. Whether you like or dislike my opinion respect it. I didn't talk down to anyone who dissed Keanu Reeves I'm just saying, that you could be more open to things. Have a good one..."
"dtylice","7","7","25","18 February 2005"," Constantine is comic book meets catechism, and THAT's entertainment!
","Todays matinée was my first experience viewing a film in DLP. Watching the turf struggle between heaven and hell it seemed a supernatural choice of venue to witness another version of the ultimate conflict. You've seen the trailers so you know what the film is about. There have been other, less entertaining attempts to depict the rise of evil among mankind on the planet. Based on many of the web reviews I read before seeing the film, Keanu Reeves will be credited for the success or failure of the film. I won't judge the fairness of those observations, however I would like to point out that seeing Keanu in this role demonstrated his sensitivity, growth and experience. Is it monotone? or is it understated? He has matured in his craft and has developed subtleties that might be missed by those waiting for the next Matrix, or who think of him only for a reprise of 'Ted.' (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) The ease he with which he holds a cigarette or shuts a door; the emotional connection he shows with his costars may be lost on those waiting for the next demonstration of pyrotechnics. So lets be fair. In addition to actor assessment maybe we should judge the film on the merits of directing, writing and editing. The film is a fun, entertaining, imperfect ride. Like free will we have a choice once we buy the ticket: focus on the negative and leave the theater or stay have fun enjoying the sins of imperfection."
"s1natsuns3t","8","7","25","17 February 2005"," Don't Blame Keanu
","I just saw the sneak preview for this movie last night at UCSD. The movie, in my opinion, is better than all the bad rap it's going to get. You KNOW it's going to get a lot of whiny critics poking at stuff they honestly can't expect a movie like this to have.<br/><br/>First, acting: Keanu does an OK job at being a chain-smoking SOB, and they probably could have cast someone better-- BUT he makes the character work. If you've read the comics your probably going to be disappointed, but if you just sit back and watch him do his weird little thing he actually isn't that bad. As expected Rachel Weiss's performance exceeds his in quality, but even her performance is dwarfed by the glorious Tilda Swinton who plays (I guess ""the"") angel Gabriel. Very cool role, VERY cool actress. Good times.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is... well, just about what you'd expect a movie about demons and exorcisms to be: dark, rainy, and dreary. Kind of odd considering they chose to set the movie in Los Angeles, which, while still a sh*t hole, is pretty damn sunny and dry. PROPS for their portrayal of hell, however, because I think they did a pretty damn good job with that. Probably should have showed more suffering and torment down there, but that's why I think someone needs to make a big-screen adaptation of ""The Inferno."" <br/><br/>Now for the plot. I actually had LOW expectations for the plot, but it wasn't as transparent as I thought. It kinda does a lot of things at once, so when they pull it all together your like ""oh, okay, I could see that"". Not exactly any surprises, but I wasn't bored. I'm sure they could have been more faithful to the comic, which relied a lot more on Constantine's wit than this one, but like I said before, they work with what they have. As far as endings go... well I've seen worse. I enjoyed the way they ended it and I also liked how the plot and resolution of the movie relied a lot on character interactions rather than random action scenes.<br/><br/>Speaking of action scenes... yea, they're cool. But you've seen a million like them before. Just enjoy what they give you and don't ask for more, this isn't Crouching Tiger or The Matrix (forgive me for using those two movies in the same sentence).<br/><br/>Other things: I actually enjoyed the movie's portrayal of both demons and angels, and found that the angles actually got the better end of the deal in this CG round compared to the hoaky-looking demons (flat heads? c'mon). True, the demons get more camera time, but you understand. Also, the movie didn't overuse it's characters and didn't beg for a sequel, though I'm sure someone at Warner Bros will mention it someday. Overall it was a lot of fun and probably worth the price of admission, but if your one of those whiny movie watchers who are never satisfied with a super-hyped action film, your not going to find this one any more attractive in the end."

So I'm not about to make any comparisons between the movie and the comic, and whine abt details that waren't 100% accurately portrayed on-screen like some geek who has no life.<br/><br/>This was a great movie, plain and simple. The effects were spectacular but not overdone like in Blade, where you're completely distracted by how awful the CGI looks. In Constantine, they used it well, and whatever CGI was used, served the story well.<br/><br/>Keanu was all right as well. I'm sick to death of pple who bash his acting skills. Look, I know he's not going to win any acting awards from this movie, but he's not that bad either. (Plus, he looks really hot in that shirt/tie and long black jacket. I'm not the only one either. The demon Balthazar and Lucifer could hardly keep their hands and tongues off Keanu in their scenes together.) Anyway, you won't be bored or left fidgeting in your seat because the movie starts off right in the middle of action, where a young girl is being possessed exorcist-style, and continues at a pretty even pace afterwards. There were some lagging moments but if you pay attention, those talky bits are quite important to the storyline and how it all unfolds in the end.<br/><br/>Don't listen to those people who bash this great movie outright.

","I don't know what it is that everyone sees Keanu Reeves as the worst actor in the world. There are worst out there people! I read the review for his most recient move titled 'Constatine' and that person said that they didn't know much about the comic. In the 'Hellblazer' books, John Constantine is just this dull, average guy who just dabbles in satanism and witchcraft to save the day. His personality is also one of a kind due to Constantine caring more for his own survival than everyone around him. I think the director made a good choice to make Keanu Reeves John Constantine and I'm sticking to my words. For some advise, next time anyone is going to see a movie that is based off of a novel or a comic book, read it first or get yourself familiar with it before you say the movie sucked."
"Canapril-1","10","3","8","14 September 2005"," Constantine
","Please readers, if you haven't seen the movie 'Constantine' Please do not read any further, as this contains 'Spoilers' and I don't want to ruin it for you...Thank ever so much...Canapril<br/><br/>I think that director Francis Lawrence and superstar Keanu Reeves did one fine job out of this movie..for what they had to work with, that being a comic book character. Yes, I have to agree that Francis Lawrence's directional debut is stunning and that it was really well done. Keanu Reeves acted exactly the way that the character John Constantine really is like especially attitude wise, how he would react to any situation if you've ever followed any of the Hellblazer comics or novel's story. Keanu Reeves' acting is not thought of by his fans, as him having a trademark of wooden demeanor..that terminology was once started by someone...people thought it to be intelligently said, so writers kept using it. Keanu Reeves is indeed an action hero to many, a romantic figure to millions of woman and a hero to many young boys. His acting of the character John Constantine was exactly as it should have been. Constantine, knew he was dying of cancer, he was definitely thinking of trying to get in good with the man upstairs, to earn his way into heaven by doing good deeds...he hated that he had this gift, to be able to see half breeds and demons and he only thought of it as being a curse. He was far from being stoical, he was down right pre-occupied with trying to get to all of those demons and put them where they belonged and he was angry with this gift-curse..he hated being the way he was and knew he had to do good deeds, because he didn't want to go to hell after he dies where half of the people there, were those that he had sent back there. Yes, he sulked and he pondered heavily about the whole thing and searched for ways to get rid of them, even going back to hell in search of Angela's sister Isabelle and he was really emotional while trying to exorcise Angela by the pool and also in his apartment with the tub and water scene. He definitely was not coming across as bemused...he was always on the alert to try to make things right, the terrible things he could see and hear and he had had enough, even throwing the Good Book on the floor in Gabriel's Library den. Thats Emotions and Thats Anger!<br/><br/>Each to his or her own opinions... speaking of emotions, how about when you see his hatred for the demon soldier in the little girl? His disgust for the demon within her...What is that, if not emotions? there were many, too numerous to mention.... but I got a super great charge out of Keanu, when he was thinking of whether or not Rachael should keep her clothes on for the bathtub scene...he truly was giving it some heavy duty thought..even if it was only for a few seconds... it was... Totally Funny!<br/><br/>If you try watching it more than once (I've seen it 4 times)....guaranteed you'll see all the parts you've missed and were not aware of the first time around...you'll get an altogether different perspective on the whole film and you'll see and hear more than you expected or that you did the first time viewing.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does not fail in his acting of the character Constantine and neither does the film. If you indeed watched the whole film, you would have known that Constantine did not fail, the son of Satan doesn't survive in Angela, because Constantine exorcised it, so John Constantine gets his wish, he gets to live, because Satan removed the cancer from his lungs. Satan also loses as daybreak comes in and Satan can't be present in the light of God and Satan realizes that John Constantine made a genuine, sincere sacrifice, so Constantine lives! Its a Supernatural Mystery Thriller...Constantine (Keanu) was a fine exorcist and knew how to rid LA area of all these half demons and he was doing a lot of good but his good deed was only recognized by Satan that John Constantine, finally made a sacrifice and that's how Satan loss.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is one heck of a fine actor, he is very versatile and flexible in all the roles that he has played throughout the years and at least he tries different roles. Just because he acts a part, that a director wants him to do or performs a certain way, doesn't mean that the man Keanu Reeves is like this at all. He's an Actor and he did a fine job on this one and so did the director and the rest of the cast. There's a saying that goes with Keanu Reeves, you either like him or you don't and I like this actor, cause he's not afraid to try different roles and he's not conceded like many out there, he's down to earth and very polite and he takes time for his fans and the public, so big deal ..he likes his private life private..wouldn't't you? Yes, save your money..and then go buy the DVD and watch it more than once, its totally different each time..by the way after the credit write-ups, there is another scene..or did you stay long enough to watch it?<br/><br/>Note: Constantine is out now on video. I work at a Video Store, I can tell you first hand that 'Constantine' is being rented a lot and sold often. Maybe you didn't like it, but many people do."

","Well, there goes the world again, for the End of Days is nearing. I must admit that I'm not a real fan of 'Angels versus demons' of 'God versus Lucifer' films, but I thought that the comic book based Constantine could bring a nice twist to the oh so familiar story. Sometimes it even does. The film is well filmed and at times it is really surprising. What the film lacks though is depth and excitement. The film is not very gripping and I think that is because the lead character (played by Keanu Reeves) is not gripping enough. Whether this is a failure of the script or Keanu I can't really say, since I don't know the comics but I admit I felt little connection with our hero. I could connect much better with Angela (Rachel Weisz) and I think she acted very well. She was about the only one who brought some feeling into this. Sure Keanu had some funny lines and his cynical ways were pretty good most of the time, but his character and Weisz's didn't seem to connect at all (on any level). Another minor 'bug' in my mind is that the bad guys weren't well-cast either. They just weren't scary in any way...it always seemed that while Constantine was just a man and they were demon's they couldn't do him one bit of harm. Silly...but an explanation for the lack of thrills in this one. In the beginning I expected something like The Crow, Dracula or Vampire Hunter D and in the end I got 'The Exorcist on the road' or...well you've read the summary...<br/><br/>somewhere between 6,5 and 6,75 out of 10 (with a small 7 given upon voting)"
"theunseeneye","1","3","8","11 August 2005"," Bad, bad film.
","Terrible action/horror movie that puts on a lot of hot air but lacks a lot of brains and substance to pull off the story its trying to tell. Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the job and his performance is that bad. You just want to smash his faces of the people who though that he was right for this kind of role. You just don't take him seriously and you end up laughing at him more than being intrigue by his character. His co-star Rachel Weisz not only has a more interesting character than he does but is 100 times more the actor he could ever hope to be. She not only gives the film's best performance (a performance that has more life and complexity than the film itself) but is the films only redeeming quality. You actually want to spend more time with her character and pick her brain on the life she have lived and the sister she has forgotten instead of the mindless dribble that the film because after the second act. Her story would have made a much better and scarier horror movie but of course this is a Keanu Reeves movie, and we have to suffer with a script and a director who will cater to his limited needs as an actor. The director has some talent with visuals but he has no idea on how to put a actual film together and the screenplay is so unfocused that you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time.<br/><br/>Worth a look for Weisz's efforts but don't hold out hope for a film as good as she was"
"Lord_Frog","1","3","8","22 July 2005"," A total disaster
","It's with a certain glee that I am submitting my opinion on this ""movie"". Once in a while comes a movie that is so atrociously bad that it becomes fun to hate. CONSTANTINE is one of these movies. It's easily (too easily) the worst movie of 2005, but it's also a strong contender for the worst movie of the last 5 years. Before you dismiss me as a Keanu Reeves hater, know that I love (and own on DVD) the full Matrix trilogy (yes, even Revolutions) and My Own Private Idaho, definitely his best role to date. I'm also a big horror movie fan. So all in all I was really excited when I went to see that film. The trailer was awesome, I couldn't wait! The film starts well, I mean the first 5 to 10 minutes. It's all downhill from there, culminating in the most unexciting climax of all time, with Peter Stormare as the most ridiculous and non-threatening Satan ever. Keanu Reeves kind of proves his naysayers right by offering one of his most awful and wooden performances ever, on a par with his ""work"" in Brad Stoker's Dracula, but worse, as in that movie he didn't have such a long time on screen. Here, he's there constantly, non-playing. Ewww. Rachel Weisz is good (as always), but not enough to save the film. I lost any interest whatsoever after half an hour, and the only reason I didn't leave the theater was that I didn't want to be rude to my mate, who I had dragged to see this. I thought maybe he was enjoying it. However, when the stupid and absolutely unexciting climax happened, I turned to him and asked ""Are you enjoying this?"" He replied ""Are you kidding??"" ""Should we leave then?"" did I ask... ""It's almost over, we might as well stay"". Well we shouldn't have. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. Oh, for those of you who think ""it might not be fantastic, but I'll watch it for the special effects""... a word of warning: the CGI looks like a cheap video game, absolutely not realistic. Rent it if you must, but don't make a blind buy, you will regret it bitterly!"
"nova1636-1","Null","3","8","19 July 2005"," Why this movie condemned itself to hell
","Okay, so here's my typically film-student critique of this movie. I'm not going to just bash it without giving good examples and saying what I would've done to change it if only I'd written the damned screenplay.<br/><br/>Problem # 1: Tone. It's a movie about Heaven and Hell and demons on earth and the apocalypse. A good director and writer could've really done this movie justice by making it darker, excluding the cute, witty one liners and quirks and going for the R-rated brutality of its theme. I don't totally blame the director for this: there were some interesting moments I give him credit for and some great mise-en-scene choices (devil in a white suit--classic); a little too much CGI for my taste and not enough left to the imagination, but I think he did his best, to no avail. My point is, a perfectly good excuse to use the darker, more serious tone that would've suited this concept was squandered, and my two hours were bruised because of it. <br/><br/>Problem #2 (a more obvious problem): wasted time on too many characters and repeated actions. This movie could've saved precious time by combining characters--thereby allowing us to understand and get to know them better--and by not having 25 trips to hell and 7 exorcisms (don't say ""Nuh uh""--I'm exaggerating). Here's what I mean by combining characters: the priest, the bowling alley guy and the annoying sidekick all could've been made into one character, the ""sidekick/researcher"" character who does all the things these three do for the plot without weighing it down with three separate characters. Also, Balthazar and Gabriel could've been combined to form a singular ""tangible threat"" character; Gabriel could've easily done all the things Balthazar did without having to splinter into two separate characters. Why wasn't this done to prevent the chaos of too many meaningless flat characters with five-minute parts and deaths that came before you could even give a crap about them? Because of Problem # 3... <br/><br/>Which is this: Constantine shouldn't have been an adaptation of the comic. It should've been based on the comic. What's the difference? It's the difference between O Brother Where Art Thou (a film based on Homer's Odyssey) and Troy (a poor adaptation of Homer's Iliad). A film based on a book or comic has more creative freedom to know which characters or events do or don't work for the film, to make changes, to deviate. The screenwriter made the mistake of thinking he had to adapt this comic to film, and thereby assuming that this meant he had to squeeze an entire comic book series and all its coolest characters into a 2-hour frame, necessity and plot be damned. <br/><br/>That said, I'm not totally mad at this movie. Keanu gave one of his biggest efforts at acting ever (some will snort that that isn't saying much). Plus, every time I see Djimon Honsou smile I have this Pavlovian response that makes me say ""I like him"". And Peter Stormare made the most original devil I've seen in a while, with his wonderfully creepy mannerisms and discomfiting presence (funny thing: the first time I saw him in Fargo in a scene after he kills a cop, I said ""That man is the devil--in a real good way""). So to wrap it up, here's my solution: some writers need a license to adapt comic books. Then maybe we'd have more Sin City's and Crow's and less Constantine's."
"snow0r","5","5","17","23 March 2006"," Not a perfect balance, but entertaining nonetheless
","Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Reeves), an anti-hero who plays the role of some sort of guardian, maintaining ""the balance"" between the angels of Heaven and the demons of Hell in an action movie that is guilty of trying too hard to be stylish, slowing down what is otherwise an enjoyable action flick.<br/><br/>The acting in Constantine is one thing that can't be faulted. Reeves, with his his hushed tones and anti-heroic mannerisms, puts in a decent performance, with his cruel but amusing character endearing the audience just enough to carry the film along. Weisz is similarly effective, as are the rest of the solid yet unspectacular supporting cast.<br/><br/>For the most part, the CGI is pretty smooth too; it isn't exactly understated but it's not overused. However, I do have a problem with the needless art school camera angles and turns of pace. The introduction of Keanu is shot with such needless...lack of style. We get a slow motion shot of a cigarette dropped from the window, to the floor, we get a birds eye view of him exit a cab, and we are treated to an exorcism from the point of view of his cigarette, for no real reason. The overuse of the slow motion irritates me the most. Keanu's first descent into hell is a prime example of this; it takes poor Rachel something like thirty seconds to close the door, and this cheap attempt to play off the success of bullet-time sucks the pace out of what would otherwise be an enjoyable action movie.<br/><br/>The plot isn't overly confusing, and it explains everything neatly enough. It could have perhaps played up the theology a bit more, but then it wouldn't really have been an action film anymore. Overall, it's good enough to be worth a look but sometimes feels a bit slow. Don't expect a classic and you shouldn't be too disappointed."

That and the fact that Reeves is a good, solid actor in his own right. The movie is a solid production that relies on special effects and character interaction to get the job done. It does admirably. All these people out here bashing this movie that have seen it, need to see it again and make sure that they aren't getting mad at the previews to other movies. I understand that everyone has their own opinion but when a movie opens with 11 million dollars in the FIRST DAY has something to say- with an exclaimation mark. I have no doubt that this movie will topple the 100 million mark easily. (lord knows I'm gonna go see it a few more times)I mean, I respect that people are not going to like this movie, but... don't cram the fact that 'it sucks' down my throat."

","I have to say I went to this movie not seeing any previews, not knowing a thing about the movie, and more importantly, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie. I am glad I went, as this is a movie that left me wanting to see more. There is a not as much action as one would hope, but the special effects, the plot, and the ending was wonderful. This movie does have it's comedy here and there, which surprised me, but it had that punchline just where it deserved it. It seems like Keanu has been doing movies that are simply original, and that is what makes this movie great! A great deal of the actors are from Europe, so their accents add to their roles superbly."

It takes a lot of balls seeming how I bet you couldn't do half as good of a performance as he did. It really blows that you guys make fun of someone because he does a better job at something than you could ever do in this lifetime or the next...

","Although a lot of people have trashed this movie, I really thoroughly enjoyed it. Keanu may not be the best actor in the world, but as this dark character involved in the supernatural I found him to do a great job. The plot, I thought, was pretty sound. Many others have said it leaves out all background story of other characters involved, and it does so for Chaz (Shia LaBeouf) and Beeman (Max Baker), but it's not very difficult to figure out background for some of the other characters. It's not exactly obvious or evident how Constatine comes to be who and what he is throughout the movie in his life, but it's pretty unimportant.<br/><br/>I didn't think the special effects were bad, as not all that many or extensive effects were used, and thought the wings on each of the ""half-breed Angels"" were totally awesome. I liked the minimal use of specific physical weapons and more the use of religious icons and symbols.<br/><br/>This may not be the deepest movie of the year, as it's pretty simple and surface, but I thought it was enjoyable, fun, interesting, had enough action to keep me interested without making it what I would call a purely action movie. I enjoyed it enough to see it twice opening weekend, and I'd recommend it to most everyone I know."

I had been expecting to be disappointed, but I honestly went through most of the film with my mouth hanging open - absolutely blindsided by the fact that this film... actually... doesn't suck.<br/><br/>Now, if you're one of those hard core comic book fans who just refuses to accept the idea of Keanu Reeves in this part, then fine, nothing is going to keep you from hating this movie. The fact was, however, that Keanu didn't do half-bad job. His dry, dark, emotionless visage works well within the realms of film noir (far better than I expected) and damn, if he doesn't pull off cancerous well.<br/><br/>All of the other actors were exceptional - although I didn't hear a lot of what Gavin Rossdale was saying because my companion couldn't stop laughing and going ""IT'S BUSH!"" over and over (to be fair, I WAS thinking this).<br/><br/>The effects, cinematography, and editing were fantastic.

","From the first frame until the last, Constantine entertains. The special effects are well used and not overblown. The screenplay is very witty and the visuals compliment it well (if you are very observant of the scenes you will be awarded with some really hilarious subtle details). The film is just as entertaining as a summer blockbuster, has the intelligence of a thinking man's thriller, and has more scares (well engineered ones at that)than any of these schlocky horror flicks of the recent months (Boogeyman, the Grudge, etc.) The imagery is also very intense (a fight scene near the end in a Hospital is simply jaw dropping and is worth the price of admission alone.) The smaller roles, Midnight, Satan, Balthazar (Bush's Rossdale takes quite an impressive turn here), and Gabriel steal the scenes they are in easily (Peter Stormare's Satan in particular, one of the best incarnations of the Devil in cinema history). Rachel Weisz is solid, as is Keanu. A lot of people don't like Keanu because he lacks the seriousness of someone like like Clive Owen or Sean Penn. Well luckily, the screenplay isn't all too serious and Reeves is just as much fun to watch as the anti-hero as he was in Speed or the Matrix. I can't imagine why this film is getting as low marks as it is, even if people find Reeves unwatchable the story is solid as is the visuals. Go see Constantine and decide for yourself."

The story isn't brilliant or new but that really doesn't matter at all. If you are open minded and like a movie about angels, demons and the devil than watch this one and have good dirty fun!!! And all you Keanu haters out there: you don't have to like him so could you please be so kind and avoid his movies so I don't have to read your never changing opinion about him anymore.

For once, or in many occasions as the cynical John Constantine, he exhibited more than the usual five facial expressions he had in all of his previous outings - frown, deeper frown, even deeper frown, awkward happiness, painful scornful look.<br/><br/>So for that alone, Constantine deserves a good rating. The apocalyptic feel of the movie is not unlike that of many horror/thriller movies - 28 Days Later, 12 Monkeys - and it worked pretty well with the wry humor of the title character. The wit and plot may not be as sharp as the comic, but I think it was good enough for a movie. Definitely worth the ticket price. (Rachel Weisz wet in her undergarments was a bonus.) Bet there is going to be a sequel."

The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who gives the only good performance this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice.

","﻿I can only say that I have regretted watching a film and wished I had never seen it only a few times in my life. This is definitely one of those times. What on God's green earth were they thinking when they green lighted this project? Up front I have to admit I am an evangelical Christian in Seminary preparing for ministry, so I am a little slanted. But hear me out.<br/><br/>I enjoy watching films because in part they can tell you volumes about the attitudes and feelings people have about faith and God. This looked like it would be an interesting film to get a pulse for the spiritual attitude of America. Right from the trailer I knew it would tackle some pretty big questions. But I am afraid this film speaks volumes of the hopelessness people feel. I came away depressed and saddened. Evil is ever present, close at hand and God is no where to be found. Worse still man is left to fight this great evil on his own. If it is truly as bad as the movie portrays why do any of us stick around to endure? What hope do we have the next life will be any better? All of us I believe desire a relationship with God why can't we portray that on film instead of laws and rules? It would at least make us feel better wouldn't it? I think this film got at least one think right about man's spiritual condition (though I seriously doubt it was intentional), man is without any hope separated from a God who intervenes in our lives.<br/><br/>OK spiritual questioning over. I gave this film a 3 instead of a 1 because it is visually stunning. It truly captures something of the horror I personally believe hell must be like. The other computer effects were equally dramatic and terrifying. But the more I think about the plot and character development the more this film disappoints me. Why does Satan's son choose this time to come out onto the world? Why would Lucifer not want his son to reign death and destruction on the world. If this is truly a dualistic world why do we see a predominance of demon half breads with out angelic ones being just as prevalent? Or better yet how are half breeds even created if there is no crossing over between plains? If in heaven there are more chapters in the Bible how do people on earth know about it? The main item driving this film is that the truce, the balance is being broken. Why then does this balance seem so easy to break and why does it only seem to get broken one way (ie from the demonic side)? This film in my opinion simply fails to be consistent in terms of plot and characters. Rules are broken for the sake of story way to easy and way to often."

The classic battle between good and evil, except what this movie/comic story does is introduces the gray. That gray is John Constantine, works for heaven, but is damned to hell. Plus the guy knows it, that makes it worse for him. How can you be anything but cynical when you are working your hardest to go to heaven, but know your going to hell. Keanu plays the role perfectly. A lot of people might be confused with the movie, but really there isn't much too it. Take a step back, try not to think too hard and enjoy the ride. It is all there, and if you don't get it the first time, it will come.<br/><br/>Who cares if you think the CG sucks, the new Star Wars has great CG but, the character development just isn't there. You can tell the Actors are enjoying their roles, as the cast is absolutely brilliant. This movie isn't for everyone, but if you enjoyed Devils Advocate, or movies like Ninth Gate & Stigmata, this one is for you. If you are a big Will Smith fan, and favorite movie is ranked up there with 2 fast 2 furious, maybe you should avoid this one and stick with movies that are pure action, no thought required. Hey that formula seems to work, cause they keep getting produced. However, since spider man became a hit and every comic book from the green lantern to Straczynski's epics Rising Stars and midnight nation have had movie rights bought up, maybe this is the new trend and formula in movies. At least they are using stories that are entertaining.. Lets just hope they get them right, too bad about daredevil and elektra."

They say that film is the 7th art, so movies should express the creator's ideas/concepts through story and characters - to make others ask themselves questions, explore a different view of the world - or just make people laugh (like in comedies) or get their adrenaline going (thriler, action, horror etc).<br/><br/>There is nothing truly original about this movie..<br/><br/>So what was ""Constantine""'s purpose? <br/><br/>Demolishing the biblical myth of Good and Evil as super-human forces, unjudgeable from our human a.k.a. limited point of view by saying it's just a game between God and Lucifer? And that they must be doing this for fun, playing us like marionettes? Geez, this is as old as the Greeks(which, you know, thought of gods as being pretty ""human"" in feelings and judgement). The film-maker could of at least add something to this ancient, saturated view of good&evil; try to give new arguments sustaining the theory, explore it with more depth or at least make the skepticism in the movie more ironic and fun, make it all much more pragmatic...

The only thing I didn't see coming was Gabriel helping Mammon and, although it's not at all new as well (see another angel, Lucifer, with his rebellion against God), it did turn out to be surprising (gotta hand it to the actress who played Gabriel, pretty convincing role). Stormare (Devil) was also good in his part, managing to get the best out of his poorly written lines.<br/><br/>Constantine's lines are really pathetic.. I mean, ""This is John, John Constantine. ..asshole"" It's only meant to be cool for fifth grade, right? Sounds like ""Bond, James Bond"". Come on ppl...couldn't they find a less-popular cliché to copy? pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. And also giving the demons ""the finger""... For a swift, smooth, cool exorcist superhero in denial of his status kind of guy it's.. indefinably stupid, it makes the character look like a big fat Looser(this among many other things).<br/><br/>OK.. so storyline and suspense 0 points out of 10.<br/><br/>Acting - 4 for Constantine, 7 for Gabriel and the Devil, 5 for Angela.<br/><br/>The special FX were pretty good, but not exceptional, except for the Hell. I'm sure everyone can comment on this part, cause it's really simple to say whether you were impressed with visual effects or not.. cause they have a big impact on you in a movie. <br/><br/>All in all I see this as a very commercial movie, but one resembling a low-budget one.. Too many loose ends, too many clichés, too little concern for the substance. That's what happens when you only care about profit."

","This movie was awesome! I saw it in digital version in the cinema and I was astonished! Though the subject of the movie isn't realistic, I thought it was wonderful, containing lots of messages underneath. Also I thought the acting of Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz was great and the tension between them is almost touching my skin. Combined with a lot of exciting action and dry humor, it makes one movie you have to see.<br/><br/>The comment that Keanu can only play Neo, I think is the comment of a rather critical person, who doesn't have a clue where the story is all about. Yes, there's the coolness that is just part of being Keanu, but Neo is the goodness himself, when John Constantine is almost the opposite.<br/><br/>Don't go to movies with great expectations, it will always turn out bad..."
"electrohipoprockturnativ_chic","8","3","9","4 March 2005"," hot and action packed
","First, keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who never read the Hellblazer comic book series.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a chain smoking exorcist who's trying to buy his way into heaven with his work. Not only can he exorcise demons, he can also travel to Hell and back. He meets a woman named Angela Dodson(Weisz) who's convinced her twin sister's death wasn't a suicide. She turns to Constantine for help.<br/><br/>This movie is a fun ride right from the start. It has great special effects, fun action sequences, and some sweet weapons for destroying demons. Unlike most others, I was pleased with Reeves's performance in this film. He plays the bad-ass characters well. Weisz is also excellent in her role. The only downside is some of the plot holes. We learn in the film of half-breeds that live on earth (some people are half-demon or half-angel). We also learn that hell has its own version of the bible. The things like this I wish the film would have given us more information on. For people who know their bible well, this movie will be especially frustrating.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie very enjoyable. I hope there will be a director's cut when the movie comes out on DVD. 8/10<br/><br/>Recommend if: *you like action *you like movies that involve spiritual warfare<br/><br/>Avoid if: *you don't like to see graphic violence with blood *you're offended by strong language"
"stamp1","9","3","9","3 March 2005"," I Liked This Movie
","Reading the negative reviews here on IMDb, I wanted to say I liked the movie. Yes, it wasn't perfect. I thought there were too many characters and unexplained actions happening in the first 15 minutes, but that is what made the movie a mystery, and I like mysteries. Much of the fun was trying to figure out who everyone was and why they were doing the odd things they did. Reviewers who said they couldn't understand the plot, either you didn't try to understand it, or you REALLY didn't watch this movie at all, or you just aren't very smart.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't care for, as another reviewer pointed out, was for a gay, weirdo, Italian Godfather-type Satan. As the lord of Hell, he didn't seem that scary, but he acted like a creepy old gay man who was trying to kiss Keanu, while running his hands up his legs, and leering at his crotch. Yes, a lot of gay men want to do this to Keanu, but I didn't like it. If I'm going to pay money to see a gay man make-out with Keanu, I would like it be romantic, not creepy.<br/><br/>For the reviewers who raved about the great job Stomare did as Satan, I felt the actress who played Satan in ""The Passion"" did a FAR BETTER job portraying the beautiful scariness of Lucifer. Lucifer means light, he shone with beauty but was full of evil wickedness. When Jesus is resurrected, we see his TRUE evil self as he howls and screams. Actually, the Balthazzar character, handsome and sexy on the outside, but completely evil inside, was a much better portrayal of Satan in this film than what they ended up with.<br/><br/>For all the reviewers who hate Keanu just because he is alive, I say, ""Nobody wants to sit here wasting their time reading about how much HATE you have in your heart for him"". It's too bad that most of you will be going to Hell, since your souls are consumed with such hatred for Keanu, there is NO way that you will be going to heaven. If you can't stand watching him, then why are you paying money to go see his films? The answer is, most of you are not telling the truth when you say you saw this movie. You wouldn't have paid money to see your anti-Christ, Mr. Reeves. If you had seen this film, you would have enjoyed it better.<br/><br/>The reviewers who said Rachel was the best thing in the movie, well, she was good. But she wasn't the best. The SFX was the best part of the film. The special effects were some of the best ever. (Although the bug demon was kinda weird.) The scenes of hell were great, the demons scary. I wish those scenes had gone on longer, but they were expensive, so they didn't. Heaven was beautiful, but we only saw it for couple of seconds at the end. The bullet-time glass at the end was great.<br/><br/>For the reviewers who said the film had humorous lines, intentional and unintentional, I agree with you. There was subtle humor, and some in-your-face humor. I laughed when Keanu hits Balthazzar with his specially made brass knuckles. I thought it was clever when they mass-produced Holy Water in the hospital's water system, a very unique way to SPRAY Holy Water on a crowd of demons.<br/><br/>For the comic purists who say the film is horrible because it doesn't match the comics in every detail: One, after 200 issues of comics, the movie would have been 3 years long. Two, make your own version, see if you could do any better. Yes, it would be nice if they were as faithful as LOTR, but that was a 10 hour trilogy, this wasn't. AND LOTR was not 100% faithful either. This movie was good in it's own way, and I liked it better being set in the hellish Los Angeles of smog-covered California, than the gay London of Europe. There is no way that Jude Law or another Brit could have done as good a performance in this film as Keanu did. PERIOD.<br/><br/>Yes, I own some of the early Hellblazer comics, up to #56. Stopped buying them when Prince Charles was possessed by a demon who ate his victims. They made Prince Charles a cannibal Jack The Ripper. Back in the early 1990's I found that offensive. Now that we have learned more about what the real Prince Charles is like, I don't think the comic was so off-the-mark as I did 13 years ago. When I was buying Hellblazer, they weren't Vertigo titles. I guess Vertigo came later. I was also buying early Sandman comics at that time also.<br/><br/>My conclusion: The film is for adults (no children under 15) with great special effects, an interesting mystery type story in a dark film-noir setting. Keanu is good, and sexy (he should have filmed the movie shirtless), the supporting actors were good. Stay after the credits to see a surprise ending, which leads to a sequel (like the Pirates OTC ending does).<br/><br/>Movie's Philosophy: There is a Hell, and Heaven, and God and Satan, demons and angels, whether you want to believe or not. There is a war going on for the souls of humans. If you wish to be redeemed and go to heaven, believing in God is not enough, you must be repentant, TRULY repenting your sinful life. You must be willing, like Jesus, to SACRIFICE yourself for others if necessary. Good eventually wins out over evil, though it may take a while. Sometimes good people die, but they go to Heaven, not Hell, as their ETERNAL reward. After we see Hell, we understand why humans would want to go to Heaven instead.<br/><br/>See this film for yourself, don't listen to Keanu-hating reviewers who probably didn't see the film anyway."
"wyplmaa","1","6","24","31 January 2017"," Problem, taking the Bible, hacking it up for entertainment and fable
","I have read other reviews, one in particular basically says that the movie wasn't meant to be gospel(the truth) but rather entertainment, I get that. However, the FACT that Heaven is real, God is real and Satan is real, regardless of whether or not YOU believe, makes it a serious matter to propagate the fables of the Catholic church and to trifle with the truth written in the word of God. There is a Satan, he is a fallen angel. Men do NOT become angels when they die. No amount of good deed will EVER win you a trip to heaven, in fact, if you count on your deeds to earn your way to heaven, you will be disappointed and find yourself in the place referred to as hell. That's right. Only Jesus can offer eternal salvation to those who accept Him and His death on the cross to pay for all sin. No amount of good deeds will make you MORE saved or less saved. But with ONLY good deeds, you WILL be lost forever UNLESS you repent. That is the ONLY message of the Bible. It isn't about punishing yourself for past sin, trust me, if you sinned, you punished yourself. There is always consequences for sin, some worse than others. Murderers are often judged and receive the death penalty, but even a murderer CAN and WILL be saved if he/she TRULY believes in Christs immaculate birth, righteous life and His own sacrificial death on the Cross. And add to that, His resurrection on the 3rd day. Yes, it is real, it is serious and making a movie DELIBERATELY PERVERTING the scripture is WRONG. Sorry, but the truth isn't always the way you wish it to be. Now you have heard the truth of the Gospel, now it is in YOUR hands to decide. No one can make a decision for you except you. We all must appear before God at the judgment. But if you receive Jesus as your personal savior(not a priest who is every bit the sinner as you and I happen to be), but go to the HIGHEST priest, Jesus, He and He alone forgives sin. Do NOT accept fables, believe the truth."

","Completely disregard the comics, in every way. The comics are called Hellblazer, different name, different stuff. Watch this movie with a clean slate and you've got a pretty sweet movie that gets surprisingly harsh in what it is willing to show us - this flick doesn't pull any punches.<br/><br/>There is no shortage of reviews for this film on the internet, so that's as far as I'll go, but I will say this: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a terrible movie. It was unfaithful to its comics. It was bad even if you never read the comics. Constantine is a pretty sweet movie. It's unfaithful to its source material. I'm sure having read the comics you will find a lot of things to complain about here, but just let go and enjoy it. The comics will always be there for you when you get home from the theater, and if they managed to make an enjoyable film despite not remaining true to the source material, that's still quite a feat.<br/><br/>See it.

I would definitely suggest you not shy away from seeing the movie or buying it when it comes out on DVD. The movie left me wanting to know more about the characters and how the story proceeds.

"CinemaClown","Null","2","5","19 September 2019"," Settles For Far Less Than What It Was Capable Of
","A fascinating fable of angels & demons with humans caught up in between, Frances Lawrence's directorial debut packs an interesting premise yet is unable to flap its wings due to issues of its own makings. Keanu Reeves' presence is no less than a divine intervention here coz without him, Constantine is very much a hopeless ride.<br/><br/>The story concerns a demonologist who has a reputation for dealing with the mystical and has been repenting for his past sins by sending demons back to hell, hoping his good deeds will finally grant him a place in heaven. But when he's approached by a police detective to investigate her twin sister's suicide case, he learns of a conspiracy that threatens all mankind.<br/><br/>Directed by Frances Lawrence, the first act is rather impressive & piques our interest with ease while paving the necessary groundwork. But it's unable to keep a firm grip on our attention for long as the plot only gets sillier & goofier with time and goes full bonkers in the finale. It is lacking in atmosphere, has no build-up whatsoever, and is missing the required seriousness.<br/><br/>It would've helped if the film had a dark, gothic vibe with skilfully executed moments of tension & suspense. What we get instead is a watered down version of a material with far greater potential. Keanu Reeves' charisma conjures more magic here than his performance but he does enough to keep us around till the end. Tilda Swinton is reliable as always while Rachel Weisz ably plays her role(s).<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Constantine has the beginnings of a cool, stylish & thrilling horror-fantasy but the story fails to capitalise on it. Somewhere along the line, the debutant filmmaker loses his grasp on the narrative, resulting in a finished product that settles for far less than what it was capable of. The cult following it has developed over the years may give the impression of it being an underrated gem. For me however, it was nothing but dull, bland & underwhelming."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","5","22 January 2010"," It was an okay film I guess
","There were some good things about Constantine. The special effects and cinematography are outstanding and keeps you interested. The music score is excellent, and there are some good performances. I do not care for Keanu Reeves, but he does an okay job in the title role, though his character could've done with more development. Rachel Weisz is a lovely actress and she is good here in two roles. Peter Stormare is fantastically suave and debonair in his villainous role. Tilda Swinton is the best though, she is absolutely delicious as the androgynous angel. Francis Laurence directs efficiently as well, and there are some good scenes such as the discovery of the relic in the desert- daft I admit though. However, the plot is very convoluted, and lacks a clear sense of direction, and the script feels rather sticky. In terms of character and storytelling, the film feels diluted. It certainly isn't a bad film, with the visuals, direction and decent performances, making up for the plot convolutions and the sticky moments in the screenplay. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","I watched this movie earlier this evening. While not overly impressed I still found this to be very entertaining and waaaay better than a lot of recent comic book style movies, such as Catwoman, Hellboy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Elektra etc.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with the source material. I did however contrary to many reviews here, find Keanu Reeves to be very good in this film. His Character John Constantine is a chainsmoking, arrogant and obnoxious guy, who does not let people in to his personal life. He is dying of cancer and tormented by inner demons (as well as fighting real ones outside). Having been damned to hell, he is trying to somehow buy his way back to heaven by vanquishing demons on earth (which only he and a select few can see). I think he portrayed this individual very well, the supporting cast also gave decent performances. I seem to slightly disagree with many people here on Rachel Weisz's performance, while quite good was not exceptional as many have stated here.<br/><br/>The eventual meeting with the Devil was a little disappointing, but overall it was definitely not a bad movie. In fact I found it to be very entertaining and visually excellent.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Keanu Reeves as I have only really liked him in a few films. But here I think he performed well and the movie was all the better for it."
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","2","5","4 September 2007"," The second coming is a total failure
","Surprising new enactment of the sacrifice of a man who had always been in contact with the other side of reality in a vast fight against Lucifer to whom the world has been totally abandoned by God. And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce. Even Archangel Gabriel is totally spaced out and corrugated and Lucifer will punish him by burning his wings and making him human and sensitive to suffering. Let's hope for eternity. The special effects are from time to time agreeable and pleasant but never really outstanding. The story is messy and obscure and the spear that had been used by a Roman soldier to pierce Jesus' side on the cross and had disappeared for some time reappears by pure luck somewhere in Mexico of all places. Naïve. And we don't know at all what's the use of it and what it brings to the story. The second coming of Lucifer's son is a failure. The second coming of some Jesus, new or old, is also a failure since Lucifer has to resuscitate him for him not to go to Hell for eternity. And they repeat as often as possible that He has a plan for anyone of us. In fact He and They have nothing for none of us. We are lost in a messy haphazard conflict between a truant God and a totally disorganized Lucifer. That's what divine providence amounts to: nothing at all.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

I liked them together and the whole ""I'm in it for myself...except now that I met you I do selfless things, ala Han Solo"" thing has been done to death, but it works.

The plot doesn't seem to have any direction though and it's all over the place....a lot of parts in the movie should have been consigned to the ""deleted scenes"" section. It started out as a very serious and dark supernatural horror flick then turned into some big yawn horror-comedy. Even more tragic is the fact that it's one long anti-tobacco advert! The acting was pretty good - can't blame the actors for how lackluster the movie turned out - that ought to be reserved entirely for the scriptwriter and the director/producer. Reeves and Weisz are brilliant together. The romantic undertone to the pairing didn't match the mood of the film at all.

What was with the Mexican who found it. It was like he became possessed after finding it and then going to LA. But, why was he possessed and by who. Was it Satan? I don't know. And I didn't get Gavin Rossdale's character. Who was he supposed to be. First, I thought he was the son of Satan, but he bites the dust half way through. What was he trying to do? And what was with Gabriella. I thought she was an angel since she had wings, but she is seen at the same place as Balthazar and is trying to kill Angela.<br/><br/>Then the part where Constatine holds Angela underwater in the tub made no sense. I get the near death experience part, but how did he know she would go to hell and not heaven. And why did he have to hold a cat when he sent himself to hell to look for Angela's sister. And how did Satan suddenly show up at the end? I could go on and on with more plot holes. But, I guess since this was based on a comic a ton of info got left out.

"padiyark","6","2","5","13 September 2005"," Dangerous Habits...
","""Dangerous Habits"" is the title of the Hellblazer graphic novel upon which ""Constantine"" is based. It is also a decent description of the pattern that Hollywood has recently been taking to adapting graphic novels. While I do accept that movies that are adapted from novels need a little trimming, Hollywood had the habit of re-writing the whole premise to make it ""original"". ""Sin City"" was really the one true exception, but in turn, it almost created a backlash for the director.<br/><br/>The cast is (for the most part) exceptional. Rachel Wiesz as the detective with an unknown power is charming as always. Tilda Swinton does her androgynous turn as the angel Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as the African mystic Midnite is perfect, and Peter Stomare, a great character actor recently seen as the torturer in ""The Brothers Grimm"", puts a nice touch on the Satan character. Heck, even Gavin Rossdale from Bush is fun as the half-breed demon Balthazar.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, Keanu Reeves is cast as Constantine--mistake one. Anyone who has read Hellblazer knows that even in the dreariest of moments, Constantine has a little life in him. Reeves, on the other hand, decides to redo Neo as a psychic detective with wood in his heart. Not good. Mistake two--the script falls on its face. We never truly understand why Satan and his minions want to torture Constantine so bad. The explanation given was so weak that Satan would have a grudge on many more people than just Constantine. Also, Constantine from the novel was always selfish, and would always use magic to resolve his problems, which only created more problems for himself and those he loved. Not necessarily in this case. In this movie, he is a relatively moral character. The role of the other characters are pretty much warped from the original story. Finally, by trying to use elements of one novel with a mutation of another (""Dangerous Habits"" and ""Son of Man"", respectively), the filmmakers cram too much in to even develop any characters.<br/><br/>On the whole, Constantine is a relatively fun flick, but a)check your logic in at the front desk, and b) Hellblazer fans should think twice before seeing it."

The writing and direction in this film are all over the place, despite the incredible source material of Alan Moore's popular ""Hellblazer"" comic book series.

There are two performances which keep this movie from being a one-star mutt... Rachel Weisz is superb within the restraints of the dead script, elevating the material as much as possible, and Tilda Swinton shines as a creepily androgynous Archangel Gabriel.

","There will always be the typical arguments about this film. Some will adore it, some will hate it and complain about it to no end. Fact remains that it pulled in hundreds of millions at the box office. Does that make it good?? No. It just makes it popular hence all the difference in opinions. I have never read the Hellblazers comic books so I went into this with no expectations and was pleasantly blown away by it.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeve's acting ability is limited, that's no secret but nonetheless there are some roles that have him stamped all over it such as Neo in the Matrix series, or any brooding, quiet type action hero and the lead role of John Constantine seems to fit him like a glove. Constantine appears to be your typical action horror film and not hard to create but the real genius behind Constantine that sets it apart from all the rest if that it actually becomes a very intelligent, complex thriller filled with religious overtones and an interesting plot line. I can't disagree more with some IMDb critics who called the plot ""flat"" and Constantine's character underdeveloped. I thought the writers of the film (also writers of the comic) did an amazing job of creating these characters in one film. They perhaps gave us too much if they're hoping to turn this into a franchise. Reeves' Constantine is a dark lonely sort who has struggled with his ability to see demons since he was a child. His inner turmoil and emotionally repressed state comes through in a major way. He has very few close friends, family so to speak and one by one in this film they are killed off. They were great characters and I was sad to see each one go because they had so much more potential but it was necessary for us to see the life which Constantine lives. Rachel Weisz as the lead actress and somewhat romantic interest does a great job. Weisz is very versatile and interesting actress and is easy to watch. She seems to take any role with ease. Reeves and her have great chemistry and they work well together on screen.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence who, up until now, has been known only for music videos does an amazing job as his directorial debut. The special effects were NOT cheesy as some critics will say but rather subtly used which is much nicer change. The film was not flagrantly full of CGI and annoying fake effects. The action was non stop and on top of that comes an incredible story. The religious aspects however fictional they may be are interesting and we are given more and more information as we go along and you can't help but be caught up in this spiritual battle on earth between Constantine and the half breeds (half demon, half human.) On top of that there are several scenes where we get a glimpse into hell which is kept so brief that it keeps us wondering and imagining the horrors. The appearance near the end of Satan at first seems very tacked on and he's not very impressive. However as he continues in his role (played by character actor Peter Stormare) you begin to feel an evil there, something held back, something within. You begin to see that this calm facade is only burying something more and I hope in the future they bring him back for more. There is history to be discussed between Satan and Constantine. Overall I don't think there is much better for an intelligent, offbeat action film out there. I would see this again and again and I hope for Franchise status although I don't think any will be as good as this original. The Constantine character and film is brilliantly done with loads of promise for future stories. Check this one out for action fans. 9/10"
"harcher","8","2","5","16 August 2005"," I really enjoyed it
","I really did enjoy this movie, up until the last five minutes, and was surprised at how well acted and written it was. I am not a religious guy so am unsure of the accuracy with which the Christian/Catholic framework was followed, and I am not sure it really matters. I also have not read the comic book this movie was based on, which is usually for the best as I had zero expectations going in. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves stars as a spiritual exorcist/detective/general bad-ass who very early on shows us that he is capable and experienced at sending demons back to hell. This is followed by a mystery that twists and turns down the path of murder, demons, angels and hell. All of this is laced together with the suicide of a female cops twin sister, both played by Rachel Weisz. This leads to the inevitable confrontation with the bad guy, Lucifer, and the special effects ridden ending where the good guys win, etc... Sounds pretty formulaic and boring? Well on the surface it kind of is, and while I enjoyed the effects I did not find them overpowering the story. This, in itself, is getting to be a big deal these days. Further, the movie touches on some issues that speak to our humanity and the nature of God and the Devil. In this story, Lucifer is not really evil, he is just an ex-angel that loved god so much and saw humanity as unworthy of God's love. He then decided to show God our unworthiness by tempting us with all kinds of subtle tricks. A word here, a word there...Better yet, we see this in the actions of the angel Gabrielle when she/he tries to bring forth the son of Satan to our world and bring on the whole apocalypse thing. <br/><br/>So while this movie is very predictable, I was still surprised at the message I got from it, and even kinda pleased if you will. So I would recommend it on these merits, I liked it and hope you like it too."
"MockTurtle12","8","2","5","11 August 2005"," I despise critics. They never get anything right.
","I saw Constantine last night. And first thing that I want to address is that I think this movie got unfairly slaughtered by critics. I really enjoyed it. Not only was it visually wonderful, but it had a great plot, a great anti-hero and was philosophical without being preachy or confusing.<br/><br/>We all know Keanu is an dreadful actor. We know, we get it. But when there's nothing you can do about it, you have to accept it. Of course, there are occasional moments in the film that you can't help but laugh (""Take a deep one"") but for the most part his acting is tolerable.<br/><br/>I could talk about this film for hours. It leaves so many questions in any person's mind - especially those with a intellectual and philosophical curiosity.<br/><br/>So let's start the revolution. When it comes around, the critics will be the first with their backs against the wall."
"moonspinner55","6","2","5","29 July 2005"," Artless farrago has lots of CGI effects but little genuine style
","In an attempt to get back in good with God, chain-smoking Keanu Reeves, who has seen demons on Earth all his life(which led to a suicide attempt), dedicates his life to driving the demons back to Hell; meanwhile, a female police detective, investigating the murder/suicide of her twin sister, believes occult forces may be to blame, AND someone out in the Mexico desert has come across the same sword many believe was used to kill Jesus. Sometimes baffling, mostly bizarre graphic novel concoction will probably blow a lot of people away, and indeed it has some arresting sequences, but too much of it is thrown at the screen simply give the audience a jolt. When Reeves, hacking up blood on a busy street in Hollywood, is attacked by a demon made up of insects, we're never quite sure whether others can see this, where this monster came from, or why he's attacking just then. The picture is very jaded and thematically sloppy and a little stupid, with one very funny supporting character shafted in such a way that it left me only feeling revulsion. We get glimpses of Heaven and Hell(mostly Hell), but for all its bravado, ""Constantine"" isn't very memorable. I had nearly forgotten about it the next day."
"SILENCEikillyou","9","2","5","27 July 2005"," This is my kind of movie....
","Action. Good vs. evil. Angels and demons. A man on the edge. Cheesy... yes, and many intervals. However, I just really like watching this movie. Keanu plays the part as 'the one' very well, and it's no different in this movie. I think he does better as a character that's kinda clueless (like in Matrix). When he is supposed to be a seasoned expert at something, he 'overdoes' the cockiness. Still, I just thought he was a real gas in this movie, and the whole badass character always appeals to me in movies like this.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say this movie might not be for many people. But, characters and plot are right up my alley."

","This was a beautiful movie. Keanu Reeves (in all his magnificent glory) played the role of Constantine perfectly, keeping me rapt whilst watching. Rachel Weisz was good in her roles as Angela and Isabel Dodson. Shia LaBeouf was fairly annoying, and his character wasn't very good (Chaz Kramer) but he was bearable, and made the movie slightly funnier in some ways.<br/><br/>The CGI effects in the movie are great, contrary to popular opinion, and I think that hell looked particularly realistic.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and gave it a 9 out of 10, ESPECIALLY because Keanu did such a good job in the leading role."
"Aaron1375","8","2","5","20 July 2005"," Keanu Reeves on the highway to hell.
","Pretty good movie, nothing super, but a fun two hours nonetheless. This movie is about a guy who sees demons and angels and sends demons who are naughty back to hell. The catch (there is always a catch) is that he is dying of cancer and he is not going to heaven when he dies. Why, because he attempted suicide as a young man and according to this movie that means a one way trip to hell no matter how good you are. Well Constantine is not exactly an angel either, even though he performs exorcisms and such. Well a spear has been uncovered and the demons are doing things differently...Constantine must pair with a cop whose twin sister has committed suicide in order to find out the deal. Action and special effects abound aplenty in this movie with some pretty good action and a few doses of horror in there just for safe measure. It is not all good, however, because other than Reeves and Weisz (the gal from the Mummy movies) there is not another soul I recognize in this movie. This movie is also in need of a better bad guy as well as there really is not a well defined one here. Still though you are in for a ride as how many other movies feature a crucifix shotgun?"
"devon98","9","2","5","19 July 2005"," Completely unique movie
","Constantine based off of the comic book hell blazer was horribly inaccurate to the book itself. However, If one did not compare the two Constantine was an incredibly entertaining movie. Despite the fact there aren't too many Keanu fans I strongly suggest that people see this movie due to Keanu's better than normal performance. He's not well known for his acting abilities, but it seems that biblical, end of the world movies such as The Devil's Advocate bring out talent in this much despised actor(read the other reviews of this movie). Constantine has a rather good exorcist like plot combined with some interesting special effects making it worthy of recognition. Despite the idiocracy of others who have reviewed this I must say Consantine is an awesome flick with more than a few surprises and twists especially at the end after the credits run."
"deepion","8","2","5","3 April 2005"," a good comic book move?
","First off, i have to say i have never read the comic that 'Constantine' is based on (that would be the DC/Vertigo comic book 'Hellblazer'), so i guess i can't really comment on if the movie reflects the comic. However, as a movie in its own right, 'Constantine' is nothing short of near perfection (or at least that is how i saw it). As the movie ended I thought back throughout the movie and realised that at no point was i ever bored or horrified (in the bad way).<br/><br/>This is a neat little movie which is great fun to watch, makes perfect sense, has just enough comedy without being stupid and has plenty of action (without being too dumb). They could have made it so stupid, but they kept it quite intriguing and not a comedy. Even Keanu Reeves (who is often faulted in his roles) did a good job. It was great fun to watch, some great visual effects, some subtle humour and some nice twists as well. A surprisingly good movie and one i believe everyone who likes a good supernatural action/thriller will like (especially those with largely religious stories). It is also the best anti-smoking message i have ever seen. In short, well worth seeing."
"Chris_Docker","6","2","5","1 April 2005"," Goth comic-book thriller that eventually picks up steam
","The mix of comic book action and palpitating priests hardly led me to expect the sort of film I might enjoy and I had to restrain myself for the first half hour of Constantine from walking out. It's like X-Men meet the Exorcist. Keanu Reeves wanders in as if he's still in The Matrix, this time calmly exorcising heavy-duty CGI demons from hapless muggles. The slim (very slim) basis of all this is that he who holds the Spear of Destiny (that, according to the gospels, killed Jesus) rules the world. Spear has been found (shades of Tolkien's Ring) and sets off all sorts of strange goings on. There is a wafer thin line between heaven and hell, which is reality as we know it. God and the Devil have fun playing at keeping a perfect balance and it takes a strange event (such as the reappearance of the Spear after it had been hidden at the end of World War II) to allow any creature from either 'side' to manifest in the real world.<br/><br/>The trick to enjoying Constantine I discovered is not to treat it as a horror film but as some updated goth battle of good and evil. Perhaps for Roman Catholics (who probably believe in that particular version of heaven, hell, the power of the church etc), films like Constantine - and the Exorcist for that matter - hold more terror. After all, if we think we might go to Roman Catholic purgatory, a story about it is more scary than if we don't, right? The other side of the coin can be seen if we watch early Japanese horror movies that rely on their (to us, equally innocuous) mythology and ghostworld bogeymen.<br/><br/>But once you buy into the genre (think Spiderman, Blade, The Crow) it becomes reasonably entertaining. The appearance of Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel adds a somewhat novel touch and prevents the otherwise fairly predictable action from getting staid. Constantine is enjoyable enough at a push - or push it to one side for the much better offerings that are available in its genre."
"movieguy1021","7","2","5","20 March 2005"," Constantine: 7/10
","Did you see Exorcist: The Beginning? Neither did most people, but I found it to be a creepy drama with great acting and terrible direction. Francis Lawrence's Constantine is the opposite: there's terrible acting and good direction. Both are similar to each other in plots: they're both supernatural thrillers about demon-fighters. They both also star actors who are pretty cool, and both movies are pretty creepy. That's why I liked both about the same.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) tried to kill himself when he was younger and was literally seconds away from death and going to Hell. As an adult, he wants to get into heaven, and tries to do that by sending as many demons back to Hell as possible. He meets Angela (Rachel Weisz), whose twin sister committed suicide, and Constantine has to go and figure out what happened. Things get hairier, and there's Pruitt Taylor Vince. Need I say more? Constantine had a budget of about $100 million, and it shows. There's a lot of great images here, and about half the budget obviously went to Venetian blinds. The movie looked great, mainly thanks to Lawrence, who debuted with this movie. The opening scene, in particular, sticks with me. It's a typical scene that seems to be in all heaven/Hell dramas (an exorcism), but Lawrence's spin on it is truly unique, and makes it quite exciting. The movie is enthralling through its typical runtime (any comedy is 90 minutes and any drama/thriller is 120 minutes, no questions asked), and oftentimes quite exciting.<br/><br/>No one will doubt that Keanu Reeves was amazing in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. However, ever since that, everyone's realized that he can't really act. Stellan Skarsgaard in Exorcist was a lot better. Still, Reeves is pretty cool as Constantine, and you need to be a certain cool for this movie. He may not be the best actor, but he's cool nonetheless. Weisz does a pretty good job, too. Djimon Hounsou, the breakout star from that mediocre movie that everyone thought would win a bunch of Oscars but ended up flailing In America, shows up as a paranormal...guy...thing. His role's not really explained, but it's pretty cool (as is the guy's who lives in the back of the bowling alley). And Pruitt Taylor Vince.<br/><br/>People will dismiss Constantine as just a simple February release, trying to ride the coattails of Exorcist: The Beginning or something like that. Don't believe them. Although hardly original, Constantine is an enthralling, entertaining two hour thrill ride. And there's Vince.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10 Rated R for violence and demonic images."
"howismyfish","9","4","14","3 March 2005"," A pleasant surprise!
","Honestly I was not expecting much from this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and the comic book movie genre has a heck of a lot more losers than winners. What I got was a very pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>I have not read the Hellblazer comic books so I can't attest to accuracy, but this was one hell of a movie (no pun intended).<br/><br/>The movie was well acted on all parts, even the kid from Even Stevens (whom I very much dislike) did a good job with his role. What really surprised me was the storyline. It was great. Not just a run of the mill angels vs demons with a human in the midst. It was well thought through and excellently portrayed. A huge plus to the movie was the special effects. Simply incredible in every way. Everything looked very realistic and was beautifully done.<br/><br/>I can't not recommend this one. The only people I can understand not enjoying this movie are people too absorbed in themselves to consider the possibility of Heaven and Hell or Catholics/Christians who are too over the top to enjoy a good movie about such a serious topic (regardless of the moral, which I thought was a pretty good one). I say that this is a movie to see."
"aecharrion","8","4","14","1 March 2005"," decent enough
","I liked this movie. no matter what was said by critics its was a decent action movie. it is a very mild version of the comic, but i did find Reeves suitably sarcastic, rude and ambivalent. telling the devil fu@k off as he floats of to heaven made me laugh. and the devil was suitably yucky and distasteful. though I'm sure he could have been worse. the special effects were top notch. the story line was sequential but not stupid and you had to pay attention to understand it, not matter how straight forward. a lot of the plot revolved around coincidence but probably could be explained away. of all of the characters in this movie the angel Gabriel was very good. suitably demented and holier than thou, and though she was suppose to be androgynous she came off as female. i could definitely see there being a sequel to this one."

Well, we can say it does have some influences from the classic Exorcist but apart from that I really don't see where the hell they related it to Matrix...whatever.<br/><br/>John Constantine borned with a gift, or a curse I may say, he has the power to identify possessed persons and reverse the situation maintaining the balance between heaven and hell, keeping demons out of this world. But lately something is wrong...demons in our world? That shouldn't be possible...Go see it! It's a great movie, lots of special effects, great acting from Keanu and Rachel among others, awesome plot using spiritual references, a KEANU movie definitely!"
"leaf6559","7","5","20","23 February 2005"," It worth watching
","I think this movie is not too bad.<br/><br/>In fact, it is an anti-smoking movie.Once Constantine appears,a cigarette will be smoked.As he said:""I used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day when I was 15 years old].So,in this movie, there is a lot of scenes that reflect the harm of smoking.For example,Constantine usually vomits blood and cough.After he had tested his gun,a poster appeared.It written:""Smoking is harmful,never try it!"".In the last scene,He ate chewing gum instead of smoking.If this is the theme of Constantine,it is really success and effective.<br/><br/>How about the characters?Keanu Reeves is the perfect actor for John Constantine.In my opinion,He should be a depressed,elusive,sober and powerful hero.Keanu Reeves did it.His wonderful,humorous performances make Constantine to become a marvelous character who impressed audience the most.However,I don't like how he treated his friends.It leads to an anti-logy with his nature.Well,he wants to escape the world,he thinks nobody understands him,but why didn't he treat his friends better?Why did his friends help him but not leave him?I don't think I could do that if I was Constantine's friend.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is suitable for this character--Angela Dodson.However,Her character show disadvantage of this movie:It just focuses on one character--Constantine.There are few good scenes for her to perform,too sad.So,some people said that COnstantine is really failed.IF the director saw this problem,it might be better.<br/><br/>How about the theology using in Constantine?I think it is the most attraction for me to see Constantine.Hell with fire,Heaven with clouds and world with lamps.Demons and angels are colorful.A few scenes sacred me a lot.The sounds bumped out suddenly and made you horrible.All in all,it is OK but still need to be improved.<br/><br/>The story itself is not bad,but I think it is too short.Some parts I still cannot understand after it finished.I have heard that the movie comes from a comic book Hellblazer and written by Kevin Brodbin.So it might be cut before.The climax is too long and seems no more interest.The other parts could not set off the climax.<br/><br/>However,I love it because of the humor in Constantine.<br/><br/>P.S: Sorry for my poor English and hope all you wouldn't mind~"
"mmrempen","8","5","20","22 February 2005"," I loved it for what it was
","Now, I've never read the Hellblazer comics from which this movie is apparently based. I've heard the fan base was screaming in outrage, but I decided to ignore that and try to take the film for what it was worth as a piece of celluloid. And I really, really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Personally, I've been fascinated with mythology of all types from around the world, which is why I hated ""Troy"" for taking out the gods, and why I loved the Matrix trilogy. This advertised itself as a demons-vs-angels take on Christian mythology, and I was intrigued. Glad to say, I was rewarded in that respect.<br/><br/>I admit Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor. No, I take that back a bit. He's very good at playing himself: stoner/hacker/clueless type, which is why he worked so well in the first Matrix, and not so well in the sequels. Here, however, Reeves is asked to play a chain-smoking, hard-drinking bad-ass role, which he is not suited for. Luckily for us, the character of John Constantine is so strong that for the first time, I saw a character that actually carried the actor. I wasn't bothered by Reeves' delivery of his lines, I enjoyed the lines themselves.<br/><br/>Aside from Reeves, it was great. The mythology element was well implemented, and the other actors play their parts to perfection (my favorite being Peter Stormare's Lucifer). The story is intriguing and though the path of the story may be very linear and formulaic, the spin of the lore in this film far outweighed any predictability. In addition, the CG is cleverly and refreshingly done, and I loved such sequences as the liquor store and the bleak, apocalyptic depiction of Hell.<br/><br/>All in all, it was great for what it was. I give it an 8/10, and the only reason it's not a 9/10 is because of a few of holes and scattered sloppiness with the storytelling and editing and such. Go see it! It's fun."

","I saw a sneak preview last night. And I was pleasantly surprised, in that the film was not awful as I was afraid it would be. Bear in mind, I am a huge fan of the comic books, so I was feeling pretty uncharitable towards this one as soon as I hear that John Constantine would be American and played by Keanu Reeves. But surprisingly, he does an...okay job. He's not the unrepentant bastard that the comic book character is. But I wouldn't have expected that take from Hollywood. He does an interesting interpretation of the comic book character, a watered-down version to be sure: but still entertaining. He had a couple of good lines here and there, and used some cool little 'magical' spells to do his thing in the movie. Tho the cross-shaped magic shotgun was sort of dumb. So take it from a semi-hardcore Hellblazer comic geek: this wasn't all that bad. I freely admit that my opinion is tainted by the fact that I saw it free of charge."

There aren't many light moments and don't expect a romantic kiss between the two leads at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Also, the overabundance of Catholocism might irritate Protestant viewers. But without it then the film could not move forward with its plot. Here is where the inevitable comparisons to The Exorcist and The Omen will occur. At least it wasn't as mind numbing as Van Helsing.<br/><br/>That being said the film offers up some genuine horror that had a few people screaming and whimpering (well teenage girls). About 10 people left the theater before the film finished. This usually happened during the more intense scenes. Were hey affected by the horror or by the religious overtones? Who knows. For me, the film was edgy and entertaining."

However that is not to say he did a bad job, he managed to impart a nice dosage of bitter black humor into the role and should be commended for that.<br/><br/>Weisz is forgettable, sorry kiddo, everyone else is kinda meh though Tilda as the androgynous angel Gabriel (remember kids, Angel's have no gender according to a few texts) was pretty good.

","So predictable. I wonder how many of the folks who are dissing this film have even seen it. When the name Keanu Reeves appears on screen, the knees jerk. It happened with the ""Matrix,"" ""Feeling Minnesota,"" ""The Devil's Advocate,"" etc. Yet, all of those films are highly regarded in retrospect. I know nothing about the comic book character, but, for my money, Constantine is a throwback to the films of Jean-Pierre Melville--think ""The Samurai""--with Keanu a worthy successor to Alain Delon. Other characters in the film are fun too, and I especially like Tilda Swinton, who thrives on sexually ambiguous roles such as that of the angel Gabriel. Nobody is going to claim that ""Constantine"" is a masterpiece, but it remains a fine entertainment, with some interesting ideas on the nature of heaven and hell and on the perils of suicide. At forty-one, Keanu doesn't need to prove himself as an actor to anyone. He's been pleasing crowds for two decades now. For those who don't get it, don't despair: the new Vin Diesel flick just opened this weekend. Go forth and multiplex."

He is going to get a lot of shots taken at him for this movie, but i thought he did a great job as Constantine, and was also the perfect person for the role. As the movie was based off of a comic i don't see what else people could expect. Critics seem upset for some reason, but Keanu played a great ""super hero"" (for lack of a better term for main characters in comics), and the screenplay couldn't have gotten any better...

ANy attempts on gloomy mature contents often prove unnecessary and even dangerous. <br/><br/>(some spoilers) The R-rated Constantine seems to stray too far toward the wrong direction: a protagonist who's a depressed chronic smoker, expert in violence as well as cynicism; a hypocrite angel who grows no heart under an immaculate form; and a charming Lucifer who happens to hand out most of the justice in the film... <br/><br/>Yet thanks to a tightly constructed plot and an underlying positive message (which is unquestionably catholic), the movie beats with life and force, and does much more to encourage than to distress. In the end the deliverance of Constantine proves all the more convincing by the contrast of all the doubts and waywardness he has ever had.

If that sounds like something that would interest you you should definitely go see this film. There has been a lot of negative criticism of this film which I do not understand.

On the contrary it somewhat demeans it by bringing the devil figure in the same league. Even though the move when for a happy ending it still left you with a unsatisfactory feeling. Over all it had a lot of things going for it not to mention the special effects, good acting too. It was a great antismoking campaign though, I'm a smoker and after watching the movie I wanted to stop smoking."

","The movie wasn't terrible, I can give it that. I did want to sit through it and see the ending, so it wasn't awful. The movie put to many Christian beliefs in all at once. The comic book didn't do that which in my opinion made it better. The movie wasn't a ""Passion"" type movie, meaning that it didn't try and make people Christian, but you sure had to think Christianity was the true faith of god to think anything of it. I think that if god were to see this movie he would be offended, especially buy the killing device (a gun) that was in the shape of a cross. If you're looking for a movie that is about angles and demons and the war between heaven and hell I would suggest Dogma, at least that movie was funny."

","I went into watching this movie half expecting it to suck. One, because there was sooo much room for error; Two, because Keanu Reeves has a not-so-good reputation after all that Matrix stuff; and Three, because most of the critic reviews were not too good. But after watching the movie I was pleasantly surprised, I have to say.<br/><br/>There's a little bit of a slow start, but the movie picks up quickly and you start getting drawn in. Constantine is a refreshingly apathetic character, playing the antihero rather than the all-around good guy hero. He's amusingly smart ass, especially during a certain confrontation at the end. Each of the characters are serious enough about what they do, but have a comedic side to them, like most people do, giving them a more realistic quality in this clearly fantastical story.<br/><br/>The special effects were not over-the-top with cheesy glory, keeping the viewer more into the movie, rather than shocking them out of it with blatantly fake CGI effects. Props to the animation team! The movie is also peppered with great little easter egg type hidden things, such as changing messages. Certain parts of the story fit together like puzzle pieces, giving you a nice, well-rounded finish feeling by the end of the movie. Plus! Stick around after the credits finish, because there's another scene at the end, revisiting something that you might otherwise think was just dropped off.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie has a great balance of seriousness, action, comedy and story. Despite having a male lead and a female lead, the action drama doesn't fall into the classic, cliché romance that most other action movies turn into. I think it's definitely worth seeing, and I'd give it a B+. At least a B."

It is my opinion that the people that did not enjoy this film were below its intelligence level. The film was represented nicely by everybody acting in it, the acting guidelines did not rest solely on the performances of one or two actors as stated by some but on the entire cast. I being someone who read all of the negative comments and still saw the film I would like to share with those who haven't seen it and let you know it is worth the money.

","After seeing 3 commercials for it during the superbowl and various versions of the trailer in the theatre I just thought this was a lame action packed capitalization on Keanu's action star status.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>After familiarizing myself with the comic a bit before seeing the film, my hopes for the overall tone of the film were set. I knew what it should have been and what it shouldn't have been.<br/><br/>Constantine I would describe as a Biblical Apocalyptic Demonic Noir Film. There's very little ""action"" in the film, and when there is action it's very necessary and not at all gratuitous. Keanu surprisingly has the right look for the part and does a good job of avoiding those Ted Theodore Logan mannerisms we all recognize. His performance is stoic, disturbed, straight and well executed.<br/><br/>My only miff about the film is that the pacing towards the end is so slow and dragged out that the whole climactic feeling and rush that we should have in such scenes is sucked out of us. Peter Stormare is brilliant as Satan, Gavin Rossdale is surprising good as the demon Baltazar and that one chick from The Mummy although speaking with a strangely low voice does a worthy job.<br/><br/>Lawrence's direction was well done, with some influence we can see from our man Terry Gilliam. But every shot is interesting and that's what I look for in a good director.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this film, just be wary that it was influenced by a DC Comic and is ALL FANTASY! I believe Neil Gaiman even contributed to one of the comics in the past, so many of us may be interested in this subject. I only hope that a film like this can open some doors for Good Omens to be made."

","Constantine is the movie version of comic book/graphic novel Hellblazer. I hadn't even heard of Hellblazer until I heard about Constantine. Therefore, I cannot say if Constantine is a good or bad adaptation. What I can say, however, is that it's an okay film in its own right. It's neither good or bad.<br/><br/>What I liked about Constantine was the look of the movie when it comes to cinematography and production design. I also liked that, for a movie I imagined to be action packed, the action scenes weren't that many. There _are_ quite a few action scenes of course, but the movie doesn't seem to be all about the next big action set piece.<br/><br/>Now, what I didn't like was the special effects. They're not bad, but a demon made out of bugs made me think of The Mummy and that is never good. When it comes to demons in movies I believe that less is more. At least if you want the audience to feel suspense. I also had a problem with the slow pace. The movie was about two hours long, but it felt more like 2½ hours.<br/><br/>When you know you're going to watch a Keanu Reeves film you know not to expect great acting. At least not from Mr Reeves himself. However, I must say that Constantine is the type of movie where at least I didn't notice that Keanu Reeves isn't very good. I think the role of Constantine suited him rather well.<br/><br/>So, Constantine is a rather good film. Unfortunately it is also slow-paced, boring at times and too long. (4/10)"

","'Constantine' used to be a heavily underrated action fantasy film, but it gained some more recognition later, and it has obtained somewhat of a cult following. The film was financial success upon its release, but it got compared too much with other otherworldy Keanu Reeves's action flick - 'The Matrix'. To be honest, 'Constantine' is not even comparable with a far superior 'The Matrix'. Still 'Constantine' has very slick production values, stylish action and of course, intriguing premise. Add supercool Keanu Reeves at his stoic best, and a wonderful supporting cast (come on - Peter Stormare as Satan!), and you have your high octane entertaining (and don't forget thought-provoking) supernatural thriller.

The motives of the characters is never clear, and one wonders who are the good guys or the bad guys.. why did ""Satan"" cure the lung cancer, then want to take the cured hero to hell?

"amountainclimber","9","2","6","4 February 2006"," Fun - Religion as Science Fiction
","This is a really fun movie and I am amazed by the commentary I have read about it. I wonder if the writers have actually seen the movie or are really just interested in bashing Keanu Reeves. First of all, he is not a detective or a gumshoe, again, what movie were they watching? The movie is really a classic sci-fi story. You have 3 parallel universes occupying the same space, earth (where we are), heaven (where angels are and where good people go when they die), and hell (where demons are and where bad people go). There is a contest to see who can tip earth to their side, but they are only allowed influence by suggestion, not by direct action. Keanu is basically a referee. There are ""half breeds,"" who can live on earth, but again, they are not allowed to interfere directly. If they do, the ref, Constantine, deports them in flashy cinematic fashion. Of course, this is a movie, so someone does interfere, and that is the conflict that drives the story. Keanu's performance is fine. He is an unhappy, alienated person with a really crappy job that no sane person would want, and which he has for reasons that you will discover by watching the movie. Of course, there is a girl, Rachel Weitsz, a cop, who gets drawn into the conflict and discovers the truth of the world. Their weird relationship, very underplayed, is quirky and interesting. Peter Stormare's turn as Lucifer is an absolute bizarre hoot. It occurs near the end and is integral to a great twist at the end. Again, the complaints about the end of the movie are lame and I doubt they watched the movie or conversely, had the brains to understand what was going on. Comparisons to the comic book are also nonsense. This is a movie. Movies are an art form with certain constraints. You can adapt material from other sources but you always get something different. The point here is that in this case, you have an entertaining movie, unless you happen to hate Keanu, in which case, your opinion is not really informative."

","I absolutely adore this film, and not just because Keanu Reeves is stared in it. I disagree with previous comments about poor acting and too many FX, i think the story is a stereotypical Angels vs Demons which requires many effects to create an impact on its audience, and since the audiences most likely going to be people who are interested in sci-fi, fantasy, thriller elements a typical code of each of these are special FX, which i happen to enjoy. One criticism i will make is the angel Gabrielle's sex... I'm so sure he was a guy!?! although 'She' is one of the best characters in the film...damn whats her name... Tilda Swinton! thats the one, she also plays 'Sal' in 'The Beach' shes fantastic..<br/><br/>i love it ! :)<br/><br/>ASHL:EY P.S, the beginning is a lot like 'exorsist'.. don't you agree??"

He makes yet another performance that shows that he is probably one of the dullest actors around.<br/><br/>Though not everything sucks in this movie.

Its good!!, but its not a documentary or a factual programme. Its an action flick drawing on certain themes. John Constantine isn't wooden, he's bitter at the world, i don't think keanu reeves was auditioning for the new batman as some have put it, i thought it was a good performance by everyone, i really enjoyed this film, and i like the way that it manifested all the monsters and demons that people are scared of as opposed to 'leaving it to peoples imagination' which some people claim is scarier. but if you want to use your imagination, read a book, don't watch a film. personally, i go and see a film because i want to see someone else's take on the story, i already know my own!!!"

"BremenDruid","8","2","6","6 October 2005"," One of the best comic movies around (besides Sin City)
","I decided to post this when I found a disturbingly large amount of poor ratings for this movie from IMDb users because the movie wasn't exactly like the Hellblazer comics that it's based on. I've just got one thing to say to that, get over it. This movie, based on it's own merits, is actually a very well crafted and though out movie (I've read a lot of complaints about Keanu Reaves' acting performance, but really I think he captures the tortured soul who knows he's heading to hell pretty well. The reason why so many people complained about this is because he doesn't act like the same John Constantine of the Hellblazer comics, again get over it.) There are some things about this movie that are a little weird, but one thing you do have to keep in mind is that this was not intended to be a horror film. It's an action film. Get it through your head and you'll enjoy this movie, the whole point of the movie was not to freak you out or give you nightmares. It's a fun movie, with plenty of good action sequences and a story that gripped me from the beginning.<br/><br/>As soon as you're introduced to the character of John Constantine you already know that he's a bad mother who's intent is to foil the plans of the underworld so he can win his way into heaven. Along his way to get there he gets sucked into what could end up as the end of the world. There are many sequences in the movie that leave you wondering ""what could this possibly have to do with the storyline?"" but in the end it all ties together so perfectly that it's almost like a jigsaw puzzle coming to completion. (Some things about the movie you do have to think about to truly understand everything.) Not only that, but the dialog between characters is often humorous, but can be very serious when the movie needs it to be. For example the conversation that Constantine has with Gabriel at the beginning of the movie. At first you can't help but feel pity for Constantine, but then the conversation ends abruptly with a one-liner from Gabriel that would at least leave you chuckling.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie (within it's own merits, and when not compared exactly to the Hellblazer comics) that no one should be deprived of missing. A great action flick that makes you think in order to truly understand everything that the movie presents."

","Yet another movie based on a comic book that I have never read. (I was a Beano girl but I doubt the movie would be very good if they made one). John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a chain-smoking exorcist, who has died and come back to life. He is trying to rid the world of demons in an effort to buy his way into heaven, where he is not allowed to go because he committed suicide. The world must be a very scary place if you believe in demons. Thank goodness for Catholicism's warped view of the world, without it we would be without so many movies - The Exorcist 1-3, Stigmata, End of Days. Anyway, Constantine gets involved with a woman who is convinced that her twin was brain-washed into jumping off a roof. He takes a few trips to hell and discovers that sure enough she is there in hell, where she shouldn't have gone because she was a good Catholic who would never kill herself (despite being in a mental institute). I don't remember much else apart from Gavin Rossdale from Bush looking rather camp as a half-breed demon. It was a bit boring you see and I fell asleep. What I did see was alright, the demons were scary looking enough and the effects were pretty good. Hell would be an annoying place if it was as windy as they made it in the movie. I don't like the wind."

They end up uncovering the dark plans of hell's minions to take over the planet, unleashing a violent apocalypse. Despite his careless attitude, Constantine is forced to help in earth's darkest hour.<br/><br/>This kind of role for Keanu just does not work for me. Sure, we're used to seeing him strut around in black trench coats with that dazed and confused look on his face, but in a time where planet earth is set to be destroyed, I sure hope we could find a better savior than Keanu. The acting award for this film definitely goes to Weisz, despite looking nothing like a cop (especially from New York City).<br/><br/>The producers obviously use the great special effects to cover up the sub-par acting and pitiful story. There is nothing worse to me as a movie lover than to see a comic book film fail to seem anything like a comic strip, which Marvel has been so successful in doing the past few years (With exception of Fantastic Four and The Hulk).

","Hmm. Nearly a good movie but it falls short due to some heavy handed moralising on 2 fronts. It would appear that the Roman Catholic church has a monopoly on things Divine and Hellish. Having usurped Latin as the fashionable way to portray superiority in such matters Constantine fights the good fight against the demons of darkness with his all too fanatical Catholic sidekick (Rachel Weisz) who just so happens to be a powerful psychic. He also smokes too much and seems to be near death. Without giving anything away, it seems that this film wants to be anti-smoking whilst at the same time gives credence to the singularity of the church of Rome.<br/><br/>The message from this film, for me, is simple. Avoid being Roman Catholic and you will avoid Hell/demons/burning/perdition/damnation you name it.

Maybe my complete and utter lack of expectations skewed my opinion a bit, but I actually found that the movie wasn't that bad. Keanu Reeves was able to use his signature ""understatedness"" (or lack of talent, whatever) to his best advantage. He's best in roles where he can act completely spaced out, confused, or determined. This one lets him do all of the above at various intervals. Rachel Weisz was also good as a set of twins. She was simultaneously tragic and determined as both of them. The sets were all well created and the story wasn't anywhere near as bad as the previews make it look. It's about on par with Hellboy, maybe a little bit better and definitely more brooding. This is a Dark Horse comic movie. They tend to be darker and more brooding than the chronically angsty Marvel and less heroic than either Marvel or DC, but if you like that sort of thing you'll enjoy this.

"Antagonisten","3","2","6","3 April 2005"," Not very entertaining at all
","This movie is what i would term ""promising but flawed"". The premise i found to be quite decent, but the film-makers were unable to capitalize on it. And the end result is a rather dull movie that fails to deliver.<br/><br/>How Keanu Reeves gets to continue his mission of destroying every single project he touches is beyond me. The man lacks any discernible talent and yet he keeps on appearing in high-profile projects like this one. I won't go as far as to say that Reeves ruined this movie (far more people contributed to that), but he was one of the disturbing factors. The more deep-seated problems here are the lack of a decent script and the lack of feeling for the subject. What could have been a good setup for an action movie turns into a movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants. Which is sad really. The very good special effects and very nice photography show that a considerable amount of money and work has after all gone into this movie.<br/><br/>There is just too little action for an all-out action movie, too little actual story for it to be story-driven. In the end ""Constantine"" falls between the two genres becoming a rather slow action-movie and a very thin supernatural thriller. So, what's the problem with Reeves? Well besides his wooden acting he doesn't feel right for the part. The jaded, chain-smoking ""who gives a crap"" hero is far too rugged for Reeves. He's just too well-combed, too neat, for a role like this. With an actor more up to the part it could have been at least a little better. Rachel Weisz does what she can with the female lead, but she obviously struggles with her rather uninteresting character.<br/><br/>The main problem still remains the script though. It has serious problems with the pacing. The movie is very slow at times. It never becomes really interesting either, the story just never feels original or interesting enough to carry the movie. I think this was one of those times where the film-makers should have realized you can't have it all. Either they should have made this a no-holds-barred ""Blade""-like action movie, or they should have worked on the script and ideas and try to make it a solid supernatural thriller.

","Constantine is my new candidate for the worst film of 2005 until someone comes along and takes its place. Hopefully no one will come along any time soon. This film suffers from pitiful character development for one. We don't even really care for the hero. His job seems to be something in the line of battling demons and satiring The Exorcist(1974). Though I was happy to see him in a film, Pruit Taylor Vince's character didn't serve any purpose. I was laughing at his death scene and I was happy when it was over. The other problem with the film is that there are plot holes everywhere. I guess the movie was aimed at fans of the comics and no one else because there are a lot of things that aren't quite explained.<br/><br/>My synopsis. 4/10 This film is a complete and total mess with some cgi thrown in.<br/><br/>The only reason it got a 4 from me was because of the direction and the cinematography, both of which were pretty impressive.

","Be careful about believing the first review. It contains an opinion that you might not agree with if you see the movie yourself. First off, if you liked Blade, VanHelsing or Hellboy, you're probably going to like this movie. It has the same kind of super-natural overtones and humor. Demons, angels and everything in-between. It's probably a bit pretentious with it's religious themes, but it's all in good fun. Keanu's performance is a bit dry, but it's the character that demands this. The other characters get developed enough to care about them too. They aren't just throw away extras or dead paperweights. Some of the characters from the Bible end up being pretty darned entertaining too. Definitely a rental, but a good matinée show too."

","I like Keanu Reeves. Loved him in the Matrix and Devil's Advocate.
In this movie, he trails off the ends of sentences so I can't hear what he's saying.<br/><br/>When he's not trailing off, he's whispering so that his voice is much lower volume than any of the other actors. So I used subtitles and lip-reading to follow the story.<br/><br/>An actor's most important instrument is his voice. Keanu's voice is brittle and a monotone murmur. Not because he chooses that voice at the right moment for dramatic effect, but because he's constrained by his voice.<br/><br/>The story was great. All the other actors besides Keanu did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Also, spoiler alert, I'm not certain what happened to the sister. Did she come back from the dead, or did she get sucked out of hell and go to heaven, or did she remain in hell (since the deal was Keanu's life for her's, and turns out Keanu didn't lose his life)."

","The first time I even knew about the character of John Constantine was on the CW show Arrow. He was different and I found him interesting that I began to do more research on his comics and found this film. I had no idea Keanu played this role and it was a pleasant surprise. He was a darker and grittier character than on CW and I loved it all more for that. The lore was interesting and had a different take on all of it with the story of Gabriel and The Devil - which by the way I loved the way the actor portrayed the Devil, making him almost likeable. Whenever I hear about comic book films, I never hear this one mentioned which is strange because it is quite good. This is a top five Keanu Reeves film for me!"

If you are not a comic book fan, it's not gonna make much sense, even if you are familiar with the Christian mythos. Actors are doing a good job most of the time. Keanu is decent, and Stormare does an excellent job! Consider it more as a more serious Dr. Who, which deals with Christian mythos instead of sci-fi. There isn't a lot of action, and when there is, it's nothing to write home about. As I mentioned, first half of the movie is boring, but it picks up after that. It's nothing glorious and majestic, but it can be fun, if you have the patience and you will probably like it more if you read the comic book. Give it a try :)"

","Okay, I haven't seen the comics/graphic novels this is based on. I've seen the TV show with Matt Ryan and I've heard that it comes much close to presenting the true original Constantine than Keanu Reeves does.<br/><br/>That being said, when I got around to finally seeing this I was pleasantly surprised. Reeves does a competent job, but I think the movie is very much buoyed by Rachel Weisz playing the unwillingly psychic detective and her unfortunate sister and by other characters in the ensemble, notably Tilda Swinton playing a very ""complex"" and other- worldly Gabriel and Peter Stormare doing a bang-up job as Lucifer himself.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of special effects and in my opinion they are all pretty good, and the action is varied enough and persistent enough that you neither get bored waiting for it nor get bored in the midst of it.<br/><br/>In the course of suspending your disbelief you have to accept that God is pretty much a stickler for rules (about suicides, e.g.) and yet is enough into dualism that he is willing to give the devil's side a sporting chance at winning the game if he plays his hand right. But this is far from the only movie with such conventions. I don't claim that this movie has tons of subtle character development or deep theological truths, but I found it enjoyable. More enjoyable than a lot I've seen."

","For some reason I when I finally went and watched this movie I thought of Amytiville Horror although I was nothing like that. I believe the rather tepid box office returns were due to the fact that Keanu Reeves was coming of the success of the blockbuster MATRIX series and that's what people were expecting. This is definitely a paranormal film but nothing along the lines of The Matrix. It is dark but that is the only comparison aside from Keanu Reeves appearance. The movie shifts between two worlds.This is also like Matrix but only Reeves has this gift of being able to travel between to two. The real world and what I came to understand as the spirit or underworld inhabited by some rather nasty beings and spirits, some of which could follow you into the real world. Reeves expertise is removing evil sprite from possessed people here in the real world. Great special effects and story-line. After watching it once I will watch it again."

","This film definitely could've been better, i'm not saying it was awful, but I'm just saying that it could have been better that what it turned out to be. I liked Keanu Reeves, I thought he really brought it with his performance, he was tough, and sympathetic, but yet had a hard exterior, he portrayed Constantine well here. Rachel Weisz was pretty good in her co- starring role, she was dramatic and had depth in her performance. I also quite enjoyed Tilda Swinton as Gabriel the angel, I think Swinton brought a lot of depth and a lot of interesting layers to her role. The special effects were all around all right, I've of course seen much better, and a few times they looked slightly hokey, but most of the time they were alright. Shia Lebough is alright too, it's of course one of his younger and first feature film roles, he sufficed in the screen time given to him. As far action goes, there is definitive action sequences that are full of shooting, like punching, and throwing people across rooms, so the action will for sure satisfy. The middle part of the film does in fact drag a bit, so I definitely had to complain about that, the middle was a little bit of a chore to sit through, which is why the rating is not higher than a 6/10 on my movie rating scale."
"dwankan","7","1","2","17 April 2016"," Fun for what it is
","This movie does a pretty good job of combining action and effects. I enjoyed it. I can't compare it to the comic because, although I've read several of the Hellblazer comics, the series felt aimless, and I stopped pretty soon after starting them. What this film does well is to tell a bizarre story of a battle between demons and humans (with some angels to even things out) with some, albeit predictable, excitement. Unfortunately, it isn't consistent. Some moments in the film went so far beyond credibility that even the actors couldn't pretend to believe it anymore. A further problem, but a common one for the comic-book-turned-into-film genre (so we can't blame this movie for it) is some of the corniest lines ever. At one point, a demon talks about how much he wants one of the characters to die, and he uses the phrase ""finger-lickin' good."" Yes, the writers actually put that one in. The acting is sometimes good and sometimes not so good. Keanu Reeves does a mediocre job as usual and Shia Lebeouf plays the same annoying character he played in I, Robot. Rachel Weisz by far outshined all the others in the production, even though she stumbled over some of the more unrealistic exchanges. All in all, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it as a decent time killer at most."

","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a supernatural detective who has developed these supernatural abilities as a result of a near-death experience. Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz)approaches Constantine for help after her twin sister Isabelle is found dead following an apparent suicide. Dodson doesn't believe that her sister did kill herself as she would have been sent to Hell as suicide is something that was against her religion (being a Catholic). Dodson senses that something other worldly made her kill herself and asks Constantine to help her to discover the truth.<br/><br/>I haven't read any of the comics upon which this film is based upon so my comments will be confined to the film alone. The first problem I had with this film was with the tone. Most films that are based on comic books have a sense of fun about them and that's something that's really lacking here. This is even more baffling when you look at the silly and far-fetched premise. The fact that such a silly story was delivered with a straight-face for the most part felt rather strange to me. The straight-storytelling becomes more of a problem when you actually look at the mind-boggling narrative which pulls you in all kinds of directions and fills your head with all kinds of religious mumbo-jumbo all of which amounted to very little. Again if the film would have been more fun it might have worked better in a daft 'tongue-in-cheek' manner, but the baffling narrative takes away more than it adds rendering the film an insufferable bore for almost its entire running time. For the record I also felt that the final act went on for way too long and ended up being more ridiculous than profound.<br/><br/>Another problem here lies with the acting; Keanu Reeves isn't the greatest of actors and simply lacks any kind of charisma and is dull throughout. Shia La Boeuf also puts in a rather forgettable performance and adds very little to the film - his character also seemed to get side-lined for about half of the film for reasons that are beyond me. When he was in the film I got the impression he was intended as comic relief, but he isn't given any amusing material to work with. For me, it was only Peter Stormare that added some lift to the film in a performance that was fun, silly and over the top. I think Stormare knew what film he was in and basically gave a silly performance that matched the silly material.<br/><br/>Aside from a fun turn from Stormare the only other thing that's worth mentioning are the visuals and special effects which were good. However, it's evident when watching this film that most of the budget and time went on making the film look stylish and not much thought went on anything else. Sadly, Constantine is merely a triumph of style over substance."

","Constantine (2005): Dir: Francis Lawrence / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare, Djimon Hounsou : John Constantine is centred between Heaven and Hell and hopes to earn his way to salvation by casting out demons. Perhaps he should have cast a more suitable actor to portray himself. A police detective enlists his help in solving the apparent suicide of her sister. Interesting concept is detailed in structure but concludes with Constantine as some sort of holy figure. Spiritually this is wrong in the Christian faith for which the only way to salvation is through the blood of Christ but the film presents this as gloom. Director Francis Lawrence is aided by stunning visual effects but the chain-smoking Keanu Reeves seems more interested in looking cool than in acting. Rachel Weisz fairs well as the police detective bent on solving her sister's murder. Tilda Swinton delivers a fantastic performance as angel Gabriel whom Constantine faces and eventually will see to fair ground. Peter Stormare is menacing as Satan in a larger than life homage to other crazed roles he has had. Djimon Hounsou plays another hell fighter who opened a nightclub. The spiritual elements may poise an issue with certain viewers. In the end it may be blasphemous to some and foolish to others but it is undoubtedly a curious escapade in technical visionary.

It's entertaining enough, despite feeling like a mash-up of familiar exorcist and superhero action movie tropes. Some of the CGI isn't up to snuff and there aren't really any memorable scenes. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz are fine, though this is more up his alley than hers. She's better than this type of movie. Shia LaBeouf is amusing in a part that's not really needed.

","This is one of my favorite action horror films, after getting use to seeing Keanu Reeves as Neo in The Matrix I never expected to see him pull off another character that I would love. The thing i seem to like about this movie is how Keanu Reeves manages to keep his demeanour on the sad, weird don't care attitude all throughout the movie, the world coming to an end didn't even seem to move him, his selfish ambition to make heaven by all cause pushed him off the edge of sane behaviour to a point where you start to wonder if this guy is real.<br/><br/>The film is based on a comic book character and the screenplay was done by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Capello, taking stories from the Hellblazer comic book, and the main plot elements were taken from the ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc and the ""Original Sins"" trade paperback. <br/><br/>John Constantine is a character created by popular comic book writer/creator Alan Moore; the character was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer in 1988 and it was published by DC Comics under its Vertigo Comics imprint.<br/><br/>John Constantine is a man with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. After an attempted suicide gone wrong John's soul is eternal damned to go to hell. Constantine then goes on an exorcism rampage sending demons back to Hell so as to win enough favour to get to heaven.<br/><br/>His quest led him to meet a troubled police detective, whose sister just committed suicide; while they work together to unravel the truth behind it, the stumble upon a plot for world destruction.<br/><br/>Similarities and differences can be found in the portrayal of the character, from his appearance to the reason of his damnation. John Constantine is British in the comic book, other than the American as he is portrayed in the film. His reason for damnation was also changed in the film, his ability to see half breeds for who they really are (which is not an ability he posses in the comic book) was the reason he tried to kill himself leading to his damnation. In the comic book the reason for his damnation was his involvement in the summoning of a demon that killed a young girl.<br/><br/>Received with mixed reviews, Constantine is not one that many will like, but there is something about the after taste this movie gives you, the idea that an ongoing action packed battle is going on here on earth for the winning of souls, was fun to think of.<br/><br/>The movie does have some inconsistency that looks too large that the makers actually missed it, they made God look a little weak, like things were going on and he just let it, also the devil being taken unawares by a coup, all this made it look like God and the Devil don't have a hold on their minions.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","Constantine is a movie about the exploits of a surly chain smoking exorcist who goes by the name of John Constantine. Towards the start of the film he receives some bad news regarding his future prospects, and this bad news coupled with the revelation that once he dies he is unavoidably hell bound go some way to explaining perhaps why indeed he is so irrefutably surly. And who could blame him? Now I know that Keanu Reeves has got his fair share of critics, his range of emotional depth isn't wondrous to behold and he's never really going to bring you to tears, however I think all this makes him perfect for the role. His character never really betrays any depth or emotion, because he's not supposed to. He's supposed to be cool, and like it or not, Keanu Reeves can be cool.<br/><br/>His knowledge of the occult is explained to the viewer through his association with the inexperienced characters of the film, namely Shia Labeouf and more frequently Rachel Weisz. Weisz gives a decent performance, she provides the female lead of the movie but never really manages to grab your attention or steal any of the scenes she is in. The usually very watchable Shia on the other hand is almost completely superfluous and his irksome performance is as easily forgettable as his turn in I, Robot was (yes he was in I, robot). Now I've never read the Hellblazer comics/graphic novels that the movie is based on and so I don't know whether ""Kramer, Chaz Kramer"" is a noteworthy enough character as the Robin to Constantines Batman to demand his inclusion into the movie, no matter how weak his portrayal. I imagine he must be. Either way, he's not really worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Other notable characters include Tilda Swantons genderly challenged Gabriel who is the liaison between Constantine and God (of all people), Djimon Honsous clearly biased Voodoo shaman Papa Midnight and a horrendously cringey Balthazaar, all of whom share various levels of animosity with Constantine. The most enjoyably performance though comes from Lucifer himself, portrayed by an excellent Peter Stormore in a very memorable scene. I can't discuss that too much though as his appearance takes place in the latter stages of the film, dangerously close to spoiler territory.<br/><br/>The lack of any conventional love interest between the leading male and leading lady is refreshing and the bleak post apocalyptic depiction of hell with the semi-headless demons scuttling along through the wreckage of dilapidated cars and decrepit buildings is genuinely creepy. In fact the film is visually very pleasing, maintaining it's dark and stylish mood throughout.<br/><br/>This film is not going to confuse you or make you think too hard, it's not going to move you or change the way you look at the world. It's just something to sit back, watch and enjoy. It's plot is fairly linear, but it works. There's little in the way of character development or chemistry, but that works too. I'm aware that it's not going to be for everyone, and given its (in my opinion) strangely low current score I'm sure there will be other reviews the polar opposite of mine who claim Keanu was a poor casting choice and that the lovable scamp Shia is the only saving grace of an otherwise empty and soulless film, and I understand why some people won't have liked it. I know there are other people who didn't like this movie because they found it to be nothing at all like their beloved Hellblazer comics (and from what I've read, they're probably right), but there's always going to be people who dismiss something that doesn't hold true to the original rather than judging it on its own merit. At the end of the day though, I think your opinion of this film boils down to one thing, whether you think it's cool or not. And I liked it. I thought it was cool."

","Keanu Reeves clashes with Satan...again.<br/><br/>Adapted from the comic-book Hellblazer (but renamed to avoid confusion with Hellboy and Hellraiser), John Constantine first appeared in an issue of Swamp Thing and soon got his own series. The character is from Liverpool but the movie version transplants him to LA (it's a more photogenic environment, let's be honest). He's supposed to be a psychic, occult detective but it's never explicitly mentioned what he is in the movie, which is the first instance of confusion the viewer will encounter.<br/><br/>Constantine ends up involved in a plot with LAPD detective Angela Dodson and her dead twin sister (both played by the lovely Rachel Weisz) which leads to confrontations with various angels and demons. So much happens in this film, but hardly any of it is explained. Don't get me wrong, I hate endless exposition, but Francis Lawrence tries to deliver virtually ALL of it with visual storytelling and it just doesn't work. There are so many random, unintelligible and moments that will alienate many viewers render the bulk of the film completely incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence fills the movie with lots of symmetrical photography and beautifully eloquent shots that act as a muted counterpoint to the fake CGI, and the sound design is thankfully down-played. In the hands of a less-talented director (Brett Ratner, Len Wiseman) this film would have been loud and unsightly with lots of stutter-cuts and 'impossible camera' shots. I'm glad that Lawrence does not use this approach for his feature films.<br/><br/>It all looks very pretty, but it'll last in your memory about 5 seconds after the credits roll (there's a scene after the credits too)."

","For a movie produced in 2005, some crucially amazing editing choices were made which allowed for spectacular special effects. I was particularly blown away by the provocative depiction of hell and his anticipated offspring, Mammon. However, this film took too many creative liberties when illustrating Roman Catholic theonomy, it's almost as if God and Satan were card playing buddies and Jesus was nowhere to be found. Some of the religious context is so poorly represented that I had to chuckle a bit. We see multiple references to 'reverse baptisms', and demons pushing against the wombs of women. Jesus can be seen every two seconds on some form of cross, but his name wasn't mentioned favorably once. The stories plot ultimately says that God and Satan are running some sort of puppet show, negating Christian theology of Christ's death and resurrection. Additionally, Reeves objective was at sometimes unclear, especially when he attempts to portray and angst ridden hell-bound medium... he appears slightly goofy. After I saw the movie, I had to wonder, ""What was the moral of the story? Did I just spend an hour and a half watching a series of incohesive events that lead to a conclusion that I already knew (suicide is bad)?"" In end, I just chalked it up to a mediocre action film."

"DP_IL","6","1","2","18 November 2010"," Why not give the character a different name?
","I've been a fan of the HELLBLAZER comics for years. When I first heard of a film adaptation, I was really excited. This excitement was quickly diminished once I discovered that the character was not only going to be Americanized but that he was going to be played by, of all the possible actors, Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Had they gotten a competent and talented actor to portray an Americanized version of Constantine, this would have been a much easier pill to swallow. John Cusack, Johnny Depp, Edward Norton and Leonardo DiCaprio all immediately come to mind as good choices who could portray Constantine accurately (albeit without a British accent).<br/><br/>When the trailer for CONSTANTINE was first released, I thought there was a chance it could be good. And then I saw it in the theaters and was completely annoyed. Here are a number of things that I found to be glaring problems with this movie when held in comparison to the source material:<br/><br/>-John is not a magician in this film, he's a simple exorcist who has an ability to see half-demons. This is fundamental to the character and it's been completely ignored in this adaptation.<br/><br/>-In the comics, John is Hell-bound because of some bad decisions he made in his youth while experimenting with magic, decisions which resulted in the death of a little girl and of some of his friends. John was not an irredeemable character, but it made sense. In this film, that incredible aspect of his character is ignored and the reason John is going to Hell? Because he committed suicide as a way to stop plagues of visions. Wow, what a horrible guy. Can anyone blame him for being such a jerk?<br/><br/>-In the ""Dangerous Habits"" story, John contracts cancer, just like in the film. In the film, he's cured because Lucifer removes the cancer to give him a chance to fall because he's redeemed himself and is rising up to Heaven. This also ruins a key aspect of the character, which is on perfect display in the comic. In the comic, John sells his soul to three separate, high-ranking demons. Then he commits suicide and when all three come at once to claim him, John gives them a choice -- they can either tear apart Hell in a brutal war to claim his soul or they can cure him until they can work this out for themselves. It's a wonderful scene which showcases John's conman nature -- and a scene which is capped off beautifully when after being cured, John lights up a fresh cigarette and flips the bird to the demons. This is ruined in the film when at the end, John reaches for a pack of gum.<br/><br/>-And what I feel is the greatest injustice is this film embraces the extremely antiquated notion of suicide = eternity of torture in Hell. This horrible belief has caused innumerable families and friends who have lost people to suicide unimaginable emotional pain, because the Catholic church wants them to believe that their loved ones are suffering in Hell. The comic book never took sides in any sort of religious debate -- it borrowed elements from a number of different sources and crafted its own unique mythology. The filmmakers chose to be lazy and go with an easy way out.<br/><br/>All that being said, there are good things in this movie. And over time, I've given it some additional chances. And I've found that over time, the Catholic stuff aside, my biggest problem with this film is that it changed so much from the source material. With all these changes that were made, the film only needed to make one further change -- call the main character something other than John Constantine. Had they done that, I doubt anyone could claim in a court of law that this film bore anything more than a passing resemblance to HELLBLAZER. And had they made that one, little change, my review of this film would probably be an 8 as opposed to a 4.<br/><br/>**EDIT**<br/><br/>Since I wrote this review, I've seen Constantine a few more times. While the problems of the film are still very much there (particularly the suicide aspect, which in my mind is absolutely unforgivable), my views on the movie have softened. Given how little resemblance the film bears to the source material, I'd advise any fans of the comic to view this movie as a completely different animal, and think of these two characters sharing the same name as being a bizarre coincidence."

","The movie particularly impressed me in how it depicted its subject visually. People say the special effects are great, but that's the implementation. It's the vision behind the effects that makes the movie look good. It's also clear that there's a background to this movie, that it builds on something, and this adds to its impact. I haven't read the comics, but I assume this background comes from there.<br/><br/>The downside for me was the character Angela. I think it's partly Rachel Weisz not fitting the role of a police detective with some killings behind her, and partly because the premise of the character just didn't work. Keanu Reeves' usual wooden acting fitted his role rather well, on the other hand.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was never boring, wasn't too annoying, and had some visually impressive moments. I'd give it 7.5, but will round it to 8."

","Chain-smoking ""Hellblazer"" John Constantine goes from DC Comics' ""Vertigo"" (aimed at ""adult"" readers) to the movies for actor Keanu Reeves. They called it/him ""Constantine"" and hoped Mr. Reeves would help the film survive the ill-advised title change. The resulting story is nicely directed, imaginatively edited, and stylishly photographed - by Francis Lawrence, Wayne Wahrman, and Philippe Rousselot - but, the dynamic trio aren't able deliver the original, much more intriguing Liverpudlian. The plot starts out fine, but becomes somewhat overloaded and confusing during the running time.<br/><br/>The film was based (very loosely!) on Garth Ennis' first ""Hellblazer"" story - entitled ""Dangerous Habits"" and running through issues #41-46 (May-October, 1991) of the comic. It should be available as a separate ""graphic novel"" in your local disappearing comic shop - or online, if the store is already gone. The story dealt with Constantine's deadly lung cancer diagnosis. With some changes, best pal Chas Chandler/Kramer (Shia LaBeouf) is included, but you have to wait until after the credits for his full story. Rachel Weisz is almost a female co-star, playing twins (Constantine's twin is not mentioned).<br/><br/>****** Constantine (2/8/05) Francis Lawrence ~ Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton"
"joshi_3592","6","1","2","29 November 2009"," Keanu Reeves as a sort of super exorcist, still it's a fun to watch movie.
","My first though when I started to see this movie was; this is some kind of exorcist film. Not quite wrong, but I would call it a super exorcist. A dilemma similar to the whole movie from 1974 called ""the exorcist"" was here solved in about 10 minutes and then Keanu Reeves goes of to kill demons, monsters, visit hell and fight angels. Obviously this movie has a lot of Catholic, religious and occult stories mixed together. But it is a fun fantasy movie with an obvious horror film feel to it.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, has by many critics been called his worst performance, I fail to see why. It's not his best, but I felt he created a very cool and enigmatic character. Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson was just plain good. Shia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer was a good character, which sadly was forgotten in about half the movie and never got the chance to evolve. They should have involved him more into the film or just ditched the whole character. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Satan is just great.<br/><br/>The effects like most movies today, are great. What can I say, it's a lot of high budget CGI that creates some really cool demons and monsters.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6/10. Half original idea, good acting, but moved a little slow. Still fun to watch if you like religious based horror films."

Also, i looked on the back of the DVD. Not that i like digimon. Because i certainly don't. Also, i actually played the game Constantine on Ps2 before i saw the movie, so unfortunately i already knew some of the plot.

Anyway, about the movie: I though it had a good and interesting storyline, plus it had demons in it, and i'm obsessed with demons. Some of the scenes were done well although i must say they were dragged down a bit by the weight of Keanu Reeves' incoherent mumbling. I must say that yes, some of it was hard to follow ( the storyline i mean, not with your eyes). Also, the first scene, almost every word and every camera shot, angle, whatever you want to call it, was the same as in the game, except for the bit where the guy turns into a gray old man, which i found to be quite humorous. Does anyone agree? Or have i just got a sick sense of humour? All in all, an interesting yet strange movie with a very creative storyline. 7/10."

","Constantine is a good supernatural/ horror film directed by Frances Lawrence (I am Legend.) The elements of good horror mixed with an action extravaganza both keep the audience entertained and thrilled. At the same time, the story also is fast and on par between any horror film since The Sixth Sense. Constantine not only is good in these areas but also in the special effects and cinematography departments which make the film feel dark and disturbing. Speaking of dark and disturbing being two of the main moods of the story, the other moods also give context and originality to its layers.<br/><br/>The only thing i can uphold about is, in some scenes its a bit far-fetched but, not that you haven't realised."
"fightrunner","8","1","2","20 August 2008"," Constantine
","In 2005 Francis Lawerence, who most recently made I am Legend, directed an adaptation of the Hellblazer comic series simply titled Constantine. At the time there was an outcry from the fans because their comic hero's features were originally based on Sting, but Keanu Reeves was cast in the part. From then on they were already fighting a losing battle with the fans. So how does it compare otherwise?<br/><br/>The film's story is based around a conspiracy to invoke an ancient prophecy and release the Anti-Christ and the end of days. There are many key players in the conspiracy and not all are who they seem, subverting our ideals on Good vs Evil.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays detective Angela Dodson, who after having a premonition of her sisters death, sets about trying to prove it wasn't suicide. Through her investigation she meets Constantine, who unveils the real world behind what we see. It soon becomes apparent that Angela has a far greater part to play in the prophecy.<br/><br/>Constantine and Angela must travel to the very depths of hell to stop the prophecy and fight demons of many forms and the occasional angel too.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does well to fill the Constantine character with the same level of sarcasm and wit of the comics. The film portrays him as someone who on the outside doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's killing demons to buy his way into heaven. But he is also fiercely loyal to his friends who have a nasty habit of dying. Also lifted straight from the comics.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are excellent too: Shia Lebouef in an early role as John's trusted yet unused sidekick. Max Baker as the Q type character who provides John with his arsenal of weapons including the Holy Knuckle Duster. Tilda Swinton impresses with her turn as the ambiguous Angel Gabriel, who may be playing both sides. But, even although he's only in it for fifteen minutes, It's Peter Stormare as Lucifer that blows the audience away. He really encapsulates the embodiment of evil perfectly, slithering and sliding around every shot hissing in Constantines ear. Dressed immaculately in white with black tattoos up and down his arms and neck. They couldn't have done it better.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film aren't widely remembered, but watching it again this morning I noticed that they have a lot in common with Nightwatch and Daywatch with exploding glass hanging in the air and people being pulled through walls backwards. It's well worth watching again.<br/><br/>For Movie Reviews, news and opinion like no other. Plus the kick ass Bi-weekly pod-cast go to www.fightrunner.co.uk"

","I have never really gotten into the world of Constantine despite the fact, that it has stories in it written by some of my favourite comic book writers. The character hasn't never really interested me enough, though it does hover around matters which I personally find appealing. That's why I really didn't have any expectations of this film.<br/><br/>It has parts in it I liked and parts I didn't like. The character of Constantine is, as far I know, pretty faithful to the original with the exception of that originally he's a Brit, who looks like Sting. And he's not so much of an action man. The world comics are set in and the world that the movie has seem pretty similar to me. But as I said I am not an expert on this matter, so I am sure, that the people who actually have read more than a couple of Hellblazer comics will beg to differ.<br/><br/>So let's tackle it shall we? John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a modern day wizard, who battles against the daemons of hell to make amends in order to gain back his place in heaven. He finds out that certain parties are trying to get son of Satan on earth. He gets help from a police Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who's dead twin sister seems to have something to do with the case. I am sure you'll fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>The plot is clichéd as heck. Nothing in the movie comes as a surprise and the ""surprise plot twist"" are so old, that even a blind could see them coming from far. That actually wouldn't be a problem, as I actually liked the visual appearance of the film, but the direction was very lacking: it seemed to lack enough tensity to keep me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>As I said, I liked the visual appearance of the film. There are some pretty nice SFX in there, but sadly the cons do win over the pros here. Constantine is not biggest piece of garbage in the comic book movie genre, far from it, but spectacular or memorable film it isn't. Which is a kind of a shame really."

","John Constantine is a chain-smoking exorcist with only a few months left to live. Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.<br/><br/>I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film, especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code."" Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.<br/><br/>Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, ""Constantine"" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between. In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the ""Matrix"" movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death. We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path. The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion). The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But ""Constantine"" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration."

The story is nice, an exorcist on earth who is going to die pretty soon and tries to buy his place into heaven. He doesn't want to go to hell, and that is logical, 'cause he sends a lot of demons there. Constantine has a lot of black humor which I like a lot. It's also very ironical that after all the demons he has defeated, he's going to die of cancer. A nice touch at the end of the movie is, when you think he will lit another cigarette, that it is just some chewing gum. You can see that he will not make the same mistake twice. The special effects in this movie are good and there are some scary moments, which make the film interesting. I find it advisable for everyone to go and see this movie. You won't regret it."

That only works for the kids - not for those of us who enjoy the story as much as the effects. The only bright spot in the movie was the guy who played Satan. That was nicely done.

Usually when you hear a music video director is doing his first feature you can't help feel fear as to how music video like the movie will turn out. For a movie about Heaven and Hell and fighting demons he shows tasteful restraint and always stays true to his darker characters and the somber atmosphere. I even liked Ted, Uh, I mean Keanu. His persona was perfect for this character and the whoa dude factor is non-existent in his delivery. I also liked that they don't explain every damn thing about how he does what he does. The dialog is also restrained and there's no overly played one-liners or catch phrases. Also the ""annoying"" sidekick disappears for most of the movie and when he reappears he's actually enjoyable as they allow him to be 3-dimensional. His outcome is also refreshing as most Hollywood movies wouldn't actually go where his character ends up. Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot and fans of Keanu will love it but for me who is the opposite I found it well done with every aspect of the look, the score and the characters.

"PassioNoftheMovieBuff","8","2","7","15 July 2005"," The Salvation of 'Constantine'.(my response to hard hearted comments)
","When I went to see this movie, I was captivated from start to finish. And when I left the theater, I found myself thinking about the movie and replaying many of the scenes and lines over and over again in my head for about the next 4 to 5 days. (wich is something that a movie hasn't done to me in quite a while) But I guess it all comes down to a few key factors that will decide if someone will like this movie or not.<br/><br/>Key factor#1: Bias expectations of die-hard 'HellBlazer' comic book fans. <br/><br/>It is true that there is a great deal of difference between the portrayals of the comic book and the movie. So as a result, any Hellblazer fan can be very disappointed after seeing this movie. However, these fans need to realize that the differences between the movie and the comic are intentional due to the fact that the writers of the 'HellBlazer' comic books where there the whole time the script and screen play were being written. In fact, they even contributed to it. I'm also sure that they weren't kicking and screaming in disappointment when Keanu Reaves was cast for the leading role. When I went to see the movie, I had never read a single 'HellBlazer' comic in my life, let alone being aware of them even existing, and as a result of this I was able to truly appreciate the move in its entirety. 'HellBlazer' fans probably don't have this advantage because after reading enough issues of the comics, the standard has already been set for the characters and story lines. Now of course the movie did peek my interest enough to pick up a few issues of 'HellBlazer' and actually read them. And even though there was a difference between the comic and the movie, I can't honestly say that the comic is better than the movie or vice-versa. I think thats what the writers and director was aiming for when making this film. They knew that the 'HellBlazer' comics don't have much awareness among comic readers as well as not very many fans. They wanted this movie to actually give the viewers enough interest to actually want to go and read at least one issue of 'HellBlazder'. So lets be real with ourselves here...(and this means all you 'HelBlazer' fans out there) if they wanted to keep the movie as close to the comic as they could, then they would have cast Hugh Jackman (wolverine in 'X-Men') for the role of 'John Constantine', dyed his hair dirty blonde, and given it the title ""HellBlazer"". But that's not what they did at all. I'm sure the title ""Constantine"" was chosen for more reasons other than ""it sounds cool"". Obviously the change in titles is to imply change in story line and characters. Plus not to mention the odd advertisement that states: ""Loosely based on the 'HellBlazer' comic series"". (Gee....I wonder what the key word in that statement was?)<br/><br/>Key factor#2: Are you or Aren't you a spiritual person?<br/><br/>I myself have read most of the Bible and believe entirely in it. My mother has an extreme catholic background and I also have a fascination and appreciation for Cathollasism. (although I am against religion as a politic and more for a charismatic belief in God and Christ) Now because of all the reading and studying and research that I've done for myself on the Bible, religion, doctrines, and spiritual things, I am able to say that the script and story line is very accurate and well written. As an example, I read a comment where the writer said that the angel Gabriel in the movie was lame and ""looked like some sort of cross dresser"". Well that is because there is religious doctrine that states that angels of God are not of any gender. They are neither male nor female. Hence, the angel Gabriel in the movie is hard to tell from male of female. (allthough the role is played by a female) So with that being said, anyone who has or is willing to acquire some knowledge of various religious doctrines, (particularly catholic belief's and the Bible in general) will most likely get a lot out of this movie.<br/><br/>Now to sum it all up on more of a movie-ish note.....I think that this was the best performance of Keanu's career, and not to mention Gavin Rosedales performance was flawless. Weizes performance lacked a little, but not enough to ruin the film. And the special effects were amazing. But most importantly, if you haven't seen this movie and are planning on it, pay attention to the performance give by the actor playing the part of Satan. This by far was the best and greatest performance of the movie. I don't know where they found this actor, but he does the part perfect. I would definitely like to see what other roles he is capable of doing.<br/><br/>But anyway....I've said enough already. Thanks for reading and if your planning on seeing this movie, enjoy ;)<br/><br/>Also...if you found this at all helpful and your curious about other movies that you're unsure of paying to see, send me an email. I'd love to hear from you and there's a good chance I've seen it.<br/><br/>Later ;)"

OAU..that's a new one!!! overall great movie, extremely interesting, it really makes you put yourself a lot of questions and finally something original, nothing ordinary in it and extremely interesting."

","I wanted to like Constantine so much. Given its subject matter (which I'm interested in) and given that although I don't think Keanu Reeves is Laurence Olivier when it comes to acting I still find a way to like his performances, I did overall like this movie. But having said that it is just one more film that is in many ways an extended pop video of ideas - a 3 minute fix or head-rush rather than a thought out, subtle and nuanced piece of work. The basic story, of course, is ridiculous. It seems that most makers of popular films today, when dealing with theological issues, reduce them to magic or fable. Thus the ""Spear of Destiny"" (the one which pierced the side of Jesus in the Gospels) is reduced to an icon of magical power which makes the holder superhuman (the opening 2 minutes is excellent for impact in this respect, however). Quite why this spear has such power is a moot point at best. Further, it is taken for granted that angels and demons walk among us and that ""witch doctors"" wield real power. Of course, people will say this is all the stuff of story and we are supposed to suspend our disbelief. Indeed, we are. But we still need to believe something in our disbelief and this film, I repeat more extended pop video of ideas, is lacking a little in coherence. This film does not make you want to believe its own story which is always going to be a problem (and the Gabriel twist is the worst thing of all in this respect). I was waiting for the meat, the little something extra that makes a good film a stand out one. It never arrived. And then there is the Keanu factor. You look at Reeves and you see Neo. And Constantine is a lesser film than the Matrix Trilogy. Future casting directors should, I think, beware of casting Reeves if their movie is in a similar vein to The Matrix films. Inevitably, they will seem lesser films by comparison. Now there's a challenge!"

We all know Keanu Reeves isn't exactly praised for his acting abilities, unless he's starring in such films pertaining to the Matrix, so it's no surprised that I ended up disliking his performance in this one. More often than not I found myself laughing inside when he would deliver such a line that reminded me of his days as Ted Logan from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures. Despite his lack luster performance, and the occasional bad CGI trip, this film does hold some good.

","I've read some posts about Constantine, saying that the plot is weak, insulting to the religious and so on. Since I've seen many trashing reviews, I am going to say something good about the movie to maintain ""the balance"".<br/><br/>The movie takes us into a world of demons and angels and shows a man who can interact with them working as an exorcist. The evolving plot is pure fun. It is full of twists, surprises and manages to be unpredictable until the very end. To someone familiar with the comic books or similar literature this might be different. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie has been often said to be poor, but... come on, this is a demon fighting movie. If you want to see acting, go to a drama theater. As for Keanu Reeves, I think he wasn't the best pick for this role. He seems to be a more fragile type of guy than Constantine and the rude attitude didn't really sell. The performance of Rachel Weisz has been glorified, but as I said, why do you have to look for acting in this kind of movie?<br/><br/>The special effects aren't stunning, but they also don't seem to lack anything and complement the plot fairly. I specially enjoyed the ""theme park of fire"". <br/><br/>Watch this movie if you want shallow entertainment, but don't expect anything meaningful. Just because it has angels and demons, doesn't mean it addresses religious issues - it doesn't.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you've seen this movie, be sure to watch South Park's episode Best Friends Forever (904).

"clivy","4","2","7","10 April 2005"," Letter to the producers of Constantine
","Dear Producers of Constantine: I thought you would like to know that my husband and I went to see your movie last night at our local flea pit. The audience (including us) totaled four. For our local flea pit on a Saturday night, that's a great turnout (we were the only people in the audience for a Saturday night showing of Lost in Translation.) Anyway, I have to say that my husband fell asleep after the first half hour. And he's a CGI fan.<br/><br/>Constantine isn't all bad. The CGI is very, very good (The Hell scene looked cheap on a ""Constantine: The Movie"" TV special we caught, but it was impressive on the semi big screen of the fleapit). The art direction is fabulous. The guy who played Satan was a knockout. His scene with him sparring on a chair while Keanu tries to light up came the closest to the comic. The costuming was like the script: everything was in black and white.<br/><br/>If you're going to base a movie on a very cool ironic comic with a big fan base, why didn't you first of all stick to the comic? John Constantine Hellblazer the comic character kicks wacko demons' butts. Why did you give the green light to a script that featured a uber Catholic morality tale? (I heard Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis, both writers for Hellblazer the comic, took their names off the film. What happened to their treatment?) I knew the film was going to be a stinker when I heard Keanu was a playing an American John Constantine and the setting was Los Angeles. The location people did a great job in finding creepy buildings and streets to shoot, but Los Angeles? For Constantine? Having an American actor play a British character, given a good script, may not be such a disaster, but why put the character in a setting that doesn't evoke the comic at all? And why did you put an amoral sorcerer who smokes like a chimney in a plot complete with anti smoking propaganda? The most unbelievable part of the film was Constantine looking over the skyline at the end and popping gum in his mouth. The coda of him putting his lighter on the tombstone of his sidekick was even worse.<br/><br/>I can't blame Keanu for turning in a blank performance because the writers gave him nothing to work with. Rachel Weise's performance was amazing given that she didn't have much to do in her part either except get wet and look scared a lot. The supporting characters were twitchy like the comic would have them but also too twitchy- maybe they just seem OTT compared to Keanu's vapidness. The best performance by far was the cat's. He had the best written part.<br/><br/>I can see your wanting to promote Vertigo titles  Warner Brothers owns DC comics  but next time you make an adaptation, get a writer who has worked on the comics. Or at least knows the comics. And please don't try to add messages based on public service commercials."
"gryveken","9","2","7","9 April 2005"," Constantine is the Max Payne of heaven and hell!
","Constantine is the Max Payne of heaven and hell... yeah, thats right. Keanu plays the role of a man that is haunted and blessed by god in this movie where the classic struggle between good and evil are blown out of proportions.<br/><br/>Even though I am not a fan of movies that originally is a comic I have to say that this one is really well done. I haven't read the comic though. Maby the movie would be horrible if I had. But, since I haven't read it I can safely say that I really liked the movie.<br/><br/>I have to warn everyone that hate religion though. This movie is heavily based on Satan and God as they are known through the bible. And if you are all against that I believe that you will find this movie a bit boring. Other than that there should not be any worries. It offers all that a classic action movie should give you. A high paced plot line with cool effects and a genuine hero. Don't expect any miracles though, its just a movie..."
"stoned_and_dethroned","2","2","7","4 April 2005"," Keanu Reeves is such a great actor
","'Constantine', a film based on some comic books I've never read because I lost my virginity long ago, stars one of our finest thespians, Keanu Reeves, as an exorcist. For the duration of the film, Keanu gets into all kinds of crazy adventures with weird demons and other evildoers. There are plenty of scenes involving hideous creatures trying to force their way out from underneath peoples' skin, scenes that look like nu-metal videos, and other crap like that. Anyway, Keanu performs some exorcisms, holds some chick underwater in a bathtub so she can magically go back and see some other chick's suicide firsthand, the singer from Bush shows up for some reason (I'm surprised I recognized him...it's been what, 10 years or so since MTV and corporate rock radio were torturing me with that crappy band?) and a bunch of other stuff happens. I don't really remember what happens or why, because I was barely paying attention, and I got up and took a stroll around the big, fancy concession area for about 10 minutes or so when I noticed my friend had fallen asleep. I was also preoccupied with the popcorn I was eating, which was absolutely delicious. I've had a lot of different kinds of popcorn, but none can compare to what's offered at my local Loews' multiplex. Anyway, right after I got back, a group of about 7 kids seated behind me decided they just weren't man enough to endure the remainder of 'Constantine', and they walked out. I wanted to wake my friend up and ask if he wanted to follow suit, but I didn't want to be rude. I hate when people wake me up out of my sleep. Anyway, in the end, Keanu prevails (I'm pretty sure). He might get the girl, but I don't really remember. Sadly, his sidekick/comic foil Shia LaBoeuf, does not survive. 2/10, just because I've seen worse."

","or for those unwilling to let a couple of things slip. Or those who require everything tiny thing explained, and cant just let not having it so go.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much when i entered the theatre to see Constantine, although having read the hell blazer comics i was looking forward to seeing how they portrayed the deep dark character of John Constantine - which i think they did particularly well - on screen.<br/><br/>As the plot develops we are introduced slowly to the character of Angela, played wondrously by Rachel weisz, and john Constantine, played surprisingly well by Keanu reeves. The camera pans back to reveal great performances by the likes of Shia Labeouf, who at first appears to play the arch-typical annoying sidekick character, but turns out to be a great addition to the cast, and the half-breeds, namely Balthazar and the delectable Gabriel. These surprisingly... interesting and 'deep' (And in Balthazar's case camp! :) ) - if you are willing to suspend the theology lesson for an hour or two- characters deliver fantastic performances and drive the plot on its merry way in a brilliant fashion.<br/><br/>The humour throughout is dark and honest; currently one of John's most repeated lines is 'A mental patient killing herself? Now that's just crazy'. Nothing is pulled when it comes to depicting the darker moodier side of the characters natures.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the audience are expected to think a bit more for themselves on occasions. The screenplay writers have been innovative in their work - not sticking with the traditional 'garlic kills this, sunlight kills that' - yet they have seen fit not to use the traditional five minute explanation as to why it would work. For those who are wondering why a mirror would work (Tee hee, go see it, you'll understand ;) ) why does it matter? what is there to stop anything new from working in this world? Alongside infuriating pedants i would not recommend this movie to hardcore fan boys expecting exactly what the comics deliver, its a work very much inspired by Hellblazer. Which is exactly why it was called 'Constantine' instead of just 'Hellblazer'. It has taken the Character and Ideas.<br/><br/>As with any movie, some will love it, some will hate it, some will laugh. The comic adaptations have been booming lately and i would place this one amongst the few, such as hell boy, who are doing their origins justice. Not only does it do that, I think it does so without having to mimic the subject matter. The writers, actors, CGI weird monster things have put damn near their all in this.<br/><br/>And id like to take this chance to thank the costume designers for putting Gabriel in that outfit... (Dribble)"
"dbborroughs","8","2","7","6 March 2005"," Good Occult Thriller
","For the record I have read Hellblazer, the source of this film, and I do like the comic.<br/><br/>Also for the record I do like this movie a great deal as well.<br/><br/>Is it the comic? Thats open to debate. I think in many ways it it is. I think the problem is that they've made a film about a very complex character who's been developed over hundreds of issues and distilled him down to what a mass audience could take in.(remember this is a character that runs in DC's alternative, non ""mainstream"" Vertigo comic line) No, he's not English, its not set in London, and its not always night and raining, but other than that I think they have the feel. Keanu for my money is pretty good. I think the problem for most people who read the comic is he's not a snarky Brit and therefore its not Constantine. I think he's fine and his performance takes other bits of his personality and brings them to the forefront. Its no different than the way different writers have handled the character over the years.<br/><br/>As a movie its a very good. Its not high art and its not Silence of the Lambs scary, but its a really good thriller with neat visuals and a creepy attitude. Any movie that can keep me up and awake until almost two in the morning when going in I could barely keep my eyes open, has to be a very good film.<br/><br/>I must single several of the supporting cast, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Satan. Both give great performances, though Storemare's devil who desperately wants Constantine's soul is flesh crawling evil at its finest. Talk about evil incarnate.<br/><br/>The plot has to do with the ""re-discovery"" of the Spear of Destiny, the attempt of the son of Satan to take over the world, and the investigation of the supposed suicide of an LA detectives twin sister. Its not giving anything away to say they are all related nor that there intertwining forms a pretty dark path.<br/><br/>This is a really good movie thats worth seeing if you're into ghoulies and ghosties and things that bump in the night."

So I really had no knowledge about the original plot. now, I liked script and dare to say those who don't like it PROBABLY are those who are under impression of comic.<br/><br/>It's a strange thing: American movie-goers never complain about when movie has different plot then a book or is quite different from historical facts, but if you make a movie on Comic and it is not what they expect they start whining. Why? Gladiator or Cleopatra or Troy are totally different then what was really happening or what should happen, but no complaints were made.<br/><br/>Here is a big discussion if Keeanu is Constantine or not.

","I enjoyed this movie immensely. I did not find myself looking at my watch or fidgeting in my seat waiting for the film to either move on or end.<br/><br/>I have not read the comic book, so I can not comment how well it did or did not keep to the original story line. The movie uses the fairly traditional good versus evil plot, with the hero having to be one whether he likes it or not. It has been done before, but I found this movie to be somewhat refreshing in comparison to everything else out there.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is colorful and likable. In general, they are used effectively to keep the movie going through their interactions with Reeve's character Constantine. I do think they should have used Shia LaBeouf's character Chas Chandler a little more, but for some reason he seems to vanish at certain points in the movie. Maybe these scenes were left on the cutting room floor to keep the movie condensed and at a reasonable length without killing it.<br/><br/>I did feel some Matrix-like influences on this movie, in the tone, scene site selections, and some of the special effects. But have faith, this movie is not Constantine meets the Matrix. But if you liked the Matrix, regardless of whether you hated Revolutions and Reloaded, I think you will enjoy this movie. It doesn't have the overbearing symbolism or the deafening soundtrack.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Comic Books, the Matrix, or other items along that genre you will hate or love this film. For the casual fan, I think if you want to watch a movie that you will be entertained by I think this is a good choice versus a lot of the other garbage being released today.<br/><br/>But, as always, in the end. Its up to each and every viewer to decide."

I'd definitely say that this is my favourite performance of his so far.<br/><br/>Weisz herself seemed to jump from the screen into our hearts, giving an excellent performance throughout the whole film and playing her part perfectly.<br/><br/>I personally loved this movie, but I haven't read the comics, and am therefor not enraged at the differences, and I also love action-fantasy movies much like this.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anyone who wouldn't be personally offended by Comic-book differences and wants to see Reeves and Weisz at their best."

The plot made me want to know more, and the acting was good. The writing wasn't excellent, per se, but didn't have me leaving the movie thinking, ""Why do people pay millions of dollars to writers when I could write a better script?"" like many other comic book movies have had me screaming. Still, having not read the comic books, I should also say that I cannot comment on the movie's ability to maintain consistency with the author's work.<br/><br/>Overall, you can take as much away from this movie as you want. If you're looking for entertainment, this movie has it in spades. If you're looking for an interesting story, with implications on the greater picture, you can definitely take that away from this movie, too.

This leads to some dull moments. I can assure you that there aren't many. The main plot was excellent with some pretty good humor mixed in ver nicely. Dexpite what a lot of people have said I fell that Keanu Reeves did any excellent job in portraying Constantine. His supporting cast was superb as well. The special effects were a very delightful surprise. I was very concerned going into the movie that they were going to be rather hokey. Definitely NOT.

"ClydeBickle","Null","4","21","20 February 2005"," My God, it's not bad.
","I walked into Constantine with rock bottom expectations. It's a February release, which usually hints that the studio is not confident in the film. It's a comic book movie, and unlike the good ones of the last few years, it strays from the source material. And of course it stars the old oak bloke himself, Keanus Reeves. <br/><br/>That said, the movie is actually pretty good. Despite it's R rating, one should not expect a serious horror movie in the traditional sense. This is a comic book movie, with overblown cgi and slo-mo battle sequences. I say overblown cgi, but I was actually impressed with the restraint the director showed in this sense. The movie is propelled mostly through dialogue, and it helps that most of the characters are well cast. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton was the perfect choice to play the ambiguous angel, and Peter Stormare as Satan was an inspired decision. However, Keanu Reeves as the chain smoking cancer stricken Exorcist is the key performance, and the best. It is truly a revelation to Reeves fit so snugly into this role, for the first time I could not imagine him saying 'Whoa'. I've heard his performance likened to a modern day Shatner or Heston, and I think that's accurate. I am please to see that Reeves has finally found his calling as an actor, after being wasted over the years on romantic comedies and the Matrix sequels (He was pretty good as a man discovering the truth about the world and his role in saving it in the original Matrix, but I don't think he pulled off the part of the messiah in action in the latter two.) and here he really shines. <br/><br/>The script is above average at best, but the moody sets, pacing, and Reeves' performance keep it from burning in the same fires as 'Elektra'."

","Constantine is really more about the guys behind the camera than what's going on in front of it. There's some awesome cinematography that will appeal to anyone with a taste for darker movies. There's some tasteful use of unusually-angled camera angles that actually add to the film, and some really smooth depictions of hell and demons. Some of the special effects really are mindblowing.<br/><br/>But, you can't help feel that this Keanu is just a slightly more spiritual version of Neo from the Matrix - the role doesn't stretch him much, and he spends a lot of time playing his character a little too deadpan and emotionless for one supposedly so conflicted.<br/><br/>The story itself has an interesting plot to it (probably better than most comic book-based movies) but is detracted from by some truly awful clichéd lines scattered throughout the movie. The end was disappointing too - it really wasn't wrapped up well.<br/><br/>So all in all, yeah, it's a good movie to go watch, but just don't go in expecting a masterpiece."

Its version of hell is without a doubt the most creative and frightening I've seen in a movie. The many visual effects help instead of distract.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie? It was a REAL ""good vs. evil"" story. The good was righteous, and the evil was reprehensible and vile. Peter Stormare is really a fantastically good (which means bad) Satan.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the movie? The inexplicable ""holy shotgun"". It is a gold-painted gaudy monstrosity, which looks about as dangerous as a super soaker.

A normal shotgun with holy shells would have been much better.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want a very good, entertaining movie, with some genuinely chilling moments, great characters, and an interesting plot, go see this one. If you want the comic books, stay home and read them. If you hate Keanu, just hush.

","Just went to see ""Constantine"" this afternoon. My initial impression was that it seemed very much like a ""Blade"" type movie (instead of vampires, you have demons). Similar weapons are used here and seem as if they could be used in either movie. No Kung Fu or martial arts here though. This movie for me also seems like a collage of what Keanu has done in previous movies. Reeves character is very much like Neo from the ""Matrix""; brooding and conflicted messiah-like. There's's a similar storyline with him on a reluctant mission to save the world and ultimately himself. The final confrontation scene has a similar feel to when Keanu's character in the ""Devil's Advocate"" meets Al Pacino/the devil and he reveals his true identity, though the actor playing Lucifer here doesn't compare with Pacino's performance. The movie is entertaining and thought-provoking but the plot is somewhat confusing and hard to follow at times. I Don't suggest going for popcorn or the bathroom during it because you'll probably be lost or confused on what's going on (maybe if I had been familiar with the comics it would have helped in following the story better).

His partner, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), tags along to find out why her twin sister committed suicide in circumstances that have hellish affiliations. Beyond this summary lies a convoluted story about Constantine's attempts to keep a balance between heaven and hell that stops long enough for us to enjoy an over-the-top visit from white-clad Satan, played with obvious delight by Peter Stormare (Minority Report).<br/><br/>The f/x is as impressive as any horror/thriller's out there today, and Reeves' performance is as one note as we have come to expect. His clothes, thanks to Louise Frogley's monochromatic costuming, are slick black, a complement to the noirish world of black and white. (For you purists, the comic book hero is made into a Los Angeles native allegedly because Reeves couldn't be counted on to keep a proper Brit accent for over two hours).<br/><br/>The theme of good versus evil having been overplayed in our cinema, we are left with little but a titillating twist to keep us interested. So the interest for this Catholic boy is the idea that evil must exist in order for good to triumph. Constantine, therefore, tries to figure out how evil survives and why it must. Maybe he decides that without evil there is just a bunch of blue staters waiting for the second coming of a Clinton in 2008."

","Constantine is a fantastic horror film about an exorcist named Jhon Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who teams up with a police officer named Angela(Rachel Wiesz) who thinks her sister was brainwashed to stepping of the roof of a mental hospital. together they fight demons who exist in an alternative version of earth. The movie has great special effects(especially in the hell scenes),great acting by Keanu and Rachel in fact by all of the cast plus sequences of great suspense and action Constantine is a must for any fan of the action thriller genre.

"Canhenha","6","4","22","25 February 2005"," Great Entertainment
","Constantine is another of the current trend of adapting all comic book characters to the screen. The funny thing about adapting comic books is the fact that most of the times the characters come out as dense as a piece of paper (which reminds the terrible ""Batman and Robin"", by Joel Schumacher or ""Daredevil"" by Mark Steven Johnson). Sometimes however you actually have an adventure film, that boasts a great look and also something besides image trickery (""Batman"" by Tim Burton is the best example, for there you have characters with some density, motivations, inner conflicts). ""Constantine"" is a good example of an entertaining film, that doesn't have much pretensions and therefore it's results are quite decent. I personally did not know the comic, and nor do I feel the need to: I went to see the film for it's own merits and I judge it on those premises alone. Francis Lawrence the director has the visual flair of a video-clip director, but without being excessive (Tony Scott and Michael Bay are names that always comes to mind in that department). The look of the film is beautiful, thanks to Philippe Rousselot the french director of photography (he was responsible for ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""Henry and June""), and the acting is actually not as bad as one might have anticipated. Keanu Reeves manages to infuse some credibility to his part, more so than he has done in so many previous incarnations of his (the most terrible that comes to mind is ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" by Francis Coppola). His performance isn't great, but it isn't terrible. The always wonderful Tilda Swinton doesn't have much screen time, but her beauty and talent are on full display when she does appear. Rachel Weisz has an underwritten role as the lady in distress - as a detective I was expecting another kind of character, but her performance is just plain (far from her riskier side in ""The Shape of Things"" by Neil LaBute). This film ends up being a good entertainment for two hours. It's well written and it's visually engrossing. These days, that's more than you can say about a lot of films on the theaters. Go see it!"
"phoughton77","Null","4","22","22 February 2005"," Worthwhile trip to the cinema given the competition this time of year
","First of all, disregard any comments on this film that compare it the comic book Hellblazer. Honestly, I would be surprised if one typical movie goer out of every cinema this movie fills up has read the comic book, and much less is a die hard fan of it. Forget that the ""original"" story takes place in London and all that crap. Those not familiar with the comic book are just fine with the fact that this story takes place in L.A. - and in the states. Secondly, I must use a disclaimer that I am a fan of Reeves. I think these roles are what he was born to do. Now, what worked in this film are the acting, direction, and visual effects. Those points alone are what places this movie head and shoulders above the typical PG-13 ""horror movie"" sewage that has been leaking into the theaters this month. Where this movie lacks is the script. We are thrust into the life of John Constantine with very little preparation or introduction. He is a fascinating character and it would've been cool to see how he grew into the person he is when this film begins. The story is also a little convoluted and has subplots that are not developed enough. The ""cool stuff"" in the movie is done very well, but there isn't enough ""cool stuff"" and there is a lot of downtime. Props to the crew for presenting a unique and ""wow""-inducing depiction of Hell. A better plot would've worked better, and you still could've had all the ""cool stuff."" Nevertheless, if you've seen all the Oscar contenders by now, then this is worthy of a checkout - much more than the silly teen horror flicks that dominate the theaters this time of year. Sequel? I'm up for it. But how about a prequel? It would work just as well."

","Okay, so Keanu isn't blonde or British. Big deal. They got most of the details of the character right (although the desire to get into Heaven is kind of off base).<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the comic, I'm definitely in the demographic of those who should be completely p'o'd but I'm not. For what it was, the movie was enjoyable and I'd see a sequel if one was made. Sure its not the comic, but if that's what you're looking for...then go read the comic.<br/><br/>As a movie its pretty good and definitely damn fine entertainment for February. I bought Keanu as world-weary most of the time. Thankfully the CGI was minimal (for this type of movie) and the director knew how to use it. Little touches like John's friends dying because they helped him, his comment about ""another ghost following me"", his basic self-centeredness, all good.<br/><br/>If you're a fan, think of it like this. John's in LA and needs some cash so he sells his life story to Hollywood. The comic is John's ""real life"" and the movie is the ""based on true events"" version."

","I have never read the comic/graphic novel, but I do know Constantine should have stayed one. This movie had so many things about it, ideas, emotions, and it should have been cool........and yet it sucked a monkey's left nut. It was drawn out, the story was not developed enough, and just seemed like an excuse to make another movie about a comic. Look, anyone who says they liked this movie is either a publicist for the film, a deranged half breed demon from the movie, severely mentally challenged or a combination of all three.

The story, though somewhat familiar, wasn't bad and had some very funny interactions, between Constantine, his sidekick, and some of the demons that he had to face. The special effects were awesome; not too big, not too small. Reeves' acting was on the mark and Weisz was awesome, even hot and sexy in some places. Even Reeves' sidekick had some cool moments.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good movie and, not to tell too much, frighteningly exciting. I recommend this one."

Every single character was superbly acted as far as my taste goes, and the originality of the portrayal and dialogue earnt my admiration.<br/><br/>There are countless critics who slam Keanu Reeves' acting skills, however I could think of no one better to act as the crude, brooding character of John Constantine. Well, maybe I could, by Keanu's half-Neo, half-Agent Smith performance did it for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps in my young age, I am merely too easy to please, but this movie regrew my faith in the modern action/adventure genre.

"pullingteeth-1","1","2","8","12 August 2005"," Constipate
","This is not only the worst movie of 2005, but it may be the worst movie in all of Celluloid Creation. From top to bottom the acting is atrocious. Keanu Reeves plays the title character (enough said. His acting skills - or lack thereof - are world renowned),and Peter Stormare (the Devil) can't decide if he wants to portray the prince of darkness as Hannibal Lecter or the old Don from Prizzi's Honor. All the actors seem so bored with the idiocy of the dialogue that they often leave their lines unfinished, as if they're too embarrassed to utter such banality. And they should be embarrassed. This movie makes absolutely no sense. From the beginning where a couple of Mexicans are playing some third world version of jacks and accidentally (and oh so conveniently) stumble upon a holy artifact missing since world war 2, to an ending that is as predictable as the weather in Hell, this movie is riddled with mistakes, subpar special effects, and a script as horrendous as Gabriel's wardrobe. Be warned. Be afraid. Be on another planet if Hollywood decides to puke out a sequel. I'll join you there."

I went to see Constantine expecting to be disappointed largely because of the mediocre reviews I'd seen for it and was pleasantly surprised. I found the story generally very good, I liked the idea, the clever characterisation and above all the excellent CGI with its accompanying graphics and artwork which helped to give the film atmosphere. I think if you are a fan of this Genre or of Constantine's star you would not be disappointed in it and I look forward to being able to buy a 2 Disc DVD with the extras when it's available (hopefully there will be a feature on the original comic series on the second disc) and if we are really lucky, a sequel."

","I enjoyed this movie, the effects were great and I liked the characters. It could use an Unrated Director's Cut to explain a couple of things a little better, but I still enjoyed this film. I wonder why The Catholic Church was so against this movie? Were they scared of something? Truth, Fakery, the glorification of Evil as well as Good? The so-called war between Heaven and Hell. I guess the new Pope's election took precedence over the release of the film as they seemed to give up rather quickly, or some sort of agreed changes were made to the film that they did not want to be seen. I don't really go for conspiracy theories, so I really think all this is a stretch. But really, it's a great film and really made me think more about Heaven and how to get there, cause Hell didn't look like too much fun to me.

Keanu isn't the best of actors, other than when he plays a bad guy and the less said about Rachel Weiss the better, all she ever does is stand there with her eyes watering. The plot was poor but then it is based on a comic so what do you expect? There were some really good special effects but then that's the case with a lot of films now but I didn't like any of the characters, especially Gabriel who you just wanted to kick from the outset.

"bendaboots","1","2","8","9 April 2005"," Matrix meets Dogma
","Well, once again we see Keanu Reeves as the pseudo-Christian salvation figure saving the world. It's quite amazing how little Reeves changes his way of acting for this one. The gestures and looks are almost identical to the Matrix trilogy. The way he bends down, turns his head or shoots the daemons... It's a first class deja vu. Indeed, the director did obviously play on this effect. Many of the special effects look similar, too. The story itself was supposedly constructed so as to attract American Christian fundamentalists. The plot is so bloodcurdling in some parts that the audience involuntarily started to laugh... In a way, these are the strongest moments of the film, where at least there is some irony. Altogether, this is one you can unscrupulously skip."
"ir0n_jaw","2","2","8","16 March 2005"," Pretty poor - What is up with Hollywood nowadays??
","Okay - In summary, this film is poor. It's yet another comic book adaption that seems to have been twisted around to fit an all to familiar Hollywood pile of crap.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a cardboard box - most of us are aware of that, especially as he never seems to be more than 5 seconds away from spitting out ""dude!"" at the end of a sentence. In this movie it gets worse, he's now decided the best way to act serious is to lower your voice and speak slllloooowwwwllllyyy. It also seems Rachel Weisz has visited the Keanu Reeves School of Acting, as she seems to be taking his lead popularising this new and inventive Reeves-ism (yes I am being sarcastic).<br/><br/>The plot is thin and ill-conceived with virtually no character development and definitely no respect for the original idea (the comic). I couldn't give a damn who lived and who died, in fact I'd have preferred to have seen the CGI devil rise up and kill everyone (then himself cos he'd probably have been poorly executed too). The screenplay is poorly written with some lines that seem to have come from the Arnold Schwarzenegger Academy for Cr4p One-Liners.<br/><br/>It's about time Hollywood took a good look at itself and stopped putting the $$$$ ahead of the art of film-making. Take a good look at Japan, South-Korea and the rest of the world - see what gems their film industries are making with one-hundredth of the budget...<br/><br/>A poorly conceived and executed film by a bunch of idea-rapers who could not write a story for toffee.<br/><br/>Boooo."

","For those with weak hearts, please beware of sudden shock of frighteners along this movie, it really can shock you if you are concentrating watching the movie like any other movie goers do. Seeing Keanu Reeves act in this movie and differentiate his previous role in Matrix is astounding. The Matrix aura thats within him as people know are brilliantly diminished by his role as Constantine. This role suits him nicely and the same can be said to Rachel Weiss. Good directing skills and implementations of HELL and HEAVEN elements into this movie adapted from a comic book. Brilliant ideas came out from this movies as i can see it. It comes in, in a different vibe, a hell and heaven vibes so as to speak. In terms of story wise, its OK but more could be done to really spark the movie more in between those fights. The fights sequence and CG's are superbly brilliantly done. Excellent cinematography. Hope Keanu Reeves will get credits for this one as well but i doubt it could as it wasn't that of a strong movie as was his last. Overall, its a entertaining movie to watch with families and friends, but not with your grandparents with all those shocking scenes powered up with DTS / THX and surround sounds. Hope to see more to come."
"MackFinch","6","2","8","8 March 2005"," Hell is for children.
","While he came close, Clint Eastwood never ventured into the territory of self- parody, instead choosing to reveal himself as a true artist. For the full postmodern take on the Eastwood persona, look no further than Keanu Reeve's work in Constantine. With every dry crack or glare, he may as well be saying, go ahead demon (or half-breed as they are lovingly referred to), make my day. If Leone had made this movie, he would be The Exorcist with No Name.<br/><br/>Which is not to say he is not effective. Reeves is often maligned for a lack of talent, but I truly think of it as tremendous restraint. He isn't Marlon Brando, but he isn't Rod Steiger either (an absolutely charismatic actor who could probably taste test different types of scenery.) When one sees a more magnetic actors play boring, such as Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland, one almost longs for a man like Reeves.<br/><br/>There has been much controversy about switching the story across the pond from the U.K. to L.A. but I can't imagine how it makes much difference. They say the character in the Vertigo comic book was based on a young Sting, but anyone who has seen Dune or even the video for If I Ever (Lose My Faith in You) knows that other avenues had to be explored. I'd be interested to see what Jason Statham could do with the role, but then I'd probably be interested to see what Statham could do with the role of Edna in the upcoming Hairspray movie. I think the role fits Reeves like a glove (sorry I couldn't work in a dogmatic pun there. Like the Shroud of Turin?) and any faults of the movie aren't his. <br/><br/>The movie is compelling but not truly fascinating, like the Ninth Gate or it's mother, The Exorcist. It's not really frightening either. The vision of hell and all it's minions shown here is truly amazing, but no one is going to go home worried that they might run into what they see on screen.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is a beautiful women but I've always found her a bit annoying, and her American accent bothers me, not because it lapses into English but because it lapses into some strange midwestern thing, kind of like the way Christian Bale talks like Jim Carrey. In the bathtub scene I couldn't help but think that her face of horror was because she'd just remembered her previous collaboration with Reeves in ""Chain Reaction"". <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is quite sexy as the angel Gabriel, made-up like David Bowie might have looked in the early '80s if he hadn't decided to become a pop star. Peter Stormare, an actor who I imagine can not really be directed so much as herded, is fantastic as Satan, and I like how his fashion seems to be motivated by his fellow Swedes The Hives. <br/><br/>The fill left me oddly tickled more than anything else. I certainly wasn't bored. First-time director Frances Lawrence doesn't betray his music video roots nearly as much as his peers, and he often seems to know what he's doing. If he doesn't quite know how to direct a performance yet it's because up until now all his actors have been lip-synching. It gave me a bit too much time to think about things, only truly holding my attention visually. I have to admire it in the end though. It's smarter than the average thriller, it doesn't just think it is, and it's one of the few major movies I've seen outside of Mel Gibson to actually believe that heaven exists. <br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"litchick_88","9","4","23","28 February 2005"," Really Good
","I think that the short dialog for Keanu Reeves was best suited for his character. You can't expect Constantine to be philosophizing when he doesn't believe in it in the first place. The smoking aspect is a great addition, as well as all the special effects. I loved Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, he did an amazing job..""finger-lickin' good"" to be exact! I'm definitely buying this one when it comes out. It definitely has action, and being given a new life at the end of the film was great, especially from the Devil...something that isn't really expected. Also..I'd love a sequel because there's tension between Angela and John, and I would love to see something go on between them.<br/><br/>**The phrase ""finger-lickin' good,"" comes from the movie, and Balthazar says it to Constantine."

The writing is amateur the story lack any logic, it isn't even abstract art, its like someone vomited on the story.<br/><br/>I just watched the movie today and the entire movie is scratching there head not understanding anything. The only thing that made sense was when the movie was over. My mother slept in deep coma and had to wake her up three times during the movie. By the time it's over. It is clear this is a block-disaster movie.<br/><br/>On the positive side, this is a very good movie for students of arts, in reminding them not to write a complicated story with no beginning and a story whose flow is discontinuous. The story could have been written much simpler in terms of making the plot more clear to keep the audiences in suspense. Was there any suspense here? No! Since no one understands, there is no suspense. I in fact, wasn't even aware this was a horror. What horror? Didn't scare me. The cat looks cute, the suicide was nice and clean, and the superhuman strenght to destroy the bathtub didn't impress me, there was so little blood not even enough for a blood exam that Keanu Reeves couldn't possibly need the help of God (from sacrifice) to save his life!

"nefastus","8","2","9","9 April 2006"," Nice addition to the genre
","If you are a fan of the Prophecy series, then you will recognizes the plot elements of Constantine. Angels and demons at war for the domination of human souls. Yet, there are enough differences between the two that it actually makes Constantine stand on its own. Also, if you are a fan of the Vertigo comic, you might be put off at it not being true to the source material. Especially after the fact that movies like Sin City and Batman Begins remained faithful to their comic origins and proved that it works, and works well. So that fact that Keanu Reeves does not support a British accent and blond locks might put you off. But don't let it. This movie is a gem on allot of levels.<br/><br/>First off the biggest obstacle one has to get over before they decide to watch this film, Keanu Reeves. It seems that critics like to destroy Reeves in print every chance they get. Calling him a ""wooden actor"" to labeling him just a ""pretty face"". Personally I think they protest too much. It is almost as if it putting Reeves in a disparaging light they elevate their status as a critic, maybe they think it gains them more credibility. Granted, some of it is warranted. In Coppala's Dracula, he really did seem out of place, being a last minute replacement for Johnny Depp, but that was long ago. Since then Reeves has evolved. You only have to see him in Sam Rami's Gift and read the praise Rami wrote about him to see that Reeves is really an in-depth, articulate person with allot of humility. So no, there is no Reeves bashing here. In fact, he portrays the essence of Constantine through personality alone without the props of blonde hair and British accent. That isn't easy.<br/><br/>World weary, self destructive and cancer ridden makes Constantine the epitome of the reluctant hero. Using his skill in the occult to send demon half breeds that break the rules back to hell so that he can buy himself a stairway to heaven. Suddenly the rules are changing, full breed demons are trying to cross over, all hell is breaking lose, literally. Throw in the Spear of Destiny, the spear that killed Christ on the cross, a pair of psychic twins, an androgynous Gabriel and an opportunistic half breed demon and you find yourself in the middle of a sulfur pit of a plot.<br/><br/>This movie is a visual feast pulling out allot of references to Bosh. Hell never looked more twisted. There is enough eye candy here to make you want to watch it again just for the effects alone, but if you do, you will miss smart story telling and an excellent performance by Reeves and crew. So watch it for the story as well."

Does anyone idealize heaven that way? I'd settle for togas rather than neckties (frivolous touch).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is pathetic and ironically soulless, indifferent . However, you're supposed to see him as an unlikely jaded victim who becomes a hero. PROBLEM: he has absolutely no personality, no presence whatsoever. He's entirely incidental. We're supposed to ""like""/PITY him because he has cancer. Other than that -and his whiny sufferings about being in communication with divine forces (poor guy!), he's got no real personality WHATSOEVER! One of the worst-drawn movie characters in recent history.<br/><br/>And it's a long movie. There was time for development, but someone decided that audiences needed more stupid vagaries of people instantly visiting special-effects hell JUST BY TAKING A BATH! (FYI: I've bathed since infancy and never been transported to another realm; this doesn't work)."

","Good luck identifying with this brooding guy with no identifiable day job but an extremely swell apartment in New York who's trying to avoid hell since his suicide attempt at 15 which was brought on by his confinement in an insane asylum because his parents didn't get his ability to see supernatural beings and who personally knows archangels and chats with Satan in a white suit and who seemingly lives on cigarettes and is now helping a gorgeous NYPD detective to find out whether her sister really did commit suicide and go to hell and whether she was also in touch with demons. Oh, and a shabby Mexican is making his way northward with the spear that stabbed Jesus on the cross. I dunno, just not your universal human predicament for me.<br/><br/>I'm already imagining the director's commentary on the film's appearance when the DVD is released. ""We wanted to achieve a very spare, yet threatening look, very futuristic and grim. So we dressed people in black and white, and we showed hell as being very red in color. There's a demon right there, yup. Oh, that demon was designed by Milford Berman, he's a real genius."" Movies with these ridiculous stakes--WILL mankind survive?--have no suspense anyway; I mean, the mere fact that I'm sitting in a theater in Los Angeles surrounded by other people pretty much serves as a spoiler. As for Constantine's stakes--WILL he go to eternal damnation?--I'd rather see a human being avoid hell on general principles, but that's all that carried me along in this film.<br/><br/>You'll hear about Rachel Weisz, and she serves as well as Maria Bello or Natalie Portman or Liv Tyler or Claire Forlani or any host of interchangeable medium-hotties would have."

Fantastic was using a confession for Rachel Weisz have a supporting actor for who she tell about her life. Is is perfect. The priest is not shown and she talks for him, telling for us about her life, we see other scenes while she talks in confession. Perfect use of supporting actor. The taxi driver, Shia, make Keanu to be ironical, and so we know more about the character of Keanu.

","We went to see the movie and loved it. The part I thought was funny was when John Constantine was going to heaven while giving Chaz a special goodbye. So if Chaz couldn't have him, heaven wouldn't either. That's why I guess he cleansed John's lungs and (John) was using gum to stop the craving. I say that if a person gives it bad reviews (because it's not their type of movie)to someone else, then I suggest the someone else to check out the movie themselves. They'll love it. It may be a bit confusing but it will be worth seeing. I love Keanu Reeves-great actor as well as Rachel Weisz. As to what I saw, I think there may be a sequel coming."

However, don't expect this to be a movie to take a girl on a date to. She probably wont enjoy it, but most guys will.

","When I heard that Keanu's follow up on the Matrix was to be this movie, based on the popular underground comic by DC comics I was way skeptical.<br/><br/>But alas, after seeing it, I have to say that I am immensely impressed by this movie.<br/><br/>To be fair, it is definitely no Hellboy, its visual style lacks the sheer power of Guilermo del Toro, but for once, Keanu's under-performance actually works, especially for his character's ""devil-may-care"" attitude, and where Hellboy is a cigar chomper, John Constantine is a chain smoker with lung cancer.<br/><br/>It is certainly not the usual riff-raff comic crap like Elektra or Catwoman, and to be honestly clear...if I did not know John Constantine to be from the Hellblazer comic series I would have thought this to be just yet another ultra stylized action horror.<br/><br/>Okay what made the movie for me...<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves...in yet another unusual role, a character thats more human than human...<br/><br/>Gavin Rossdale...in his debut role as a demon, with the appearance of a upper-class guppy. He was a show stealer in his scenes and I kind off wished that I could have seen more of him.<br/><br/>that ""Stormare"" guy from Fargo... as the Devil. Now kids, that was one hell of a show stealer, and the way he portrayed the devil was funny and yet very scary.<br/><br/>all and all, the SFX, the monster designs, the sets and acting...everything worked well and it was one entertaining...scary but entertaining piece."
"zardoz-13","8","2","9","3 March 2005"," Keanu Reeves Against Hell
","Anti-tobacco advocates will applaud the action-packed Keanu Reeves supernatural saga ""Constantine"" (*** out of ****) for the way that rookie director Francis Lawrence seamlessly integrates a public service message about the horrors of nicotine into his otherworldly, special effects-laden, metaphysical melodrama. Simultaneously, comparisons between Reeves' ""Matrix"" trilogy and ""Constantine"" are inevitable. First, like ""The Matrix,"" an unseen world exists in ""Constantine"" that nobody knows about except those that battle audacious demons in an eternal war between Heaven and Hell. Second, just as the heroes transported themselves through telephone wires into the hidden world of ""The Matrix,"" the protagonists in ""Constantine"" follow a similar procedure. Basically, they immerse themselves either partially or wholly in water, so they can cross over into the fiery netherworld. Mind you, ""Constantine"" diverges enough from ""The Matrix,"" so that you cannot truthfully call it a ""Matrix"" knockoff. Although this grim but entertaining Warner Brothers release concerns subject matter similar to that in ""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Spawn,"" and the ""Prophecy"" and ""The Crow"" movies, ""Constantine"" manages to carve out a niche all its own. Swiftly-paced, gorgeously photographed by Oscar-winning lenser Philippe Rousselot, with an anti-social, chain-smoking, lung cancer-afflicted hero; a pretty sympathetic heroine, and several intriguing (or perhaps blasphemous) twists on Catholic theology, ""Constantine"" provides enough thrills, chills, and cheeky humor to make it worth watching more than once.<br/><br/>As John Constantine, Keanu Reeves plays a natty ""Men-In-Black"" type enforcer who acts as an exorcist of sorts in a perpetual war against evil on Earth. In an early scene, Constantine banishes a skeleton-like demon with half of a skull from the body of a young Hispanic girl. The exorcism doesn't go as easily as Constantine had anticipated, so he appropriates a 300 pound mirror to trap the fiend in and send it to a shattering death. Afterward, Constantine gets the feeling that something just ain't right. Demons have never behaved this rebelliously and Constantine is worried. According to the script by Kevin (""The Glimmer Man"") Brodbin and Frank (""Suburban Commando"") Cappello, angels and demons can influence humans, but they cannot intervene in their everyday affairs. Unlike most humans who have doubts about Hell, Constantine has no doubts. Born with an uncanny curse to recognize demons on buses as well as anywhere else, young Constantine tried to take his life, but the doctors managed to save him. Nevertheless, during the two minutes that he lay clinically death, our hero toured Hell and saw enough demons to commit him to his current course of action. Constantine serves as a sort of INS agent who--as he says in one scene--""deports"" demons back to Hell. Since he committed suicide, Constantine hopes that his reputation as the toughest demon buster in Los Angeles will earn him grace in God's eyes and a place in Heaven. The angel Gabriel (played by ""The Beach's"" Tilda Swinton as an androgynous entity with wings) doesn't think that Constantine stands a chance in Hell of entering Heaven.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, L.A.P.D. Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz of ""Chain Reaction"") is grieving over the apparent suicide death of her twin sister Isabel. Isabel (Weisz in a dual role) who took a header off the top-floor of the clinic where she was being hospitalized and plunged to her death. Despite her best efforts, Angela cannot get the Catholic Church to give her sister a proper send-off. When she sees the surveillance camera footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her sister utter Constantine's name. Eventually, Constantine and Angela team up to take on hordes of dastardly demons. While this occurs, a homeless Hispanic dude has unearthed the Spear of Destiny, the same spear that a Roman soldier jabbed into Christ's side at Golgotha, which he finds wrapped in a Nazi flag in Mexico. This invincible spear-carrier sets out for Los Angeles, and nothing can stop him! Seems like there is a second-coming at hand. But it has nothing to do with Heaven. That's just for starters!<br/><br/>Although the Brodbin & Cappello script has some flaws in its logic, ""Constantine"" is still an exciting, high-octane, summer-time, occult actioneer. Brodbin and Cappello do a good job of laying out the ground rules for dispatching the demons, but it appears as if some of the plot hit the cutting room floor in this two-hour plus, R-rated epic. Nobody has time for sex in this gritty, dark-edged, demon-infested nail-biter. Although it contains horrific elements, ""Constantine"" doesn't qualify as a chiller. This movie won't give you Technicolor nightmares unless you smoke cigarettes like a chimney. Purists who have read the DC/Vertigo comic ""Hellblazer,"" which served as the basis for ""Constantine,"" may complain because the protagonist was a profane Englishman. Word is that they Anglicized the hero, because Keanu didn't want to fool around with an accent. As hard-boiled as this tale is, the filmmakers supply more than enough humor to off-set some of its more unsavory subject matter. At one point, Constantine traps a spider under a glass, blows cigarette smoke into the glass, and settles back to watch the arachnid with the comment: ""Welcome to my world."" No sooner has our hero said this than another character frees the spider from its glassy prison. Interestingly enough, ""Constantine"" isn't the first movie where a Keanu Reeves character has gone to Hell. Does anybody remember ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey?"" Further, ""Constantine"" isn't the first movie where Keanu has met the devil. Anybody remember ""The Devil's Advocate?"" Constantine"" also represents a reunion for Weisz and Reeves who co-starred in ""Chain Reaction."" Finally, if you do see ""Constantine,"" stick around after the end credits for one more scene that ties up a loose thread in the plot."

"wendingowolf","9","3","17","19 February 2005"," The exorcist becomes an Action/Horror flick, but is that enough?
","I come into seeing this movie thinking it is going to be the Christian end of the world version of the Matrix. While I am not a Constantine graphical novel fan, this movie definitely feels like a Vertigo product.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Kenue) plays his part like a dream. A chain smoking demon exorcist bad ass who knows something, and because he does, he is paying for with fees on his soul every day. While hunting, Constantine runs into LA cop Anglia (Rachel Weisz) and the Demon hunter happens, and down the rabbit hole he goes. ^^ The movie gets one thing perfectly right, it carries that dark graphical novel feel with it. One could put little square text boxes in the corner if needed, and it would work seamlessly. The catch, is that like most graphical novels, is that there is usually a bit too much dialog over action. For those expecting a Matrix esq trill ride, might want to pick look else where. But for those that like devilishly dark films with a biblical. It comes off a lot like the exorcist, with action and horror. Not the most perfect mix, but the While a masters in Christian history is not required, the complete clueless will feel lost when watching this film unless they are paying close attention. As a mythology buff, there are parts 'dumbed down'. The lance of Longilus is called more aptly, the spear of dynasty (the blade that pierced Jesus and was stained with his blood, while other parts, (namely towards the end, which I will not give away for spoiler reasons) are amped up. But the final act has a few twists and surprises that make it a thrill.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie I'd recommend seeing."

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","6 June 2016"," Hollywood, I blame you
","The character of John Constantine was born from the pens of Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and John Totleben. He was originally a side character in The Swamp Thing comics, but very quickly moved to his own adventures in Hellblazer. He's the epitome of a blue collar mage, getting by with the skin of his teeth, some guile and a boat load of punk attitude.<br/><br/>The character has numerous problems. He's arrogant, not very strong magically, has a bad habit of getting his friends killed while saving his own hide, is very much rage against the gates of heaven kind of punk and is always biting off way more than he can chew. And that's why we love him. But that's not exactly something that you can make a Hollywood movie out of. So when they announced they were going to try anyways, I was suitably nervous. And for a reason.<br/><br/>I mean, if you don't take into account that it's a Hellblazer movie, it's by most definitions fine. Keanu Reeves easily pulls off the detached arrogance needed, the special effects are nice, the storyline, while a bit high-flying, is definitely interesting and the whole one man against all the forces of hell slash occult style the film has going for it is very cool indeed.<br/><br/>But, it's a Hellblazer adaptation and as such it fails miserably. I mean, the character of John Constantine is a blond, atheist/agnostic, British barely-a-mage with a real problem with firearms. Reeve's character is a dark-haired Catholic living in New York, with huge magical talent and more than filling to pump someone full of lead. And Chas, originally a middle-aged, unhappily married childhood friend of John's, with absolutely zero interest in magic, has been turned into teenage wanna-be apprentice of his. Tell me that's there's nothing wrong with the picture painted here. I dare you.<br/><br/>By all means, do see the film if you're into all that Catholic exorcism style of fantasy. It's very good in that regard. But, if you love Hellblazer and the character of John Constantine, I'd steer clear."

","I read and loved the comic book this movie is based on (Hellblazer).<br/><br/>The script writers did not even bother to keep the important climax from the original story. I've never expected a movie to be very very faithful to printed sources (books, comics) but this is ridiculous. <br/><br/>The movie is thin as spring ice with no depth, none of the cleverness and interesting side characters that appeared in the original story. It is simply not a Constantine movie. For people that have never even heard of the original character before the movie I guess this would be a 5-6/10 movie, okay to watch when bored. The two stars I gave this movie is for Peter Stormares and Tilda Swintons efforts. They are the only redeeming quality of this title. <br/><br/>For anyone that have even a fleeting hint of the Constantine story called Hellblazer, this Keanu Reeves (as Constantine? Why not Nicholas Cage as Gandalf??) time-waster isn't worth it's name."
"tempestnyx","8","1","3","26 March 2016"," Constantine is a fun wile ride with great characters and actors who know what their doing.
","You know, this movie gets a lot of heat for being bad but you know I love it. I love Keanu Reeve's as an actor, especially when he doesn't talk because he blends into the characters. Moreover, this film, I mean it's good. I love it.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays DC Comics/Vertigo hero John Constantine, who battles the supernatural forces. In the case of the film he sees angels and demons, and he sends demons back to hell where they belong. Why? Because he's trying to buy his way into heaven because he's a suicide and the only place for him to go is hell. However, then something happens. Well, many things happen. One: Constantine is curious that a demon wants to eat its way out of a little girl. This is suspicious behavior becomes Demons possess; they don't use humans as portals. Two: he is diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer. He's living on borrowed time, and when he dies, the Devil himself is going to get him. Three: Angela (played by Rachel Weisz) is having a crisis of faith when her twin sister kills herself and demons are haunting her. Talk about complicated. And to make matters worse, the Devil's son has decided that he needs Angela to enter the world.<br/><br/>It's a solid story that progresses very well and Keanu did a good job bringing the character to life. No, he's not a blond, and he's only half-British who sounds like a surfer boy, but he knows how to act, he knows how to be emotional, tough, and angry. Keanu brings the character to life, he's an ass, no doubt about that, he's perfect. He nailed the character down, and that should be recognized. Is Matt Ryan better? Yeah, he fits the bill, but Keanu wasn't bad. He acted just like John Constantine, nailed the character down, even if he didn't sound or look like the character. More importantly, the story has evolution. The characters evolve, Constantine most of all and that's amazing to see a superhero film that focuses on the characters as much as the story. That is what makes a good movie.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the other cast members who are amazing. Tilda Swinton plays the androgynous, ""half-breed"" angel, Gabriel, with a disdain for humanity. She plots to set Mammon (the son the Devil) free so that humans can understand the gift of heaven. Talk about delusional. And it was great because it came out of nowhere. It was the jaw- dropping moment of the film that followed the devastating death of Chas Kramer (played by Shia LaBeouf), it was an incredible scene for these two and brought to life everything. That was the moment, the real moment when Constantine realizes that everything was bigger than him. Well, not, I mean, it's hard to pinpoint the exact scene where his character grows up and realizes that he can't buy his way into heaven and that everything he does is selfish even though it helps others. He's an ass, but that's what makes him so great.<br/><br/>But again, all these actors were fantastic and together they brought the film together, they made it something worth viewing and given everything that may contradict the Hellblazer comics, it is still a great film that focuses on the story and the character development. It doesn't sacrifice anything for something else and brings the film to life and makes it great.<br/><br/>Also, Peter Stormare was a great Devil. Seriously, those 20 minutes with him were incredible. He should just always play the Devil."

","I really liked this movie. It is the classic battle of good versus evil at a very personal level for Constantine and those around him. Born with a gift for such matters, Constantine fights the half-breed demons who try to persuade us mere mortals into doing bad things. And there is a major plot afoot involving the spear of destiny and the promise of hellacious things to come. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine in a cool but cynical way. Rachel Weisz is excellent as a cop who is investigating the death of her sister, and Constantine seems like just the guy who can help - so why won't he? Excellent supporting roles played by Pruitt Talor Vince, Tilda Swinton, and all the others. Also, great camera shots.

","Now that I'm 6 years into loving this movie I have to share. Clearly a flick that needs more than the one viewing at the theater. Owning this DVD gives you the opportunity to view the details. The visuals are amazing, dark, and spooky. The storyline is complex enough to encourage thinking after the movie is over. Constantine is an effective live action translation from the comic book series called Hellblazer. Keanu and Rachel have such a sweet chemistry but there is also a wonderful, sometimes intense, dynamic energy with Reeves and the secondary cast members who are brilliant. Shia is a perfect young sidekick against the intensity of Constantine. Peter Stormare portrays a very surprising Lucifer. The casting is totally brilliant. Tilda is the archangel Gabriel in a way that has never been done before. I have heard that there is a homoerotic vibe to this movie but it surely has a hetero-erotic vibe too. As always its about the viewer more than anything. Youtubers have had a field day using the imagery from this movie for their vids. I recommend to anyone, over 13, who enjoys the horror/demonic genre. Don't forget to watch it past the credits and view the extras for some treats that were lost in editing. The blu-ray edition has even more information about the filming and there is a remarkable crispness. If you have a choice, get it on blu-ray."

George Lucas would be a key example.<br/><br/>Anyway, here is the point I am getting at. The makers of Constantine, have no such 'little kids' in their imagination. This feature is a clunky, overlong, and surprising dull piece of work. It contains a vastly underwritten screenplay, an utterly sucky performance from Keanu Reeves, and most frustratingly of all, there is no action. <br/><br/>As dull as it is, I suppose it has a few sporadic horror charms which may appeal to some, but not me. Every twenty minutes, Keanu Reeves gets to punch or shoot something freaky, but it never lasts long. We also get to see hell a couple of times (or one vision of it), not to mention Tilda Swinton playing a boy (probably wearing a green screen bra to generate the same kind of effect as a wire removal, if you get my meaning) <br/><br/>This aside, Constantine has nothing to offer. It ends on a far too rushed and incomplete note, which just cries out for sequel, something it doesn't doesn't deserve. I feel more than a bit cheated by Constantine, it doesn't deliver. Do yourself a favour and skip it."
"ladymidath","7","1","3","12 August 2006"," It's A Shame....
","It's a shame that the director and the producer did not sit down and actually read Dangerous Habits. It's a good story and it would have shown John Constantine's character as it is written in the Vertigo comic series, Hellblazer:John Constantine. The movie was quite good, but can someone please tell me why Keanu Reeves was cast to play a blonde haired Brit that actually looks like Sting? And why was a teenager cast to play the character Chaz when in the comics, he is a fifty odd year old grandfather? I liked the movie, but I hated the way the characters were Americanized. This is where I feel that the film let me and all the other Hellblazer fans down. I probably would have enjoyed it better if they had stuck closer to the original characters and stories."
"casarbi","4","1","3","29 June 2006"," Hell comes to Hollywood
","I'm not acquainted with the comic book but this was a tepid and dull watch.<br/><br/>Keanu is terrible in this. It's not he's a bad actor, he just lacks charisma. I felt nothing for John who came across as a sulker rather than pained.<br/><br/>Comic books are often more about ideas than films. There are a lot of ideas floating around here and you need a strong lead to pull them together. If you don't feel for the lead, it becomes a mess. Keanu doesn't really convince me of the characters pain. I begin to wonder if he believes in the character. Maybe being so clean, with his well styled hair didn't help. No amount of ""fatigue make up"" could make him look truly worn out. A serious miscast.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the effects are not mind blowing and while there are some strong signs of decent cinematography and direction, the seems to be a lack of consistency in the visuals to tie it all together. It felt like this film should have been darker. More gritty. It comes across, as neither being mainstream or artistic. It just seems to lack cohesiveness from it's leads or the production.<br/><br/>The script is plodding and the film is far too long. While the last ten minutes builds up well it falters in the last couple as Hollywood formula comes a knocking.<br/><br/>I didn't get any satisfaction from this movie, and while a couple of scenes did have some nice production values and direction, overall this is unlikely to do have done the comic book series any justice. Avoid."

","Constanine is a man with the power to see angels and demons in our world; as he knows he is going to go to hell when he dies, he tries to kill as demons as he can in order to gain the pass to heaven; One day, he discovers than things are going ti change in Earth... Comparing with the comic which is based, the movie is completely different, for most puritan fans, it will be terrible. However, the movie is a good action-fantastic film, with great special effects and quite good action scenes. The acting is not very good, but it does not demand that, fireworks are more important in this kind of movie, and they are really good! It does not bore at any time and results totally enjoyable. In addition the idea of a world in three parallel dimensions (Heaven, Earth, Hell) connected by portals is quite interesting and results enjoyable. To sum up, this seems the typical bad film of an adaptation of a comic (as Daredevil, or Hulk), but is really well done for being one of this films, because it is exciting and enjoyable without being too much violent or boring, and the results is much better as expected, so it deserves a 7. (this genre, usually does not deserve more than a 4-5)"
"brando647","7","1","3","2 February 2006"," Another underrated comic book film...
","It seems like ""Constantine"" didn't get much attention when it was in theaters. Personally, I really enjoyed it. The best way I could describe the feel of the movie to those curious to see it is that it's sort of like the Matrix movies, but with angels and demons instead of machines. The movie is based on the ""Hellblazer"" comic book series, featuring John Constantine. With his power to see demons and angels as they interact on Earth, he attempts to keep the balance between good and evil.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspect of this movie for me was the storyline. While I am an agnostic, I've always been curious about religious mythology, and this movie plays heavily on just that. It has an entire history regarding God, the Devil, and mankind's role in existence. I enjoyed the backstory almost as much as I enjoyed the film's plot. One of the coolest visuals in the film is it's envisioning of Hell. At some points in the movie, we are given the opportunity to view Hell. It is a fantastic landscape mirroring what exists on Earth, except distorted. The film's creators took the look of Hell from the moment during an atomic bomb detonation between the heat blast and the shockwave. It is really something that must be seen, I was really impressed.<br/><br/>The theology and impressive visuals aren't the only thing to enjoy in this movie. Reeves gives his usual performance, perfectly suited for the role of the callous Constantine. I can't think of much to say about Rachel Weisz, as it seems I love her in any role she plays. The most entertaining performance to watch for comes in the form of Peter Stormare as Satan. The man just seems to ooze with evil.<br/><br/>I think this movie is generally a hit or miss. Either you like it or you don't really care. It does seem a drag at points and that may turn people off, but I think overall the film has more highlights than low points."
"J-Nanson","8","1","3","4 September 2005"," You got to see it more than once to really appreciate the film
","I totally disagree with the first commend made.I think it is a good film and Keanu Reeves acts very well in this very difficult subject of film material. When I saw the film in the cinema I left stunned, I was not quit grasp what i just had seen, and it was a definite thing, it wasn't what I expected when entering the cinema. Walking out the cinema I was not sure if I liked it or not, but it worked me a treat on the way home and for few more days to come. So I was looking forward to get my hands on the DVD and watch it again. I must say it grew on me watching it on DVD in my own privacy 3 more times. You got to see the film definitely more than once, to understand it and liking it. It also makes you think twice of what can be without you admitting your deepest fears and hopes of what there is after we leave this existence and if we are there the really responsible for our good and bad deeds made in this life."

","When the movie came out, I hadn't even heard of it. I didn't remember seeing it on TV from before. I was told it was a good movie, but I really didn't have any intention of watching it. Then, last night my friend told me to watch Constantine if you want to quit smoking. Since I am trying, I figured 'What the hell?'. So, I watched it, and I was actually impressed by it. I mean, it wasn't the best movie of it's time, but it's good. I love how they mixed reality with fantasy. The realism of him getting lung cancer and dying, and the fact that there are demons and angels, and that he will be going to hell. I have read that a lot of people don't like Keanu Reeves, and think his acting sucks. But, I have always enjoyed his acting, even as a little girl. I never really watched the 'Matrix' movies, I had no interest in them. But, this has to be one of the best movies I have since Keanu in. Great job!"

"rdickerson-1","6","1","3","23 July 2005"," Not great, not bad but somewhere in between.
","Lots of fuss on this board about the movie, but in my opinion, good enough to plunk down 4 bucks and rent it for a night. Th highlight of the movie are the special effects, closely followed by the performance of one Rachel Wiesz. A truly captivating performance that had me moved. I can only imagine what it's like to lose a twin sister, but from my personal experiences, I can say that most of the twin talk in the movie is dead on. It helps that I have a couple friends who have either a spouse or siblings who are twins, but what do I know. Anyway the point is Weisz pulls it off effortlessly and should be considered one of the best performances of the year.<br/><br/>Not much to say about the special effects except that they are first rate. With so much being done on a computer these days, it's not hard to tell the difference between whats real and a video game. (""Chronicles of Riddick"" comes to mind when I think of overdone computer-generated special effects.) <br/><br/>So in a nutshell, the movie does not suck, is not great, and is somewhere in between. And yes, Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, not even a good actor, but I will still take time to check out his movies. Check out ""Something's Gotta Give --a much better movie-- if you want a good, clean, Keanu performance. As John Constantine he was good, in a dirty, life-sucks kind of way.<br/><br/>Lower your expectations a bit and you may enjoy this little nugget of a movie."

Peter Stormare (Satan) was exceptional in his portrayal of the dark side and Tilda Swinton's (Gabriel) performance as God's angel of destruction was well played. The script was well thought out and if the viewer has at least a basic knowledge of the 'end times' they will be able to follow the plot and appreciate the strong performances of the actors.<br/><br/>Before watching the movie, all the reviews I read were bad. I'm pleased to say that they were all wrong! I hope they intend to make a sequel! After watching this movie I went out and bought my own copy!"
"Acid_Lee","6","1","3","8 April 2005"," Not one for the comic books fans ...
","This movie has been met with a lot of mixed opinions about its quality. There's certainly been a lot of aggro from dedicated fans of the comic book 'Hellblazer,' as they have discovered that their beloved Constantine is now an American living in Los Angeles with dark hair. Originally, he was from Liverpool and looked like Sting.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a chain-smoking, cynical exorcist who is gifted, or cursed as he sees it, with the ability to see things that are not of this world. Because he tried to commit suicide earlier in his life he is destined to go to Hell when he dies, which isn't too far off as he is dying of lung cancer. Wanting to avoid this fate, he goes round sending unruly demons back to Hell with the hope of buying his way into Heaven.<br/><br/>The story starts with the suicide of mental patient Isabel Dobson (Rachel Weisz). Isobel claimed to be psychic and could see things that others could not. Her twin sister, Angela (also played by Weisz) refuses to believe that her sister would take her own life and enlists the help of Constantine to investigate. Together they unravel a conspiracy that could bring an end to all life on Earth, as we know it.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the role of Constantine in pretty much the same way as he plays every other character he's ever played. His acting is lazy and void of emotion, but it suits the character of Constantine well, so it actually pays off this time round! Rachel Weisz was an excellent choice to play twins Angela and Isobel Dobson. The only downside with her performance is that her American accent isn't that good. Together Reeves and Weisz have great on screen chemistry. Anyone who has seen Chain Reaction, in which they previously starred together, will agree.<br/><br/>The film is almost stolen by two of the supporting characters. The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) is a bit of fruit and is not all s/he* appears to be. Satan (Peter Stormare) is slightly camp, but extremely sinister and utterly evil, which is what we would expect from the Prince of Darkness, wouldn't we? There are a lot of things that are left unexplained, and it is never made clear what Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) has to do with the main plot. It's not even worth talking about the Bush front man's acting ability because he has absolutely none. There are also a lot of religious references in the movie that might make people want to switch off until the action starts, but unfortunately people need to pay attention to these as they are important to the story.<br/><br/>This is a movie that one would think consists of action, violence, etc. In truth, the movie is a thriller with little bits of action thrown in. There is a lot of violence, several suicide references, and even references to self-harm.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite good. There is good use of CGI, creating very real and quite horrifying looking demons. The depiction of Heaven and Hell is interesting to see.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the comic book, this may probably anger you. If, like me, you've never read the comic book, you may find this to be an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>6/10 * Angels don't have genitalia; therefore they are neither male nor female."

","Can you all please get over the Matrix?!?! This film, or any other film, whether starring Keanu Reeves or not, is not the Matrix, and does not deserve to be compared to it.<br/><br/>Constantine is a genre film, dealing with the end of the world, the occult, etc. much like The Prophecy or the awful End of Days and Stigmata. And it's really not too bad. If you go into a Keanu film looking for cinematic art or a think-piece, you will always be sadly mistaken. This is a good fun movie, adapted from a great comic book, and Keanu's performance is easily a cut above his average. Hell, it wasn't as if he was actually ""acting"" in the Matrix either.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz and Djimon Honsou were both excellent, and Tilda Swinton as Gabriel was an inspired choice.<br/><br/>While this will never make it into my top-10, for the style of film it was, it was very good, and I fully enjoyed watching it. It was money much better spent than on either of the two Matrix sequels..."

But if you really look at the trailers, only the special effects are shown. Yes, they were awesome, but generally a movie needs a plot to be complete. Unfortunetely, there were too many holes. The film seems rushed and leaves you wondering. Reeves seems to take his role much to seriously and tries to tap into the magic that made ""The Matrix"" a success but does a lousy job trying to be ""cool and mysterious.""<br/><br/>Let's hope that Francis Lawrence picks a better script for his next film, or one that even has depth."
"spacemonkey_fg","10","3","18","3 March 2005"," Dark Noir like Supernatural Thriller
","Title: Constantine (2005) Director: Francis Lawrence Cast: Keany (whoa!) Reeves, Rachel Weizs, Tilda Swinton, Djimoun Honsou Review: Well, after all that bad buzz at the beginning of its production about Alan Moore hating the route they were taking with the film and all that bull, I honestly thought this movie was going to be a total train wreck. Still, that curiosity was in me, and a little hope that maybe, just maybe they would not mess things up. Well, I'm very happy to inform you guys that this film kicked some major ass! The story revolves around Constantine, a chain smoking, demon seeing exorcist who is bummed out and about to die of lung cancer. In comes detective Angela Dodson who's sister has mysteriously killed herself. Angela and Constantine must investigate her death and in doing so they plunge themselves and us with them in a world filled with demons, angels, crucifixes, exorcism, trips to hell and the devil himself! By far the coolest thing about this film is its look. Francis Lawrences experience in making pretty videos for MTV must have helped him out in seeing the importance of the visual aspect of a film like this one. I mean, we are going to go to hell right? And for the most part, every time a film goes to hell, it tends to be a tad disappointing (Spawn anyone?) Did this film fail in that department? Heck no! Hell was a desolated desert where everything is constantly burning in hell fire and the fire and brimstone and being hit by a constant with that never seems to let down. Cool visuals there. But it doesn't stop here, there's also the dark film noir look of Los Angeles. Its dirty, shadowy and retro in style. Liked it a heck of a lot, it felt like one of those old detective movies that are in black and white.<br/><br/>I loved the dialog here. I mean the story is very interesting, very well written. Its nothing mind shattering, but it manages to keep you interested all through out. The dialog in a supernatural film like this one can sometimes lend itself to sounding goofy or moronic. Not so here. The tone of the movie is very serious and sprinkled with a few moments of funny dialog to relieve the somber and dark tone the film has for most of its running time. Also Constantines sidekick Chas Chandler (Shia Labeouf) is responsible for the comedic relief and for the most part did a good job. By far the coolest dialog sequences are those with Belzebub himself. Which brings me to my next point...<br/><br/>The devil! I loved the rendition of the devil in this flick. Peter Stormare steals the show as old Satan. He was a disgusting almost animal like thing. Speaking with lots of disdain and this ""I don't give a crap I got it all covered"" attitude all through out. Some of the funniest dialog was with Constantine and Lucifer going back and forth with some double talk.<br/><br/>The effects were handled well, most of it was on CGI, and I think that for the most part it was well handled and not overdone. They used it only when necessary and it was well made. Only thing the demons looked very cgi, I would've done it with mechanical effects. But this is not the 80s and Tom Savini no longer does make up effects. So we gotta get used to this sort of thing. On Constantine, the computer effects didn't distract from the story which is my main preoccupation.<br/><br/>Keanu will be Keanu no matter what film he is in, so this wasn't a big stretch for him as far as acting goes. But I must say that he did give the character a certain air of ""Screw YOu! I'm an arrogant idiot and I don't give a crap what you say!"" that I enjoyed and that I felt must have come straight from the comic that the story was based in. As far as acting goes Peter Stormare was the coolest thing here.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun film with heavy supernatural elements all around. As far as religious themes go this one has it all! From demons to angels to exorcisms! Its all here! Grab your holy water and strap on to that electric chair cause Constantine will give you a jolt of coolness that will stay with you long after you've left the theater.<br/><br/>Rating: 41/2 out of 5"
"thepts","7","3","18","26 February 2005"," Slaughters the comic book, but still a decent movie
","As the topic says, this movie does nothing to honor the original comic.. and I mean nothing at all. I guess this is old news in adaptation movies, that fans of the original don't like the adapted result, so I'll be quick: John Constantine is a shabby English guy, part caught in the 80s and 70s, wearing a worn, brown trench-coat. He doesn't spit words out like Reeves here, he's just tired and very very disillusioned. Wants to be the good guy, but hasn't always the strength or the courage. Yes, he does dabble with the Christian universe, but mostly with heathen religions. John is certainly no traveling, believing, catholic exorcist like in this movie. In other words, Hellblazer-fans, leave every hope of seeing a ""LOTR-style"" respectful adaptation behind you.<br/><br/>As for the actual movie, yes I could yab about how moments like a main character discovering his terminal cancer and another finding her twin sister dead (plus other subjects of life, death and religion) would require much better acting and less cliché. But why bother.. This is a good action and effect movie, that's all.<br/><br/>So if you tolerate those movies well, watch until the last part of this, and you might even find more rare movie content, which appeals to the less than casual moviegoer as well."

There's a little bit of action, but not very much, and no the climax gunfight doesn't rip off the matrix (its not even a gunfight, C just shoots a bunch of demons in a cool way, there's no real fighting), this isn't really an action movie, there's only about 3 minutes of actual action, but it doesn't need a big fight or anything like that to be as great as it was. Its funny, very, and has a little drama, alittle horror, alittle action, alittle bit of everything, blended together quite well. The performances were even quite good, Reeves did a great job, i know i just got a lot of laughs, but i don't understand why people hate him so much, he can do a really good job of delivering his character, and the is no exception, the rest of the cast did good too. 9 out of a 10, no real flaws, i would have preferred some more action at the end maybe a showdown with the devil and some in the middle of the film, but overall a great film."

","The first one was the scene where the Mexican found the legendary dagger of life. It was said that anyone who holds this dagger controls life itself. It was really a scary scene cause of the car being destroyed instead of the man and all the cows dying. But it really opened up the story of the movie well because it showed the main theme of the battle of all the characters. Then the possessed girl who was on the ceiling was really shocking. This scene explained a bit more of hero's personality and occupation. Then John Constantine appears and shows us his amazing ability. So the story tags along and it shows Constantine's distressed life with his little sidekick Chas. But the Gabriel part was awesome! The effects with the wings and the lines of Gabriel convincing John to continue his quest to remove evil from Earth. But all in all the Plot can be described in one word-EXCELLENT!

I did not think this was a drawn out or bad rendition of the series, I think Keanu brought life to the characters dark yet realistic outlook on his and his acting was superb he continues to amaze me with every new performance. I think this movie kind of shows him as Neo a little bit which is cool because I completely dug Neo of matrix, I mean its almost like a cult classic of my generation.

"dj_bassett","Null","3","19","22 February 2005"," Fine, but will irritate fans of the series
","Fans of the series are going to be annoyed at CONSTANTINE, which casts Keanu Reeves in a paradigmatic British ""good bloke"" kind of role and at times roams rather far afield from ""Hellblazer"" (Constantine is not known for action, really, nor is he the kind of guy who's going to fit in well in a redemption tale, which is what the movie turns into.) That said, Reeves is not bad, especially as the story kicks into high gear and we see him trying to figure out what's going on: Reeves always does bewilderment well, and we see a lot of that. Unfortunately he's asked to be acerbic and cynical at the start, which is something he's not good at.<br/><br/>Absolute newcomers are probably not going to like it either: I've read reviews from such folk who seem completely lost in the story's byways. It helps to have at least a general familiarity with the Vertigo aesthetic, and it's sort of oddball take on Heaven/Hell/God/Satan/Good/Evil. Probably the ideal audience is somebody like me, who followed some Vertigo series but not ""Hellblazer"" specifically.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It ultimately becomes rather conventional, and that's a problem here and there (the climax is kicked off by as ridiculous a plot machination as I've seen). There's also too much fogginess in the story: the bad guy's plot seemed to depend far too much on luck, for instance. But the effects are spectacular, the mood is nicely grim and downbeat, the trip to the conventional destinations is unusual, there's a lot of interesting Vertigo-type ideas on screen, Constantine is for the most part not much of a superhero, and while the movie ends as a redemption story, it's a complicated sort of one, which I liked. (I thought Constantine's final solution to his problem was incredibly ingenious.) In other words, I liked it despite it's faults, and would cautiously recommend it. I've heard some people call it BLADE crossed with THE EXORCIST, which actually isn't too far off -- whatever you think of ""Hellblazzer"", if that notion appeals to you you'll like this."

The character of Lucifer was gorgeous:dressed all in pearl-white and presented almost like belonging to Heaven he gives the life back to Constantine so he could long to take him back to Hell later when his sins kill him.That's when Constantine stops smoking! What a hell of a big joke: no doubt the movie could be proclaimed as the greatest anti-tobacco advertiser,maybe too early to say of the year and maybe not,taking in consideration the terrifying pictures of Hell on first place and then the fact that the great Constantine who is by the way also a kind of a hybrid,and who fights constantly the daemons,kills creatures of Hell and evil hybrids who take advantage of their force of influence on the Earth...this Constantine is dying of lung cancer!It's not Satan that is killing him-it's a cigarette.

Tilda Swinton as Arch Angel Gabriel was great! ""Lou"" was funnier than hell! Literally! After all he's been in hell forever, he must have a sense of humor by now!"
"dzimpact","7","3","19","22 February 2005"," It has its shortcomings but it's still good fun.
","I looked at the reviews for Constantine prior to seeing the movie. I must say that I was a bit less than optimistic about how good the movie was going to be. To my surprise, I liked it.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the role of John Constantine. He is a man who has been to hell and returned to earth with the knowledge that he is damned. Rachel Weisz plays the role of Angela Dodson, an intuitive cop who always seems to know where the bad guys are. The two come together when Angela's sister dies in an apparent suicide and Angela gets the help of Constantine to find out if it was truly a suicide or if it was murder.<br/><br/>Constantine is far from flawless but what it does right, it does very well. One could forgive the holes in the plot and a strange animated movement that Keanu Reeves makes every time he shuts the lid on his lighter. The movie's faults don't seem so bad when you notice that you're having fun watching the movie. The interaction between its characters is interesting and the overall look of the film goes back and forth from exotic to spooky.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine, did a fine job considering that this is his first major motion picture. Prior to this he has directed music videos including those of Britney Spears and Aerosmith. One could say that sometimes it takes a fresh perspective such as that of a music video director to add some new light to the theatrical movie scene. Oddly enough, his road is quite similar to that of Russell Mulcahy when he directed the original Highlander back in the 80's. Incidentally, I liked Highlander as well.<br/><br/>There will always be little things that anyone can say to put down a movie such as this one but after watching countless mind numbingly boring movies as of late, it's nice to finally see something that I enjoyed. I also liked the little bonus that is given after the credits."
"JimD73","7","3","19","21 February 2005"," For Something This Early In The Year, Constantine Is Probably Worth Your Time
","Another dark comic book movie? After the mediocre Daredevil and the terrible Hellboy, I wasn't sure about this. However, this had the whole fire-and-brimstone thing going for it, and I am always a sucker for that. However, due to the poor luck of this genre, I had mediocre expectations. Was Constantine a mediocre movie? Plot: 16/20: John Constantine (Reeves) has seen hellliterally. He died after committing suicide and was brought back. He sees demons and angels, and whenever a demon breaks the balance by using more than influence against humans, he deports them back to hell. Apparently, God and Lucifer made a wager to see who could take in more souls, heaven or hell. They are not allowed to force anyone, just influence, and only half-breeds of angels or demons, who, to the untrained eye, are the same as normal people, are allowed to walk amongst humans. During an exorcism, Constantine finds a demon attempting to escape, which worries him that hell may be attempting some mischief. Around the same time, Constantine also finds out his chain-smoking has given him lung cancer and he is dying.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Detective Angela Dodson (Weisz) is investigating her twin sister's apparent suicide, though she doesn't believe her sister, a devout Catholic and someone who claimed to be able to spot demons, would have committed suicide. Of course, the two stories intertwine, as Angela receives a vision telling her to find Constantine, who decides to help her, as they unravel a demonic conspiracy. Also, in Mexico, a scavenger has found the Spear of Destiny, has been granted superpowers and is on his way to the States.<br/><br/>Well, it gets a little more in depth than that, but that kinda sums up the beginning. I guess the plot isn't great, and there are some loose ends and holes, but it holds up pretty well and is filled with that religious irony we all expected. It throws a few twists, and the visit at the end is great, but the plot becomes somewhat convoluted and twisted near the end, and is overall predictable. It brings more good than bad, however.<br/><br/>Action: 13/20: Constantine, much like Hellboy, isn't all about the action. Unlike Hellboy, when we do get some action, it is a real treat. The scene near the end involving Constantine barrelling through a room of demons, which many have dismissed as silly, I found to actually have payoff and be a visual treat. The lack of action is apparent, and some scenes seem as if their sole purpose is to fill the void, ending up feeling a little forced. One particular scene involving a beetle demon just seems there to kill time. When you look at it after it's all done, it really doesn't have enough, but what we are given is pretty good.<br/><br/>Special Effects: 19/20: The effects here are great. The half-breed demons look appropriately goopy, while the full demons are decomposed and burnt, really looking like they've been through hell. The angels aren't really too distinguished aside from the wings, which look believable enough. The only time the effects fail is one scene involving Balthazar (Rossdale), which seems too CGI for it's own good. Overall, great effects.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/20: Surprisingly, Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) is pretty good here. Sure, he's still stoned out of his mind, but it fits the role. Most of the rest of the cast overacts, especially Weisz (The Mummy). LeBeouf (Holes) has almost exactly the same role he had in I, Robot as the young sidekick who doesn't get any respect from his superior, which seems to be his niche these days. Like I, Robot as well, LeBeouf's character gets little screen time (granted, he gets some). Finally, Peter Stormare (Armageddon) has a good appearance as Lucifer. Most of the cast overacts or isn't used or explored enough, so I can't give it a good mark for acting, even if Keanu fits for once in his career.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 17/20: In the end, Constantine is a pretty good time-killer. It probably won't get you to think much after it ends, but it does what it set out to do and proves to be a worthwhile movie to see this early in the year.<br/><br/>Total: 74%: Not incredible, but better than Hellboy and Daredevil. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an action fix this early in the year, though I am very split on this one. It had a decent plot, great effects and, when it got to it, good action, but the action wasn't prominent enough and the acting was mediocre at best. Still, it's worth a look, though unless this really catches your eye, maybe wait for a rental."
"ballena","7","3","19","21 February 2005"," Reeves was perfect
","A lot of viewer comments reflect a severe dissatisfaction of Keanu Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine. I have to say that I thought he was excellent in the role. The story was taken from the comics, so it's not supposed to be ""Passion of the Christ"". Parts of it are a wee bit cornball, but Keanu seemed real in the role of Constantine, kind of like a Bogart turned exorcist. The zippo thing might have worn a little thin, but it was obviously an extension of his manhood. The other actors did well also, and the demons were nothing short of endearing. I am a horror movie buff, and I did not think this movie predictable in the least. It is a legitimate thriller and I would recommend it for ages 12 and above."
"evangeline","10","3","19","21 February 2005"," Moody and very well paced.
","I am really annoyed by the comic book ""fans"" bitching and moaning- hell, if you can look at drawings and read captions on a piece of paper and enjoy it, a film should be that much more of an experience. What is even more taxing to listen to is people's disappointment on how they perceive this should look like- well, EVERYBODY has different ideas of what a fantasy world should look like, yours is hardly the only relevant one.<br/><br/>I had never heard of the comic book, nor do I think that should make any difference- the film is it's own work of art. <br/><br/>I liked the mood, the slow development of the story-it unfolds like a dream- it felt so very different from the chunky, shoot'em up action of every single Hollywood film I have seen lately. I liked everybody's acting, especially the Devil- he was delightful. (Keanu was excellent as well, very much not ""Neo"" as I read here and there- let The Matrix be already)<br/><br/>This actually might be one of the better films I have seen in a while."
"emily-134","7","3","19","20 February 2005"," Based on comic books, it's not epic, but definitely interesting.
","I have to admit I was really excited to see this movie when it came out. I couldn't wait! So, I read the book that was based on the movie first. I'm glad I did, because I was able to understand a lot easier, and explain some unexplained things in the movie to the friends who went with me. You might consider seeing it twice, or reading the book, if you had trouble catching everything.<br/><br/>I think it was kind of a gutsy film to make because of the subject matter - does not mesh even with every Christian belief out there. So, I imagine a few audiences will not remember that it is a work of fiction. Also, it shows pretty much every actor how they would look at their physical worst. Constantine's pale, Angela's crying, Beeman's got bugs all over him, etc. Not that this is bad, just gutsy.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, I thought. I mean, really, is it possible to portray hell (since we don't exactly know how it looks) in a way that will really make people cringe? Soldier demons were a little Gollum-esque, but I got over that.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie a lot. It was different, and I like a fresh story. There were only a couple things that bothered me: - The background and relationships of the characters to each other was not explained enough.<br/><br/><ul><li>To me, Satan was not that believable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The book that was BASED on the movie was better than the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>Forgiving that, go see it.

"T1Thousand","7","3","19","20 February 2005"," Hell Wants Him, Earth Needs Him, Film Lacked Him
","Heaven won't take Constantine. WE should take the movie though and leave the lame ones of this genre behind. Many films having to do with supernatural forces, demons, angels, the occult, etc all attempt to be something original and interesting but fail. Some examples include Lost Souls and the prequel to the Exorcist. But this movie gives us something a little different. It has a good concept--a doomed man exorcising demons on earth to get his way into heaven. That is only a tad of the story--there is more to it that kept me quite entertained and waiting to see what would happen next. It is not only brainless action and special effects. I was actually afraid that it would be that way and that the story would be weak. There is a story and it follows through a bit smoothly. There are only a few dull moments where I lost track of what was being said because the dialogue was much too prolonged. But other than that I will say that they did a fair job with this one. It is not awesomely great either; it had its flaws. There are some instances in the movie that was unnecessary and if they were taken in another direction, this would have been better. But as I said before--compared to the other films of this genre--this is one of the better ones fortunately. It has a dark and ominous atmosphere and it puts you through each plane in the film--Hell, Earth, and Heaven. The visuals were very well done for all three of them and transitions through them were good. Added on to that, Constantine is actually an interesting and cool character to put in a movie like this. Hell wants him, Earth needs him, but Film lacked him; and by that I mean that many movies in this category lacked an attention-grabbing lead character...and story for that matter. This one succeeds in those two departments. So if you are a fan of this movie and were able to sit through the mediocre End of Days, then you will like this one. It is one of the better movies of the year so far =) <br/><br/>6.8/10 Stars"
"lancerdragoon","8","3","19","20 February 2005"," Good Movie
","Knowing the subject matter, I was very interested and quite intrigued to see the movie. I, of course, didn't really expect much from it, it being a movie with Keanu in the lead. But I have to say I was blown away by its production. Every angle seemed to have a purpose; all elements (from the start of the movie until the end) played a role in affecting the storyline. In short, it was tight.<br/><br/>There are a few loose ends, yes but the movie's ending was satisfying. And if there are doubts that the movie was a mindless action romp, it can be stifled. In the whole movie, guns and something else that wasn't exactly a gun (won't spoil) were used probably about oh, three times. It feels very nice to see a movie that doesn't rely too much on action scenes since The Matrix.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the movie DOES use a lot of CG Effects, and most of it were pretty convincing. However, if you've seen The Matrix and most action movies after it, then you're bound to be bored by slow-mo effects which the producers of this movie liked to use. I guess it can't be helped, since Keanu's in the lead.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good movie."
"oldgirl","8","3","19","20 February 2005"," fascinating
","I found it an interesting fusion of Catholic theology, folk tradition, and the sort of world-view philosophy most often found in speculative fiction. The cinematography has a gritty film-noir look which, though in color, enhances the morose mood of LA after dark -- plenty of shine,with equal amounts of smoke from the burning ghats. Scenes from Hell were, well, hellish; it was entirely apropos for the very air of Hell to remain in constant swirling motion. The rush and howl of flame and ash evoked the howls of the damned without beating us over the head with it. In keeping with the dark angst of the picture are the little touches of comedy, burnt-embers smuts here and there, and none of them that do not bring forth a round of highly ironic laughter from those in the audience with the wit to understand them. I also liked the dichotomy of the two main characters; cynical Constantine and sincere police detective. Many would have this film operate on firmer, more believable, more familiar ground. Give me the Great Mystery every time -- sometimes it's better to have cinema without complete safety."
"thepharaoh-1","8","3","19","19 February 2005"," Good overall time to watch
","I did now know what to expect, the previews I watched before other movies made it look like it would be worth watching at the theater. I did not know that it was based on a comic book and came out the theater happy with way it was written. I went to see it with a group of people and there were mixed reviews about it. Four out of us 5 said the movie was a good one and should be watched on the big screen. I will buy this when it comes out on DVD. I have to say out of the last 6 movies I have seen and basically blew my money on wastes of time this one actually made up for them. Reeves does a very good job showing good sarcasm and showing he still has a lot left to make good movies.<br/><br/>I give this one a solid 8 out of 10."
"gabbi_5","6","3","19","17 February 2005"," A look into heaven & hell
","Keanu does a great job playing John Constantine, a man who tries to save mankind from demons, half-breeds, and should eaters. The movie also stars Rachel Weisz, who portrays a police detective with her own motives to help Constantine. Constantine has the ability to see things behind every wall & window, but in his quest to save the salvation of mankind, he doesn't prove to me he is any type of hero. The movie wasn't as dark and sci-fi as I expected it to be. It gives us a nice portrayal of what L.A. could really look like, but then again in reality it isn't what we want. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially those ""Keanu fans,"" it is definitely worth seeing."
"geoffj-1","6","3","20","25 February 2005"," A simplified view...
","I have learned long ago not to expect a comic book-turned-movie to be (necessarily) like the comic book. And so, if you are a fan of the Hellblazer rag, you may not find this film as deep or as detailed as you might have become accustomed. This film however, freed of the continuity baggage of the comic, presents a believable glimpse into a man's life of divine sarcasm. You see, he doesn't have faith because he knows the truth about heaven and hell. Yet, without faith, the theological elevator can only go down in the end. This is the dichotomy: he is revered for what he knows about the balance of heaven and hell...but his knowledge ensures he will never reach redemption. With all of the ""shocker"" films coming out this time of year, Constantine DOES have the depth which will keep audience members talking long after the credits have rolled. And keep an eye on the brief performance of Peter Stormare as Lucifer...brilliant. A perfect movie for people who spent many a night at college discussing religion."
"thorsten-tewksbury","7","3","20","19 February 2005"," From one of the books which started it all...Occult Thriller
","In the 90s lots of stuff emerged from graphic-novels like HELLBLAZER (from which this movie was made) and role-playing (KULT). You could say: Hellblazer is for Comics, what NEAR DARK is for Vampire Movies. Or Anne Rice for Vampire Novels: A fresh disrespectful approach in their own time. By now the ""adult-occult-thriller-genre"" has spawned lots of other movies and Comics like PROPHECY with Christopher Walken. So this is the ""original"" thing, but it's late, and its not that bad, if you know what to look for... . And its made BEAUTIFUL. Of course a movie has to place more into dynamics instead of Text and Inside-Jokes. But it gets the allover feeling. DO THIS: Read some Hellblazer-Graphic-Novel before going to the movies (HARD TIME or DANGEROUS HABITS) and you get more out of the movie. Without read before, it's like Lord of the Rings without Tolkien in the Background: You don't get the half of it. Always remember: the Movie is more than a comic book, it very often pictures the mythology of a whole genre (like the Lord of the Rings-Movies , like Matrix) and this is about the 90's occult stuff: From NEIL GAIMANs The Book of Magic (where Harry Potter originates together with Constantine, yes) over Garth Ennis PREACHER and of course to HELLBLAZER."

","For what it was trying to accomplish, I thought this movie was terrific. The few ""you're trying too hard"" lines - not from Keanu, mind you - worked well with the intentional tongue-in-cheek lines and Keanu giving the devil the finger even as he was being pulled into Heaven momentarily towards the end. The scenes in hell are great, the CG not overdone for such a film, the plot never fell apart, the role of Midnight - as the neutral character with a club where half-breeds go to turn water into wine for fun - was great, and the wooden Reeves was perfect... but then I was never a fan of this particular comic for those of you who think someone like James Marsters might been better for the role. Peter Stormare was a great Satan, too. Nice nod to Keanu's matrix fans with the bluish-greenish color filters - but it doesn't feel feel 'matrixy' (matrixesque?). I thoroughly enjoyed it considering the choices I had at the box office (my first chance to get to a movie in months). If you go, stay after the credits for a one-minute mediocre epilogue."

It was also a treat to find a few more subtleties and nuances in the script than might be anticipated. Lots of nice supporting performances, too. I was especially fond of Peter Stomare.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see that new (?) director Francis Lawrence jumped the learning curve and avoided the typical shortcomings of directors recruited from the music video arena. The movie's flow is quite good, the build-up to the movie's climax satisfactory and there are a few nice surprises saved for the end. Thankfully there's not the big revelation that many movies have recently become fond of.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the comic, and are a fan of metaphysical good vs. evil conflicts (with big budget sfx that look great BTW), you'll find a lot to like in this movie."

For Keanu Reeves fans, he is cool and for Rachel Weisz fan, she is beautiful. The supporting cast is impressive. Djimon Hounsou, who cuts such an unforgettable figure in ""The Four Feathers"", unfortunately does not have much to do as the enigmatic Midnite. Tilda Swindon, who is sensational in ""Young Adam"", has just a little more as the not-your-usual angel Gabriel. Peter Stormare, who plays the slightly mysterious Clifford in ""Birth"", gives us a very interesting version of Lucifer.

","""John Constantine"" (Keanu Reeves) is a man who was born with a gift in which he can see angels and demons as they walk upon the earth. Regrettably, not quite prepared for this unexpected ability and with nobody he can turn to for help, he subsequently commits suicide and his soul is sent to Hell. As luck would have it, however, he is allowed to live again provided that upon his return he helps keep the delicate balance between angels and demons there on earth. In simpler terms, there can be only so many angel and demon ""half-breeds"" who are allowed on earth and those who violate certain rules have to be sent back to where they came from-by deadly force. But then one day things take an immediate turn for the worse when John realizes that he may be the only person who can keep the world safe from a very powerful demon intent upon breaking the barrier and setting up his own kingdom there on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good potential but it suffered from an uneven plot which became more bizarre and ridiculous as time went on. It's almost as if the writers had no clue about Biblical scripture or the supernatural and simply made things up as they went along. Be that as it may, in spite of the rather absurd story-line, I suppose this movie was okay for the time spent and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average."

The depiction of the half-breeds, angels, demons and the devil are spot on, in following the tale between heaven, hell and earth. This film is never preachy it doesn't tell us our path, it simply follows the poor bastard Constantine whose path has already been destined.<br/><br/>I got some genuine hide-under-the-covers frights out of it, the music, the performances, the settings... to me it all said Hellblazer. But it also reminded me often of Devil's Advocate, i felt this film stood alongside that one well, climbed far above it in some cases, certainly the mythology of this film is far more in depth and ready to spawn many a sequel. Keanu Reeves is not my Constantine, but his previous dalliances with the Devil, make him well-placed to play this role and bring a bigger audience in.

","I was mildly surprised at how much I liked this film. It moved quickly and an implausible as some of the scenarios were; they made for good digital effects and interesting moments of cinematic tension. (The mirror scene was quite good!) The movie centers on the personal battle of Constantine in his attempt to ""win"" his way into Heaven. He encounters some rather nasty demons and uncovers a sinister plot. Some of the rather odd ways the ""good"" is juxtapositioned with ""evil"" disturbed me. While we see evil in its many splendid forms, we never see good. Indeed God seems to be a rather apathetic being that is less concerned about humanity than the Devil is. There are numerous clichÃ©s in symbolism from Constantine's friend Beeman who is a kind of ""Q"", to the medium of water as a spiritual conduit. I think the best part of this film is the back-story. The Spear of Destiny, the hanging jars in Beeman's room, the origin of all the artifacts in Midnight's collection and the intriguing idea that we are really nothing more than tally marks in the battle of two supreme beings' contest."

","To many of the left wing, liberal media and population, this movie may represent everything wrong with religion, Catholicism, and the right-wing Republican ideals in America today. However, I believe that this movie with all its theological references and great special effects was very entertaining. John Constantine (Reeves) has a great, dark sense of humor that makes you laugh at times, but the moment is gone in a second for the audience knows that this movie is far from a comedy. Filled with dark, depressed images and references, this movie hits deep within each person in the audience. No matter what race or religion, every person has experienced and/or heard of the history and past of the Catholic religion. This movie takes the mysticism of religion and the legends of the bible and turn them into reality.<br/><br/>If you want to know more, go and see for yourself. And another thing, stay for the credits, for a major scene immediately follows them."

","This movie had moments to enjoy, but was mostly lifeless and cryptic overall.<br/><br/>I've always believed Keanu Reeves to be one of Hollywood's worst actors (along with the likes of Kevin Costner perhaps?), and this film definitely proved my hypothesis. Keanu Reeves is basically Keanu Reeves in this picture. He talks as though he is stuck in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and does nothing more than speak the lines as if he is reading them from a cue card. The only standout performance was from Djimon Hounsou, who played Midnight.<br/><br/>Much of the plot didn't even make any sense. Without attempting to sound pretentious, I saw this movie at a preview at a prestigious university, and most of us came out of the film shrugging our shoulders-- What just happened? I'm guessing that many will have the same experience. Some of the lines were inaudible, and the ending seemed like the writers didn't know where to go with the movie, so just randomly summed it up in the last 10 min.<br/><br/>Some redeeming qualities were that the effects were quite interesting, although at points it seems like the effects were just to show they could to them--rather than a vehicle to tell the story. There were also a few suspenseful parts that made the audience gasp.<br/><br/>This movie might be worth watching just for effects sake, but don't expect another Matrix."
"Coventry","6","4","33","27 February 2005"," From pitch black class to pure camp!
","I'm always up for a story about that handles about demons and darkness, so I was pretty enthusiast in anticipating this ""Constantine"". It's the third comic book adaptation in row that centers on a anti-hero (after ""Hellboy"" and ""The Punisher""), men that are really not too keen on the supernatural powers they developed or were born with. John Constantine is a sinister private eye, capable of whooping demon-butt back to the depths of hell. His duty is to keep an eye on ""halflings"", beings that attempt to cross over the borders of heaven, hell and earth. When Constantine is approached by police woman Angela Dobson for help concerning the strange suicide case of her twin sister, they slowly discover that Satan's son is preparing his arrival on earth. Many people around this website seem to hold a grudge against Keanu Reeves but I really liked him in this role. The ""you-don't-like-it-go-to-hell"" attitude really suits him! Unlike many other 'critics' here, I really enjoyed the first hour of ""Constantine"" as it features a constantly ominous atmosphere, sublime black humor and even a few efficient and impressive shock moments (the cows!!). The images of hell, or simply the use of special effects in general, is well considered and very compelling while the interactions between Reeves and fellow unearthly creatures often leads to terrific kitschy fun. Unfortunately, but almost evidently, director Lawrence can't keep up this quality-level and the film sinks deep towards the worthless camp section. The twists then become more ridiculous, the cheese factor increases and the effects become more and more flamboyant. The only real aspect to enjoy during the second hour is a glorious OTT appearance by Peter Stormare (Fargo, 8mm) as Lucifer. ""Constantine"" sure isn't the turkey many people here claim it to be, but by no means it's an essential milestone, neither."

","OK, first of all, I am a HUGE comic book fan. I am overjoyed about the fact that so many Books are making it to the screen. Constantine was not word perfect to the comic book, admittedly. But, look at it this way: the movie had enough of a plot, and a good enough cast to make it to the movies in the first place. And, I thought Reeves did a pretty good job in his part. He got the character down perfect. And, for once, he didn't act like a stoner/philosopher. <br/><br/>I am amazed at how much backlash this movie got from hardcore comic book fans. From the standpoint of a pure movie critique, X-Men wasn't that great of a film. But, it did what no one else had done since the Batman Miasma of the 90s. It opened up the forum of comic book characters for a wider audience. Now, more people know about Hellblazer than ever before. And, as far as John being from LA instead of London: A.) WHO CARES?! and B.) It's an American made movie. Of course we are gonna Americanize it. Deal with it. I was entertained, the special effects were great, the dialog was good, and I enjoyed the movie. Be glad it made to the screen you nay-saying ninnies!"

"dunmore_ego","3","1","4","9 August 2011"," Inconstantine.
","Beautifully shot in ocher tinge, evoking a mythopoeic superstructure, striking cinematography accentuating iconic imagery and mellifluous art direction, it's a pity CONSTANTINE is such an insensate, half-headed dog of a film.<br/><br/>This movie was better when it was called THE MATRIX.<br/><br/>Traversing between two parallel dimensions, Neo - I mean, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves, kickin' it arctic cool, by way of Eastwood's Stranger and Ren & Stimpy) is some kind of secular exorcist, a border patrol for illegal demons trying to cross over into our dimension. Since there are already enough evil acolytes walking the Earth - they're called priests - Constantine routes these aliens with extreme prejudice, utilizing rules and laws that have no basis in any mythology.<br/><br/>That's the problem with movies of this ilk. No rules. The definition of ""inconstant"" is ""likely to change frequently without apparent or cogent reason."" Visually elegant, yet irrelevant.<br/><br/>But then, how can it be expected to adhere to rules when its source material is more contradictory and confused than a whore crying rape - the Bible? Simultaneously exhorting us to love our enemies, then enjoining Joshua ""to destroy all that breathes as the Lord God of Israel commanded"" (Joshua 10:40).<br/><br/>Bring the kids.<br/><br/>The writers of the comic book that CONSTANTINE is based on, Hellblazer (Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis), cannot be wholly blamed for CONSTANTINE's befuddlement, as screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello consolidated this tale from many Hellblazer episodes.<br/><br/>The first demon we encounter enables a young girl to walk up walls. In the next scene, she is tied to a bed, where Constantine exorcises the demon into a mirror and smashes it, thereby killing the demon. If you're going to possess someone, why possess an underprivileged village girl? Why not a person whom the authorities would find financially impossible or ethically uncomfortable to restrain - like Donald Trump or Tom Hanks? (Some might say Trump is already in league with demons, while others might say Hanks is as well, after seeing THE TERMINAL.) And maybe my mythology is rusty, but I believe the clause that covers disposal of demons via mirrors is right next to the one about ""Let he who is without an expressionless movie hero cast the first stoner.<br/><br/>CONSTANTINE's brouhaha revolves around the Spear of Destiny - a totally fictitious ornament (mentioned in passing only by John 19:34), which somehow gained credence in catholic vernacular as the ""spear that killed Christ."" And whomsoever ""holds the Spear of Destiny holds the fate of the world in his hands."" Reportedly in Hitler's possession at one time, I suppose that accounts for his domination of Western Europe. So what happened in May 1945? He woke up one day and misplaced it? <br/><br/>This Spear is instrumental in birthing the son of the devil - in some contrived plot also found nowhere in any Christian mythologies or apocrypha - where a transgendered angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) betrays god to help the devil's son for a motivation unknown to anyone but the confused screenwriters.<br/><br/>Constantine uncovers this plot by sitting in a chair of special effects straight out of the bible. (Remember that psychic chair that Jesus sat in that one time?) This chair is apparently so dangerous that its owner, Midnite (Djimon Hounsou, dutifully cast as the African witch-doctor stereotype) constantly disallows its use by Constantine. When Constantine eventually uses it and his life is threatened, to escape, he need only call out to Midnite, who wrenches him bodily from the chair. Uh, guess it wasn't that dangerous after all.<br/><br/>Enter Rachel Weisz, as cop Angela Dodson. Her twin sister, Isabel, just committed suicide and is walking through hell in her nightie. As a cop - a person trained to only accept evidence - Angela approaches Constantine with unquestioning, juvenile belief in his ""gift"" of dimensional travel, beseeching him to find her sister and bring a wrap.<br/><br/>Constantine promptly breaches hell by putting his feet in water and staring at a cat. Whilst in hell - which looks like a cross between a Heironymous Bosch painting and Downtown Los Angeles at 2:30 a.m. - Isabel runs from Constantine and some half-headed monsters, who all cluster together like N'Sync for a dynamic photo op.<br/><br/>Constantine brings back Isabel's hospital tag as ""evidence."" Rachel asks, ""How could this be?"" Well, there's this thing called a POCKET which could very easily have hidden that tag until Constantine needed to whip it out and impress your small mind.<br/><br/>What would any dumb American film be without the British Bad Guy? Gavin Rossdale (from Bush - the band, not the criminal public official) plays Balthazar, a smarmy Bond Villain type who meanders about for no reason, who can't be killed by heavy artillery, but cowers under the mighty incantations of Keanu's stoner spells.<br/><br/>A thousand transgressions of non-rules later, we arrive at the movie's conclusion, laden with effects in lieu of excitement, logic and interest. Constantine meets with Satan (Peter Stormare, clad in angelic white, chewing more scenery than Heston on Sinai) and narcs on Gabriel in the next room, who is using the Spear to bring forth Satan's son. Exactly like in the Bible.<br/><br/>Let me get this straight: Satan, omniscient bringer of darkness, doesn't know what is going on in the next room? Directed by Music Video Director to the Sluts, Francis Lawrence (Britney, Janet, J-Lo), the roaring beauty of this movie is tempered by its dangerous stupidities. If audiences could appreciate it as simply an imaginative story, the human race might just survive. Unfortunately, ninety percent of audiences will take it as fact, to be added to their human-penned gospels and already insane mythologies of Christ and hobbits and Islam and space aliens. And as these gullible dupes become the decision-makers in society, billions more murders will be perpetrated for this ""sacred truth"" in a never-ending spiral of ignorance.<br/><br/>Bring the kids."
"rowmorg","3","1","4","8 February 2010"," Nearly 1,000 reviews --- and here's another
","It's extraordinary how religion's purest superstition attracts American audiences. The idea of a permanently burning hell-world just a pill or a shot or a state-of-mind away below the floor is so powerful that hordes of people crowd into cinemas to see the enaction of it. Then hundreds of them go to IMDb actually to write it up. Evidently, a certain level of people have not improved their world outlook since the 15th or 16th centuries, when fiery little sheets and pamphlets first came off the presses, telling of visits to hell, and anthologising the efforts of fictional men like John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).<br/><br/>It's never quite clear what Constantine's vocation or profession or trade is. Some reviewers describe him as a PI, or private investigator. I think that reflects the wildly superstitious audience again. PIs tend to spend most of their time on the internet and telephone, using reams of documents. They'd be in trouble in a world of flames, but ""Hell wants him. Heaven won't take him. Earth needs him,"" according to the movie blurb.<br/><br/>Naturally, Satan, the former angel of light turned devil of the flames, appears in Constantine, and it's not satisfactory, considering that Peter Stormare ""began his acting career at the Royal National Theatre of Sweden"". He was a bit overprepared, perhaps, for the rather poor dialogue (from Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello), and unimaginative directing from rock-video maker Francis Lawrence.<br/><br/>The English dolly-bird Rachel Weisz is a good match for Keanu, because the lines are not that great, the sets suck, and frankly looks do count when all else fails. Mind you, this is US mass cinema and apart from madam there's no sex here at all."
"winner55","4","1","4","14 October 2007"," bloated, with a message from hell
","THis film is really an incredibly long advertisement against smoking cigarettes; but I found it wholly unconvincing, and am puffing away while I write this - delicious! Full-flavored - it satisfies! Which is more than this movie did.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I actually had some fun with this thing's mindless action sequences, which are rather well handled.<br/><br/>But let's be honest: First. Stop spending tens of millions of bucks on comic books. There's way too much money spent on this film, and not enough to cover-up the fact that it is mere B-movie pot-boiler.<br/><br/>And hey, if you're making a B-movie pot-boiler, than it ought to be slick and to the point, with as little dialog as needed. There's nothing more soporific than an over-long B-movie pretending to be ""deep"" or arty or something.<br/><br/>Finally. Although I recognize that the real fault for it lies with the audiences who admire such mush, I am sick and tired of Hollywood's blasphemous trashing of Christianity, all of which only reminds us - shamefully - that most Americans who claim to be Christian haven't the slightest clue as to what their religion is really all about, despite the fact that many are willing to kill Muslims in the name of a Christ they don't understand, and who must be utterly furious at such vicious mockery of all that he taught.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing very clear - Christianity is NOT about any ""battle between good and evil"" (that religion is Manicheism, a derivative of ancient Parsi). It is about redemption, mercy, charity, peace. If it isn't, then it has no more claim to our attention than professional wrestling.<br/><br/>The morality of this film is essentially that of professional wrestling.<br/><br/>And just as an afterthought, let's remark that, while the intentional comic relief of the film falls flat, the dramatic moments are just about funny as hell - and come from some writer residing there, no doubt.<br/><br/>Like a highly polished remake of the old Italian Hercules movies, and just about as much fun for the same reasons."

That is they way your surroundings probably sees you, but luckily most people sees the good heart hidden inside. Keanu Reeves does that excellent.<br/><br/>I fully understand critics that wanted him too perform ""better"", but hey, this is not mac-beth.

"dantown","6","1","4","28 August 2006"," Keanu Reeves leaves the special yellow short-bus of acting
","This is an almost great movie. The world below versus the world above is always a good topic for a movie-if you do it right. Keanu Reeves has almost learned how to act. This is a good idea for a leading man. Keanu is a weathered and sickened extra-spiritual crime-fighter who can see through not only lousy alibis, not only through walls like superman, but can see through the impermeable walls between life and death-and between salvation and damnation. He is Superman times two. Imagine that. He is Superman with warts and all--spiritually. What a great fricken idea! A science fiction movie where all heaven and earth may be torn asunder. Your soul, dear viewer, is thrown onto-gambled- on the roulette wheel of all creation. There's a screenplay! Then there's Tilda Swinton-a miraculous actress-playing angel Gabriel-who tells Constantine: He's F***ked for all eternity! This is real solid journey into story-telling that transforms hell into Earth, and Earth into hell, and churns your stomach at every turn. Peter Stormare as The Devil is intensely vile. His performance is just stark-raving outstanding. All of this movie stretches your capacity to comprehend its sick intelligence and dire beauty. It is a descent into hell. You the viewer barely escape its awful world-view. It has a greatness, but an awful spiritual desolation. As I said: Tilda Swinton is a beautiful artist, as are all the actors in this sickly fascinating fable of spirit and damnation. It is a gigantic creation of weird reality which cannot be easily shaken off. I think Keanu Reeves has finally grown up as an actor. That is not a small thing."

","well, at least they tried it....<br/><br/>what you get is a music video director's feature film debut, and it shows... unlike for example the Scott brothers, who both started at MTV but really showed how to pair visual style with story and likable, strong characters, this mess of a film has a hard time to capture your interest throughout the whole play time.<br/><br/>to start with, most of the casting is nearly perfect, if it was not for Keanu Reeves. He's reprising his lame role from Matrix, where he had 2 facial impressions. that was okay for the role of Neo, but it definitely is NOT okay for a deeply troubled role as Constantine. Ah well... I know it's getting bored to bitch about reeves and his missing acting talents, but here it shows.... badly...<br/><br/>Second, you get a somewhat interesting story and characters, paired with bad dialogue and just missing talent from the director to communicate this to the audience. Hell, I'm writing this as I'm watching Constantine for the third time or so, this is how boring it can get.<br/><br/>All the time I'm watching this with friends, they tell me how ""God's Army/The Prophecy is so much better than this"", and they're right: no CGI, no budget, but a hell of a movie: tense, interesting, compelling.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Constantine had potential, and you can spot it in nearly every minute of the long) running time of app. 115 minutes. But it also makes you angry, because this franchise (remember, it's a comic book adaptation) had lots more potential than this mess.<br/><br/>There are some truly great ideas in the script, you get some really great actors, but when the director doesn't care, you don't get a great movie.<br/><br/>Missed opportunity, but worth watching at least once."

","Hell is coming...taking over people...so why aren't more people running for their lives?<br/><br/>In this movie, Keanu Reeves plays John Constatine, a man who as a child was able to see things that were never meant to be seen. In other words, hell demons. Now as a young man, he's addicted to cigarettes, and makes his teenage friend, Chas Kramer (Shia Labeouf)drive him to locations where demon's are usually found, lurking about. Constantine's introducing scene involves him, trying to save a young girl who's body has been abducted by a demon trying to get out of hell through her. His way of killing this demon? Getting it stuck in a mirror, and throwing it out the window.<br/><br/>Supporting actress Rachel Weisz plays Angela, a detective who's twin sister, Isabel, has recently committed suicide after being in a Phsyc ward. Looking for answers about what happened, (""Isabel would never commit suicide,"" she says) she goes running to Constantine. The corny parts of this movie, are the key parts, more precisely the one scene where a whole bunch of winged creatures attack Weisz and Reeves in the middle of a road, where as nobody else in the street notices a thing. The lines are tacky and confusing, leaving you with a major headache from trying to figure out what language Mr. Constantine is trying to speak. Plus this movie leaves key characters out of the entire middle film, and then suddenly makes them reappear at the end. Also this movie pushes aside the fact that their are other people in the world besides the key characters, and makes it seem as though no one else notices hell eating up the earth.<br/><br/>This story wants to be good real bad, and although has decent special effects, lacks quality acting, and a script that explains what the hell this movie is talking about."
"eched","7","1","4","16 July 2005"," The longest anti smoking ad you will ever see
","Constantine is a man that was given the power to see demons by God so he could keep the balance of good and evil. Apparently God has a bet going with the Devil to see how many souls each of them can get. you know, kind of like how they bet on Jobe (I don't know how to spell his name. Maybe when I got some free time I'll look it up). If you don't know who Jobe was, that's no big deal. I was just giving an example.<br/><br/>Well, anyways, they have this bet and Constantine is there to make sure that nobody cheats. Because of Constantine's bad life he is doomed to burn for all eternity. Now, Constantine figures he can buy his way into Heaven so he goes hunting down the bad guys and then your movie begins.<br/><br/>Keaneu Reeves, aka Neo boy from the Matrix plays Constantine and expect to see some bad acting on his part. He is dieing from lung cancer that he got from smoking. The whole film is turned into an anti smoking ad because of this point by the way. Well anyways, when he starts to cough to illustrate his sickness you can tell he's forcing it. They should have just said he was dieing. His fake coughing only destroys the illusion. But expect to see some darn good acting from Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. Now, I know what you're thinking. Everything ever said about Gabriel has hinted at him being a guy, so you would think that getting a girl to play him would be a big no-no, but it really works well. You see, this incarnation of Gabriel is both male and female, which in a way makes sense because angles wouldn't have sexes. To bad they didn't think this plot point threw and make all the demons the same way. Well, anyways, she/he looks and sounds like a girl but dresses like a man and is talk about as a man. Constantine calls Gabriel a man threw out the film. So, this is a rather creative idea and I must say that Tilda Swinton makes for a darn neat and interesting angel.<br/><br/>Now the good thing about this film is for an action flick it has a very smart and creative plot and a very interesting and well thought out conclusion. It's not your wham bam thank you mam kind of climax. Instead it's a very surprising and well fitting one that just works really well. Not what I was expecting, but I'm darn glad they went with it.<br/><br/>As most of todays action flicks go, expect to see some bad CGI, but it's never painful. The film makes up for it with its creativity.<br/><br/>So, some bad acting from the star, but because this is a surprising intelligent film, and because of good old Gabriel (I hope she gets more acting roles) I'm going to give this film high marks. 7 out of 10. For an action flick this is pretty good.<br/><br/>P.S. God has really got to do something about his gambling problem."
"quark42","9","1","4","11 July 2005"," Ultramodern yet stylish
","Constantine is the greatest dark thriller to be released in the last two or three years. This movie had all the action and intrigue as your average carbon-copy CG-intensive production, but its cinematography and pacing gave it the overall feel of a Wachowski, John Woo, Ridley Scott, or even David Fincher film.<br/><br/>Movies based on comic books have a wide range of potential. The still-life panel dialogs can either lend themselves to two-dimensionality or conceptual brilliance, depending how they are directed. Constantine is at the high-concept end of the spectrum, with well-conceived, well-composed, and well-edited scenes that ultimately make no judgment about the true nature of the afterlife.<br/><br/>Despite the Keanu stigma, which has been essentially obsolete since Point Break, every actor in this film delivered a first-class performance. The writing didn't come from Shakespeare, but neither did the script from Star Wars. The actors obviously believed in what they were delivering, which encourages the audiences to do the same. The casting could not have been better, down to the selections of ""Gabriel"" and ""Satan."" Everyone and everything contributed to the dark and foreign atmosphere that this picture delivered.<br/><br/>There are two camps of people who have seen Constantine -- those who loved it, and those who hated it. This fact alone should be justification for checking it out. Those interested in cinematography will get an eyeful."

","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz So, how long has it been since our boy Keanu did the Matrix movies? Couple years, right? Well folks, his acting skills have not exactly improved much in that short amount of time. All the same, I don't think he's as horrible as everyone else seems to think. Sure, he's not great, but there are MANY people who are far worse. Anyway, on to the review.<br/><br/>John Constantine (Reeves) is a man who has been to Hell and back. Literally. As the tagline says, ""Hell wants him, heaven won't take him, earth needs him."" Constantine is stuck on this planet sending demons back to Hell. Basically, he's an exorcist, plus a little bit more.<br/><br/>Then a woman (Weisz) comes to him with an interesting case about a girl who seems to have committed suicide. One particularly interesting thing about the case is that before she jumped off the building, she said Constantine's name. Odd? Perhaps. The girl is Angela's (Weisz) sister, and Angela desperately wants to discover the truth about her death, because as a devout Catholic, she believes her sister's soul would be going straight to Hell if it was a suicide.<br/><br/>This movie isn't terribly huge on plot. Were you really expecting it to be if it's starring Keanu Reeves? I mean, c'mon, the guy can't exactly act terribly well. However, despite the fact that EVERYBODY on IMDb is bashing our boy Keanu for his shoddy acting, I don't find it to be all that bad, and for the most part, in this movie, it worked.<br/><br/>The movie is a very interesting and very twisted journey through Christianity from a Catholic perspective. It raises questions about the reality of good and evil forces existing in our world as we know it. Are Satan and God really sparring here on Earth? Is this the battleground of the supernatural realm? Maybe.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are pretty good, the acting is okay from some people (particularly those who have a lead role) and exceptional from others, like Rachel Weisz. I'd go watch it in the theater again, because I thought it was a pretty cool ride.<br/><br/>Just don't expect to have to think much.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)"
"Streebo","7","1","4","8 April 2005"," Constantine between comics and movies, heaven and hell....
","We find ourselves at the gates of Hell for this one. And our guide is none other than Mr. ""Woah..."" himself...Keanu Reeves! This is the cinematic adaptation of the Hellblazer comic starring Alan Moore's enigmatic and esoteric oculist, John Constantine. <br/><br/>Conatantine is a breath of fresh air in an overly stale horror wave of the last month. <br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/ <br/><br/>John Constantine is an occult detective of sorts that spends his time confronting demons and devils in an attempt to maintain some karmic-like balance of good and evil on the prime material plane of Earth. <br/><br/>I have always liked the Constantine character because of his cloak of mystery and his apparent willingness to confront any Demonic power or Ancient Alien God without any apparent powers of his own. He seemed like a rough edged detective that was never afraid to confront beings that should have crushed his soul between their toes, but he always seemed to find a way to come out on top. <br/><br/>In case you're so dense (or my writing is too obtuse) that you haven't figured out that I'm a comic fan boy from way back , then I'll point it out for you. I'm a fan boy. And I loved this film. <br/><br/>Yes I had to forget that Constantine was supposed to be British and look like the rocker, Sting. Once I did that, I was able to sit back and enjoy Keanu's stone-faced interpretation of the mystical walker between worlds. I mean in you think about it, a rumpled tan trench coat would look awfully boring on screen. <br/><br/>I felt the film had the right blend of action and horror to make it a truly enjoyable experience. The CGI in the film is the best on screen in years and the storyline of a man caught between heaven and hell was completely engrossing. <br/><br/>I felt that if the film had focused more on subtlety and less on CGI in various places, that it could have been an absolute classic. As it is, the CGI is used properly and there is enough tension and dread to bring some horrific moments to the surface from time to time. <br/><br/>I thought the filmmakers did an excellent job of mixing all of the elements to make a truly enjoyable modern detective cum exorcist Gothic horror. <br/><br/>This was the first horror film since Saw that actually entertained me throughout the entire film and left me feeling that I got my money's worth. <br/><br/>FYI - The apotheosis of the Constantine character came in the Books of Magic by Neil Geiman. He is in a mystical club filled with every demonic power and evil archmage this side of the Abyss. Constantine is guarding young Tim Hunter, a teenager with the potential to become the greatest mystic the universe has ever seen. Every demonic Prince and their Legions of Cults are looking for Tim Hunter to rip his throat out. Just as every malevolent beast in the club turns and surrounds the hapless Tim Hunter we hear the flick of a lighter. The club turns as one and looks upon the trench coat wearing John Constantine as he lights a cigarette. Constantine looks calmly out into the gathered hordes and says; <br/><br/>Quote: ""Nobody touches that boy. <br/><br/>That's right. The boy's mine. And in thirty seconds, me, and him, and the witch are going to walk out of here. <br/><br/>You know who I am. Or you ought to. <br/><br/>You know my reputation. Now... <br/><br/>Does anyone here really want to start something?"" <br/><br/>The demons part like an unholy Red Sea and allow the trio of heroes to leave unscathed. And Constantine never does anything other than light a cigarette. Brilliant! <br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the film and think you should take it under consideration. And if you enjoyed the film , go buy all of ALan Moore's issues of Swamp Thing (where Constantine first appeared) and The Books of Magic by Neil Geiman. The Hellblazer series is pretty decent with the best stories coming from writers Garth Ennis and Brian Azarrello. <br/><br/>overall grade: B+/A-. <br/><br/>OK, freaks, my sixty seconds are up. Let's all go run outside and howl at the moon. <br/><br/>Peace."

I couldn't say the same for Djimon Hounsou's role as Midnite. It's probably not all his fault. It wasn't an easy one. <br/><br/>Angel Gabriel and Lucifer could and should be left out in this movie. Their addition to the film is a reduction of the potential thrills that the movie has. It just makes the film look kind of ridiculous. <br/><br/>The main thing I kind of resent this film is the way it handles it's main issue. I don't' know the comic book, but the film would have been so much better if it would be less direct and more mystical or even a bit ""careful"" about handling a theme that from the start isn't all that convincing.

However after I had gathered my senses a little, i began to take in the full strength, brilliance and creative insight of this film. As a religious person, such graphic and poignant images and perceptions of hell and the nature of God were beyond disturbing to me. I knew it would be a film that stayed with me forever, and it is not often I feel this way about a film that is not directed by Tim Burton. However, saying this there are elements of normality and human nature in the film, that are not entirely veiled by the movies black tint.For example, the relationship that develops between Reeves and Weisz is endearing, and Reeves' struggle to find himself after hearing the news that he is terminally ill will keep the average movie-goer intrigued.

","right, so we're left with a disingenuous, watered down script with an American actor as Constantine, a mangled mi sh mash of story arcs from Hellblazer (yes they are there if you look), and a vacuum of storytelling. All wrapped up in some of the most visually stunning demonology and magics you might ever see go past puritanical US censors.<br/><br/>I love the Hellblazer comics, but before I started to watch Constantine I had to remind myself that this wasn't made for me, in fact, it was made despite me. If you can accept that, it opens up a new way of looking at the film, and you can savour the cheap visual thrills it has to offer. If it makes even 1 person go out and start collecting Vertigo comics it'll have done something good."
"DarkJedi2008","7","2","13","5 March 2005"," Disappointed, but it's still above average.
","I was surprised, to say the least, that Reeves would choose to do another semi-religious picture straight after the Matrix, as the two parts (Anti-Hero, World under the world, etc. etc.) are almost the same. I was interested in the film from the start, the promising TV spots and trailers supported that. Well, finally got to see it today, and I have a mixed signal. It's disappointing, yes, but it also has a lot of high points. It's flawed, but complete. Interesting, but incredibly boring.<br/><br/>Alright, the premise of the film is all over the place. God and Satan have had a wager for the souls of mankind, a real time bet. There are rules. Neither angles or demons can directly make a human do something, but they are allowed to push them in one direction by merely speaking to them subconsciously, but ultimately, not make them do anything by force. Reeve's Character, John, has been seeing this battle since birth. He killed himself at a young age, was sent to Hell, but sent back, to be a medium between the two. He makes sure the demons who do to much on Earth stay in Hell. It's a pretty odd job, even a blessing to see these things, but John does it all for selfish reasons. After twenty years of all of this, he has never trusted in God, nor gave any real thanks to him. He knows all of it is true, but doesn't believe in it. He'll do this work, but he won't give his heart over to God. That's his downfall. In Constantine's world, taking one's life sends us to Hell no matter what, Christian or not. So, since John's already been to Hell for this sin, he's going to go back there. In his mind, perhaps, if he sends enough demons to Hell, he'll earn his way into God's kingdom. To the film's credit, it does show very clearly God's way of salvation. The gospel is presented (By Faith, not by works) as great, and the only way. Perhaps that's the only real quality of the film that seems to match up with the Bible. Don't take me wrong. I never expected this film to be accurate, and honestly, it's not trying to be. It's a spiritual thriller at heart, but it's covered in so much Holy Water and Jesus Bullets that it's hard to take any of it seriously. These aspects don't offend me of course, but from any perspective, it simply takes away from any emotional effect the film would have.<br/><br/>Well, the rules have been broken. Satan's demons are coming to Earth to destroy all of mankind. Not fun. So, now John must save the world...Did you really expect much more? The first half of the film is very well done. It has great atmosphere, and never really seems to come away from it. John's sarcastic and hateful, but likable. Even the spiritual aspects are presented in a good way, whether they're accurate or not. The film does start to slide though, as it tries to create so many subplots, to the point where the audience just stops caring. Oh, she's my twin...Oh, Satan's son is coming back...Oh, John's friend dies...I was not really interested in any of it. It seems like I'm simply listing the bad aspects of the film, but there are a lot of redeeming qualities. Like it or not, Reeves does a good job. Well, at least, the best he could. He's not really much of an actor, he has the same emotion and expression in every movie he does. Yet, he's right for the role. Sadly, Rachel Weisz brings all of her character down. Whatever was interesting about her on paper is now completely destroyed. Shia LaBeouf is the only really good aspect here, and a lot of me wishes he was in more of the film alongside John rather than Weisz. Oh well. Directing is rather well done, cinematography is a big highlight, as well as the special effects. Though it had it's flaws, the movie kept me interested to the point where I was wondering what would happen in the next few minutes. Well, after seeing White Noise, anything could keep my interest.<br/><br/>The ending was great, yet, Satan's appearance brought down a lot of it. Sure, you want to be ironic. Satan is really just a hick. That's wonderful. Just, make it to a point where I can see the irony, not just a stupid plot tool. This was the film's biggest weakness. Satan. He's not scary. He's not ironic. He's not funny...He's just...uninteresting. The film was good, though. I was entertained. Something I would pick up on DVD to give another go around. However, wait for DVD."

","I can't understand just why everyone insists on attacking this movie left right and centre. I'll admit even I'm ashamed to admit to liking a Keanu Reeves movie under normal circumstances- but you almost feel people slate this just because it's not 'ok' to like anything he's in.<br/><br/>His passive acting style actually rather lends itself to this character because he's just a little bit arrogant, and I think it's nice to see Keanu really acting for once. It's a role that fits.<br/><br/>Naturally Weisz is excellent ( when is she not?) pulling out a great emotional performance and the supporting cast ( including surprisingly creepy Gavin Rossdale and hauntingly androgynous Tilda Swinton as Gabriel) were all nothing short of brilliant and held this movie together admirably.<br/><br/>Although the plot might not have been wonderful, and might have been a 'dishonour' to the original comic- you just have to admire this movie for what it is. A good enjoyable action movie. The special effects are nothing short of lovely. Since when has it been a crime to have a movie with good effects?<br/><br/>I found it entertaining and enjoyable. Give this movie a chance, it's nothing like as bad as they insist it is."
"michael-broughey","7","2","14","26 February 2005"," Not an original concept, but well done, even Keanu showed some life.
","Fans of comic book lore might have seen this release coming and based on Keanu's ""style"" of acting and the character from the comic books itself, could have guessed his casting for this movie as well. After all, it's the same production company(Warner Bros./Village) that already has models of Keanu from the Matrix to use in the CG scenes. I don't know where you critics get the idea that the effects are bad, demons are represented in ghoulish detail and the visions of Heaven and Hell are sights to behold, if nothing else gives you a kick from this flick, the effects will. Now onto Keanu, who gave his most vigorating performance since ""Speed"". The scene where he reads Gavin Rossdale's character's last rites is a sight to behold coming from a somewhat bland actor. (Whether his absentmindedness facilitated the role of ""The One"" in the Matrix or not is questionable, but changing the lead character between installments in a trilogy is frankly, terrible for the movie's overall success,(Speed 2) the Wachowski brothers didn't have many options and this seems to be the case with ""Constantine."") I know I'm not with the crowd on this one, but the movie is a solid action/thriller held together by Rachel's highly involved performance. Maybe Keanu learned a few things from her along the way...<br/><br/>P.S. The devil being represented as a tattooed man in a scruffy white suit was an excellent choice by the writers."

","Absolute crap. Cod theology (plus a camp Lucifer) for 9-year-olds and others who haven't yet got to grips with joined-up writing (i.e. readers of graphic novels). Constantine has a dumb storyline, warmed-over CGI effects, a Jewish actress playing tormented twin Catholic sisters, and Keanu Reeves giving another of his wooden performances. Think of the Exorcist on Valium and you'll get a good idea of this lame movie. It couldn't scare a kitten, but it could certainly bore one. The studio which made this drivel deserves a really good kick up the arse, but I think their accountants will be too busy taking comfort from the old truism that 'nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public' to notice."

He can't smoke a cigarette to save his life. <br/><br/>If a do-gooder whiner American smoking Chinese cigarettes isn't enough, how about him begging god's help and giving up smoking at the end? <br/><br/>Did I mention it was awful?

"tony_p_thompson","7","2","15","27 February 2005"," Hype(rbole) slips off the edge; lacks edge...
","I thought the first Spiderman wasn't nearly as faithful as Spidey2, Punisher was pretty close, Hellboy too, but the cinematography of ""Sky Captain"" was the first to hit the look. And three of these didn't have the type of material that Constantine had to cover. More than a few commenter's hit resonance similar to this assessment: the movie tried to hit a broader audience base than it should have.<br/><br/>I believe this points to script/screenplay issues. But rather than complain, I think this movie did a great job with some odd material, and KR was correctly type-cast.<br/><br/>I liked the movie overall, and in addition to being a good popcorn movie (Italian Job would be a 9 here, LOTR a ten), I think it is done well enough that I'll add it to my DVD collection when it hits the market.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER STUFF *** .. Just like the protagonist in ""The Reluctant Messiah"", KR continues his anti-hero role pattern in Constantine. Knowing this predilection going in, you shouldn't expect a non-normative performance.<br/><br/>This is the first movie that I thought created effects to capture a world of angels and demons in a 'matter-of-fact' manner, and KR did well with merging various superstitious facets along with his Mr. Anderson 'tude. If you're looking for theological or dogmatic traditional adherence, forget about it tho...<br/><br/>With that said, this movie excelled - from my perspective - exploring the concept of alliances and loyalties with callous disregard for order, similar to the study of street-rats versus godfathers explored in Black Rain (for example), and what audacious would be engaged along the rise to power. How the plot was choreographed around this theme also went well.<br/><br/>It was certainly OK to have humans act in accordance with 'free will', but perhaps several elements could have been served better thru better foreshadowing or flashback sequences, particularly the ominous emergence of a second-rebellion of Satan and the issue of suicide, and some better coverage of the roles that angels & demons play in the battle of good versus evil.<br/><br/>The cinematography was pretty reasonable, capturing some moments well, particularly the effects sequences, but languishing in covering moments where character development needed bridging which is where a couple sections lose momentum, about 5-8 minutes each. In casting KR as a 'depressed' individual, this went well I thought. Some of the humor seemed too contrived and not bad-assed enough, which is one place the edge got lost.<br/><br/>Given several exemplary movies in the heaven&hell/alien horror genre, including small screen offerings like ""V"" and the recent 'Passion of the Christ', the movie lacked the level of 'darkness' that might have been possible with a hard R-rating, and this is where the missing edge was most noticeable."
"donnalynn","7","2","15","24 February 2005"," Interesting but drawn out...
","You could've put this into an hour long series, plain and simple. The acting in my opinion was good and that was the only thing other than the special effects that saved it. It was too drawn out and slow. That seemed to be the only draw back to me. I thought they did a really good job at keeping it understandable to an audience. Most movies like this get very theological and most people are going 'huh, what?'. The average person that goes to see a movie like Constantine has the mind depth of a teaspoon. What I really found refreshing was the fact they didn't put Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiz characters together romantically! It would've made the movie worse! However they did have some tension between them and that was all that was needed. I recommend seeing it, but wait till it comes out on video."
"sowhatnowthennext","8","1","5","27 July 2019"," Nice story, strong interaction between characters
","I really liked the sarcastic nature of the Constantine character and his guts in going for the less than noble route to redemption. The characters Gabriel and Satan are fabulously portrayed by Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare and their back and forth dialogue with Constantine is very enjoyable. One thinks they have the upper hand but circumstances shift all the time. Angels and demons and exorcism is nothing new, however the dark undertone portrayed in this movie gives a sense of foreboding. A suspense even. Keanu Reeves does a great job playing cynical, jaded, bitter erm person? Being?
I am not a comic fan so I enjoyed the story on it's own with no expectations."

Instead, when the earlier stages, very dodgy in parts but still, seem to be putting some slabs together, you very quickly find out the dodgy was all there is and the film isn't going anywhere, and it's more cheesy lines about the rules of the film, unlikely weirdo characters popping up and doing their thing.<br/><br/>This could be cut short by saying it actually had potential in its narrative and concept to be genuinely interesting, but instead went exactly the other way from that. Embarrassing feature for Reeves, the film-makers probably thought they'd ride the Matrix wave and setup something somewhat similar for/with him and, who knows, get a little lucky maybe ?...with this ?"
"birdieleigh","9","1","5","19 December 2010"," Very cool movie...far, far, better than it is credited to be.
","I am honestly surprised at how many negative reviews for Constantine I've read here, because it is a movie I happen to love. Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Reeves), a contemporary exorcist/supernatural expert with his own personal demons, who helps a cop named Angie (Weisz) investigate her sister's death. It was an apparent suicide but Angie is convinced that her sister, Isabel, wouldn't do that...being that she was devoutly Catholic, and suicide is a top-ten no-go for Catholics. Constantine reluctantly helps her out, with a little help from his friends (Hounsou and LaBeouf), and some meddling from angel or demon ""half-breeds"" (Rossdale and Swinton). The result is something I'd like to call genius, although I guess there are many who would disagree.<br/><br/>The story uses some very, lets say ""creative"", twisting of Catholic doctrine to develop a spiritually tense world where everything is a battle for your soul. No, the theology is not all correct. But it still makes for a very thought-provoking and slightly unconventional look at faith. It isn't every day that you see a film in which the angel Gabriel looks someone in the eyes and says ""you're f--ked."" Needless to say, I was fascinated. The way in which spiritual elements and figures are represented here really impressed me. Let's take hell, for example. The imagery Constantine uses when portraying hell is completely remarkable. The effects in general were very well-done.<br/><br/>As for the characters, which looks to be a sore-spot for many who watched this movie, I didn't see anything wrong. Rachel Weisz was impressively real and believable, and her character gave you someone to really sympathize with. Djimon Hounsou and Shia LaBeouf are always very talented, and it's interesting to watch one of LaBeof's first ""I'm-getting-away-from-Disney"" roles. However, my favorite performances in Constantine are the ones that seem the least noted: Gavin Rossdale as the classy half-breed demon Balthazar and the incredible Tilda Swinton as a complicated half-breed angel Gabriel. Swinton, especially, really shines in her role, even though she isn't on-screen for very long. And what is with all the complaints about Keanu Reeves? His character wasn't lacking in complexity and I could actually watch him without imagining him saying ""excellent!"" (Although I can usually do that...I think he's much more talented in general than people give him credit for).<br/><br/>But don't let me tell you what to think. If you want an entertaining supernatural thriller with an ounce of spooks, cool effects, and a talented cast, check out Constantine. If you don't like it, its not like you'll be going to hell or anything for it."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","5","27 November 2010"," Shelf your hatred of Canoe Reeves and give this underrated flick a chance.
","Over the years Canoe Reeves (Alright Keanu) has gotten a bad wrap. His problem is that he comes across as a bit of a dumb-ass - and perhaps he is - but where his films are concerned it seems that most critics see his name on the poster and immediately think ""rubbish flick"".<br/><br/>In many cases they are spot on (ummm, The Lake House?), but I would argue that Constantine is a notable exception.<br/><br/>Now instead of summarising the plot I'll touch on each of the main actors and how they went in the film. Not sure why I'm doing this, it just feels necessary here.<br/><br/>Canoe – Pessimistic, even fatalistic. Canoe definitely ""puts in"" here and actually has a crack at making the film better.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz – Lends credibility to her role as the troubled Angie. Always gives the right degree of ""I can't believe this sh*t is happening"", and acts logically when needed.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton – Casting genius as Gabriel the androgenous Angel. I can't think of anyone that looks less like a male or female - but still appearing human - without surgery. She is also very effective in the role.<br/><br/>Shia LeBouf – Should just f'n die. Why does Hollywood think he should be in every movie that they make when he has such an obvious personality deficiency? Gavin Rossdale – Mr Hollaback ""I was in Bush"" (the crappy British band kids!) himself is generally loathsome in reality, but he doesn't bring shame to the house Stefani built here as a demon.<br/><br/>Peter Stormare – Hams it up to the hilt, but necessarily so.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou – Lends a bit more credibility to a role that could have come out all Robin Williams-like.<br/><br/>So why would I bother putting the above in when it has nothing to do with the film? Because without that I would just be describing a film in which the lead character is trapped in a battle between good and evil, with Keanu Reeves as the good guy, Shia LeBouf as his sidekick and the guy from Bush as one of the bad guys No way in hell that I would want to watch that based upon that info! But Constantine is actually quite good, it is dark as comic book heroes should be, (as Hollywood has finally learned with the Batman reboots and many others), it has the theological element that I am a sucker for, and it takes itself just seriously enough that you can fall for bits where they use a bucket of water and a normal housecat as necessary ingredients as a conduit to hell (!?!), and dress Satan in a nice white suit and have him literally spit his lines.<br/><br/>(See that? I used the word literally correctly. Not like so many boneheads today who say things like ""Did you see that foul? He literally ripped his head off!"" as the guy who was fouled in this hypothetical rubs his bonce and walks away.<br/><br/>No people. Literally means it actually happened.) So again rather than rehash stuff about paranormal fighting tools, exorcisms, the evils of smoking and how a club for the supernatural and occult has a bouncer who screens people with cards depicting things like ""A frog in a dress"", and ""Two rats on a bench"", I'll simply say this: Constantine has great visuals, the depictions of hell are particularly cool.<br/><br/>I liked it.<br/><br/>I'd actually welcome a sequel.<br/><br/>I think everyone should at least watch it rather than seeing Canoe's mug on the poster and stepping to the right.<br/><br/>(And I'll ignore the bit where the Mexican guy didn't hear the car coming. And why the driver didn't see him in the first place. The damn scene looked cool enough that I can set aside such logic.) Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. More than a 2 hour anti-smoking campaign, Constantine is one of the better comic book movies in recent years and in my view is underrated.<br/><br/>Soapbox moment.<br/><br/>I hated Shia Le-Boof from the first film I saw him in, I think it was I, Robot. I hated him in this, and as soon as his head popped up in Indy and the Crystal Skull I knew that was doomed.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood think this guy is the answer to all our prayers? He sure ain't Johnny Depp pretty, is generally obnoxious and about as funny as a used tea bag, yet he keeps getting choice roles and wrecking promising movies.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

Like our hero, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves). Constantine is some sort of Phil Marlowe of the occult, dressed like a Man in Black (let's face it, demons are probably just another species of aliens).<br/><br/>As so often before, Reeves' acting is as expressive as a concrete wall, but this time he has an excuse: His character is based on a comic book hero. Still, his whole performance screams: ""Give me back my coat and shades from The Matrix!"" Constantine, a one-time suicide victim, is offered a chance to find redemption as certain sinister powers are trying to upset the ""balance"" by bringing the Son of Satan into the world. Beelzebub jr. - unsurprisingly - chooses Rachel Weisz to hatch him but his decision is not just based on good taste, there aren't actually many other women on the cast-list of this piece of mind-boggling nonsense. Except, of course, the divine Tilda Swinton, who appears as the archangel Gabriel - why not Gabrielle, one is inclined to ask - just in time for the show-down.<br/><br/>Constantine, Gabriel and Satan (gleefully played by Peter Stormare, Milton already new that the devil is so much more interesting a character than god) fight it out over Rachel Weisz's body in a sequence of actually quite beautiful shots involving a swimming-pool and lots of broken glass.<br/><br/>Still, the only way in which this movie makes you scared of eternal damnation is that hell must be like watching this kind of trash over and over for aeons and aeons."

The camera work is beautiful, so are the special effects, so once you manage to ignore half the religious crap, you can enjoy a good bit of light-weight horror show with a psycho-dramatic touch.<br/><br/>I particularly like the character of Gabriel. Tilda Swinton plays her with glorious well-meaning arrogance, and her show of ignorance towards humanity is important to understand Constantine's self-pitying indifference and apparent cruelty.

But I don't see that this is really that much worse than the usual slop. But I suppose, not being familiar with the comic and so not feeling betrayed, I can't make myself rise to indignant righteousness over a supernatural-themed mindless shoot-em-up spectacle. And it's hard to get really incensed about the acting (de)merits of Mr. Cool Breeze. Yes, he looks far too sleek here to make believable any real pain or even that disheveled gumshoe cliché of world-weary see-you-in-hell antipathy. But the man is not a character actor. We all know this. Or should. So, doesn't it make all of this disgust over his expressionlessness just a little... gratuitous? As if one expected him to emote??! Actually, I enjoyed his deadpan style in this movie. It made me laugh several times. I don't know if it was his (or the director's) intention, but sometimes the studied deadpan delivery of standard noir gestures and lines made them almost ironic. He does not do either the heartfelt drama or the highbrow very well, but I think he's perfect for these slightly self-conscious and heavy-handed caricature-roles. Incidentally so does Tilda Swinton also seem well-suited to such roles. I thought she looked stunning. The only miscast, ironically, is Rachel Weisz whose lovely performance was altogether too human, touchable, real, and vulnerable for this sort of thing."

","All the actors did an excellent job. Kudos to Djimson Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, Shia Lebouf, Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare. While Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz played their parts well, it was these actors that made the movie. It'll be another cult classic up there with ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf"". Most reviewers knocked this movie just because Keanu Reeves played Constantine. He did a good job portraying the weariness of deamon hunting and battling cancer. I still pictured Rachel Weisz as the upbeat intellectual from the Mummy movies. However, she is now getting beyond that after her performance in ""The Constant Gardener"". I hope they bring in the other characters from the Hellblazer series in any future sequels (I am praying for one)."
"BaronBl00d","5","1","5","19 December 2005"," Blow , Gabriel, Blow
","Having no awareness of the comic book, Constantine for me was...alright I guess. It starts out very feebly with Keanu Reeves performing an exorcism. If you want to see some miscasting, then look no farther than here. Now, I am not going to say Reeves is horrible. He isn't nor is he good. He is Keanu Reeves playing John Constantine, a man that helps God by killing demons(half-demons I think they were called)that try to cross over into our world. He does not help God because of goodness but rather for a hopeful gain to be admitted to Heaven for services rendered. I believe this is the basic background. Reeves is then paired with a police detective whose sister mysteriously committed suicide and who possesses psychic powers, etc... Constantine certainly has a very complex and developed story and I, for the most part, found much of it intriguing if nothing else. The idea that two forces combat daily over souls and keep a tally sheet for deeds performed was done in an interesting fashion. There is an over-propensity by director Francis Lawrence to use special effects here, there, and everywhere. Some of them are quite dazzling; some of them look like the frosting on top of the frosting on top of the cake. Lawrence does do some scenes very stylishly. I was confused a bit with the storyline here and there, but nothing multiple viewings should be able to correct - should one be so inclined. I confess I am not. For all its interesting plot contrivances, thematic battle of good and bad with Angel Gabriel and Satan as well in tow as characters, and sense of style, the film is just not coherent enough to make any real sense nor do the actors at hand have the depth to carry off any true believability. Reeves is barely adequate for this kind of role and it shows. He quips one-liners ala James Bond with a stone-faced incredulity that makes him almost seem clownish. You must have a lead that can lead. The other performers are not bad. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, a complex character that I had particular trouble understanding, gives a very unique interpretation of what an angel would be like in human form. I guess my review is lukewarm at best: I liked the concept but not fully the execution."
"brokenwilhelm","5","1","5","21 August 2005"," Could use some more action
","This is an okay movie. Recommend at least renting it. This movie had more talking then there was action. It did explain most of the happenings but, the crappy ending screwed the movie up and plus. It would use more action then there was. But like I said before, recommend renting it, not buying it. Now by all means, if you like lots of talking, and demon ass kicking. Then this is the movie for you. But this lacks the action and can get very boring. Keanu Reeves was the wrong actor to pick on this in my opinion. But, this does follow some key points to the Hellblazer comics. So if your a big fan of the comics, I guess you should watch this. But other then that, if your not a fan, and you hate talking. Don't even bother watching this movie."
"eht5y","5","1","5","13 August 2005"," Pretty Disappointing
","From the previews, 'Constantine' looks enormously appealing: a special effects bonanza, fusing the comic book action hero aesthetic with creepy occult horror themes that inevitably draw in audiences raised with a healthy fear of hellfire and damnation. Unfortunately, it turns out to be yet another vague, unconvincing B-movie dressed up to look smarter than it actually is, with schizophrenic pacing, plot holes galore, bad acting, and demons that are about as scary as the Fun House ride at a rural state fair.<br/><br/>Keaunu Reeves is John Constantine, a man born with psychic powers that enable him to see demons and angels, the soldiers in the ongoing spiritual battle for the souls of humanity (which, unsurprisingly, appears to take place solely in Los Angeles). As a boy, Constantine successfully attempted suicide, but was brought back by medical intervention. He was dead long enough, however, to be damned to hell, and has spent his subsequent years trying to earn a reprieve from God by fighting demons that torment and possess humans and banishing them back to hell, with the aid of a crew of mismatched sidekicks and a stock of holy relics for weapons.<br/><br/>But trouble is afoot: an ancient relic--the spear used to pierce Jesus' side during the crucifixion--has been unearthed, meaning that the anti-Christ may soon be among us. To make matters worse, Constantine--a lifelong chain-smoker--has terminal lung cancer, and has yet to earn his pardon. Meanwhile, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), an L.A. cop, has lost her twin sister to suicide, and begins to suspect both that her death may have been occult-related, and that Constantine might be able to help her solve the mystery and spare her sister's soul from eternal suffering.<br/><br/>I could elaborate further, but suffice it to say that logic and verisimilitude were out to lunch when this one got put together. The film seems to depend on a barrage of visual effects that, while impressive, have become typical enough in big-budget films that they fail to persuade or frighten without explanation or clear rationale. Keanu Reeves can be an appealing screen presence, but here he's so wooden and miscast that he almost singlehandedly ruins a film that was already on pretty shaky ground. The best performances come from the actors with the least screen time--Djimon Hundsou as Papa Midnight, who runs a demon-infested nightclub and appears to be some sort of mediary between heaven and hell (though his actual function is never really explained); Tilda Swinton as the androgynous angel Gabriel, who, rather un-angelically, taunts Constantine for his efforts to save his own soul; and Peter Stormare as a superbly creepy Satan who arrives a little too late to save the movie from mediocrity.<br/><br/>The big problems here are pacing and plot. 'Constantine' shifts from ponderous stretches dominated by Keanu trying his best to look like a guy who has been to hell and back and frenetic effects sequences that seem to expect the audience not to care what's happening or why as long as there are CGI demons on screen. The plot runs into the typical problems faced when filmmakers try to translate Christian occult mythology to the action/horror genre. To explicate the problems would give too much away; suffice it to say that that the fundamental intelligence of the story can be summarized in the observation that Constantine fights demons with a 'holy shotgun' and a pair of brass knuckles engraved with crosses, and all it takes to visit hell for a minute or two is to soak your feet in water and hold a kitty cat.<br/><br/>'Constantine' is, of course, a comic book ('Hellblazer;' the title was abandoned due to its similarity to 'Hellraiser'), and the character is basically Batman or Wolverine without the costume. Sadly, the story pits style over substance, and fails to persuade. It isn't irredeemably bad--the production values are high, and everyone but Reeves and the exasperating Shia LaBouef (as Constantine's wise-cracking teen-aged sidekick) give A-grade performances--but even clunkers like the recent, laughable 'Exorcist' prequel are scarier and more convincing."
"novella221","2","1","5","28 July 2005"," I was confused!
","Now I have only seen this film once and maybe I should watch it once more but in all honesty I found it very boring. I found it boring because I found it confusing! Maybe i'm a little dumb but I really got lost with this film. Keanu Reeves does not make such a film exciting either. I can't recall him ever changing his facial expression throughout the film . He looked bored playing the part of Constantine himself. It might've helped if a different actor was the lead role but too late for that now. Yes, in a way I can't review the film because every word said sounded like a different language to me and the story didn't make sense but what I can say on a personal note is that it was boring- I got to a point where I was ready to walk out the cinema before it had ended. I felt as though you needed to do a lot of background reading before watching the film. And can someone tell me what was the point of Gabriel? I hated it and don't have the patience to sit through it again-only if I need a good sleep maybe. In it's favour there were good special effects."

","Gifeglove you are crazy.<br/><br/>Constantine was an excellent movie. The special effects are amazing, and the story should be focused on Constantine because he serves such a great purpose.<br/><br/>Although Angela is needed by the devil for the main part of the movie, the whole story is based on John Constantine and how he tries to be accepted into heaven.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for everyone if you are into special effects and like seeing conflict between the two greatest powers, God and the Devil. And Keanu Reeves plays a spectacular role as John."
"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","1","5","20 July 2005"," More Over-Cooked Comic-Book Mayhem
","Just when you thought comic-book movies couldn't get anymore crazy and over-cooked, along comes Constantine to raise the bar again. There appears no limit to the ability of comic book - excuse me, graphic novel - writers to concoct wacko scenarios out of random bits of pop culture flotsam (a little Exorcist here, a little Chandler there, a dash of Batman); and there also appears no limit to the willingness of movie studios to exploit the supposed built-in audience for this kind of dark, freakish crap. On the surface it would seem a good strategy, taking works from one graphic medium and translating them into another, but the problem is that there's more to making good movies than just morphing comic-book frames into film images. It takes more than graphic style to make good movies, a fact that becomes painfully clear when watching something like Constantine, a film that's as mind-numbing in the playing out of its story as it is impressive in its visual design.<br/><br/>The story isn't told so much as pounded into your brain. The protagonist, John Constantine, is one of these messed-up comic book anti-heroes, a guy who, if he weren't saving the world, he'd be off paying shrinks hundreds of dollars an hour to help him get over whatever childhood traumas were responsible for his being a sullen, chain-smoking wreck. As if Constantine's life weren't bad enough, he discovers that the earth is about to be beset by the minions of Satan's Son, and wouldn't you know it, he's the only one who can rescue humanity from this supernatural scourge. Or almost the only one. There happens to be another supernaturally-gifted character, a female cop named Angela (played by the always-succulent Rachel Weisz), except that Angela is in denial about her psychic gifts, not to mention being aggrieved over the recent suicide of her twin sister. Around these two complex-ridden characters swirls a world of pat comic-book duality, a world where heaven's representatives seek to balance the mischief carried out by the spawn of Hell - the kind of morally black-and-white world beloved of our two favorite Georges, Bush and Lucas. Not that you would expect moral complexity in a comic-book movie - it's not that easy to sell ambiguity to the masses (House of Sand and Fog was not a hit, in case you didn't notice). And neither would you expect restraint from a movie whose purpose is to sell itself as hard as it can to an audience made-up mostly of jaded action-movie fans, the kind of people who find Spider Man a little slow.<br/><br/>Constantine gives these graphic novel drones everything they could want and more: angels and devils, swarms of winged demons, visualizations of Hell where the world looks like Hiroshima at the point of the explosion. What distinguishes the film is the outrageous extent it goes to in exploiting people's enduring fascination with religious imagery, paraphernalia and ideas. The Exorcist was once the last word in religious porn, but Constantine has usurped it. John Constantine is trying to buy his way into heaven after being condemned to Hell for committing suicide; Angela's sister Isabel was a devout Catholic whose soul is damned because she jumped off a building; Constantine's buddies are a psychic-priest and some other squirrelly guy who lives in a bowling alley and deals in rare religious artifacts (he has a copy of the extended bible, the one normally only found in Hell). It's hard, seeing how insistent the film is in selling its rather pornographic version of religion, not to be a little unsettled (especially when you consider how well this kind of stuff tends to go over with people who consider themselves religious), but it's not really crassness that does the picture in, it's plain-old Hollywood shoddiness. For all its outward gall the movie is rather pedestrian, the storytelling rather flaccid. The surface may be brimming with imagination, but underneath is the same old save-the-world jive, the same old comic-book hokum.<br/><br/>You might expect a little infusion of charm from Keanu Reeves, an actor who is normally at least watchable, but the sound and fury of Constantine so drowns-out his laid-back personality that he's reduced to a video game character, a dully enigmatic figure marching grimly through level after level of computer-generated carnage. This isn't the kind of movie that emphasizes the personality of an actor, and it isn't the kind that goes for much sex-appeal either, as evinced by the fact that Keanu and Rachel Weisz, two of the hotter people on the planet, manage to generate about zero sexual spark (which is about as much as Keanu had with Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Trilogy). The producers of this kind of movie seem almost contemptuous of the idea of any spontaneous human quality, erotic or otherwise, breaking through the over-designed, over-sold surfaces of their commodity-films. To let actors fling off the kind of nervous, quirky energy that makes for good viewing would represent a threat to the machine-tooled product, so we end up with performances so two-dimensional, so styled to fit in with the overall visual scheme, that one wonders why actors are employed at all. Don't directors care about what people like Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz can bring to a film? I guess that's a silly question given the kind of money that's on the line with a movie like Constantine - the kind of money that precludes the possibility of any messy humanity being allowed to get in the way."
"thetickingman","6","1","5","7 July 2005"," Solid film
","There has been much savagery leveled against Constantine's re-imagining of the comic book Hellblzer. It's re-location from London to LA, and its disregard for John Constantine's Liverpudlian origins are actually artistic decisions which in some ways benefit the film. Constantine's LA is a dark, seedy place of insidious characters and shadowy alleys and Constantine's hard-drinking, hard-smoking paranormal private dick is played relatively straight by Reeves. It is beautifully shot by Phillippe Rousellot and the effects are also noteworthy with interesting designs and an inherent quirkiness in the execution of set-pieces (Constantine's bizarre method of entering hell through the use of cats and foot-baths and knuckle dusters inscribed with holy crosses etc)that holds the interest. There is some fine support from Rachel Weisz, Djimon Honsou and Tilda Swinton, and Peter Stormare excels in his brief appearance as Lucifer (worth waiting for). Despite some drastic alterations to the source material, it is best to make your own mind up with regards to Constantine as it is worthy of praise (it is Francis Lawrences first film). It is an underrated film that deserves a certain cult status."

The chain-smoking anti-hero seems to find himself once again in the middle of a battle between good and evil. The artistic visuals bring about a dark and moody atmosphere. And smoking a cigarette in the pouring rain is just another luxury compared to a bad ass rumble in the bowels of Hell. For Weisz, I would also tippy-toe around the devil in red hot coals.

","I was really impatient to see Constantine even despite universally expressed contempt for it, because I'm really fond of Keanu Reeves. Well, I'm sorry to say it, but it proved everybody to be right, for it contained neither plot that you cannot laugh at, nor outstanding special effects to make up for it. Alas, the idea was great...<br/><br/>However, I'm tempted to say a few words in Constantine's defense. Everybody is eager to blame Mr. Reeves for his acting but to me he appeared the only one who's consistent with his part. His character is the most developed and sound in the whole story (maybe because he gets to speak for himself?). Completely another thing is that unfortunately (or luckily, it depends) he is doomed to wear ''The One'' stamp all over his person. One can do nothing about it - The Matrix was a once-in-a-decade, groundbreaking film. Here, he's the one who attracts interest and whenever he's on screen you cannot take eyes off him. He is really a character, you can identify with him and feel for him.<br/><br/>The others, including Rachel Weisz, Gavin Rossdale, etc. could be called 'awesome' (but honest to God, I wouldn't know why), but it's not clear why are they in this movie and what's their point in it. There's nothing outstanding in their performance to me, since I don't see them as characters - just some actors doing their work. They don't manage to get any sympathy from the viewer, no matter how brilliant they are.<br/><br/>In short, actors are not to blame, they tried to save everything they could but lost the battle against the scriptwriter, director and producer. Too bad."

","So let me ask you who is smartest - a) Keanu Reeves who consistently gets paid millions to make movies that people want to go and see or b) people who obviously loathe and detest Keanu Reeves with an almost rabid irrational passion and yet who keep forking over their hard earned cash to watch his movies in the theatres so they can then spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet composing what is basically a ""Keanu can't act and has never been able to act"" diatribe completely ignoring the movie itself. Hmmmm, I am a little stumped here, I don't understand it personally, if you hate the guy so much why do you keep going to see his movies, or are you all just closet masochists? That having been said Constantine both intrigued and disappointed me. I was perhaps expecting a little more action dare I say. I think that it will need a second watching before I catch the nuances of the film and begin to really appreciate its quality. I thought Keanu was excellent as Constantine, sullen, miserable, couldn't really give a toss about the world or what is going on it in other than his quest NOT to go to hell. Rachael was as always perfect in her portrayal of the tortured detective. I must have blinked and missed Shia LaBoef (spelling sorry) in I Robot but here he was an amiable and amusing side kick a/k/a apprentice. I loved the ""Q"" character living in the back of the bowling alley, right down to his grimy fingers which had obviously been poked into too many grimy places in his quest for unusual objects. Tilda Swinton was as usual wonderful as the asexual Gabriel, with the perfect touch of angelic and demonic (not sure I ever knew that Gabriel was a half breed though or did he/she become one after being de-angelified? - thereby hangs a question). Both Bathazar and the Devil had more than a little longing for Constantine and that was portrayed beautifully by both of the actors. The FX were top notch, and beautifully done. There were some slow spots, which I wondered with a more skillful editor might not have ended up on the cutting room floor but all in all an enjoyable movie that I will enjoy seeing again to fully appreciate. One has to admit though, it was Keanu's movie, and I believe he will gain many more fans as a result of it. You don't have to eat the scenery to be considered a good actor, you have to embrace the character and be unselfish with your fellow actors. In all respects Keanu fit the bill. And for those who are so rabidly Keanu haters please do me, the world and yourselves a favour, stop going to see his movies, it really is not healthy. And by the way, if you want to really know what a truly gifted actor and wonderful person he is just check out the comments from his fellow actors, to a man (or woman) they praise him to the skies.

What was he meant to do, smile through it all. There were no cheesy one liners at all nor was Keanu's character boring. It was also said that there was no plot to the film. You must have been too bust eating popcorn to pay attention. The plot was evident in the first 20 minutes or so. I am being very vague because I don't want to ruin it for others who haven't seen the film yet. The ""side kick"" was not meant to be a main character of the film. His role was to serve and learn from Constantine and that was it. He wasn't in the film for entertainment value. Next time some of you people rate films, make sure you are actually watching them and paying attention to the plot because there definitely was one.

Must these movies always match up or better the original comics? How can they? The original character was never a living person. This movie has probably been the most enjoyable movie this year. That may not be saying that much however. Its worth more than a 6.5. I think the next time I stop by a book store I'll pick up a copy of the original. I also think that the original comic fans should keep in mind that the editors have to squeeze a lot of comic book content into 2 hours of viewing time. Which is something the editors of Lord of the Rings got away with."

Not being a follower of the comic I found it to be entertaining and worth seeing.<br/><br/>Even though Keanu's acting sucked I wouldn't blame it all on him. After all, Ifound his acting reasonable in the Matrix and a few other films. This director obviously has more experience with hip and flashy music video's than dramatic delivery. He had a good enough casting director to get a lot of good actors (Djimon Honsou for example)to fill supporting roles but he couldn't manage Keanu's canned expressions and inability to carry subtlety. Keanu can do OK if he's got a good coach, but he can't do crap w/o one."

It tries to hard to be both a suspense thriller and an action movie, but it really succeeds at neither. The suspense thriller moments dragged on to the point that I actually fell asleep more than once, and the action scenes just screamed ""BE SURE TO BUY THE GAME!"", which by the way, is out already.<br/><br/>As far as the characters, while I understood some of their motivations for what they were doing, I never really bought into them emotionally. I got the impression that the character Constantine is intended to be an anti-hero, but I was never compelled to like or dislike him. In fact, I just plain didn't really care what happened to him. If you want a good quality anti-hero, pick up a book and check out Thomas Covenant or Elric of Melnibone. Those guys are true anti-heroes.<br/><br/>Definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly not among the best. It would have scored higher if it had prompted to me to at least do a little research on some of the theological concepts involved, but...well...it didn't."

If you have never read the Hellblazer comic, you CAN go see Constantine. If you like fantastic scripts (that do NOT star Ben Affleck or any of the cast of Friends), you CAN go see Constantine. The character development is comic book-esque, so yeah, you might not realize every detail they're giving you (Hey, I read Sandman and I can still get lost in other comics when I don't know the whole history), but as I am fond of saying, ""Shut up and let the art wash over you"". The Noir quality is at just the right pitch so as to let you know all is not as it seems, but not so paranoid that you get distracted from the acting and cinematography.

","This is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever wasted money on. It's really awful, but, not bad enough to be campy. Keanau, what the heck are you thinking? The only redeeming feature in the movie is Gabriel...nice touch to make this archangel gender neutral. The settings are bad, most of the costuming is bad, there is no mystery involved, you don't even end up rooting for the ""good guys"". The rules for the demons change, rules for everything change through the whole movie. The plat is ludicrous, characterization is paltry, situations are stilted, direction is non-existent. Even the special effects are lame. Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere."

","I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. Better than any the other garabage that is out now. I never read the comics so I can't compare the two but after seeing the movie I just order 1 of there graphic novels on-line. I thought the story was pretty good and definitely original. The acting was cool typical Keanu Matrix style and that Rachael Weis is fine. It was better than Matrix Resolutions by far. Constantine might even be worth a sequel. Some things that could have been a little better where maybe a little deeper into the plot. The characters where cool maybe not Satan, he could have been casted alittle better but he wasn't that bad.

Rachel did a very nice job as well, she brought a good element to the movie and her character (Angela) is the one that teaches all of us...because John has to constantly tell her information, the audience gets to know more. the romance never really blossoms, but if we are lucky, there may be a sequel. i hope that if you choose to see it, you enjoy it!!!

","Take the following four words to heart, and you will enjoy this movie: ""Willing suspension of disbelief."" Most of this movie is merely OK. The ending, however, is fantastic. This movie goes out strong with unexpected developments and fascinating otherworldly politics. Don't get me wrong, the first part of the movie doesn't suck -- but once Lucifer makes his entrance, I was completely hooked and drawn in for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>Lucifer is depicted in a more Miltonian way; he isn't some cardboard bad guy -- at all. He and Gabriel steal the show in the few scenes in which they appear. Keanu Reeves does a remarkably good job in a role he seems to have been born to play.<br/><br/>I have enormous respect for how they handled the love interest angle.

Rachel Weisz I admit could have done a better job but she still kept me on the edge of my seat. The humor of the movie was pretty funny, so it made me both laughing and scared almost at the same time. The plot was a little bland and didn't make much sense but oh well.

","While this is no Oscar winner, it does take the viewer on an interesting and circuitous ride through a world bordered by heaven and hell. It's dark and surreal. There is humor, but it is intentionally deadpan.<br/><br/>2 points that many people complain about (R. Ebert for example) 1)""why doesn't he just beg forgiveness"", well Constantine actually answers the question. Though he is constantly confronted by the evil forces of hell, he has trouble believing in and trusting GOD. 2)He's dying, ""it's a wasted plot diversion"". Um, well, Constantine's motive for everything is trying to avoid going to hell. The fact that is will be dying in a year or less, kind of explains his urgency in his attempts to ""buy"" his way into heaven. Seems important to me.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an interesting and different approach to horror/action. While no part stands out as great, it is a solid ENTERTAINING movie. And entertainement is what it's all about, tight?"

I have not seen this particular comic, so I had no preconceived expectations, which can be an advantage. I thought Constantine was visually imaginative, with a frightening view of hell. The effects were beautifully done. Thank you to ILM for another magnificent effort. I also thought the actors did a good job. I happen to be a fan of Keanu Reeves, and like the fact that he does not feel the need to chew up the scenery and everything else in every role.

","I saw this last night and had so-so expectations for it, though I'm a huge fan of the genre. Having just stumbled across some scathing reviews of it, particularly Paul Clinton's (CNN), I wanted to put in my two cents to the contrary.<br/><br/>But first, if you don't like Keanu, and I guess a lot of people (or at least reviewers) don't, then you might be disappointed. Personally, I think he does a good job at performing in exactly these kinds of roles. Whether you think his look is vacant, from lack of talent, or detached, as the character requires, is up to you ... I thought the result was a little unexpected and very fun.<br/><br/>I've never read Hellblazer and still saw a comic book feel throughout. I'm guessing that's what the director was going for. The supporting cast really contributed to this aspect and I thought they all did a great job.<br/><br/>Gripes: 1. the weapons were a bit gimmicky. Yeah, yeah, I know it's a comic book adaptation. 2. For a man in the final throes of emphysema he was able to fight and run around pretty well. 3. overuse of effects. For example, when the priest knocked over those bottles of liquor, they showed you liquor coming out, but it was CGI. Is it that hard to film a bottle with, you know, real liquid coming out? However, in general, it was a visually beautiful film with a fun story line and great characters. Don't let the critics put you off."

If you're going to cast an American as Constantine, then the guy who plays Sawyer on ""Lost"" would be an excellent choice. Yes, Constantine can be dragged down into despair, confusion and guilt. But he's also a trickster figure who sometimes revels in being a jerk. He can get passionately angry, anti-authoritarian and well... show a range of emotions. That's the Constantine of the Hellblazer comic I'm describing, not the guy in this film.<br/><br/>There are bits of Constantine's filmic world that I like, but it seems like there are giant holes in both the plot and the metaphysics here.<br/><br/>Still the movie is a lot better than Catwoman."

Keanu Reeves actually does a good job, I'm always weirded out by movies with him starring, since Point Break, Bill and Ted's and the last two Matrix movies have scarred me.

The 7.0 rating this website conveys is misleading and gives you high expectation for a film that I wouldn't watch on a plane/bus journey (even if i had nothing else to do).

The best parts are when Keanu Reeves punches people in the face. ""It's called pain. Get used to it"" and ""my names Constantine. John Constatine. Asshole"" are the best lines I have ever heard.

First off, John Constantine has a disease lung cancer per say and if you had that..what else to do than save the world right? I mean..the ultimate sacrifice is doing something for someone other than your self out of pure unselfishness. For John...that wasn't too easy..even though he risked his butt saving countless people from demons, he was only trying to ensure himself a ticket to heaven. so, when he learned the truth from Gabriel and Angela (mostly) He shaped up and risked his life for two people & three reasons. The first person was for Angela. the reason(s) why is 1)he's in love with her. 2)he wanted to save her happiness by bringing back her sister. the second person would be her sister reason being because he knew she didn't belong in hell. and of course Angela's happiness.(already said). sweet isn't it?

"TheRealBambi","10","1","6","6 May 2006"," Well, they got the demon thing right
","I'm slowly warming up to Kenau Reeves, and really admire Rachel Weiz. This movie was a real risk, in my opinion. The writers really portrayed the whole demon battle accurately. No matter that the images reflect a Western heaven/hell view of the whole struggle. There are people walking around with the misfortune of having a bird's eye view into the demonic world that surrounds us. Kenau and Rachel portrayed these kinds of folks very well. It takes an artist with a lot of trust, or a lot of knowledge to take on a project like this. It's certainly not a way to guarantee popularity.<br/><br/>I appreciated the moments of sorta humor to lighten things up. I also liked how there is so much cigarette smoking in this movie. For some reason, the cigarette thing creates a thread of consistency for me.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: even if you don't have an opinion one way or the other with respect to the existence or non-existence of demons, the film is worth the view. It's worth the time because it's a good story and it has amazing visuals and special effects."

","Constantine is yet another movie based on a comic book that even most comic book nerd hadn't heard of. So they take the story of John Constantine on the pursuit of riding the world of demons because of something long ago that bars him from the gates of heaven. It's extra important to get in now because a large chunk of the residents of hell were put their by him.<br/><br/>In the role of the title character is Keanu Reeves who will forever conjure up the thoughts of Theodore Logan no matter how serious the role. Needless to say, the slacker surfer persona doesn't mesh well with the demon hunter. On his quest in the movie, Constantine crosses path with the chick from The Mummy movies as a detective trying to prove that her twin didn't commit suicide. And because ever good comic book character need a sidekick and Constantine has a cab driving apprentice played by the dude from one of the Disney Channel shows that I won't admit to watching.<br/><br/>One of the few entertaining elements of the movie is the unintentional comedy most notable being every moment where Reeves tries to act, and be sure to watch out for Constantine's rubber ducky. Equally questionable casting choice was the dude from Bush showing up as the bad guy. It was extremely hard to be scared of him because whenever he comes on the screen I fell off the couch laughing.<br/><br/>The only redeemable aspect of the movie was the scenes of hell. They really captured what I assume hell to be, a very hot version of Earth with weird demon ready to rip the flesh. The only part missing from my version of hell would be the members of the Backstreet Boys raping me for eternity while singing their songs. In fact all the special effects were all well done. Now if they can figure out to make a CGI Keanu Reeves and the movie might have been a lot better.<br/><br/>The biggest crime of the movie is that they cut out what could have made the movie. If you role through threw the delete scenes you find out about Constantine's tryst with a very hot (bad pun intended) half-demon who was cut out of various scenes in the movie. If I were to ever make rules of making a good move, number one would be ""Never leave out the token hot chick."" Because of that, this movie deserves to fail."

It wasn't awful by any stretch, but it would have been more interesting had they not saturated the movie with mind-numbing special effects; those Hell scenes were pretty silly. And overall, why does the ""Bill and Ted"" guy, aka the ""Speed"" guy, aka Neo, ever try to do serious roles?

","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with a gift he didn't want - the ability to see the half-breed angels and demons that walk the earth. But he is a bitter, cynical individual who has squandered his gift and, after smoking 30 cigarettes a day since the age of 15, has now been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. To round all this off, he's also survived a suicide attempt- meaning his entrance to Heaven has been blocked. In an attempt to avert this, he wars with the earth-bound minions of evil. But when the twin sister of a female police detective (Rachel Weiez) dies in an apparent suicide, he stumbles onto a plot to take over the earth that is much greater than he ever imagined.<br/><br/>Indeed, the anti-smoking lobby are definitely working their guns here, re-enforcing the cancer and premature death message (not to mention it just being a really filthy habit!) in their downbeat, morbid anti-hero with subtle references and innuendo through-out the film. Indeed, there is an off-puttingly dark, bleak feel to the whole film. That's not helped by a story that is confusing and with a desperate lack of emotional attachment to any of the characters. And then, of course, there's Reeves. He may have head-billed some of the most prominent action films of the last ten or so years, but the fact remains, to paraphrase Jonathon Ross, that we are dealing with an ""impossibly wooden"" actor here, chronically devoid of charisma and lacking the ability to really make us engage in any of his characters.<br/><br/>The whole thing just seems to be some kind of sub-par take on The Exorcist. Some of the special effects and action are good, but unlike Reeves's previous The Matrix (or, hopefully, even Speed!) one can only see a continuation in the shape of a sequel to this series being, well, a really filthy habit. **"

If your hoping for a lot of action, forget it. <br/><br/>The action is decent but sparse, but this isn't a bad thing as it concentrates more on the storyline and the characters, which is important if you want to understand the concept.

As a child this is intensely disturbing to him.He can never go to heaven as he once committed suicide because of his abilities, before being resuscitated.After seeing hell he tries to redeem himself by exercising demons and saving people so he may be granted entrance to heaven, and time is running out as he is dying. But the tragedy lies in the fact that even when Constantine earns his redemption, it is taken from him. He can never go to heaven. <br/><br/>I've noticed a lot of the comments posted seem to be by people with an intense dislike of Keanu Reeves, so their opinions are biased.

Shame on the writers for that. I seem to remember this as the same character he played in I, Robot and on every talk show appearance he's made. A real journeyman.<br/><br/>I got the feeling from this movie that the director felt that the wetter characters appeared the more dramatic tension there was. Given this belief, it's understandable that everyone is wet throughout the whole picture. It seems like a stylistic rip-off of better films like ""The Crow"" or ""Seven."" I am seeing this type of thing more and more. As if having every shot be dark and wet will make the film more edgy or 'goth.' <br/><br/>My favorite touch at the end of this incredibly dark nonsense is that Keanu's character, John COnstantine,decides to chew gum instead of smoking at the end. This is supposed to indicate growth and new perspective on life for the character. I'm guessing that this is the result of his travails over the course of the film. This character never showed any signs of emotion or humanity until this point, good or bad. Why the Hell would we believe he has grown? <br/><br/>In addition there are fumbling attempts at sexual tension or hints of caring feelings between Keanu and Rachel's character. This either needs to be explored and ramped up or dropped. It feels tacked on as an after thought to please an exec at the studio. Either Constantine only saves her because he needs to in order to save mankind or the director needs to spend more time establishing the slightest bit of chemistry between the characters. It's not enough to just assume that two folks will automatically be willing to risk their lives for each other for no other reason than they are two attractive people in the same movie.<br/><br/>Just my opinion."

","I SWORE I wasn't going to see it.<br/><br/>See, I was a HUGE fan of John Constantine: Hellblazer in my comic days.<br/><br/>I really don't mind Keanu, sometimes he can act.<br/><br/>But just by watching the trailers I KNEW I was going to hate it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that John Constantine is British, Blond and a HUGE a$$hole. Not to forget that in the books his name rhymes with ""valentine"" not ""Ovaltine"". I used to think that Sting was a perfect match (in his younger days). My modern choice would have been Jude Law, but they didn't ask me.<br/><br/>But Mrs. Hob wanted to see it and well, I am the kinda guy that just HAS to sniff the spoilt milk.<br/><br/>Well surprise surprise. I actually liked it.<br/><br/>Sure they moved John to LA and changed his looks and nationality. Keanu does play him pretty good - though not as angry or as big an a$$hole, but I can honestly say I could accept it as a ""version"" or ""riff"" on the character.<br/><br/>As for the story - straight out of the comic!!! Not literally but figuratively. I actually felt like I was watching the comic on screen (aside from the main character).<br/><br/>I also liked that the director didn't necessarily fill in all the blanks or spoon-feed all the back story, and yet it was there.<br/><br/>So in the end, I liked it. A bit slow in spots, but never afraid to take its time.<br/><br/>WARNING: If you cannot reconcile the choices made in redefining John Constantine - avoid this.

But then last night I went to see it, & now tonight I'm going again. Trust me this movie was good, I AM the pricky fanboy, that tears apart everything, but as far as comic movies go ""Constantine"" was perfect. Great special effects, great story, great look, it's worth going to just to see Hell. Keanu absolutely nailed the part, he is John Constantine, the slimy, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, con-man. This movie is based, I think, off the Dangerous Habits, story arc, issues 41 - 46. As for the weird looking cross gun, he uses that somewhere in the Garth Ennis run.

One of those friends didn't manage to stay awake throughout the movie's entirety and all the rest, including me, were sorely disappointed. In a nutshell, i felt the story line was very poor, the character development was also lousy, the CGI effects(especially the Hell scenes) were well done, but weren't even close to saving this bummer. I would be hard pressed to recommend this movie as a video store rental and would advise others that spending the $9 or so theatre admission price could be much better spent elsewhere."

","If you were only going to see one movie this year...it wouldn't be ""Constantine."" But, if you're normal and can see more than one movie (who would resign themselves to that, anyways?), I'd recommend this one. Keanu Reeves's character, John Constantine, seemed heavily Neo influenced. Not that this is a particularly bad thing, it just seemed like Reeves has now been cursed to only be cast in Neo-esque roles. This aside, the rest of the cast was amazing. Both Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton gave extraordinary performances. As for the special effects, they were really amazing. I'm not sure what some people were thinking when they said they were horrible. The special effects artists did an extremely good job at knowing when enough was enough. While the movie did have it's flaws (which I can't say here, since it would reveal too much of the movie), it was still enjoyable."

","Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man who has the ability to see demons in other people. He's dark, misanthropic, and anti-climatic. See, he died when he was sixteen (for 2 minutes on a suicide attempt) and went to hell. Of course he didn't like it much so now he banishes demons in order to 'buy' his way into heaven. The plot of the film picks up when cop Angela Dodson (The wonderful Rachel Weisz) approaches him about the apparent suicide of her twin sister, who was institutionalized. She believes something paranormal caused the death. What unfolds is an apocalyptic scenario...<br/><br/>Sounds good. Too bad it was written poorly.<br/><br/>Keanu is Keanu, in probably his worst performance in a long time. His character is somewhat boring and an asshole, making it hard for the audience to bond with him. Although he does have a few good lines and scenes, his performance is disappointing. Weisz is great, but she can't carry the film. The rest of the cast is either underdeveloped (see Pruitt Taylor Vince's and Max Baker's character) or misused (Djimon Hounsou, Tilda Swinton, Gavin Rossdale). <br/><br/>The story line is also annoyingly incomplete. *SPOILERS* Why does the devil's son want Constantine or Angela? What the hell was going on at the end? The point of the Mexican? Whats the point of him having cancer? I didn't really like Stormare as Satan that much. But I didn't find Shia LaBeouf as annoying as others did. <br/><br/>Basically the plot had loose ends. A lot. And not in a way where you're dying to see the sequel either. <br/><br/>On the positive side, I loved the cinematography, and I'm not big on camera-work. Its a promising start of full length motion picture direction for Francis Lawrence. And there were plenty of neat ideas in the movie (IE God isn't all knowing, he's just playing a betting game with Satan for souls), but they're underdeveloped too.<br/><br/>Overall it gets 6/10. Probably a movie you can wait to rent."

There, I've said it now. Also, I have to admit as a lapsed Catholic Matrix fan I am probably right in the cross hairs of the target demographic for this movie. So my opinion should be heavily discounted perhaps. Having said that, this movie was so much better than the reviews that if I were you I would check it out.

One thing though that was surprised was the lack of many elaborate, gut-wrenching fight scenes.<br/><br/>Also given that most movies adapted from comic books are fast paced this started at a snail's pace. A lot of talking and introduction of characters. However as the minutes came and went the pace picked up and the elements, which seemed insignificant at the start came into place to provide a good climax.<br/><br/>Also given that this was adapted from a comic book I really was not expecting that a very deep storyline but surprisingly it was certainly above average and was quite intelligent for it's class.<br/><br/>My major gripe about this film was the acting performance of the actors particularly of Keanu Reeves. I never really rated him as an actor and found him one-dimensional. This movie further reinforced that belief. Most of the lines he delivered were rather flat with little emotion shown. The others did well enough but I felt Reeves overshadowed all of them given his significant screen time.<br/><br/>The effects I thought were fine.

The other is that Ms. Weisz was able to keep her dignity throughout, although there were many opportunities to exploit her good looks.

I'd go so far as to say it sits with 'Sin City' and 'HellBoy' as a better than average adaptation. The problem people seem to have is with the idea of Keanu as Constatine and/or a lack of awareness of the history of the comic. Keanu actually works well as Constatine...maybe he could have been more cynical, but this is a Hollywood film and I'll take it as it is - a great looking, well acted (Tilda Swindon is perfect as a chilly Gabrial) slough through the dark side."

","Constantine has to be the worst abuse of American cinema on a British comic I have ever seen. Nothing was kept true to the comic, and Keanu Reeves has about as much attitude and cockiness as a solid hunk of wood. John Constantine, in the comics, is a character who just reeks of attitude and is haunted by his past, and doesn't rely on macho fighting etc, and NONE of this is captured in the writing of his character. The casting and plot are both awful (well, at least the script flowed, which is why this didn't get a 1) but what is the deal with Rachel Weisz? She was so unnecessary, and Constantine, as they say in the comics, wouldn't give 2 tugs of a dead dogs c*** about her if you know what I mean. The only thing this really has going for it is some cool special effects, and good (although illogical writing) script flow. My opinion, they should have had Garth Ennis, Jamie Delano, Alan Moore, etc, ANYONE who actually had a hand in writing the comic to be involved with the script, and casted Ewan MacGregor as Constantine.

Director Francis Lawrence creates an atmosphere appropriately dark for the content, using cgi effectively without overdoing it. The cast is of course great, most notably Peter Stormare's cameo in the role of Satan.

It's dark and moody, the settings are pretty much stripped down to the bare necessities, and ...well, I kind of like that. The camera work gives the film an edge that works very well and makes it interesting to watch. Style over substance can be quite disastrous, but here it works just fine.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, I guess. Keanu is very uneven, though. Sometimes he really seems to be struggling, but from time to time, he's actually very good. I found Constantine's character pretty interesting, with a not always likable persona.

","The movie starts off pretty quick and fast paced. And I liked how it started off and liked the first 30-40 minutes. Then it kind of slows down and the flow of the movie starts to get inconsistent. I also thought around this point in the film the editor just went to sleep. Some scenes are just boring; others go on for too long, and still others just left me confused or seemed irrelevant. It was kind of sad how the beginning was very interesting but then it just kind of broke down. Towards the end it picks up a little bit and the ending isn't bad, but the lag / inconsistencies in the middle kind of made me loose interest.<br/><br/>I guess the other aspect was that as the movie played out I seemed to understand less and less of what was going on. For one I didn't understand why Keanu was doomed to go to hell. If they explained it I kind of missed it. Also there were a ton of other things that either went explained or I just simply didn't understand or couldn't keep up. I do have hearing difficulties (which usually aren't an issue in a loud theater), but where I saw it had pathetic sound so maybe I just missed much of the dialog.<br/><br/>I kind of got the general gist that there's this all mighty Dagger used by the devil or some other baddie, that when some poor Mexican stumbles onto it, he becomes immortal, possessed, and starts reeking havoc moving towards some goal or destination, seemingly possessing people and tilting the balance along the way. However this is where it starts to get weird and I start to loose focus on what's going on and why. I didn't understand why some people became possessed; I didn't understand why certain demons could now start crossing thresholds that Keanu kept spurting out ""They're not supposed to enter our realm."" I didn't understand what actually happened to the possessed guy carrying the dagger. I didn't understand the relevance of Gabriel and why he was played by a she and what he/she was trying to do in the very end with the dagger. The list of ""I don't understand"" just goes on and on Unlike the matrix where everything is in riddles, this movie is either just not consistent at all, or just simply doesn't explain enough, or just expects the audience to follow a very weird non understandable plot, not sure which is the case.<br/><br/>The story was interesting. Keanu is an exorcist who's job is to vanquish demons who cross the line, However since he's going to hell anyway, he has a very careless way about him, which IMO kind of hurts him in that it makes his acting look very bland like he simply just doesn't care, which I read a lot of complaints about. Personally I think it wasn't so much his acting as it was his character was very morbid, cold, resentful, and just down right miserable. So yeah, it came off like he wasn't much into it. The other actors in the film I thought did aright. There was no one in the film who I thought did an exceptional job in terms of acting So no acting awards from what I saw. The effects were pretty good. Nothing stellar, but they fit the bill. All in all it was an okay movie with some entertaining / interesting scenes, but by large I found it to be very confusing to the point of being frustrating. It's like when you keep taking breaks when watching a movie to the point where you just can't follow it anymore, except here I was in my seat the whole time. I've rarely had problems understanding movies, so it's not like I don't get half the movies I've seen. This one seemed to be an exception though If I see this movie again (by renting it later on I mean) it will only be to see if I can make more sense out of it as it just came and went when I saw it in the theater."

","Constantine has one redeeming quality. Peter Stormare plays Satan, and he's characteristically great, creating what may be the best Lucifer since Pacino. You could also add Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Djimon Hounsou as ""Papa Midnight"" as secondary and tertiary redeeming qualities, but that's up for debate.<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie is terrible. The screenplay is so flat and weakly written it was almost offensive to watch, and the directing is gimmicky garbage. Some of the special effects are nice and the production design has its moments, but the visuals are certainly nothing to rave about.<br/><br/>There is obvious cinematic potential for the comic book character Keanu Reeves plays, but his wooden style should never be combined with such a monstrously bad screenplay. He could have been a kind of demon-fighting Bogey - instead he's more like a bad Columbo impersonation. Rachel Weisz would make a nice entry in a wet T-shirt contest, and she seemed game to deliver a good performance too, but the absence of any sort of consistency in her character eliminated that possibility.<br/><br/>Personally, I am getting tired of music video directors who confuse ""a random combination of nice-looking angles"" with ""cool"" and writers who confuse a ""a smattering of religion, faux-hip settings and genre-bending clichés"" with ""interesting."" I think we're going to have to face the fact that, no matter how cool some geek thinks it is in his mind, a fusion of the occult and sci-fi will never make a half-decent movie. And the fact that religion has inspired so many awful supernatural flicks lately is as strong an argument as any to go atheist.<br/><br/>If there is a sequel, and it is called ""The Adventures of Satan"" starring Peter Stormare, I will see it. Otherwise, I will not give this lowly film a second thought."

","Hey I want John Constantine's day job, it sure makes my job of writing marketing copy for IT companies seem so boring now! Gifted demon-seer, Constantine (played by Kenau Reeves) gets to see Angels and Demons wherever he goes, which means even the most boring of activities - such as riding a bus - like a day at the freak show. A well constructed plot and fast moving story line, I loved this movie. Our eyes were filled with rich imagery of heaven and hell and demonic onslaught within the 'earth plane'. But wait there's more! Some hilarious dialogue is thrown in along the way; at one point in the movie, Constantine announces, ""I just pulled a demon soldier out of a little girl!"" and tells us more than once - ""I've been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately."" Tilda Swinton plays, the archangel Gabriel (although looking a lot like Mick Hucknall, lead singer of Simply Red) and Satan's henchman Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale, the lead singer of the band Bush, which I thought was kinda cool) put in appearances. Satan (played by Peter Stormare) is brilliant as the diabolical Lord of The Demons himself, Satan and puts in a a very casual appearance bohmenian in style sporting a brilliant white suit and sooty bare feet. Satan is cool, crazy and a crack up! When Constantine asks if he can have a cigarette, the original Lord of Hell sneers that it's fine with him, and says ""I've got stock."" Lo and behold! What would an action packed movie be without a ridiculous looking firearm. Constantine is given a solid gold gun, that fires real gold bullets and of course its accessorised so that it looks just like a small crucifix(no Jesus), very cheesy but fun! The only real let-down in the movie is, Rachel Weisz (from The Mummy series) plays Angela Dodson, a police woman who's trying to prove that her sister's recent death was not suicide. She was absolute rubbish in this role unfortunately."
"brunchie","Null","1","8","13 November 2005"," Confusing mess. See it for the theological questions it raises.
","By the end of the movie, I was thoroughly confused and I don't want anyone to bother to unconfuse me, especially fans of the graphic novels it was based on. I have no problem with a movie that has twists, scenes and dialogues that you have to pay close attention to. I have no problem with a movie that makes you think but this one merely gave me a headache. And not to mention Mr. Reeves' acting that reminded me about what a critic said about another actor's performance: ""So wooden, you can dust it off with Pledge."" Most of his lines were delivered like he took a sip of water between words. He delivered his lines like the kid you have to suffer through in first grade when the teacher asks the class to each read a passage out loud. And isn't this the second movie that Shia LeBouf plays the wisecracking, annoying sidekick who wants a piece of the action? The only performances worth noting are Gabrielle/Gabriel played androgynous and Angela because she's performed well in better movies. The only time Reeves' deadpan delivery worked are for the few one-line zingers. Not to mention that is the second movie I've seen where I didn't agree with the MPAA rating. I usually don't watch R-rated horror/thriller movies because the violence is usually over-the-top. The House of Flying Daggers portrayed blood spurting, and people getting sliced and stabbed yet it got a PG-13 but the violence in this movie was no worse than ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" or the first ""Indiana Jones"". And I'm kind of tired of the dark side character- Midnight- being cast as a dark actor- played by an African actor ala Judas in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", Pam Grier in ""Something Wicked..."" and even Darth Vader wearing a dark outfit and voiced by black actor, James Earl Jones but the supposed Savior of the world is a white actor in Reeves' second role of the type after playing Neo (an amalgram of ""One"") in the Matrix (pretty much employing the same acting style).<br/><br/>I really watched this movie for the theological questions it raises. Where do suicide ""victims"" go after they die? Are demons and angels amongst us or are they safely in their domains letting only their half human spawn live amongst us? Have we misdiagnosed some mentally ill people who instead of being crazy are merely able to see the spirit world? Are some of the evil or helpful people in the world really half-demon or half-angels? Can you bargain for your soul's outcome? Are God and Satan like Yin and Yang, two equal superpowers? And does this movie answer those questions? No. It merely raises them. For a movie with a similar theme, albeit less gruesome, see, ""What Dreams May Come."" with Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra in a role that finally does something with her fragility/vulnerability. What did intrigue me is that film is unabashedly dependent on Catholic beliefs and delves into areas of theology that Protestantism doesn't even address. Would love to ask the typical Baptist or COGIC preacher what he thinks about the above questions."

What I could understand was John Constantine (Reeves) is a man who has a special gift to see and fight against the powers of hell and the supernatural. The exorcism scene he does at the beginning is quite cool. Angela Dodson (Weisz) recently lost her twin sister Isabel who supposedly committed suicide, she doesn't believe it. But after all that lot I can't understand anything. Just a load of battles for some reason I'm not bothered about, I suppose it's wise to listen to some of the dialogue. Adequate!"

The visuals of the movie were brilliant and contrary to what some people are saying it doesn't diss my belief, in fact it echoes it, which I thought was particularly interesting. I believe that the dimensions of heaven and hell are layered directly onto this one. This was portrayed in a mucho cool way! The way it is Gabriel that falls to earth begins to question belief systems and the way things are supposed to have happened, after all it's a movie, if you can't be free with ideas in movies we are pretty much screwed!

Now that's something filmmakers should try doing more often when adapting a comic into a movie, it gives the film a really nice feeling.<br/><br/>It is a rather dark movie, but not like ""Interview with the Vampire"" in which you had to squirt your eyes to see anything besides the main characters.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also very good. It's basically rock, yet not too hard as in ""DareDevil"".<br/><br/>The characters are all pretty well developed and you'll undoubtedly end up taking a liking to one or another. The only one that should have gotten more attention was Balthazar, he really deserved it.<br/><br/>Plot-wise ""Constantine"" does well: it's not too predictable but not terribly complex either, it's a little bit of both, a perfect combo. The only thing that somewhat bothered me about the ending is ""the finger"". That was a rather unnecessary scene to the film and to John Contantine's character development-- we all already knew he was a very stubborn, rude man.<br/><br/>Something that also caught my attention was how ""couples"" were left out!

But face it, one-dimensional goody-two-shoes are hardly fascinating, and her acting didn't rise above that point. Was Constantine a compelling character? No, but I think dialogue, scene construction, and the fact the protagonist wasn't supposed to be a likable guy pretty much constricted what Reeves could do. Nevertheless, Midnite (Hounsou) was pretty compelling in his small part, as was Balthazar (Rossdale), so that may be an indicator there was a problem with the leads' performance. I like Swinton's small role too, but I think it has more to do with her looks, and my general fascination with ethical perspective.<br/><br/>They do rip off The Prophecy movie themes, but its not like its horribly distasteful.

Aside from the obvious similarities to The Matrix, there is a lot of great ideas in this movie that really delve into theological history. I never really got absorbed into this movie though and it could have been a lot darker in tone and in presentation. This film has nothing to do with film noir, but for some reason that is how it is often being described.

That coupled with the problem of pleasing the books fans (and nerds in general) and attracting more pedestrian movie go-ers who are just as happy to watch the latest Bruckheimer rock video. Overall I think the writers did an excellent job of both, you had the compelling story of one man trying to save himself from damnation, and an especially awful damnation stemming from his occupation, and the usual end of the world type stuff you would expect when you involve God and the Devil.<br/><br/>And Keanu's acting is wooden, but lets be honest people he doesn't get jobs because he can act, he gets them because he looks cool with black hair and presents the overwhelmingly white, stark look that is so appropriate for movies like this and the Matrix.

He did what was required , nothing less nothing more. And no one in the movie could have been much better then they were considering the lousy dialog they were given. And believe me when I say that Keanu can be good, everyone who has seen The Gift knows what I'm talking about. It's sad that Keanu doesn't get more parts like that, that brings out the best in him. This is not an original script at all, and i'ts a bit silly in many parts of the movie. I felt like they wanted to make Constantine to James Bond, only that he was an exorcist, which I didn't like. I wanted something more new and fresh from this movie that I didn't really get. But it is entertaining, and it can bring out a few laughs from you, and it's not like you're falling a sleep during the movie. If your going to look at this movie don't have high expectations, go in to the cinema just looking towards to have a little fun, because it's kind of good at entertaining you. It's not bad considering that this movie is Francis Lawrence first movie he has ever made. I wouldn't say to anyone: Do not look at this movie.

The writing sucked, the direction lacked . . . well, direction, and the whole movie had way too much CGI (this coming from the guy who liked 'Matrix Reloaded'). Yet, why do I like this movie? It's because it falls into the category of ""so bad, they're funny"" movies (aka guilty pleasures). This was definitely a guilty pleasure movie and I will be glad to go see it again. Sure, they're playing off 'the Matrix' and 'the Prophecy'. Sure, they generalize Christianity into just Catholicism (like most of Hollywood). Sure, there are blatant advertisements throughout the film. But it was entertaining to watch and make fun of. Think 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'. I rarely can come up with as many side comments when watching a movie as I could with 'Constantine.' As long as you go into this movie without taking any of it seriously, you can have a pretty good time with it. As far as the movie goes, it's about a 2-out-of-5 stars.

Maybe so, but that doesn't give the production team carte blanch in forgetting what the most important ingredient is when it comes to good cinema: SCRIPTING! I felt the script lacked explanation and left too many loose strings untied. I truly felt dissatisfied, esp. with its denouement. Also, the trailers lead us to believe there's supposed to be some sort of over-the-top special effects, presenting a Hell that is over-the-top as well. At most, less than 10 minutes of the film is devoted to this vision of the netherworld, and only less than a minute was devoted to showing us the seemingly inexhaustible ways demons can torture the damned. In my mind, that scene, if expanded with demonic close-ups inserted, would have lofted this bomb in a more heavenly trajectory. The only bright spot I saw in this film was that it featured Keanu Reeve, one of the finest actors around. But even his presence couldn't keep this stinker from sinking to the depths of Hell itself.

However, despite being able to point out all of these elements, the movie still comes across as being only marginally good and by no means amazing. Somewhere in the process of making this film, the instruction manual for good movies was lost, and all the pieces were thus thrown together haphazardly. And it almost works. Constantine almost achieves the amazing emotional fulfillment that great movies offer, but it somehow falls short. Numerous unrelated events deviate from the otherwise powerful storyline, and you feel like you are reading an essay about the meaning of life where entire paragraphs have been devoted to something completely unrelated. These distracting elements are not unforgivable, but they do take the focus away from the powerful themes of life, death, redemption, purpose, and justice.<br/><br/>So, if you want a movie that deals with these themes in a less-than-perfect way while offering a few thrills and scares along the way, Constantine is for you.

That being said, I was interested in Constantine because, well, I like the stars (Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz), I like the general concept (Heaven vs. Hell), and, well, lamely, it looked neat.<br/><br/>Constantine is mostly concerned with its titular character (Reeves) who apparently died and came back able to see demons and fight them (this is never really made clear, you sort of have to pay attention to pick all that up). He's a pack-and-a-half a day smoker who's grim, taciturn, and takes his job very seriously. He quickly runs into Angela Dodson (Weisz), who is a cop investigating her twin sister's suicide/ possible murder (in another murky bout of storytelling, they don't tell you Weisz is playing twins, so the first fifteen minutes are pure hell to figure out). She thinks there's something altogether mysterious and ooky about it, so she goes to Constantine for help.<br/><br/>Constantine is awash in darkness, from the way the film is shot to its overall tone and subject matter. There's precious little humor in the thing - it takes itself viciously seriously - and mostly the film is a downer. The forces of darkness are suitably twisted and malevolent (Constantine's main enemy on Earth is a demon named Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) who pretty much looks like a lawyer), but the forces of light are no beacon either - besides Constantine himself, there's Chas Chandler (Shia LeBouf, playing exactly the same role as he did in I,Robot) and a host of weirdo sidekicks who know everything about bugs, who live in the back of bowling alleys, etc. Nothing here is normal, or bright - or explained.<br/><br/>One of Constantine's major problems is that very murkiness it embraces - both in the tone of the piece and in the writing. Absolutely nothing is explained - why exactly is a pool of water a conduit to Hell? - and the viewer is left to grapple with one weirdness after another. Apparently Constantine finds it all normal, so I guess we're supposed to as well. But from the get-go, the lack of clarity in both the visuals and the writing makes the film damn hard to get involved in.<br/><br/>Reeves is fine here as the beleaguered hero. His minimalist approach to acting suits the character just fine, and he gives you just enough to have grudging sympathy for John. Weisz, frankly, most of the time looks lost. I know she's a better actress than this material, but she mostly seems to be wandering around in a daze through the whole film (maybe she had already seen it; she could pass for one of the audience). Two of the other important roles - the archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) and Lucifer himself (Peter Stormare) and so badly cast they help wreck whatever scant momentum the film is able to summon up. Swinton seems to have been chosen solely on the basis of resemblance to Cate Blanchett, and Stormare just doesn't have the gravitas to play the King of Hell. When it all comes down at the end, it really feels like Reeves matching up against two 'B' actors - and it's not like anyone is mistaking Keanu for Pacino in the first place.<br/><br/>Constantine has some sharp ideas in it - little thoughtful things here and there sprinkled throughout - but much like the work that inspired it, the film is so busy trying to be cool that it forgot along the way to be good and entertaining as well. I know with the uber-success of Spiderman that a lot of comic book films have been green lighted, and the Blade movies even proved you can go a little dark with them. But not this dark, and certainly not this murky. Purportedly a story about a man trying to escape Hell and win his way back into Heaven, Constantine is more like Purgatory, a drab grey unending plain of nothing, where a sort of grainy twilight prevails. Definitely wait for the DVD, or just skip this one altogether."
"stevetseitz","6","1","14","23 February 2005"," Unoriginal
","This film was a disappointment and the bad news is that I wasn't expecting much. I can almost hear the pitch for this film. "" Instead of being original this film is simply a Keanu vehicle like ""The Matrix"" with some action sequences stolen from ""Blade"", it has the childish pop theology of ""Prophecy"" (although ""Prophecy"" was far better) and it has an apocalyptic finale not unlike that of ""Ghostbusters"". Throw in a supernatural little film-noir/anti-hero gumshoe from ""Cast a Deadly Spell"" and you have ""Constantine"". The film had decent special effects but nothing too amazing by today's standards. I say rent it and save your money."
"lotiwu","5","2","46","8 February 2005"," Tilda Swinton is the best part of this film!
","I went to the premiere in Taiwan yesterday. I like this film, but I have to say that it's not very ""good"". I like it because I love Keanu's face, I love any story about the devil-like good vs. the angelic evil, and I love the angel Gabriel (I'll say more about this later). Therefore I didn't really care whether Keanu's performance is good (in fact it's not) or how stupid the love scenes go in the film. Thank God and Satan, there are only about three scenes in which the director try to persuade us that there are something romantic between Constantine and Angela. He failed. Those scenes last only 1 or 2 minutes, so that's OK.<br/><br/>The angel Gabriel is a big surprise. I didn't know that Tilda Swinton played a part in this film. She's amazing, powerful, and funny. She's the most lovely angel I've ever seen in any films, and I hope this film would become a sequel--just for the chance to see her again. If there are enough people love Tilda's Gabriel like I do, maybe we would have the luck to see Gabriel in Constantine II. (Or just shoot another film ""Gabriel"", I would definitely go for it.)"
"murking","3","1","15","24 February 2005"," Decadent
","I've seen a number of CG hell films in the last couple of years, so I'm familiar with the brand of special effects, including the Matrix effect, used this time with broken glass. But the plot of these style pieces are so thin and incoherent, you feel as if you are in hell, with stale popcorn. I got the feeling this script was written on cocktail napkins in the VP section of the Viper room in LA. Just decadent jaded people who hate living in the so-called city of angels and want to wallow in Navarro-Sixx-Phoenix inspired hell. What more can you ask for than sunshine and abisinthe, I ask while the snow is piling up outside. Keanu is still handsome, I guess, no thanks to his lifestyle and career choices (too many bad Satanic films) He still hasn't been in a film I like since River's Edge (1987) After leaving, I immediately wondered what kind of treatment this will receive on DVD. Is it arty enough to warrant a commentary track, entertaining enough to warrant a featurette. Let's just leave it at mysterious and monosyllabic. 2.0 channel, 5.1 channel and English subtitles will do."
"dreamursie-1","7","1","15","20 February 2005"," surprisingly good
","i really liked it, even though i didn't buy keanu as constantine, at all,& this is really nothing at all like the comics.even though its slow in parts, i was never bored, my interest never lagged, & i was never confused as to what was going on or why.my wife & mother came with me, both of whom aren't usually into this type of movie,& they both really liked it as well, so its not just a guy movie or a fanboy movie like a lot of people think. a lot of the reviews I've read, keep comparing it to the matrix, but its nothing like the matrix, other than keanu wears a trench coat. well, also there's the going back & forth between 2 different worlds thing, but really, its not at all the same, once ya get past the surface. & don't be so quick to leave when its over, apparently i missed what comes after the credits."
"tallguy62","2","1","16","6 March 2005"," Mostly an incomprehensible mess, but special effects were great.
","What is with all the reviewers being enamored by Rachel Weisz? She was almost as horrible an actor as Keanu Reeves was in this film. What did she do in this film that was so spectacular? I'm mystified as to why viewers thought she was so great. She was terrible.<br/><br/>I really liked the first hour or so of this movie. The action was good and the story engaging. It was really quite a good thriller up to that point. However, the suspense falls apart after the first hour of the movie. After the first hour, the plot line does so many twists and turns, you have no idea what is going on. It really is never explained at the end.<br/><br/>I was relieved that one of the reviewers explained that Satan removed the ""cancer"" from Constantine's lungs at the end. I could never figure that scene out because it was never explained. I could never figure out who the Mexican guy was and how he fit into the plot. Who was Gabriel, and how did she figure into the plot? None of this was explained at the end. What a stupid ending!!! The dialog was actually FUNNY. People have said this was unintentional. I'm not so sure. I think it was probably quite intentionally funny, but it didn't do anything to add to this film.<br/><br/>I take issue, however, with those reviewers who have said the special effects were lame. Visually, the special effects in this movie were stunning!! (If you want to see cheesy special effects, watch The Mummy movies). I was quite impressed with the sets (especially the one near the beginning when Angela and Constantine were in the street and the lights all started to flicker and go out. That was a great scene.) The special effects in this movie deserve an ""A""."
"Agent10","7","1","16","27 February 2005"," Decent film, but still full of holes
","To say the least, Constantine wasn't as bad as it could have been. Any film with Keanu Reeves attached to it seriously has a potential Razzie nomination waiting in the wings. But this time around, the film wasn't too bad. <br/><br/>The obvious put downs will be Keanu's rather pitiful acting, which ranged from horrid to downright hilarious. But what proved to be even more annoying was the fact so many people talked in whispers. Speak Up!! Also, a couple of miscasts must be called out, especially with Shia (can't spell his last name) and Gavin Rossdale. Everyone else seemed to fit their roles all right, but those two could have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>But then again, their are plenty of good things. The story was complicated and interesting, which kept you within the story as opposed to being lost in an array of explosions and big-breasted women. All of the occult stuff within the film was also quite engaging.<br/><br/>I guess in the long run, this will be one of those films that will be okay to watch and pick at, just maybe not one you want to buy."
"master_vadim","7","1","17","26 February 2005"," Well worth viewing
","Yes, yes...I know that there are a ton of people out there that will say that the film is not faithful to the original comic series. As is often the case with transferring printed works to screen, compromises must be made simply because they are of two different mediums. As a film, Constantine works. It has an engaging story, excellent visual effects, and fine performances from all the actors save the principal, Keanu Reeves. Unfortunately, Keanu should have never be given the lead in this film as, well there is no easy way to say this, he simply cannot act. If you can't make an audience believe you are coughing, then it's definitely time to go (back?) to acting class. Personally, I would have thought Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play the lead, but such is life. It will be interesting to see what path the studio executives choose to take for the sequel, and of course there will be at least one sequel. Hopefully, they will take a lesson from the two pieces of tripe spawned from the Matrix and focus on story, character development and acting first. These elements, rather than star name branding, should ensure a successful movie franchise."
"Nezz","7","1","18","3 March 2005"," The climax involves something similar to what Keanu Reeves experienced in ""Devil's Advocate.
","The movie seems like it runs a lot longer than its two-hour duration, and depending on how engrossed you are into the story I imagine you might believe otherwise. The special effects are first-class, allowing us long glimpses of Hell and its demons. And while I still say the best visual description of Hell is found in the Robin William flick, ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""Constantine"" is a sweet-looking spectacle.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the film is the detective character. Even though essential to ""Constantine's"" plot, I did not like Angela's story or believe she was a necessary character to tell John's tale. When you see the film, pay close attention to how Angela responds to what she learns early on about the war between Heaven and Hell and compare that to her big revelation near the climax and see if it makes much sense. It's a minor plot hole but sticks out if you too do not find yourself liking the female sidekick.<br/><br/>But ""Constantine"" is unique in that the Heaven/Hell genre is so little explored and rarely does it delve into the controversial aspects of Catholicism. So few films care to talk about the place you ultimately end up at if you don't declare Christ as your Savior at any point in your life. But it's not preached so I'm sure nonbelievers and people of other faiths will find no problem getting into this story and sympathizing with a Catholic destined for eternal torture and suffering.<br/><br/>One fear I had coming into the screening but was quickly put to bed was the fact that the movie was directed by one of those first-timers who's only experience is directing pop music videos. For a guy who's resume is limited to Britney Spears, Will Smith, Sarah McLachlan and Aerosmith, I'd say Francis Lawrence has a promising career ahead of him in film. He doesn't make that mistake so may MTV directors do when they hyper-drive the pace of their films by dissolving it into quick cuts and camera zooms.<br/><br/>If anything, Lawrence keeps the pace slower than the norm, allowing the audience to absorb the brooding scenery and crisp special effects. Whether you appreciate the backdrop or not is the litmus test for how much moviegoers unfamiliar with the graphic novel will enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>As you might expect the climax involves something similar to what Keanu Reeves experienced in ""Devil's Advocate,"" the first film he was in that brought his character face to face with Satan. Here the confrontation isn't nearly as long but gets the point across nicely.<br/><br/>Because ""Constantine"" in print is a long series of graphic novels, there was no way all of it could be condensed into one film. Like the unbelievably bad Marvel screen adaptation of ""Hulk,"" the movie has to spend considerable time covering the basics, and perhaps that is why I believe it doesn't live up to its full potential. With the introductions out of the way (and to be sure. worthy of an entire film by itself) I would not be surprised if an even better sequel is on the way.<br/><br/>Stay seated through the end credits to see what is really the last scene of film, showing what happens to the character I left out of this review."
"cedric_owl","2","1","18","22 February 2005"," So much effort for so little
","How could so much money be spent creating something this joyless? If you like your blockbusters glum, humorless and numbing, then by all means, get in line to see this Gothic mess. All others steer clear.<br/><br/>First of all, this film has the most one-dimensionally pessimistic character in the history of Hollywood movies. Keanu Reeves literally doesn't crack a smile once, from beginning to end. He's not ""conflicted."" Or ""world-weary."" He's just a complete sourpuss with no redeeming qualities. He seems to have a vauge contempt for even his leading lady. I mean, there are plenty of ""dark"" characters in successful studio films (Batman, Sam Malone, even Indiana Jones), but this is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the film is quite artful, even lovely to look at at times. Great special effects. Some truly excellent supporting performances (particularly Tilda Swinton and the great Peter Stormare as one of the weirdest Satans ever). Some remarkably skilled camera-work, and a truly creepy ambiance. But all of this is in service of creating one of the dullest, most unengaging films ever made.<br/><br/>Ah, well, I guess we have Batman to look forward to."
"siegelr","2","1","18","21 February 2005"," Add a Holy Hand Grenade and Killer Rabbits and you've got something.
","This is probably the silliest movie about Catholicism since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The only problem is, this movie takes itself seriously.<br/><br/>Although this film doesn't have a Holy Hand Grenade, it does have a Holy Shotgun. It doesn't have killer rabbits, but it does have demons made out if flies and crabs.<br/><br/>Okay, I admit I have never read the comics this movie is based on, but really! The androgynous Angel Gabriel with hair done up like a sideshow half-man, half woman? A little more creativity would have been nice.<br/><br/>All the characters in this film, except the computer generated ones, seem lethargic. Its as if they're all just getting over the flu or something. Of course, with all those early close-ups of the cigarettes Keanu's character, Constantine, is smoking, you can pretty much guess what his problem is going to be (not many surprises in this movie.). <br/><br/>Everyone on Earth seems to be having such an absolutely miserable time of it, you wonder why they even put up a fight. The depiction of Hell in this film is quite a bit livelier than the depiction of L.A.. Hell almost seems an improvement. Just a bit of urban decay and some fire and brimstone... nothing a bit of cleaning up and a good air conditioner wouldn't take care of. <br/><br/>In summary, if they made a Matrix Episode 12, it would probably be like this movie: sullen, confusing, dark and pointless."
"maxxinewebb","5","1","18","21 February 2005"," Unfortunately, Constantine fails to satisfy
","I went in not knowing what to expect, and for the first two-thirds of the movie, I could suspend disbelief enough to enjoy the story and the moody atmosphere. Unfortunately, as we got closer and closer to the end of the movie, the story gets sillier and sillier and even strained, as if having to explain too much in too little time. Overall, I was disappointed with the fact that this movie has no real suspense and no real sense of danger. All obstacles are overcome much too easily by Constantine and explained away at times by religious mumbo-jumbo that, to me, seems more of a cop-out to end the story neatly than actual plot. It has it's moments, and even Keanu's acting has improved in this film. But unfortunately, although it has decent bits and parts, they don't come together smoothly enough in the end and at times, stalls and strains as it tries to get the point across."
"mr_moviefone-1","5","1","18","20 February 2005"," Like the film's title character, ""Constantine"" is in limbo; it's not a good movie and it's not a bad one.
","Like the film's title character, ""Constantine"" is in limbo; it's not a good movie and it's not a bad one. Instead, ""Constantine"" remains tediously in between what could of made it good and what could of made it horrible, resulting in an uneven, half-baked motion picture that has its moments, just not enough of them to construct an overall success.<br/><br/>The story, based on a series of graphic novels (""Hellblazer""), follows John Constantine, a super natural ""private eye"" so to speak, and his quest to gain access into heaven through his extermination of demons. Born with this curse (or ""gift"" as the archangel Gabriel puts it) of seeing past the earthly guises of angels and demons, Constantine seeks God's redemption, after attempting to commit the ultimate Catholic no-no of suicide back in his days of youth. Along the way, Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) seeks Constantine's help in unraveling the mystery behind her twin-sister's alleged suicide, embarking the two on a journey into a too-close-to-home war between heaven and hell.<br/><br/>John Constantine himself, at least as portrayed in the theatrical version, isn't a very interesting character to behold. His situation is intriguing, his weaponry neat to look at, but ultimately, Constantine comes off as being your typical action-hero, lacking personality, intelligent dialogue, and the basic necessities needed to create a fully dimensional and watchable protagonist. It's hard to say whether this is the fault of the script or the casting of Keanu Reeves, but in any case, the performance can become a bit of a bore. Rachel Weisz as the spiritually curious Angela Dodson is fine, as is Tilda Swinton playing the devious angel Gabriel, but I think the best performance award in this particular film goes to Peter Stomare, who plays the role of Satan quite well the best Satanic performance since Al Pacino's in ""The Devil's Advocate"".<br/><br/>With a two hour running length, ""Constantine"" feels quite a bit longer than what your watch might suggest. In fact, there's a line in the movie that goes a little something like, ""I was dead for two minutes two minutes in hell can feel like a lifetime."" Now, I'm not going to say that ""Constantine"" was a hellish experience (although on a literal level I'd be somewhat correct), but it is a bloated one. Some parts of the film test patience with dialogue sequences that do not enhance character development, but rather the story itself, which can become somewhat complicated to follow if you begin calculating all of the plot holes or if you've fallen asleep midway through (an understandable possibility). I think the film has too much plot with too little development. Luckily for ""Constantine"", the plot is an intriguing one. What would have worked well in this case however, would have been the focus on the character of Constantine himself and his personal dilemmas, saving the rest of the material for another movie, its sequel.<br/><br/>Those faults aside, ""Constantine"" does manage to do a few things right. I found the scenes in which Constantine exorcizes demons from human vessels to be fairly well done and tense. And, like I've mentioned before, the premise itself makes for engaging material even if that material itself is stretched a little too far. The confrontation between Constantine and Satan at the end is low key, but well executed, while the special effects are reasonably good this is probably due to the fact that ""Constantine"" is such a dimly lit film, as opposed to a well-lit one, where special effects flaws would be too easy to distinguish.<br/><br/>Elements from John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" are stolen and used in this contemporary retelling of heaven and hell's battles, as they were in ""The Prophecy"" as well, but the concept never gets old and is almost always interesting. With ""Constantine"" the battle feels modern and can be fun to watch when it's not boring you with the details. After watching ""Constantine"" though, it's hard to tell where its fan base lies. It doesn't have enough action in it to sustain the attention of the under 12 crowd; even though it has some frightening moments or elements rather, the horror junkies won't get their fill; and those seeking adventure will find a movie that has only outbursts of energy that is otherwise muddled by scenes of tedium. Fans of the graphic novels are the only ones I can think of who will, without a doubt love this movie, but even then, I'm unaware of how well adapted the film is because I've never read the source material.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about ""Constantine"" is that it is interesting. It's not always fun to watch, but there are some fun scenes to be seen and at two hours long, there's only about an hours worth that comes across as worthy of the ticket price you paid for admission."
"nclogan2000","5","1","18","20 February 2005"," Constantine is a decent action film.
","Constantine stars Keanu Reeves as the title character. He's a man with the ability to see half-demons, half-humans, and all other strange supernatural doings, fighting them with screeching beetle boxes and a holy-cross shaped shotgun. Rachel Weisz is a detective who needs Constantine to find out if her half-sister really committed suicide, or if the devil made her do it.<br/><br/>Now, the previews led me to believe that they were going to take the premise and run with it, making every attempt to mine the suspense, fun, fright, and cool special effects out of it as much as they can. However, trailers always make you think that way, because they always include the best parts, edited for maximum impact.<br/><br/>The movie itself is decent. It creates a somewhat-complex character out of the two-note Keanu Reeves (which isn't an insult, he can play two notes very well), where his chain- smoking not only represents his way of not dealing with his fate, but also his subconscious desire to bring his life to an end. The special effects are good, especially with the car crash in the beginning. The story gets muddled toward the end, but it still kept my attention. I recommend it as a modest time-passer."
"halal777","7","1","18","20 February 2005"," It was so so. see it for the heck of it.
","I must say that I was skeptical of a biblical based action film, but for a Hollywood representation of the battle of angles vs. demons I was impressed. This film wasn't the greatest thing to grace the big screen but I will give it the points for good ideas and a couple of really interesting camera shots. The acting was decent but probably could have been better. I'm not saying that Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor but this film felt like another Matrix style rehash. Of course this film had to have the plucky sidekick played by that dude from Even Stevens which I thought was completely unnecessary. Basically his character just didn't seem to fit. The presentation of both story and visuals was good. The use of creative camera shot and CG, and a semi-decent developing story line leave this film open for your own opinion. In conclusion this is more of a one-time theater experience to be shared with friends or family. Either check it out once in theaters or wait to be a rental because you are really not missing much. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly nothing special."

","One of the previous reviewers titled his/her review ""God awful"" (sic!) Well, God must be pretty awful to allow for the stable existence of an Universe (ours) where reviews are predominantly concerned with the personal appeal of actors, where _plots_ are regularly confused with _scripts_, and where this movie gathers more than 3 million comic book fans in its opening weekend. <br/><br/>All the recognizable actors in this extended MTV video are flat-liners: they play themselves and thus sustain the same note. But this is not bad per se: a lot of great music is written with just a handful of notes. <br/><br/>The notes of Mr. Reeves, Ms. Weisz, Mr. Hounsou are loud enough but the resulting chord is irritating. What can you expect from a combo of three clichés: 'phase-shifted', 'noir while perky' and 'mysterious foreigner'? <br/><br/>There is no direction to seriously consider (unless one believes that absence of editing is the new hot style of directing). Special effects are uninspired: hell is a sandstorm in Arizona, demons are decomposed. <br/><br/>The movie benefits from Hollywood's current Kabbalistic fad: Archangel Gabriel is played by a woman but is treated like a man (being hit by Constantine, etc.), there exists an alternative Bible for the non-humans (this concept was mangled to make it click with the pseudo-Catholic 'intent' of the movie), etc. The main theological theses, (1) that of God/Devil pact of neutrality and (2) that of human actions as ontological causes of non-humans' existence are also interesting and (I dare say) Zohar-inspired but handled very poorly. <br/><br/>The astounding absence of Gabriel's direct spiritual access to God (in the final scene s/he threatens Satan unaware that God had withdrawn His powers from her/him) is, most likely, just a plot device, as misused as the rest of Catholic mythology. <br/><br/>(Parenthetically: what the heck do screenwriters have against poor old Gabe? Remember Prophecy (1995)? Why Gabriel is such a left-wing/right-wing radical? Leave the guy/girl alone!)<br/><br/>Longinus' Spear is completely wasted here -- see Parsifal by Syberberg to appreciate what can be done with this fascinating mythical device (if brains be used).<br/><br/>Was this movie a disappointment?

So because of this he is trying to buy his way into heaven by casting demons back to hell.<br/><br/>Most people decide to focus on the acting in the movie, but it really wasn't the acting and more of the script. Although the story is interesting, the dialogue is pretty boring. The whole angle of the filmmaker was to try to not make the movie look like a comic book movie, such as Spiderman or X-men, and focus more on the human side of the characters, and they were successful until the end when the typical, he shall return to fight more evil, occurred which caused me to turn off from the movie.

But he failed. Resuscitated against his will, he found himself cast back into the land of the living. Now, marked as an attempted suicide with a temporary lease on life, he patrols the earthly border between heaven and hell, hoping in vain to earn his way to salvation by sending the devil's foot soldiers back to the depths. But Constantine is no saint. Disillusioned by the world around him and at odds with the one beyond, he's a hard-drinking, hard-living bitter hero who scorns the very idea of heroism.

","When watching a movie like this one you often see the potential for the movie to take a unique route. This movie always seems to approach them and when it comes time for this movie to be truly unique it chooses to settle for corny action sequences and dull dialog. Keanu Reeves, for one of the few times in his career, does fit the role played fairly well the only problem is his acting range is so dull it really offers no ability for the director to expand on the character of Constantine. The movie does add lots of flashy special effects in order to try and grab its audiences attention but these effects are often predictable, dull, and in some cases just unnecessary. The movie does add a variety of sidekicks and villains to the film but ultimately their point is nothing more than to slowly move this dimwitted plot along.

Most confusing of all is being thrown into a conflict named the Spear of Destiny.<br/><br/>John despises his life. He has a no given attitude to his demonic society. His knowledge is a curse. His house is protected with chalkboard writings and tiles formation. His services to the church are nothing but merely daily chores.

","Constantine (2005) is a fantastical drama by Francis Lawrence about a man, John Constantine, who possesses the unique ability to see the demons and angels that dwell on Earth. Established to be selfishly motivated, John exorcises demons from the innocent to win the favor of God. Upon meeting a detective, Angela, John assists her in discovering the truth behind her sisters supposed suicide.<br/><br/>The most present aspect I noticed in this film is thread. A large topic in the film is the idea of demons ""crossing the plane"" to Earth and the world in which humans interact. To further this concept, the film continually uses physical planes. While many threads exist, such as the cross, water, and John's cigarettes, I found the glass acting as a means of transport to be interesting. Glass is barrier broken in many scenes throughout the film, as a transparent means of moving from one state to another. In this film, it took the shape of a separating between Earth and Hell, between ignorance and knowledge, and life and death. <br/><br/>The film quite overtly expresses the archetype of light vs darkness in its cinematography and storyline regarding religion and demonology. The light and dark can be related to aspects of good and evil, but also that of enlightenment, as described in Plato's The Allegory of the Cave. Most notably, it serves as a social commentary on suffering and forgiveness. <br/><br/>I found the film to be fascinating, though the plot, at times, seemed obscure. While there are many aspects I can draw out of it, I do not consider it be a film I would watch again. The resolution left me with little satisfaction and the overt hint at attraction between John and Angela didn't seem to add to the plot in any way, making it a distraction and feel unnecessary. I would rate this film an 7/10."

"mounirrmaged","8","0","1","8 August 2016"," a pretty good overlooked comic book movie
","Constantine is a rather unique comic book movie that is unusual in its style and its structural narrative. The movie follows the story of John Constantine, who has the ability to see demons and angels. He is also a demon exorcist. However, despite saving lives, he is no saint. He despises his job and uses it only for his own personal gain, that is to buy his way into heaven. He is a bitter character who, at first, is unlikable and uncomfortable to be with, but you still are intrigued by his journey. By the end, the character grows on you morally due to his selfless act when he sacrifices himself to save Isabelle by sending her to heaven. The film might be at first a simple good versus evil story. But as the film progresses, much more is brought out, but done with subtlety. Now before i go into my review, i want to address that this movie is not 100% loyal to the comic. But it still honors the source material in its own unique, creative way. Just like Jim Carrey's the mask is different from the source material, this movie does the same as well, and i am glad we got this version. Now the movie is indeed flawed, as its directing style is over the top and some of the performances are very cheesy, but through clever writing and careful direction, the film turns out in a very interesting path for the viewer to observe. I also love how this movie identifies very clearly the difference between knowing God and believing in one, which is an important element in the story for Constantine to grow as a character. Constantine is the big gun of the movie. The rest of the characters, some are interesting(such as Gabriel, changing from your typical beloved peaceful angel to the angel who would do anything to ""save"" humans, even if it means releasing the son of the devil himself, which questions if pure good can always stay that way. The movie elevates the themes of good versus evil to a new unique direction, which gives this film its strength and interest. Its a superhero movie disguised as a biblical epic, which helps elevate the themes of good versus evil and the themes of faith to a higher ground. Now like i said the film is not perfect and it does have its flaws, like some of its direction can be over the top, some of the performances are cheesy and some of the effects are outdated. But the story and the character arc of John Constantine makes this a very unique comic book movie that i wish it gets more appreciation. 7.5/10 from me"
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","0","2","3 February 2016"," Underrated supernatural noir
","I have a soft spot for the 2005 adaptation of Hellblazer's Constantine, starring an out of left field Keanu Reeves as the smart ass, chain smoking demon hunter. Yeah, he's a far cry from the sassy, blonde and severely British incarnation from the source material, but oddly enough it works with Reeves (helped along by the fact that I have no nostalgia for the comics, and went into this one without previous knowledge of the mythos). Reeves is a sulking badass as John Constantine, a man with extreme supernatural proclivities who dedicates his days and nights to stopping the terrifying legions of the dead, who walk the earth in many forms. He's a jaded, cynical loner whose last ounces of life force go into his work, his only companion being chatty cab driver Chazz (Shia Lebeouf). He's also terminally sick with lung cancer, putting additional strain on his body as well as his heaving soul which is a blinking target for all kinds of demonic forces who have their eyes set on him. When a desperate homicide detective (Rachel Weisz) gets caught up in a spooky situation involving the suicide of her sister (also Weisz), John steps up to her side to both protect and assist her in keeping the darkness at bay, which this time threatens to put the hammer on humanity big time. Plot is appropriately pulpy, with darkly comic exposition from Reeves in all the right places, mixed in with some neat special effects. The atmosphere impressively paints an inky black, suffocating tone of otherworldly noir that almost calls to mind entries like Blade Runner and The Crow, albeit lite. The supporting cast contains many strange friends and foes for John, including eccentric ally Beeman (Max Baker), an alcoholic schlub of a priest (underrated, shifty eyed Pruitt Taylor Vince), slickly nasty demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), underworld kingpin Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou radiating superb charisma) and Tilda Swinton as a sneering, androgynous Angel Gabriel. Another performance I must note is Peter Stormare as Lucifer, in one of the funniest, most memorable film incarnations of the role I've ever seen. Stormare always has a wonky way about him, his dialogue delivered flippantly, juxtaposed with a cold, constant gaze that could melt flesh. Put to work as the Devil, he makes magic, playing him as a giddy, white suited, tribal tattooed lunatic with a restrained menace that only hints at the archetypal fury beneath. Reeves makes a surprisingly cool Constantine (lol I may get some hate for saying that), and besides the fact that he's not much like what the comics envisioned, he carries this version along just fine. The holy hand grenades are a highlight, as well as many other creative touches both bold and subtle that go a long way."

I find the angel and demon lore intensely captivating and Keenu's performance of the character spot on. There is nothing he could have done better, his darkly sarcastic take was superb in every sense of the word. I would not have wanted anyone else to play this role in any other way. Shia LaBeouf adds a dash of humor and although has a more limited role, manages to connect meaningfully with the viewer, while Rachel Weisz delivers a beautifully haunting performance without which the film would have been somewhat empty.<br/><br/>The film is really dark, yet palatable.

"fedor8","Null","0","4","13 December 2014"," How terrifying can these demons be if Roger Federer's boyfriend Gavin Rossdale is one of them?
","You wanna hear a good joke? Rachel Weisz – police detective. Hilarious, huh? I've got another one: Tilda Swinton – as angel Gabriel. Want more? This one's even funnier: Tilda Swinton as angel Gabriel telling Keanu ""you're f**cked"". I half-expected a ""yo, bro"" to be thrown in there as well.<br/><br/>But here's the best joke of them all: Shia LeBoef – horror-movie superhero-sidekick comic-relief actor. If you're immune to annoying actors, you might be forgiven for thinking that his name was the joke here – although, in all fairness, his name IS damn funny. <br/><br/>I'm not out of bad jokes yet, and neither is this horribly cast movie. How about this one: Gavin Rossdale in a horror film – as a semi-demon, sort of a Hell-beast Halfling. I mean, we already know he is half-man half-mouse, but telling us he's half-demon as well is definitely stretching our patience and imagination – not to mention the basics of mathematics since both halves are already taken. Roger Federer's Numero Uno fan and secret gay lover. Bromance shromance: their love is real. Federer's marriage is a Travolta-like sham and both sets of his twins are test-tube babies. But I digress. This is a review of a Keanu flick.<br/><br/>Honestly, the way this movie's abysmal casting was unfolding, I was half-expecting Al Sharpton to appear as Satan. Although, admittedly that would at least make some sense. Clearly, the casting director is high on crack, pretty much all of the time. I hope he got his act together after all these years, so perhaps he isn't preparing to cast Matt Damon as the Dalai Lama, or Jennifer Aniston as a sexy woman.<br/><br/>Also cocaine-happy is the script-writer. He makes Rachel a god-fearing Catholic who is adamant about having a Catholic funeral for her sister, even stooping so low as to actually degrade herself by begging a boy-fondling Catholic priest to grant her sister a proper religious burial so she doesn't end up in hell – yet that same day she tells Keanu that she doesn't believe in the Devil. Say what? Sure, most of us know that Catholics are very confused creatures, but even they ought to be able to follow the simplest rules of the religion they abide to. To summarize: Weisz believes in Hell – fears her sister will end up there – yet doesn't believe in the Devil. Who the hell does she think runs Hell then? Mahatma Gandhi? Che Guevara? Adolf Hitler? Joe Stalin? Evita Peron? (Admittedly, all those could run it, and run it well.)<br/><br/>Keanu acts pretty weird too; after coming back from a brief visit to Hell – which is supposed to be burning hot, last time I checked a raving and ranting sermon - he asks Rachel for some food, not water. So the Catholic Oven evokes hunger? What the hell is wrong with this writer? Still, at least the writer has a sense of humour; he informs us that in order to visit Hell, all you need is one bathtub, 50 gallons of water, and one Keanu Reeves to drown you in it. That's a hoot.<br/><br/>The movie does redeem itself somewhat by the surprising appearance of Peter Stormare as the Horned One (or at least the Bald One, in this case), and he doesn't disappoint. However, nothing and nobody could have truly remedied the anguish of having to watch androgynous Tilda Swinton impersonate an angel – or just having to see Tilda Swinton, period. Her/his/its ""performance"" is the worst I've ever seen of any actor trying to do an angel – Gabrielish or otherwise – in the history of horror or comedy. This blue-blooded in-bred pink-orange mutant from a age-old inferior lineage of Scottish nobility (a result no doubt of centuries of Swintonian uncles molesting their Swintonian nieces), with her curly ginger locks and thick manly goalkeeper hands, lends the movie an air of absurdity and lack of seriousness that it doesn't deserve – even as a flick based on a stupid comic-book. After all, the script isn't essentially bad, and the action scenes and visual effects are fine. <br/><br/>The less said about Federer's love interest, the better. Except that he's one of the worst post-grunge Cobain imitators on record, during his brief but profitable corporate-sponsored heyday(s) as the frontman of Bush – ironically named so considering that he swings the other way. Which way? Switzerland, as I'd already mentioned."

It was a well done horror flick as this type of genres goes. <br/><br/>It starts out as a tale about a police detective who's twin sister committed suicide and she can not believe it because her sister was a devote catholic. In her efforts to find out if her sister actually killed herself she contacts this psychic. This is where the supernatural horrors begin. We get demons, angels, the devil, hell, and heaven all in the classic tale of good and evil enhanced by CGI special effects. <br/><br/>The acting was good. The screenplay interesting enough to keep your attention, although the story was a bit on the fantastic side. I will say I did enjoy the movie."

","It's such an Easy Thing to do. Make Fun of Keanu Reeves Acting Ability or Lack Thereof, but that is a Constant and a Given. Let's move on and Sling the Arrows at Someone Else. Like Shia LaBaeouf for Example, if there is a more Annoying Actor Around, God Help Us (""John how is it going John...John take me along John...John I'm ready John...John, John, John, look out John."") Sheesh!<br/><br/>Here in this DC-Vertigo-Comic called Hellblazer, Adaptation, is a Supernatural/Horror Noir with Angels and Demons that are just Scary and Helpful Enough to make this Over Produced, sometimes Good Looking, Franchise Wannabe, a Passable Effort that is one of those Great/Awful Movies depending on Your Point of View.<br/><br/>The Film Fails to be Edgy Enough, like the Comic, or Bizarre Enough, like the Comic, or Darkly Humorous Enough, like the Comic, to make it Rise from the Ashes of a Coming Post Apocalypse to Anything more than just OK.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton Steals the Acting Accolades, but that was not Hard. Rachel Weisz seems to get a Pass here with Praises of being a Real Actor, as Opposed to that Poser Reeves, but She might change Her Expression Once in this Two Hour Movie and Her Voice Never Modulates one way or another. <br/><br/>Now if that is Good Acting, it must be that Eye of the Beholder Thing because it is in Fact just Showing Up and Looking Cute. She is Never Convincing as a Police Detective, Sulking and Whining about Her Twin Sister. <br/><br/>Overall this is an Imperfect and Often Annoying but Somehow Watchable Movie."
"eddie052010","4","0","3","21 February 2014"," Devilishly boring.
","Comic book movies. Today, they are some of the most profitable movies around, with franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Spider- Man and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy raking in their millions. Due to the success of these films, many companies want to have a slice of the comic book movie pie and therefore others start to appear, some good (Watchmen) others rubbish (Catwoman, Sin City). This is more on the latter side. While not being completely awful, Constantine is still a below par attempt to cash in on the comic book movie craze, with bad acting, an unoriginal plot and an achingly slow pace to boot.<br/><br/>The plot is that cop Angela Dodson (played by Rachel Weisz) is investigating the suspicious death of her sister Isabel, and releases that it may have a more supernatural explanation. She gains the help of Constantine (played by Keanu Reeves), who has personal experience with the supernatural, as he is a demon hunter. Together, they discover a more sinister plot, which could lead to the apocalypse. The plot here is one of the big problems with the film, as it is blatantly unoriginal, and gets really tedious because of it. It steals from films like Alien, Pitch Black, The Prophecy and End of Days, and doesn't come up with enough original ideas to excuse this, especially due its clear intention as a franchise starter.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the movie's pacing kills any sort of enjoyment you might have. For the majority of the running time, the plot is spoon fed to the audience with long, drawn-out exposition which instead of opening up this new world to the audience, making them feel like they've been lectured for 2 hours. This also means that there's very little action, and when it does come, its bland and really lame, with Keanu Reeves repeatedly shooting demons in slow motion. It's also disappointing that even though hell is brought up a lot in the film, it is barely in the film, not even being used as the setting for the climax, making the film feel more underwhelming. It's like this movie wasn't confident enough to show off its world and what it had to offer, so it just talked about it instead, which is an amateur writing mistake (not surprising, considering the writers previous credits include Suburban Commando and The Glimmer Man). This mistake is a more fatal one considering how this movie wants to be a franchise starter, but its tell don't show structure makes it hard for the audience to care about showing more of the world. Even Twilight, with its silly stories, at least showed off more of its world, making it more open to sequels and makes it more deserving as a franchise starter.<br/><br/>Another thing to comment on is the dreadful acting. Keanu Reeves, unsurprisingly is as wooden as ever and Rachel Weisz seems to be more concerned with perfecting her American accent than trying to deliver a great performance. It's such a shame, seeing how the supporting actors, particularly Shia Laboeuf and Tilda Swindon have much more charisma and bring a lot more energy to the film, showing off how much fun they're having in their roles. <br/><br/>The characters are also uninteresting as well, and are very two- dimensional at best. It's funny how the writers gave out so much exposition for the plot, that they couldn't give their characters and sorts of interests or any third dimensions in the process. Sure many of Christopher Nolan's films lack in character but at least make up for it with exciting stories and great set-pieces, something which this movie is sorely absent of. Considering its intention as a franchise starter and its huge budget ($100 million) this is flat out inexcusable, and makes the movie miss its mark completely. <br/><br/>Overall, this is just a failed attempt as a comic book movie franchise, due to its many faults. If you are looking for a good action movie of biblical proportions, watch The Da Vinci Code or The Prophecy, as they are much more fun and are more worthy of your time. Just leave this boring mess to rot and burn in the fires of hell. After taking away two hours of your life, that is the treatment that it deserves."

","A. Why is Shia LaBeouf in this movie? Do you owe him money? Does he have a picture of you getting it on with a ten year old? Did he promise you sexual favors for the role? Could you not find another coked-out boy- band reject, in L.A.? B. Why was this movie so watered down? Has the lowest common denominator proved to be a loyal and reliable audience in the past? Was the concern that if the movie was made well no one would go and see it? Did you not know that movies are allowed to be good? C. Did you know that there is a comic book series called Hellblazer, that's all about John Constantine? Was it too difficult to just use the comic as the movie's story-board? Did you just not want to pay the comic book writers for the screenplay? D. Did you not know that computer generated images look fake? Did you not know that by using lighting, puppets,make-up artistry and blood packs you can make special effects look real? You spent one hundred million dollars to make this movie, did you know you could have made ten movies for that price?"

","If Hell has cars, then I'd hate to be there to see what's occupying the hot country. Probably '77-'78 Mustang II's, Pontiac Azteks, and newer Fords. Let's clear this once and for all: Reeves is NOT an actor. He's a celebrity. Besides Bill and Ted, I thought he was offensively appalling. If you've seen Point Break, you can observe that Reeves was still nursing that Valley boy drawl. If he's such an actor, why can't he play anyone besides an apathetic savior in The Matrix or pompous Jonathan Harker in Dracula ? I hear Reeves is a perfectionist and pretty unforgiving of his ""performances"". Well did Lawrence bother to screen the dailies of Constantine in front of him to rectify that ? Or is Lawrence fond of printing EVERY take ? Reeves doesn't convey the range of emotions like his peers. The same stoic, introverted character who guzzles whiskey and chain-smokes. It seems Reeves had struggled to eek out a comic character who's pretty self-destructive. The movie doesn't fail completely, it's just the weight of it, is on Reeves who's grossly miscast. The frivolous responses just seem to evade any semblance of capability. There's no over-acting here. That would impugn Reeves knows how to act. Otherwise, he just seems to go through the motions and gave Lawrence a plethora of apathetic takes where he just doesn't cut it. Did the requisites for the role say: ""No enthusiasm needed"" ? I deduce...Yes. I mean Reeves can probably relate on some level and click with Constantine's moral constituition if not his over-indulgent tendencies. It's not like asking him to portray Vo Nguyen Giap. Reeves has no range. I don't mean he has unlimited range. I mean no diversity. Stormare and Swinton had fun and it shows. Cam't say that for Reeves. Unless he wasn't in character the whole shoot."
"mytyde","3","0","2","21 October 2012"," Misogyny and Anti-Latino Racism in the movie Constantine (2005)
","Anti-Mexican racism In the movie, a Mexican guy poking around in a decaying building in the desert finds the 'spear of destiny' (Lance of Longinus) wrapped in a Nazi flag, which grants him superpowers to break stuff and jump high. He immediately starts walking and crosses the street without looking, mangling the car that crashes into him. He keeps walking straight to the American border and uses his new superpower to jump right over the barbed wire border fence. In a deleted scene, he is confronted after crawling under the fence by two border patrol officers, who he threatens menacingly and somehow forces to shoot themselves. Then he walks up to a white guy sitting in his car at WalMart and murders him for the car. Meanwhile the rest of the movie is going on between a bunch of white people. The Mexican guy arrives for the climax after having driven straight to Los Angeles, and he attacks the heroine in a crucifix-shaped pool and drowns her (to send her to hell). When the hero arrives to save her, the Mexican man's corpse is briefly shown floating in the pool, then it (suspension of disbelief) disappears by the next shot. There is no other reference to the spear of destiny having some mystical power to possess people and make them do the devil's bidding, and both main characters later handle it without difficulty. Since he had no presumed foreknowledge, the only plausible explanation is that the Mexican man was already in the service of the devil. I'm just surprised he didn't stop to steal some American jobs and collect welfare before completing his ridiculous Odyssey to the movie center.<br/><br/>Rape imagery and Misogyny The first scene with the protagonist was an exorcism of a Latina girl which startlingly paralleled how a rape scene would have gone: she is tied down by her Latino community, the hero-exorcist (Constantine) dehumanizing her by covering her mouth and eyes while a scream tries to escape her throat. Then Constantine denies her and her community witness to the act of the final exorcism (themes of WITNESS are important in psychology). When one Latino man looks he falls back against the wall in pain. I won't extrapolate that trapping the demon in the mirror and forcing it out the window was an extension of the same story, though it could be noted that 1/3 of rape victims contemplate suicide and many perpetrators are never prosecuted. There's also the issue of violence against women. Constantine drowns the heroine in his bathtub without warning her beforehand (to send her to hell at her behest); does that seem like even human behavior? Not surprisingly, she expresses some tacit interest in the nihilistic, misogynistic protagonist who complains about getting to fight demons for a living."
"Hey_Sweden","4","0","3","6 August 2012"," Two hours in Hell with Keanu Reeves.
","The film star here at least gets a role in which being monotonous is not such a bad thing. In this adaptation of the ""Hellblazer"" comic book series, John Constantine (Reeves) is a detective of sorts, dealing in the supernatural - dispatching demons, that sort of thing. He meets a young female detective, Angela Dodson, played by the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Angela's twin sister has committed suicide, and this serves as a catalyst for apocalyptic goings-on, as Angela, like her departed sibling, has had the ability to see strange things for many years now. Soon John, who has been to Hell and back, is battling the forces of darkness once again. Director Francis Lawrence unfortunately doesn't bring a lot of life to this nightmare story. The fact that it's as dreary as it is is actually acceptable given what kind of story it is, but it's kind of hard to care too much about the characters. There is some humour, but it's often of the dark variety, keeping in tone with the balance of the movie. The people who deserve the most credit are those creating all of the morbid visuals. One thing that can be said about ""Constantine"" is that it *looks* just great, with superb art direction, set decoration, cinematography, and various practical and digital special effects. However, these elements can only help so much as this film overall feels too familiar. Granted, it's got some good ideas, like using water as a conduit between worlds. And it does get better as it goes along, with a delicious confrontation between John and Satan himself, played with his typical flair by Peter Stormare. The supporting cast is extremely effective, with Tilda Swinton cast as the renegade angel Gabriel, Pruitt Taylor Vince as the frightened Father Hennessy, singer Gavin Rossdale (of the rock group Bush) as smooth and dapper villain Balthazar, the magnetic Djimon Hounsou as the character Midnite, and comedy relief provider Shia LaBeouf as John's sidekick Chas. The movie is generally quite oppressive, and it's easy to see how it could divide its viewers into ""love it"" or ""hate it"" camps. This viewer felt that it had its assets, but couldn't overcome a general lethargy. Four out of 10."
"amethystwings32","5","0","2","15 May 2012"," disturbing!
","This movie is about a life that is trapped between,heaven and hell; was very dark tormented. It was also disturbing,and yet, I found myself in bits of the torment of the soul that was trapped. I at times found myself feeling sorry for him. That is my mom's spin on this paranormal movie. Of inner demons from within, my take was though it was disturbing and graphic in aspects. Is that strikes deep into the very depths of our soul, and we at times feel like prisoners . Trapped between the darkness of despair or the light of hope. With no way to escape so we are held captive in our own misery. Much like the character in which Keanu portrayed. So intensely with his somber and brooding appeal. Not suitable for those with squeamish stomachs due to the blood and demonic violence! All and all we would give it a B++."
"drqshadow-reviews","5","0","1","20 February 2012"," Neither as Good as I'd Hoped Nor as Bad as I'd Feared
","As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become."
"mike-2675","Null","0","2","30 August 2011"," Dogma: The Dark Side
","Constantine begins as a somewhat pedestrian Gothic horror-fest, replete with exorcisms, demon-gore and holy artifacts being deployed as aggressively as Uzis. Early into the first act, however, one is drawn into an intelligently-drawn setup - a Cosmic opera of demonic and angelic ""half-breeds,"" all infused with the petty rivalries so ordinary to humanity. That it is infused with a dark humour with an arc all of its own adds to its charm - the steady thrum of sarcasm pulses through the film, building to a crescendo of wit worthy of the best of comic tragedy.<br/><br/>The film deftly articulates the inherent contradictions in the search for personal salvation. The desire to go to heaven is, after all, a selfish pursuit.<br/><br/>It is flamboyant in its holy irreverence, and in this aspect it reminded me of Kevin Smith's Dogma. The ""tone"" of the two films couldn't be any more different, but both of them manage to satirize our anthropomorphization of the afterlife, and to ultimately give us a grand laugh at ourselves.<br/><br/>The middle-distance-stare of Keanu's acting chops is perfect for his role here, and I have to give an special mention to Tilda Swinton as the tightly-wound angel Gabriel."
"TheMara61","10","0","3","4 April 2011"," State of Art
","Yes, Constantine raised a lot of criticism and it was also extreme admiring. However, is it not the only definition of a great state of art? I admire Keanu Reeves because he has a certain feeling for acting in these controversial roles. And, My God, he is given his soul to us, every moment of playing. Maybe he was Constantine all that time. So, themes: Believe in God; make redemption for your mistakes. Those themes sounds so, so common. Yet they are genial proposed to us in that movie. I cannot end this comment, probably never ever be read by someone. In the end, I have seen Constantine in Amsterdam in2005, now on my laptop (legally bought), and the movie let me speechless. Example: Keanu REEVES. Like... the challenge of Keanu fighting with the worm man, in real world he ingenious fights with none. All team just try to create something special, and I am so sorry because in the movie the whole work behind the scenes is unidentified. Probably what they do every time into a movie. And, sorry, the Gabriel Angel Tilda was herself a state of art."

","John Constantine played by Keanu Reeves, and his sidekick Chas Kramer (Shia LeBeouf) are our earthly guardians who keep Satan's minions and bad angels in check. In fact Constantine has taken such pleasure in returning Satan's bad boys back to Hell that Satan has sworn that when Constantine dies, his soul is the one soul that he would leave Hell for.<br/><br/>Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) a police investigator has a twin sister who apparently has committed suicide at a hospital. Angela cannot believe her sister would ever commit suicide, being Catholic, so she must have been murdered. It is at this point that both Constantine and Dodson meet. Something supernatural is suspected, and Constantine being who he is, is the best candidate at solving this crime.<br/><br/>Pruitt Taylor Vince plays Father Hennessey a retired priest who can perceive/hear voices as his special gift; assists Constantine with his investigation until his untimely suicide/murder.<br/><br/>Enter in Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) the evil Satan overlord on earth. he is always around when something goes wrong.

"random_avenger","5","0","4","31 July 2010"," Constantine
","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a demon-hunter whose job is to find and send half-demons back to Hell when they try to invade the normal world. By doing this he hopes to ultimately save his own soul that has been doomed to Hell due to a suicide attempt many years ago. When he teams up with a female LAPD detective Dodson (Rachel Weisz) he may have a chance to finally redeem himself for good by locating the Spear of Destiny, a powerful magical object that is very dangerous in wrong, demonic hands.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Hellblazer comic book series on which the movie is based, but the film doesn't really stand out much among other modern action-fantasies. The story is quite action-driven and lacks atmosphere despite attempts to make the sets and characters ooze coolness and mystery. Some of the exorcisms and hellish ordeals actually come across as rather comical; I don't think this is all intentional considering the tone of the rest of the film, even though it must be noted that there is clearly some intentional humour too. The visions of Hell and some of the demons look somewhat cool though, but the impact is significantly diminished by very obvious CGI effects like in so many other films that came out before and after it – a shame, really. The cinematography is pretty good throughout though.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie are the characters. Keanu Reeves has never been the most charismatic of actors but John Constantine is never given much time to develop in the midst of the action anyway, so I'm not sure if there was much anyone could have done with the role. Rachel Weisz in a double role cannot bring her characters to life either and Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's young assistant is just annoying. Nevertheless, I did like Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer himself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a few good actors and decent photography cannot carry a whole film alone. Constantine isn't completely useless but doesn't offer much to friends of suspense-driven horror films or kick-ass actioners. It works alright as harmless pastime and can be watched for light entertainment though; perhaps those with an interest in Christian demon mythology will find it more enjoyable."

I can't really put my finger on it. The plot line was complete nonsense, but maybe that's why. Maybe ever once in a while you have to forget the seriousness of life, not worry about it not making sense and just enjoy what's there. What is there is a perfectly fine film.

Keanu Reeves was without a doubt the perfect John Constantine, I loved every second of his character. Rachel Weisz did an excellent job only i wish her and John could've had a stronger bond/love connection towards each other. My only BIG BIG problem with the movie is there wasn't enough Shia Labeouf. His character Chaz could've gone so much farther in the story than it did and I am soooooooo not pleased that he was killed in the end but I guess the very last part of the movie makes up for it ( he looked hot as an angel :) ) I L-O-V-E-D LOVED Gavin Rosdale! who would have suspected him of being that great and I thought this film's version of Satan ROCKED.

"quiropiuscochannel","6","0","2","21 December 2009"," Constantine had the material and potential to be a great film, but it was worked with the wrong hands
","Constantine had a very interesting storyline and concepts of the ocult, the hell and heaven, and a very interesting character as well along with the mysterious and bizarre ambientation. Warner Pictures had a great graphic novel to work an adaptation, Hell Blazer, which features a lot of original material like few literary works can about the ocult, the religion, and mystery. However, when the directors previous works have been about a few TV episodes of not too popular TV series then you got problems... It could have been significtly better with a director with previous works and similar films. Keanu Reeves was not bad portraing John Constantine, however, I think it took his role of ""Serious and Mysterious guy"" too far, he is completely inexpressive in this film. Yeah, I know Keanu is not the most expressive actor ever but he could do better portraying a more depressed and sad constantine instead of a Neo kind character, all mysterious and inexpressive. The special effects were not bad but i think they could add a lot of more demons and action scenes, because the few this film has are too short and mediocre if you ask me. John could have a much more interesting fight with the insect demon, Balthazar, Gabriel, and also i think it short journey to hell should last longer, also that scene where he killed the demons in the sky was too short. I mean, the movie was long but it was concentrated on boring chats between Constantine and Angela. Im not saying the situations and scenes in this movie were bad, they were great in the initial idea but they were not well worked. Satan's actor was not compatible, Gabriel's angel suit was very bad disigned, and the fat guy who helped constantine was not too compatible with the actor if you ask me. Constantine's assistant, Chas, needed a bigger part in the film. In conclusion: The movie was very interesting, the storyline is very original, bizarre, mysterious, dark, the character is very interesting, the concept and ambientation are great but i think that if Keanu Reeves would acted a bit more according to his comic book character, They choosed a different director and give some details to the script it would have been an Excellent Film."

Hellblazer is, generally, a dark, cynical and intelligent comic with lots of twisted characters and ambiguous plot lines, Constantine is a straight forward action film with some dark elements.<br/><br/>For once Reeves wooden acting suits a role, Constantine is moody and uncommunicative allowing Reeves to be brooding without having to stretch any acting muscles, Weisz is OK as the romantic interest and the rest of the cast have almost nothing to do. Stormare is quite bad as the devil but that has more to do with the direction than the acting.<br/><br/>The plot runs along at a good pace with a few surprises and plenty of action and although the ending is overplayed and almost farcical in some parts it is still done quite well.<br/><br/>This is a simple and enjoyable film, nothing to get excited about but a pleasant enough way to spend some time."

I don't believe that it does, so I count the dark aspects of Constantine as a downfall.<br/><br/>The plot line was weak, and just like the later Matrixes, the only leg that the movie stands on is it's special effects.<br/><br/>Please, Keanu Reeves, king of the dopes with surfer-dude attitude, go die in a ditch.

","This film has no plot. It has no characters. It is mere gibberish. It is more proof that film makers know that all they need to do is establish a few high octane action scenes with lots of pizzaz in the previews to get audiences, knowing full well that a few crackheads will be in awe of the comical camera shots, with the quick ignorant cuts and zooms for no reason, except to confuse the viewer. The more naive viewers will be fooled, much like the emperor with no clothes. More than anything, this is a cigarette commercial. Anyone even resembling a romantic male character must smoke cigarettes constantly. It is not even subtle. It is ""in your face"" smoke the whole movie. In fact, it is not possible to watch this movie without feeling like your choking to death, unless you're a right wing cigarette fanatic. Aside from that, nothing makes sense. Nothing is explained, and to top it all off, the characters can't speak coherently. Illegal immigrants speak better English than these drama school rejects. Horribly directed, horribly scripted, horribly acted. Nothing to like. Hard to see anyone rating this garbage over a ""1""."

","There is a scene in this movie in which a detective with supernatural powers uses a cat as a portal into Hell. I turned to my cat, Josefina, usually keen on the heuristics of these things, and asked if she found this in any way offensive. ""Absolutely,"" she replied, turning her eyes from the screen in disgust. I gave it a good mulling-over that night, and the next day asked Josefina if she would have found it more acceptable if the portal to hell had been provided by another animal -- say, a dog -- but by that time the effects of my herbal psychotropics had worn off and, if Josefina answered, I didn't hear it.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays a nice Catholic girl who's sister has apparently committed suicide. Weisz wants her buried in sacred ground, though, and she knows her sister would never kill herself. So she turns to Ke'anu Reeves, who has a reputation for knowing stuff about the supernatural.<br/><br/>It turns out he knows quite a lot. There are angels in Heaven and devils in Hell. The problem is they can't pass into the realm of the quotidian, so they send ""half breeds,"" half-angels or half-devils, whose powers are limited to ""whispering in our ears."" Or so he says. Some of them resemble Harpies of Greek mythology or horrible deformed creatures out of ""The Garden of Earthly Delights."" Considering that they're limited to merely whispering, they do a good job of throwing bodies around and filling the streets with flapping bat-like wings.<br/><br/>I won't go on about it. The movie stinks. The dialog has lines like, ""You're trying to buy your way into Heaven."" And, ""God is a kid with an ant farm."" (Actually, come to think of it, that last one is pretty funny but I don't think it was meant to be.) The wind-up is that Reeves gives Weisz a crash course in the writer's version of how things work in this all-too-Christian cosmology and, expectably, it's all an excuse to hang a lot of computer-generated effects on. There are no surprises. The only thing that could have saved this trite piece of trash would have been the introduction of an Eskimo cosmology, with Hell consisting of seven levels of cold, and Sedna lording it over all.<br/><br/>Reeves, in poor fettle, rarely departs from his imitation of a mahogany idol. Rachel Weisz is more animated, a better actress, and beautiful in a not-quite Hollywood way.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Something is whispering in my ear. It's saying, ""Don't bother."""

Keanu Reeves was no good and Rachel Weisz was fantastic and saved the movie and lastly the script sucked. It was almost like these comments came off an assembly line. Ignore them they do not know what they are talking about.The true situation here is we have a lot of Keanue haters with no originality in their comments at all.<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining, intelligent, with crisp dialogue. Keanue did a solid job as did Rachel however I reserve my best praise for Peter Stormare who played Satan. I watched this movie twice just for his scene which had me laughing and had me somewhat on the edge of my seat knowing he is capable of very bad things and at any moment could let loose which is exactly what was intended. Tilda Swinton did a believable job as Gabriel, in fact I cannot fault anyone in this movie.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate in recommending this to anyone unless of course you do not like Keanue in which case he could give an Oscar winning performance in any movie and you would not like it so do yourself a favour and do not bother to rent this DVD.<br/><br/>I would normally rate this movie about a 7 (about 3 points higher than any comic book adaption I have seen apart from Batman Begins, everything else is crap).

","People should stop bitching when their favorite comic book gets turned into a mediocre film - go home and read, then. You were the better for it in the first place. Film is a different, less autonomous, more capitulating medium. And for what it is, this is better than it might have been.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou, Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare are more than most summer pictures deserve or get, and they help raise CONSTANTINE above the company it normally would keep. But they don't do the whole job themselves. The visuals are frequently outstanding, grim in the most cartoonish sense, particularly the imagining of hell as a thermonuclear freeway. The story is just complicated enough always to be interesting, with less banal dialog and more interesting characters than your average post-'73 exorcism extravaganza. And how many Keanu Reeves leap-and-explode soundtracks include half a Dave Brubeck tune? <br/><br/>Francis Lawrence demonstrates a better first-feature handle of story and pace than any music video graduate since Spike Jonze. He is helped out by a script in which the hundred little details that make this kind of movie work - the demonic affinity for mirrors, entering hell by strangling a cat or riding the Sing Sing hotseat - are exotic without being stupid. Lawrence also exercises very good sense in allowing every other actor more dialog than Keanu Reeves. Mr Reeves is most cinematically valuable as a suit model, and his acting does jeopardize a scene or two in this film, but it must be said he is at his most restrained and credible for the most part.<br/><br/>Something about CGI makes most directors go a little crazy. Sure, it seems like a useful way to get your ideas on the screen, but the programs and processes are still evolving, and can't do everything yet. CGI can represent inanimate objects perfectly, monsters and some animals very well, but as of 2005 the human form still looked like a video game, out of sync with the rest of the landscape. The second couple of Matrix movies and the first couple of Spider-Mans graphically illustrate this among other weaknesses. CONSTANTINE stretches but rarely exceeds the limits of its technology; except for the bilious water effects in Pruitt Taylor Vince's demise, the production wisely shadows the least perfected animation to reduce necessary detail, and does what it can do with sometimes dazzling mastery.<br/><br/>As far as cute geek sidekicks are concerned, CONSTANTINE is stuck with two of them, three if you count the aforementioned guy who can't keep his eyes focused; Shia LaBeouf is not the worst choice for comic relief, but he sure got better between this and TRANSFORMERS."

The words that i believe has n bigger meaning than what is realized is this fraise in the movie where Constantine says that ""God is like a kid with an ant farm"" and we are the ants and what he is trying to say is that this is why people get killed for no good reason and why this world has no order some times looking at every day news.

I'm hoping he doesn't burn out and become yet another Hollywood hack, as Constantine was a very promising, yet very flawed, film.<br/><br/>Problems: It's based on a comic series that I must assume makes more sense than the script, which is intriguing at first (guy dies, goes to hell, then comes back, can see dead people, fights crime and demons....or something), but with all the convoluted plot points it almost completely implodes by the end, throwing any and all sorts of biblical good vs. evil esoterica you can stand--and a lot you can't.<br/><br/>Plusses: It's a GORGEOUS film to watch, even with the dark subject matter. David Fincher's Se7en wouldn't be an off comparison.

"silverbullets","Null","0","6","4 August 2007"," It's all about The Balance.
","My misuse of the 10/10 is all about Keeping the Balance (said in best Keanu voice).<br/><br/>It seems a certain rabid Hellblazer fan has attempted to spread the non-luv with a zillion reviews saying the same thing about how this ruined the comic and how Keanu is a moron. I totally understand adaptation-disappointment and sympathize. (But come on, give me a break. But it seems that hundreds of people have fallen for these cookie-cutter reviews...unless it's the same person making their neg reviews popular?) Regardless, I think in this case, you have to take the film as it is and not focus so much on comparing it to Hellblazer. Comic/graphic novel adaptations always come out different--they're two totally different visual mediums (there's a good reason Alan Moore doesn't want to do screenplays for adaptations of his books), and I think filmmakers need to be cut some slack for just trying to make a good movie that works on all levels. I think Francis Lawrence and crew (particularly the DP, editor, and production designer) have done an extraordinary job in adapting the medium, even though some Hellblazer fans might fault the adaptation of the content. It's tough to translate the hyperbolic normal of a comic bk world in film--it's a fine line between cheesy and cool when on the screen. But I felt they kept the balance quite impressively. Every moment that had the potential to cross the melodrama-cheese line suddenly cut to something normal/humorous enough that kept it all in amazing balance. In other words, they made that world believable enough to draw you into the story. And aside from the wasp-demon's face (the one bad egg), the CG was great. There's a ton of it, but it doesn't feel that way; it was generally very organic and melded into the fabric of the production design.<br/><br/>With said fine line (between cheesy & cool) in mind, the acting was great for the most part (and I disagree with Mr. Write-a-zillion-reviews/Enemy-of-all-that-is-Keanu--I think this was one of Honsou's more unimpressive performances--he sounded like he was reading his lines). It's why I think Keanu, for all the bashing he gets, is really a rather good actor on average. A hell of a lot easier to do scenes where you don't have to talk about dragon-breath and fight with halfbreed CG characters and make melodrama believable--and just play an ordinary character in the ordinary world like our more celebrated celebs are so often celebrated for doing. I found his of Constantine to have depth--not so simple to interpret when your character is a guarded, solitary, hardened person. Despite the fact that the Matrix comparisons are the first to be thrown around, I'm thinking that casting Keanu for the role was equally, if not more about his performance in The Devil's Advocate. (Which was one of his better films, methinks. Actually, I thought there were some similarities in terms of how these films dealt with supernatural horror elements--it's an accomplishment to make those elements legit and powerful enough without the gratuitous creepiness that makes a lot of typical horror obnoxious/manipulative/cheap...IMO, of course.) And back to the script and directing--I felt it was solid all the way through. Deleted scenes say a lot for a director--it's praiseworthy when every one of them would've really hurt (or even ruined) the film as a whole and got scrapped, re-shot, or heavily re-edited. I'm impressed with Francis Lawrence, who didn't have mounds of experience, but really crafted a satisfying, intricately balanced (heh-heh), non-cliché story out of all the elements at hand--and even more so as the subject matter (heaven/hell, evil, salvation, etc) is a heavy and delicate one.<br/><br/>This is an adaptation that works in capturing the spirit of a very broad, layered story medium and crafting it into a more compact yet more visually-layered story medium. I really hate that I listened to the din of purists (and all those who like to parrot/regurgitate the ""wooden"" Keanu diss...""wooden""? Come on.) and didn't catch the film in the theater. This one's a keeper."

","First off, no, this ain't the comic book John Constantine. It can't be. Think the movie was dark? Don't read the comic, then... talk about dark and scary. There is no way the censorship folks would allow a true Hellblazer movie -- not only that, but there is no way at all to get the complexity of the comics into a 90-120 minute movie. Keep in mind, folks, when they make a movie, they are trying to sell it to a far wider audience than just us comic book geeks.<br/><br/>Second, I really think a lot of people just decided early on that it was ""cool"" and ""in"" to hate Keanu Reeves. I think that's a really negative attitude to take, and I am sorry you feel that way. I thought he did a pretty good job of the character. The MODIFIED character. If they were going to do a *real* Constantine, they would need Spike from Buffy and Angel. No, Nick Cage couldn't pull it off, unless you want a Texan Constantine.<br/><br/>Third. The kid wasn't annoying -- he didn't get enough screen time to be! And Papa Midnight couldn't have been so cool if he had been a bigger part of the movie -- how interesting can ""I'm occult Switzerland"" really be for a whole movie?<br/><br/>Now, a lot of people have likened it to The Prophecy. I beg to differ. I thought so too, for a second... but in this movie, Gabriel's motives are NOT Walken's Gabriel's motives. In The Prophecy, Gabriel hates humans, because God loves them best, and he was made to serve man. In Constantine, Gabriel wants man to deserve God's devotion, and is convinced the only way they will is to suffer horror. As happened after 9/11 in NYC, in the presence of horror, people are kind to one another, noble, helpful and self-sacrificing. When things go well, people tend to be selfish and cruel to others.<br/><br/>In all, I thought it was a pretty good supernatural action movie. No, it wasn't perfect, and it sure wasn't the Constantine I know from YEARS of being a fan of the comic... but it was far far better than most of what I see on the big screen anymore."

","Keanu Reeves is back in a familiar place, playing in a movie that is centered around God, angels, the devil, heaven and hell. This movie is a not too distant cousin of the much better ""Devil's Advocate"". Keanu Reeves plays Constantine, an irreligious man with the ability to see angels and demons, and also the ability to exorcise people that have been possessed. Constantine is a man torn: he knows about God and the devil, Heaven and Hell, yet he doesn't believe. He is also a man trying frivolously to earn his way into Heaven though he has been condemned to Hell for trying to commit suicide.<br/><br/>The theme in this movie is not foreign at all, that being demons plaguing the earth, or some sinister plot from the devil, or in this case, the devil's son. This movie gave you a closer glimpse of demon activity from both, on earth and in Hell. The movie was intriguing from the standpoint of: what creature(s) will appear next, or what eerie event will occur next, and can Constantine save his soul? It is a decent movie with some intense scenes and interesting characters."

","Constantine blends an enthralling story with great eye-candy in this blade runner type of film. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine- a character born or tormented with the gift to see ghosts and deport them back to hell. The movie originally based on the DC Comic: ""Hellblazer"", which illustrates a different view of the Catholic Religion. The setting of this dark and creepy view of good and evil is not only intriguing but intelligent. I thought the movie was beautiful with the visual and sound effects, especially during the Holy Water and View of Hell scenes. The screenplay was well scripted and illustrated. The performances of Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia Lebouf, and Djimon Hounsou were terrific. Reeves portray the Constantine perfectly and even though people give a bad rap for being a bad actor, I don't personally think that their could have been a better man to portray his character. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie is so underrated and unappreciated because everybody who saw the trailer thought this movie was going to be another run 'em up, shoot 'em up type movie, but it's not. The movie views a serious topic in a darker, but yet, a super hero type of way. The movie is a lot deeper than it lets on because who ever has read the bible and knows the stories of catholic religion, know that sone of the facts in the movie is true. For example, the true story of the Crucifixion. Also, the sub-part of the movie about the appreciation and meaning of life gives the movie more depth. All and all, I think this movie does not get the proper credit due to the injustice of what it represented on the outside."

","Hey look, it's Keanu Reeves! Part of me thinks that it'd be enough to say that and give my rating to the movie, but this ain't no Johnny Mnemonic, so you won't see a 4/10 here. All right, so the stuff that this film has going for it: 1) Decent source material - I've always liked DC's Vertigo lines of comic books more than the regular DC universe; and...<br/><br/>Eh? That's it? Well, honestly the other elements could be worse. The ""style"" of the film is a mix between The Matrix and Blade so it's not all that inspiring, perhaps even derivative. The direction was adequate but nothing special (director Lawrence's background in directing mostly feature Jennifer Lopez videos--he must be right at home working with accomplished thespians such as Keanu). The acting was passable at times and not quite passable at others.<br/><br/>So what's the bad in this film? It's just blandly mediocre. There are no chills that really chill, no thrills that really thrill, hell looks bad but it's certainly not fear inspiring. The whole film has this sort of television-movie feel to it that keeps it from being anything bigger than mediocre. This is the kind of movie that, if it had less of a budget, might've made for a B-television series that would've probably been better.<br/><br/>Not a must watch at all. But better than watching the aforementioned Keanu movie. If you want to feel like you just watched a movie that FX or the Sci-Fi Channel might show, that's the kind of movie this is. It's not regrettably terrible. Just mediocre. But hey, it's Keanu! 6/10."

But of course, there Hollywood movies that rules (I love commercial movies too, the thing i hate is the ""typical"" thing), and i think that ""Constantine"" is one of them.

"Criftus","8","0","3","29 January 2007"," A fun and entertaining film ...
","Constantine should not be taken seriously. It's not a masterpiece of film-making and thankfully it doesn't pretend to be. What the audience should expect from this film is an above-average action movie, set in a dark world where the lines between the divine and the mundane have blurred, and supernatural forces conspire to upset the delicate balance between good and evil.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is surprisingly well cast as the titular role of John Constantine. His questionable talent works well while playing this dejected character: a man who has lost all hope and fears what the afterlife holds in store for him. His deadpan, emotionless portrayal sounds ""right"", and is - most importantly - entertaining to watch. Rachel Weisz delivers an impressive performance as police officer Angela Dodson, and the impartial Midnite (played by the excellent Djimon Hounsou) is a delight. Other notable performances are made by Shia LaBeouf; who offers some light-hearted comic relief as sidekick Chas Kramer, and Tilda Swinton; playing the seemingly androgynous and unsympathetic half-breed Gabriel. The appearance of Satan (played by Peter Stormare), while brief, is also quite memorable.<br/><br/>The sound and special effects are both top-notch and effectively draw you into this fantasy world of angels and demons. The writing isn't overly complex, has its clever moments, and is fairly consistently charming. The plot is on par with most action movies, though seems a little more fresh than most ... perhaps this has much to do with its theological framework. The cinematography and direction aren't inspired, though do a good job telling the story.<br/><br/>If you take yourself, this subject, and your movies too seriously, I've no doubt that you might be disappointed. But sit back, grab some popcorn, relax, suspend your disbelief for a little while and enjoy Constantine for what it is: a dark, immersing, fun, and entertaining diversion."

","""Constantine"" is, in no uncertain terms, a wasted opportunity. What always puzzles me is how film-makers can take perfectly good source material and transform it into something less effective, less gripping, less fun. The tales of ""Hellblazer"" comic's John Constantine could have made the perfect viewing experience with very little tampering. Shot in the UK, with a medium-sized or even small budget and a no-star cast, this could have been a cult classic. Instead, Hollywood have gone down the usual route, outdoing themselves this time with the worst example of miscasting in recent times.<br/><br/>Let's get this straight - Keanu Reeves was never going to play a memorable John Constantine...it's a bridge-too-far for this actor. In the right movie, Reeves shines (take the superb ""Point Break"" as an example). Here, though, Reeves is a drowning man, having bit off more than he can chew, and then some.<br/><br/>The film scrapes a 7 as it's visually impressive, the scenes of Hell are memorable and nightmarish and the production does display more intelligence than many other blockbuster affairs. Rachel Weisz delivers an understated and realistic performance but her heart doesn't seem in this production.<br/><br/>I would have dearly loved a faithful adaptation of the comic books...fans should perhaps avoid ""Constantine"" as it's a painful viewing for those craving the raw and uncompromising thrills of ""Hellblazer"". Non-fans will take this as it stands, a big-budget, Hollywood production with an imaginative plot but no soul."

If you expect to be able to follow the story whilst loudly crunching your popcorn, you will be disappointed. If you are a fan of the comic and you want to see your hero recreated on screen, well...you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>But if you watch it purely as a piece of entertainment, you will enjoy it. The acting is fab, all the roles are well cast (although I don't understand people raving about Rachel - she was OK but not spectacular and barely convincing for me), the special effects are great, the costumes look fab and the music is excellent.<br/><br/>Its an interesting story, expertly brought to life. The calibre of the actors cast in this movie alone would be enough to stop it being boring to watch, but as I said, they almost all turn in stellar performances. Gavin seemed out of his depth but he was surrounded by an awful lot of talent.<br/><br/>I am a Keanu fan (but much, much more after seeing this film).

"gavin6942","5","0","6","9 December 2006"," A Great Story, But Told With No Soul
","John Constantine has survived hell, and now fights to keep demons away from Earth, despite being banned from Heaven (basically fighting for God and humanity with no chance of being rewarded for it).<br/><br/>I never read the Hellblazer comics, but I am under the impression they are probably very interesting. The elements of this film are very interesting -- the philosophical ramifications are intriguing and the story in general is unlike any other heaven versus hell story you'll come across. Constantine is a unique character, and one we might call the tragic hero.<br/><br/>The film, however, left me feeling very empty. The concepts were interesting, and I really enjoyed the presence of the Spear of Destiny (one of the more interesting parts of the Adolf Hitler mythos). And even the special effects -- which I usually hate, as I hate all computer graphics -- were fairly impressive. I enjoyed the look of hell as a place being constantly bombarded by nuclear bombs. But something was not here, it was just very flat.<br/><br/>First, much of the action really had little background. As the film progresses, you learn more about Constantine and the battles he fights. But so much of the story is not explained. I understand in the director's commentary he points out what certain items are and where people's motivations are coming from. But this does not do me any good, does it? And my biggest complaint was the overall feel. While the graphics were nice, the tone was supposed to be dark. A man fights demons, he's dying of cancer and there are suicides. Yet, the tone is more PG-13 and not so much R. The director did not darken the film at all, but kept it bright and vibrant (like a traditional comic book). Was he fighting the hordes of Satan or Casper the Friendly Ghost? There was simply no suspense or character emotion at all.<br/><br/>The playing up of the Roman Catholic point of view was overdone. The female lead says something like, ""My sister was Catholic, there's no way she'd commit suicide."" Um, Catholics kill themselves all the time. And then over and over they repeated that Catholics believe suicide is a one-way ticket to hell. Why do they feel the need to explain this over and over but they don't explain the aspects that are actually difficult? And also, the thing about getting buried in a Catholic cemetery because of suicide: this didn't need as much emphasis, and is also false. Sure, the rules say you can't, but it still happens all the time. Why do the writers assume everything is so cut and dry? This movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, whose past efforts have only been music videos. Granted, some great directors can come from music videos or commercials or even from nowhere at all. But Lawrence might not be one of them if he can't tell what a light film is and what a dark film is. And his next project? Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" -- a remake of ""Omega Man"" and ""Last Man on Earth"". Now, this film is already destined to be mediocre (Will Smith does not have the science fiction integrity of Vincent Price or Charleton Heston), but if Lawrence goes and makes this another ""light"" film, the entire project is a waste of time.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is decent in this regardless of what others say. This is probably the most mature thing I've seen him in. The original actor was Nicolas Cage, who probably would have been even better, but Reeves did a fine job. (I have heard this film gets compared to ""The Matrix"" a lot. I didn't make that connection, but if it's true it could have avoided such things without Reeves, obviously.) Rachel Weisz is a strong actress, even when given horrible roles like this one. I feel bad having to say anything against her, so I just won't. I only wish she would have walked out on this film and done something else.<br/><br/>Most surprising was probably Gavin Rossdale, who played the half-breed demon Balthazar. I thought he was very calm, cool and collected and quite sinister. Often I find musicians do not cross over to acting with as much success as they had planned, but Rossdale really had great screen presence. I hope people continue to call on him for such projects, especially roles that Jude Law is not available for.<br/><br/>I know that I'm probably in the minority, but I don't want you to see this movie. My very good friend loves this movie (""one of the best"") and his girlfriend likes it as well (and their tastes are not overly similar). And the general ratings seem to suggest others consider it to be decent. Well, I don't. It bored me and I thought it was really nothing special. I would have rather watched ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""."

","The performance given by the actors in this movie could be the matter for a long discussion. Keanu ""Wooden Face"" Reeves tries very hard, and at least, like John Constantine in the original comics, he's gloomy. He doesn't manage though to be *as* sarcastic, twisted and generally selfish as the original... and anyway he really hasn't got the worn-out looks it requires to be a good Constantine. I regret also that they didn't pick the Kingpin from Daredevil to play the Papa Midnight part. The other actors do much better I think...<br/><br/>I would say that what keeps the story together is mostly the decorum, the SFX and the mind-drilling music. That and the very interesting concept of ""both sides are hypocritical, good and evil are really two groups who just want to beat each other by all means necessary"". If you think about it, in the end you might wonder if all of this, including the last ""choice"" Gabe puts in John's hands, wasn't just all a test of Constantine's soul. If so, it was really playing dices.<br/><br/>Albert Einstein would probably appreciate that one :)"

","This is one of the best movies, based on the Vertigo comic book 'Hellblazer' by DC company in America.<br/><br/>Constantine was played by Keanu Reeves. John Constantine doomed to be sending to hell. Because he committed suicide once, so he attempted to go heaven. The world is divided into human being world, heaven, and heaven. But the balance is crumbling this time. For that reason, he sends back the things that injure human beings. He makes use of his particular ability. He could see the things that human beings cannot see since he was a child. One day, Angela came to John. She said to John that she wants to know the truth of her sister's suicide <br/><br/>I think this movie is more than a little horror content. It is interesting story and the picture is large-scale.

"cscoleman316","Null","0","5","28 September 2006"," A Spiritual Take
","Taking the movie at face value and not as a supposedly poor rendition of a comic book, it was very interesting how accurate some it's story was to Christian theology. In the same way that Dogma had a solid basis in theology with a puree of quasi-Christian mythology heaped on top, Constantine was a success as far as showing the dual universes we live in. The writer's concept of angles and demons being non-intrusive ""whisperers"" is a completely valid one, as well as the idea of possession by demons, although they take the idea and run a bit too far with it. The idea of redemption for access to heaven as opposed to buying your way in is also a valid point and as flawed as the character Gabriel's belief system is (she is supposedly an angel), nearly everything she says to Constantine is true. All in all as a conservative Christian, I was impressed with the lack of Hollywood's usual slanting of the Christian religion."

Sure, the special effects weren't perfect and there was a lot more that could have been explored, but over all it came out as a very enjoyable action film.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves was an excellent moody, sarcastic Constantine and Rachel Weisz pulled off the emotional Angela well. Of course, the highlight for me was definitely the much overlooked Shia LaBeouf who's witty, book-read Chas quickly became my favourite character.<br/><br/>This film isn't some extraordinary piece of cinematography, but for a not-entirely-mainstream take of a dark graphic novel it worked well.

The whole movie is about a man named John Constantine (Reeves), who has literally been to hell and back. Because of the life he has chosen, he will never enter the gates of Heaven. The only way he will get into the Gates of St. Peter, is self-sacrifice. Instead he tries to bring so-called 'half-breed' demons that came into earth, back into hell.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf, Djimon Hounsou, and Tilda Swinton also star in this movie. Shia was the only one who brought comedy to the movie, but also the worst acting. Djimon Hounsou was great, and so was Tilda.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome! And so was the editing. I guess this is a good movie to buy on DVD, and is passable to watch a few times, but then it gets boring. It's still a pretty fun movie.<br/><br/>But this movie has the most mild R rating. It would've went well with a strong PG-13 rating. The demonic images weren't really all that demonic or scary, and the violence was as bad as Mission Impossible violence. In my opinion, it should be rated PG-13 for violence, disturbing images, and thematic material. That's it.<br/><br/>Constantine is a definite 6 out of 10. Pretty good.

This is a major thing for someone like him to confess. It's hard as hell (no pun intended) to get this guy to truly like a film. That tells me something. I myself, probably would get the film too. It was gripping, it was intense; I loved the visual effects.

Ennis is a well known writer among the whiskey and cigarettes comics crowd. His work on the Hellblazer series was excellent and one only hopes that we can see some work done toward making ""Preacher"" into a series of Motion Pictures or perhaps a cable series. <br/><br/>Without any fore-knowledge of the comics the movie works as one in a long series of what used to be called B movies. Personally I am a big fan of the B movie.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz makes a welcome addition to any movie and this was no exception. Coincidently she also played in a classic pair of B's, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"". <br/><br/>If you think you might enjoy a modern remake of a classic theme, i.e. ""what to do when the Devil owns your marker"" with an attractive cast and some cool special effects I would recommend this film.

","Honestly, honestly, the movie is pretty much a throwaway. Don't see it if you want a fantastic demonic movie--that would be the Russian release Night Watch.<br/><br/>As it is, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Constantine--I watch it a lot, in fact. Not because the acting is fantastic, or even mediocre. Keanu Reeves has only two faces, it seems: deadpan and angry. And those two are pretty much the same. The only real change comes when he's hacking up a lung.<br/><br/>The other actors are passable, Tilda Swinson and Gavin Rossdale as the angel Gabriel and the demon Balthazar (respectively) standing out particularly. Their characters were also, by and large, the most amusing. The possibly gender-confused (and slightly insane?) Gabriel is an almost pitiable character, while Balthazar simply oozes so much sex appeal that it's almost not fair.<br/><br/>Mostly it's the vibrancy and the actually rather interesting storyline (though, undoubtedly, the movie owes that to the comic series) that carries the movie. Every scene has several details to note--the bar scene instantly comes to mind--so even when the viewer tires of watching Keanu Reeves refuse to change expression, there's plenty else to look at.<br/><br/>Also, in spite of all the failings, it's a very thematic movie. If you want something spectacular in all aspects, don't see Constantine. You'll be disappointed. But, if you simply want a dark- edged film with nice effects and good attention to detail, you'd probably like Constantine."

","I have always felt this was one of the best characters DC/Vertigo has in its arsenal. Some felt the casting was off, especially considering John Constantine's creator (Alan Moore) once was quoted as saying he pictured the sorcerer being played by Sting. Regardless of how you feel about Keanu Reeves, or his acting abilities, this film had so much more to offer that the dubious casting became a moot point.<br/><br/>Constantine is a troubled modern mage, dying of lung cancer and sentenced to an eternity in Hell. After partnering up with a police detective played by Rachael Weisz, and running about with some interesting supporting characters, it becomes clear that Weisz's ""Angela Dodson"" is in mortal danger. Further investigation leads the pair on a quest that could determine the fate of the world, possibly save Constantine's destiny and even bring Satan up to Earth to collect the one soul he most desires...<br/><br/>The feel of this movie is dark and oppressive right from the start. The lighting was brilliant and the camera angles startling. The special effects could have been a bit more sturdy, but the film markers' idea of the Infernal Realm was spectacular. Only the demons themselves seemed lacking. I must say, I didn't notice the music so much, except for the inclusion of A Perfect Circle's song ""Passive"" in Papa Midnite's (Djimon Hounsou) bar.<br/><br/>And Papa Midnite was incredible. As was the rest of the supporting cast, who really fueled this movie. Shia LaBeouf was a perfect sidekick and comic relief as ""Chas Kramer"" for the stoic Constantine. Gavin Rossdale hurled away any leftover glam from his days as lead singer of Bush when playing the demon ""Balthazar."" ""Gabriel"" could not have been captured more fiercely or delicately than by anyone other than Tilda Swinton. Finally, Peter Stormare gave, perhaps, the greatest portrayal of The Devil since Al Pacino. (Hmmm... another Reeves film.)<br/><br/>No, this movie is NOT the comic book that many reader love. No, it's not a film for everyone. But for what the cast and crew set out to achieve, it is a fantastic piece of genre film making."

","I have not read much of the Hellblazer series, but I have purchased the regular DVD version (which I think I'll let my nephew have who is high school age and has a quite mature outlook on life for his age) and I do like the movie immensely and thought the comic that comes with it was a wee bit on the extreme side, but then again, I prefer realism to a sanitized version of how our everyday bad habits can have an effect on us and others in this world. From what I have read of the comic, I prefer the movie to the comic and hope someday to be able play the game on a PS2 which I will most likely never have, but then again, isn't that what faith is for? I truly hope that the genius of Francis Lawrence can be utilized again to perhaps consider a trilogy that includes the other two archangels of Judeo/Christian/Islamic religious teaching and folklore, Raphael and Michael. All the actors and actresses in this movie were superb and I'm tired of hearing complaints about Keanu's acting. Any research for archangels would be in the Books of Tobit, Daniel, Revelation, and of course, the four Gospels. Good luck to Francis."

","Reeves is a perfect choice for the eponymous hero of the film. It is hard to follow at times and the TV version I watched seemed to have a low and at times indistinct sound track, which made it hard to follow in places. Its an interesting concept and has certain parallels to the Matrix: What is reality, who are we? Is God and Religion all BS? I thought the entrance of Lucifer ( The bringer of light) was a clever idea and initially I thought he was God, The white suit was a red herring in this respect as he exuded evil in a very understated way! What was Gabriel? AC/DC? there certainly was a question left unanswered here and having a woman play the part but with no makeup and her breasts bound tight so as to have the appearance of a man was a stroke of genius!

","An installment of a graphic comic book has come on to the big screen. ""Constantine"" is indeed a very violent and very graphic movie. All those demons, all the gore, and the depicted scenes of Hell, makes DOOM look like a cheap advertisement. I liked the way it way made, despite of what I saw, Keanu Reeves played the character down hard. Known in ""The Matrix"" movies as Neo, John Constantine is a heavy smoking demon killer who put them critters back where they belong. Since Heaven doesn't want him, and Hell doesn't either, he's stuck on Earth. The gun was outrageously ingenious. No demon should mess with Constantine. Going after the half-breeds are always a pain, and Satan was always getting his mitts on Constantine. Since he couldn't get him, he got his cancers instead. This movie is more entertaining than most demon based movies. I liked the part where Gabriel(Tilda Swifton), lost his wings. And mostly his godliness. A very fun film for the fans of Vertigo Comics. Rating 3 out of 5 stars."

This is based on a comic book about John Constantine, a man who is doomed to end up in hell but fights demons anyway. He is helping a detective find out her twins motive for suicide. He meets the Angel Gabriel and Satan. He visits Hell several times during the movie. The acting, considering i don't like Keanu Reeves could have been better, and maybe he could have redeemed himself to me. The violence in this movie is fairly tame, but has a few intense scenes of action. The language is no bad at all, only 2 uses of the F-word through the whole movie. I don't recall any sexual content.

","I wasn't expecting to like this movie, as I generally despise Keanu Reeves' attempts at acting. However, I thought it presented the good/evil debate in a new and interesting way, and I especially enjoyed the ending. I'm also a big fan of Tilda Swinton, and I enjoyed her asexual performance as the angel Gabriel. I thought the effects were good, and the portrayal of hell was awesome. I also thought that it made some good points regarding the Catholic views on suicide, and I liked the way it didn't really have a ""happy"" ending. Papa Midnight was probably my favorite character; I thought he was interesting as well as human. I was also pleased that the movie didn't get too ""preachy"" on the subject of cigarettes, despite the fact that Constantine is killing himself with cigarettes, he continues to smoke, which made him nicely human."

","I thought the movie Constantime was an epic about the original Emporer Constantine who Christianized Europe in 325 AD. Imagine my surprise and embarrassment to find out that it was about a tragic hero who shares the same name as The Emporer but in this case, John Constantine is a cynical, jaded detective/hero who goes around saving souls from going to hell and sending those who have managed to escape hell back where they belong. He's already tried to reject God's plan as a Saviour figure to no avail. He's got a street smart attitude when it comes to chapter and verse but gets the job done without all the ""holier than thous"". Despite his jaded nature, he does, somewhere deep down inside him accept God's will for him on Earth. This quality, plus the fact that I like looking at Keanu Reeves gave me a reason to care about his character. When tormented Angela (Weitz) comes to ask him to help her figure out her twin sister's strange and mysterious ""suicide"" the film takes off although it runs through a number of heavily Catholic mis-informed scenes and settings. I thought it would end in a cheezy romance scene but I was wrong. It wasn't, however, a great ending either. I don't want to spoil anything here... if you want a spoiler read on down. What happens in between is just a hodge podge of special effects a la The Matrix while Angela and John do God's will.<br/><br/>The cinematography was decent...even the Matrix scenes are done well and don't look like a cheap rip off or a satire. Perhaps this is because Keanu Reeves is an expert at this by now... he can pull it off. His acting was mediocre at best but he did manage to make John Constantine interesting and kind of a kick a$$ Christian Neo. Weitz' performance was subtlety entrancing...I think she held most of the film together because we actually care about this innocent victim. The secondary characters are infinitely more interesting but they always are aren't they?...Chaz, Gabriel, Lu, etc. The film is kinda predictable but the diolague is so smart in the scenes where John is kicking the demon's butts to the curb. I couldn't resist laughing out loud at the dark humor inherent in his words as he goes about kicking demon A$$. <br/><br/>One word of caution: you have to be ready to completely suspend your sense of disbelief. If you start looking for answers to all the Catholic dogma that is being tossed around through the movie or try and point out discrepancies, you will be disappointed. Catholic traditions and dogma re: hell/evil are manipulated with impunity. <br/><br/>If you're into symbology and cool gadgets and the age old theme of Good vs. Evil with a religious feel then this movie might be for you. (There's a ton of sweet props too: The Sword of Destiny, Gabriel's psych ward hospital ID tags worn as bracelets, John's Zippo, etc.)<br/><br/>The film allows for lapses in Catholic dogma to get the story out there, reel us in and hold us till the end. I don't think ANY of the religious issues should be taken to heart too seriously; even The Catholic Church concedes to mistakes on their part and I am not talking about the pedophile priest scandals. I am talking about how The Church held The Vatican II Council in the late 1960's... the second only to The Niacine Council held by The Emporer Constantine in 325 AD (or thereabouts)when the ""rules of The Catholic Church"" were solidified into a unified whole..Catholic dogma. At the second council, The Church did away with limbo. Also, they apparently were wrong about people being able to buy their way out of purgatory. Anyone could ask the church to pray for souls in purgatory so they would ""do their time"" and get to Heaven faster...for a fee. It seems that They admitted that they got that wrong too.<br/><br/>I guess if The Church could take liberties regarding ""rules and dogma"" when it suits their needs, so can the movie Constantine. At least Constantine is a work of fiction whereas The Catholic Church has real and true followers who lead their lives according to The Church's principles. <br/><br/>Now /that's/ a real horror show.<br/><br/>~ScriptyChick<br/><br/>Afterthought: If you are interested in Catholic Themes, I suggest you looking into Dante's Commedia (The Entire Work, not just The Inferno) and Milton's Paradise Lost. And then there's the age old best selling classic: The King James Bible. Don't leave home without it."

","First off, I must express my deep dislike of Keanu Reeves as an actor...However, he actually does well in this film. His John Constantine is a really cool character...a true bad-ass.<br/><br/>Constantine is based off the awesome 'Hellblazer' comics, and I've been waiting for a movie about these comics for a long time. The movie does not disappoint, but it does not strike gold, either. It follows John Constantine's (Reeves) efforts to enter heaven, using the method of repenting for his sins by means of exorcism of demons.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Shia LaBeouf as the comedic relief that is John's assistant, Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz as a detective who lost her twin sister to the demons, Peter Stormare as Satan, Djimon Hounsou as Midnight, a club owner, Pruitt Taylor Vince as a minister, and Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel is excellent, especially LaBeouf and Stormare. They both make you want to watch them the entire time they're on screen.<br/><br/>The special effects are. Awesome You'll see a real depiction of Hell, which is just plain awesome. The weapons that Constantine uses are so cool, including the ""Holy Brass Knuckles"". You'll come to love Shia LaBeouf's character, and you'll see that he's really grown as an actor from his days on Disney's 'Even Stevens'. The direction of Francis Lawrence is pretty well done. I also enjoyed the film even more because I saw it on an IMAX screen. It's a good rent for the weekend, and for the die hard action fan, it's a good buy. I recommend this to anyone between the ages of 15 to 25, and the action fan. Lovers of Hellblazer might not like it too much, but it is still good.<br/><br/>7/10 --spy"

","Constantine is quite possibly the worst film ever made that was based on a comic book. I think the bottom-line message of this movie can be summed up best by a few lines of dialog that Tilda Swinton (as Gabriel) utters to our so-called hero early on: 'You're going to die young because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to go to hell because of the life you took. You're f---ed.' <br/><br/>And so are we, the hapless audience who is forced to sit through this abominable mess - and make no mistake, we ARE forced: we have to see how it turns out, after all, and even more than that, we have to see just how ridiculous it gets on the journey.

No, there weren't Oscar-worthy performances - but then I didn't expect there to be. It's an action/adventure/fantasy movie, based on a comic book series (which I've never seen so maybe this helps me enjoy the show). So what did folks expect? When you see Keanu Reeves is starring in a lead role in a movie, do you go for his fine acting skills? I don't. He and Rachel Weisz do have good chemistry on screen, which was apparent after their first film together (Chain Reaction), and it was cool to see them together again. Keanu as a sulking, loser-if-he-weren't-gifted and Rachel as an intelligent, faithful detective seem appropriate casting. I, for one, say it was worth the rental fee and say ""Get the popcorn, and sit back and relax"". No political undertones or messages to be found and debated here, just an evening of entertainment."
"SonofMadpoet","6","0","2","9 February 2006"," Not a great movie by any stretch, but still worth the price of admission
","Let me just start with this. Keanu Reeves is not a very good actor, and, while he tries his best (or does he?), he still ends up bringing Constantine down a couple of rungs.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me was how this movie was advertised. From the trailers, I thought that this was going to be a movie that was essentially ten minutes of buildup, then-BAM! Keanu shoots demons for the next 70 minutes. No, the truth is that it's about 90 minutes of buildup until finally some shooting happens. Now, with that buildup, the story has to rely on the characters, and this is where Reeves begins to chop into the movie's otherwise fairly engaging philosophical quandaries. He isn't John Constantine, he's just Keanu Reeves in a jacket, with a tattoo on his arm, talking in his normal, almost-but-not-quite-convincing voice to an otherwise great cast of characters. Most noteworthy among them is Rachel Weiz, who owns her character very well as the confused and conflicted Angela Dodson. Other characters are well done and all bring the movie up to a barely good, 7.5 level.<br/><br/>But...if it deserved a 7.5, then why is it getting a 6? Well, that all comes down to the confusing script writing. It's all very vague, and, for all I know, perhaps it was supposed to be that way. But considering that it was the philosophical weight that made Hellblazer such a great comic, Constantine comes off as weak and boring in comparison. At it's root, Hellblazer was about a war between Heaven and Hell, and, more importantly, that war's effects on the people living in the middle, Earth. Constantine, as a movie, never really finds much of a focus, and the whole thing seems very...aimless, random, and kind of pointless. The plot twists and turns like a frightened worm, but it never really goes anywhere, and that is the true failing of the script. It's got character galore (even enough to make Reeves engaging, to an extent), but no real place to put the characters, and not enough force to drive them forward. The movie tries to appeal to both the philosophy lovers, who would completely love the biblical and religious references, and the casual viewers, who just like a good explosion, and it can't really appeal to either. It makes a valiant stand to be a great movie, it's not like the makers gave up, but it lacks the focus and direction that intellectuals would enjoy, and there's not enough gun play and death to keep a normal guy entertained.<br/><br/>And so, much like the titular character, this movie stands at the edge, between light and darkness, bad, and good, it's just...a movie, one with its share of banter and explosions. I'm not ashamed that I watched it, but there were far better ways to spend two hours of my life. It was worth the price of admission, but when there are better movies, ones that can balance out brawn and brains better (cough...the first Matrix...) Constantine feels like white noise, straining to be music. As such, it walks the line between heaven and hell, but never goes beyond the limbo that it seems to be stuck in.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you've got nothing else to do, there are worse ways to go than Constantine. However, make it a rent, not a buy. It's really only a movie that will be good one time through."

But hey, if they are such purists, why couldn't they get the British film world to make the movie for the past ten years? And why wasn't Rachel Weitz, a British actress, allowed to use her accent?

","Okay, I admit it: I was predisposed against 'Constantine' before I ever set foot in the cinema. I'm a bad, bad man. I'm fond of the John Constantine character in the 'Swamp Thing' and 'Hellblazer' comics, and thought the decision to transform Vertigo's middle-aged scouse occult wide-boy into a surly Keanu Reeves, and move the setting from London to LA was foolish. How ill considered and prejudiced of me. I also thought that a horror movie directed by a pop video maker would be little more than a particularly bloody epileptic lightshow. What a cultural snob I am.<br/><br/>Pity I was right, isn't it?<br/><br/>It's a lazy movie. Constantine's emotional response to the discovery that he has lung cancer is akin to the disdain of a supermarket teller who discovers the bar-code on a tin of beans won't scan. The sly charm and sarcasm of the comic Constantine (the defining characteristics and, consequently, the principal reasons for his appeal over the past twenty years) is transformed into sulky rudeness  presumably because guile is beyond the ability of the leading man. Rachel Weisz is little better. She's in twitchy funny-accent mode, though, which is never a good sign. Tilda Swinton tries very hard as the Angel Gabriel to be a little more than an archetype, as does Peter Stormare as a particularly oleaginous Satan, but both these character-actors are set exclusively as antagonists to Reeves  but as all true drama comes from conflict and contrast between characters, the poor sods are working against a brick wall. Francis Lawrence's direction iswellnot apparent.<br/><br/>It's hard to see who the film is aimed at. Much of the iconography and many of the characters from the comics are retained: Constantine is aided by his taxi-driver friend Chaz (who, in the US, would call a Charles 'Chaz'?), and frequents the occult club of the witch-doctor Papa Midnite, but these icons are distorted to such a degree that they bear no relation to their originals. There's a reliance on gimmicky props, such as the 'Holy Shotgun', which the comics have been mercifully free of these past two decades. Indeed there's so little of the character and back-story of the 'real' Constantine in evidence here that it's a wonder they even bothered to use the name,<br/><br/>Visually, there are flashes of brilliance. David Lazan's art-direction is very good. His design of Hell (a fire-storm ravaged urban desert) is splendid, but it's over-used to the point where it becomes almost tedious, and an escalating reliance upon CGI effects also gives the overall impression of this being a particularly over-ambitious Aerosmith video."

","Constantine is an exorcist, damned to hell, and dying too. In an attempt to gain a ticket to heaven, he expels demons and casts them back in hell. Normally only half demons are to be found in this mortal world, but lately, full demons are trying to cross over too. A series of strange events makes Constantine weary that something bigger is about to happen. Step by step a devilish plan is revealed, and in the end it is up to Constantine to prevent hell on earth.<br/><br/>I thought this movie began very promising: very dark and mysterious. But it looses it's darkness and mystery, sadly enough, to become a more ordinary comic book movie: the tormented, swearing, drinking and smoking anti-hero Constantine becomes a real hero, too good to be true, with a heart and big guns, shooting around, saving the day. Of course he has to save the world, what kind of movie would it be otherwise. But his sharp edge gets lost and I started missing it. It comes back by moments, but in general he is to nice and friendly towards good people. A lot of this might have to do with Rachel Weisz, as Angela investigating the strange suicide of her twin sister, being to shiny and sweet to be a good companion for Constantine. The character of Angela (and her twin sister) might have good potential, but Rachel Weisz misses something to make those potentials reality.<br/><br/>But there are other things in the movie to make up for that: the angel Gabriel takes over from Constantine to becoming a more interesting character. Tilda Swinton is very well casted to play this character. I was quite surprised when Gavin Rossdale suddenly appeared on the screen, as half-breed demon Balthazar. Later Sithboy told me that the director, Francis Lawrence, is also a video clip director, and probably picked up Rossdale that way. Anyway, I must say Gavin Rossdale is not too bad as a demon. The thematic of heaven and hell, demons, angels, exorcism, etc. is attractive and keeps a bit of mystery alive in the movie and makes it amusing to watch.<br/><br/>In short: the movie was amusing, good entertainment, but it didn't make me go up in it's world, it didn't stick with me and it didn't make me really enthusiastic. It didn't make me feel, like I think a real good movie should."
"Bogmeister","6","0","4","28 December 2005"," We Get it: Angels are just as insecure and petty
","The fanbase for this latest attempt at summarizing chaotic existence dominated by God, his Angels and the Devil comes from readers of DC Comics Vertigo line, where-in sincere attempts at adult storytelling surfaced following in the footsteps of Alan Moore's groundbreaking work on the old ""Swamp Thing"" comic book series, which gave rise to the 'graphic novel' term, rather than the standard 'comic book' label. Moore developed his own take on theological discussion, creating intricate modern mythology using established comic book characters; his was the benefaction on the series this film is based on. Everything was there for the taking and just needed to be ably translated into film form.<br/><br/>An immediate setback is the casting of the still boyish-looking Keanu as the self-destructive weary title character. Everything from his mannerisms to his forced approach to depression rings false; when he pounces on another in a long line of cigarettes, you just think 'fake.' Constantine should appear and behave even older than he actually is; instead, he seems younger. I don't have a problem with cute little jokes, as in the lettering on the taxi he exits near the beginning, but when he proceeds to struggle with some demon (imitating classic scenes from ""The Exorcist""), no sense of horror is conveyed, just a lapse into parody ('hey, dude, get outta that girl's body, OK?'). Unfair? Maybe. Or maybe I'm tired of excuses made for Keanu, who really needs another 30 years of life experience to project what's required here. But that's just a guess; probably nothing would help. Unfortunately, Rachel Weisz is another actor who just leaves me cold. As we're supposed to sympathize with her and root for her protection from dark forces, this creates another serious drawback to the story. The two main characters are the weakest links in the picture.<br/><br/>So where does that leave us? The finale. Most of the picture is forgettable, a plodding by the motions until the revelations of the final 20 minutes. As mentioned elsewhere, some elements of this story bear an uncanny resemblance to the more eclectic ""The Prophecy"" from 1995 (not ""Prophecy"" from '79, a whole other monster story). By chance or design, the angel Gabriel here (Swinton) actually adheres more to the description of popular lore, being essentially female. But Swinton scores another coup, projecting an otherworldly persona (she's now the 'go to' actor for inhuman beings, as in the Narnia movie later in the year), as easily as Keanu fumbled his attempt at gravitas. It's the plot of ""The Prophecy"" transposed to the final revelatory minutes of ""Constantine"" which at least makes for interesting, even repeat, viewing. And why stop with one petty, misguided angel? May as well throw in the latest interpretation of Satan (Stormare), here a somewhat immature sourpuss, into the mix. Stir. Result? Constantine outsmarts them all? Tell me another one."

","This movie adaptation of the popular comic book of the same name is just entertaining enough to not be a complete drudge,but it's hardly perfect.Anti-hero,demon-expelling private detective John Constantine(Keanu Reeves,curious casting by those who've read the comic book,as well as to the legions of people who do not regard his acting abilities very highly)is contacted by a distressed police detective(RAchel Weisz,who is as compelling as she is lovely MHO)whose twin sister seems to have killed herself. She believes that her sister's death was not a suicide,because if it were,per Catholic tradition(actually,I believe it's fairly common of a belief in ALL major,mono-theistic religions),then her sister would go to Hell, since suicide is considered a mortal sin.<br/><br/>PLenty of cool imagery and a harsh music and sound effects track both add character and ambiance to this film. The stories are interesting. So what went wrong? It would be tempting to lump this all on the square shoulders of Mr.Reeves,and while he is not particularly stellar here,I don't feel that he quite ruined this either,because his brooding lack of verbosity may actually BE what a character like Constantine needed.<br/><br/>To be sure,Keanu DOES seem to lack the gravitas or wit that a hard-bitten,seemingly doomed cynic who just happens to be doing God's work should have. But I also think that really,outside of Weisz,Peter Stormare(as a leering Satan)and Tilda Swinton(as the gender-neutral Archangel GAbriel),the acting here is pretty spare and strangely almost incongruent with the way this film is paced. It almost feels like this would've worked better on the big screen if it were animated INSTEAD of live-action. Also,the script seems to be just filler between supernatural confrontations,bridges to the end of the story rather than telling anything particularly interesting about any of the players involved,save maybe Constantine himself. <br/><br/>There was an interesting story here,and plenty of eye-candy,but it seems to lack much life.

As we all now know, it was a relative failure at the box-office, failing to even recoup its estimated budget in the US, and found few champions amongst the critics, gaining mixed reviews at best.<br/><br/>The film itself attempts to fuse the noir ambiance of those shadowy PI tales of the 40s with the more contemporary spectacle of fantasy/horror which, on paper at least, should provide an intriguing and engrossing fable. And there is an epic aspect to the story, with its focus on demons and angels roaming a world that is the subject of a wager between their masters. But it is this ambitious sub-plot that derails what should be a potent concoction by providing an abundance of religious iconography that influences the direction of the tale in ways that damage the film as entertainment, despite presenting some tantalising glimpses of what could have been a fascinating exploration of good and evil and the grey in-between.<br/><br/>Constantine is an exorcist of demons trying to step over into our world whose motivation is entirely personal Â– even though he is at first unable to see it. A suicide at an early age, he died for two minutes and sampled, as an appropriately punished Catholic, the damnations of hell before being resurrected. Doomed to return upon his final demise, he sends demons back to hell in the hope of buying his way into heaven. To make matters worse, he's running out of time: his lungs are black with cancer and he has a year left at best. Now this is the sort of subject matter that should either draw you in or repel you, depending on what floats your boat. Personally, I can't get enough of this dark stuff, so it's surprising that the film Constantine almost completely fails to convince you of the verisimilitude of its world. The effects look spectacular, but too often they get in the way of the plot rather than advancing it, and seem to serve too often as an inadequate substitute for atmosphere. This over-reliance on the fantastical also tends to leave the story so unfocused at times that the plot strays close to incoherence as it begins to spread in uncoordinated directions like an unattended stain. It's a shame, because the first half-hour or so looked promising.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves performs with all the integrity of a bloated movie star with a guaranteed pay packet. After twenty years in the business he still can't act, and seems to be attempting a kind of moody Clint Eastwood impersonation here. Needless to say, it doesn't work and Rachel Weisz, an appealing actress with only marginally more talent than her co-star, finds it tough to play off him with any success. Neither are helped by a script that stubbornly refuses to attempt anything more than a cursory study of their characters, leaving the audience dangerously adrift with no-one to care or root for. Tilda Swinton is a highlight as an angel called Gabriel, but her role is too small for her to make more than a passing impression, as is that of Peter Stormare's Satan.<br/><br/>Despite its bad points, Constantine possesses some great ideas and it would be interesting to see a sequel that expands a little on the characters in the story while taking a step back from the special effects. After this first film's dismal performance, however, the chances of one turning up in the next few years appear decidedly small."

"MidnightWarrior","3","0","3","5 November 2005"," Stunning visuals, incoherent religious discussion ruins story & plot
","After browsing through the new releases at the local video rental store, I found the movie Constantine. I remember seeing the ads for the movie and thinking how interesting this film looked; the visuals looked spectacular, the story had an affiliation with D/C comics (I'm not familiar with this particular comic) and it listed Keanu Reeves as the lead role.<br/><br/>So I bit the bullet and decided to rent this one. Overall, I thought the visuals, editing, and cinematography were fantastic. The cast selection was fairly good; the acting was superb. Yet somehow, I really didn't find the religious discussion from the plot and story in good taste.<br/><br/>Allow me to back track. When someone rents a film about demons and such, it's a given that there is going to be some form or sort of religious discussion. And usually the religious discussion has some sort of merit or something to fall back on.<br/><br/>In this film, the writers create somewhat of a new religion of their own desires. One reference is the reference to the 17th chapter of Corithians. No such chapter exists in real life; but in the movie, Hell's bible contains these plus more chapters.<br/><br/>Next, the whole religious thought that writers implement in the movie is grossly flawed. The Bible teaches us that God is the Only Supreme Ruler over all creation - see the 10 Commandments. In the film, Satan is equal with God.<br/><br/>The Bible teaches us that God has no son (Numbers 23:19), yet in the movie, God and Satan are said to have children who fight with one another. The Bible teaches us that Jesus (peace on him) is a prophet of God and is a man (James 1:13, Matthew 4:1). Yet in the movie the religious people constantly blaspheme by saying otherwise.<br/><br/>Heaven and Hell are portrayed as NYC city; hell being a junkyard with fire; Heaven being surrounded by beautiful clouds.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on, but I'd rather not. The point I'm trying to make is that not being religiously factual or accurate really destroyed the plot of the film, in my opinion. How could I enjoy this film when I kept thinking, ""the Bible says otherwise."" ? People who have no concern for religion and blasphemy might enjoy this film more than I did. People with concern for religion should approach this film with an open mind. Otherwise, you're very likely to become offended.<br/><br/>So I conclude by saying the above summary title says it all. And what a pity because the film had enormous amount of potential."

","I would recommend this film to people who enjoyed Stigmata or The Ninth Gate. The plot was fairly good which was carried by Keanu Reaves in his ""I'm going to save the world single handed"" role (which he is good at i.e. matrix). The effects were good. The one thing that was fairly ropey was Rachel Weisz's American accent which frequently switched back to English (as it was in Enemy at the Gate). Midnite AKA Djimon Hounsou from Gladiator played a cool middle man (middle of good and evil) whilst Peter Stormare playing Satan well. A good cast, good acting (generally), the plot was well paced. I enjoyed the views into hell, and the skimpy angel costumes. The film seemed to be a mix of Dogma, Blade, The Ninth Gate and a few more."

All the real good characters didn't get enough screen time, and the main character had way too much (like I was really concerned about him in the first place?)

Satan has some plans of his own though, as does the angel Gabriel. Interesting material but I think the movie failed to really capitalize on it. The scenes of Hell didn't impress me much, just a city in flames. The movie didn't really seem to have a climax either, unless you consider Satan in a white suit acting silly and making jokes one. Still, the movie moved along nicely and gave my mind a rest. And yes, I know a cricket is an insect and not a sound.<br/><br/>This one came across a little better with a second viewing. A little, mind you, which is to say it adequately passed the time. Constantine's golden, cross gun is absurd though. And I don't know how he managed to trick Satan at the end.

Apart from the fact that it is completely sacrilegious, and twists holy figures into evil wielding monsters, It takes every cheesy, lame direction you could take with this movie and goes there, at 100 miles per hour. <br/><br/>I was truly disappointed. Half way through I said to myself ""this is a good flick"" Then it started going downhill. cheesy one liners, predictability, and then awful chewing of gum instead of smoking at the end.

No director with any sense of pride in his craft could look at the scene where Constantine flips off the devil and say ""yes, this is a good thing to do"" ""it is not at all lame as hell"" <br/><br/>My mind just can't wrap around it. When this metaphorical building starting crumbling it fell down hard, and everywhere. Every character lost its initial charm and became one with the big pile of cheese this movie morphed into. The girl who played Angela was a good actress at least, and the director somewhat kept her integrity as a character, The rest of them were fed to the lame movie wolves. <br/><br/>I'm sorry if you liked this film, I truly am, I don't want to be Capt.Negative over here.

","John Constatine is so jaded -after all hes been to hell and back- that he wears a perpetual snarl. This in itself is probably the best I've seen from the lack-of-character actor, Keanu Reeves. Dare I say he played well the role of the stoic, gritty angel?<br/><br/>Constatine is challenged by Detective Angela Dodsen (Rachel Weisz) who, like her twin sister who committed suicide and is thus banished to hell), is also one of the few talents who can see the demons. Angela wants somehow to prove that her sister was actually murdered, and I guess somehow get her sister out of hell.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an exorcism and some wild special effects, and throughout there's always the promise of some exciting effects to be had. Well, we've seen good fx before, but how many movies let you hang around hell for a while. That was cool too. <br/><br/>In between the cool scenes, though, Constatine is miserable, which sort of permeates the film. Demons are escaping into ""our plane"" but the acting is weak so you never get a sense that the danger is real. Even Satan appears but he doesn't look dangerous, he just looks like the journey-man actor that he is, Peter Stormare.<br/><br/>I cant compare it to the comic book, since I've never read it, but I shudder to think how long its been since weve seen the really great demon movies such as the Exorcist and the Omen."
"chris-358","6","0","2","28 July 2005"," The Matrix meets Dogma
","First of all, I have to admit that I didn't watch the whole movie. My daughter had rented it from the local video store and I came in a few minutes after the start.<br/><br/>If Matrix was an exploration about the nature of reality, Constantine is an exploration about the nature of suffering.<br/><br/>Like Yin and Yang, in Constantine God and Lucifer both hold some sway over the affairs of the earth. There seem to be some higher ""rules"" that keep things in balance between the presence of good and evil forces in our current dimension.<br/><br/>Constantine himself is a person who is attuned to the presence of these good and evil forces. He is able to apply various techniques on them, including ""deporting"" demons back to hell when they cause problems.<br/><br/>If there is a God who allows suffering in this life just for ""our own good"", then maybe like Constantine we aren't so happy to embrace him. The alternative, embracing Lucifer and a future in Hell, is even more unpleasant. So Constantine tries to define his own future while he can.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is not consistent in the stance that God and Lucifer are equal and opposing forces. For example, I don't recall Constantine ever ""deporting"" an angel, only demons. And God rewards Constantine's self sacrifice at the end by welcoming him into heaven (only to be thwarted when Lucifer removes Constantines diseased lungs and restores him to life). Is good really better than evil? It looks like maybe it is.<br/><br/>The picture of reality being a game played by cosmic rules reminds me of Dogma. Similarly here, the rules of the Roman Catholic Church and similar constructions limit both the humans and the gods. I know the writers of Dogma were poking fun at those rules. I'm not so sure about Constantine.<br/><br/>Spoiler<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is that the finely tuned balance of good and evil influences on earth is going out of whack. Constantine is very busy trying to restore the balance. He meets a pretty police detective and they work together. In the end we discover that the angel Gabriel has been diddling with the system in order to have an overabundance of evil on the earth. Gabriel contends that men are at their best when they are undergoing suffering and trials. So to increase the goodness in man trials and suffering should be increased. Gabriel ends up becoming human (and enduring some of the suffering he so blithely employs), Constantine is delivered from both Hell and Heaven, and boy meets girl.<br/><br/>The end."
"The_Void","5","0","5","25 July 2005"," Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick...
","Much like the halfbreeds of it's plot, Constantine treacherously treads a thin line between a divide. The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's ""Chain Reaction"" co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss."

So what happened? Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos. After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off. But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism, silly discovery of a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies, suicides, 'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc. The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess, but others have done it better - many, many, many times ad infinitum.

"dee.reid","6","0","2","23 July 2005"," ""Constantine""
","In the tradition of comic book-to-film translations, ""Constantine"" (no, not THAT Constantine) offers very little in the way of plot and just focuses squarely on special effects and such. Also in line with such tradition, it all but completely discards the source material, which in this case are the DC/Vertigo ""Hellblazer"" comics. Though I'm not big on the ""Hellblazer"" series, which have seen their most popular arcs through comic book artist Garth Ennis, I do realize that much is different from the source material, including the fact that morose hard-a** anti-hero John Constantine is British and most of the action of the comics takes place in Liverpool, England.<br/><br/>But I'm not here to make comparisons; I'm here to judge a movie. The best thing to be said about ""Constantine"" is that it keeps you watching, not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it's fantasy - interesting fantasy.<br/><br/>In ""Constantine,"" we learn that John Constantine (the effectively wooden Keanu Reeves), is dying of cancer, forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an attempted suicide (he was clinically dead for two minutes), has a bad attitude, and can see demons yet no one else can. To think that a normal person could see demons you'd have no choice but to declare that person insane, right? Demons and angels, we learn, cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange occurrences in Los Angeles force Constantine to search for answers after he's attacked in public view by a demon.<br/><br/>The plot to ""Constantine"" bears more than a passing resemblance to a past Reeves vehicle (""The Matrix,"" anyone?), in that as human beings, we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality. As the film opens, two scavengers in Mexico discover the Spear of Destiny, the weapon rumored to have been used to kill Jesus Christ during the Crucifixion.<br/><br/>One of them high-tails it to Los Angeles where the main plot of the film is revealed. Isabel Dodson, the twin sister of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), commits suicide. Angela, the dogged detective she is, disbelieves the official story because she knows her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide, as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell.<br/><br/>The special effects are nonstop, and there is one effective and horrific sequence where Constantine ventures to Hell, which is in all respects, a darker vision of Los Angeles except it's a place where demons and the damned roam. With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies, who include normal human Chas (Shia LaBeouf), a half-breed named Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), appropriately named Father Hennessey (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), Constantine and Angela race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the forces of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The plot, if you want to call it that, is pretty non-existent and Reeves is pretty wooden as usual but let's face it, nobody in this cast is going to get Oscars come next spring. The film drags for about the first 20 minutes or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its motions. Director Francis Lawrence (of music video infamy, which accounts for the dizzying camera-work) does his best, but somehow or another the film can't really seem to get it together when it comes to certain parts of the script.<br/><br/>For example, it's not really sure what it wants to be: a horror movie, fantasy, thriller, what? It's not really sure and I'm not really sure of what it wants to do. Such items shouldn't plague the viewer but it does, to me, play out a lot like a mish-mash of all three.<br/><br/>As the anti-hero chain smoker John Constantine, Reeves' wooden acting is effective (is there any other way to play such a character?) and as the film progresses you can tell he's really suffering inside, as he grows sicker and sicker from cancer. And we also believe his desperation as he tries to send half-breeds to Hell in order to get back on God's good side so he can enter Heaven when he dies. In his character, we also get our fair share of Pentagrams and demonic spells and chanting and such. The opening sequence alone brings back uncomfortable memories of ""The Exorcist"" (1973).<br/><br/>""Constantine"" may win over die-hards of the ""Hellblazer"" and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter Stormare as an Armani-wearing Satan. Like Neo says, ""Whoa.""<br/><br/>6/10"

","This movie was very interesting I thought. The plot is very confusing but if you pay very close attention then you can understand it. Basically what this movie is about is Heaven and Hell. John Constantine had visions of demons as a child and soon tried to commit suicide, which is considered a mortal sin. However after the attempt doctors revived him. He was dead for 2 minutes and he spent those two minutes in Hell, and basically after seeing how horrible Hell was he never wanted to go back. So in a desperate attempt to buy his way into Heaven, he fights off the demons that are trying to cross over into the real world. The story tells us that there is a demon in every bad man and an angel in every good one. So when the demons attempt to come through, Constantine kills them off. But this still isn't good enough to get into Heaven. In the beginning an angel named Gabriel tells John that he can't buy his way into Heaven. John asks what he can do and Gabriel said self sacrifice. And then she tells him he's f***** which I found funny because she's an angel. But anyway...In the end just before the spawn of Satan is release, Constantine meets the devil. (Quick reminder that Hell wants him) The girl he's been with, Angela, has a sister who did the same thing that John did, committed suicide because of the visions she had. Constantine said that as long as she can go to Heaven instead of Hell, he'll go to Hell with him. However that is considered a self sacrifice and before the Devil can take him, He dies and goes to Heaven...briefly. Satan revives him, say that he's going to keep Constantine on the earth until he shows that he belongs in Hell. Cliffhanger, No? <br/><br/>OK well I enjoyed this movie. There could have been more action but it actually was much more a suspenseful movie than it was action or horror. However if that is what Hell is really like I'm afraid to go there too. No folks this is no ""Little Nicky"" Hell. This is a terrifying portrait of Hell. It creeped me out at least.<br/><br/>CAST <br/><br/>CONSTANTINE: The acting is okay. Keanu Reeves, although I honestly think he could use some acting lessons, is the perfect person to play the part of Constantine. He's not tormented by the things he sees, he almost sees them as playmates. Just more fun. And he does portray that well. 8/10 <br/><br/>ANGELA: Rachel Weisz does an okay job in this movie. To be honest I appreciated her role in the mummy more than in Constantine. In the end she just had no effect on me. I wouldn't have care if she died. But she did an okay job in showing how much she cared for her sister, and how much she really wished she could have helped her. 5/10 <br/><br/>CHAS: Shia LaBeouf is going to be a big star when he gets older. He becomes a bigger part of this movie towards the end and he didn't really have much to portray, but he plays his part perfectly. An eager kid wanting to be like John Constantine. ""If you're sitting on the bench you gotta be ready to play, right?"" -Best quote in the movie. I was like ""YES! Shia's gonna play a bigger part."" 9/10 So all in all, good movie that could have used development around the plot points. 7.5/10"

His down-beat portrayal of the depressed, chain-smoking, wise-cracking, cynical tool-of-god character is spot on. This is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, people!

I consider him to be a great actor, and though Constantine was a bit wooden, that's exactly what I would expect from a damned cancer sufferer - a really dry atmosphere.<br/><br/>For those who complain about the story - it's a fantasy film, filled with religious imagery, action, and dry humour. What's there not to like? Unless, of course, you just don't like supernaturalism in the first place.<br/><br/>The casting was wonderful. Rachael Weisz was strong and sexy, a perfect female lead. Ganin Rossdale was slimy enough, putting strength into his demon. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel is, in my opinion, the very definition of inspired casting. Pruitt Taylor Vince plays his pathetic yet helpful priest to perfection, and Djimon Hounsou balanced heroism and malice brilliantly. Finally, we have the Devil himself - Peter Stomare. Twitchy and cool, with a white suit and tar-coated feet as icing on the cake.<br/><br/>In the end, if you're a hard-core Hellblazer fanatic, or a tight anti-fantasy conservative, don't bother. If not, Ican't see a single reason why you wouldn't like this film."
"rar2","8","0","5","16 July 2005"," This movie is extremely good
","Contrary to many assertion this movie is well-casted. Keanu Reeves has been parodied and mocked - - and not without just cause - - yet he is more than adequate is this film. He's a bitter and frustrated man, so of course, he seems like he's ""been plugged"" into this film. Just read the tag-line on this site - - he's a nomad amongst three portals. And honestly no one can figure out which is which, right?<br/><br/>I agree that Hell is this movie was so amazing I certainly do not want to go there. Cheesiness aside, it's vivid, real, and, well, hellish. Rachel Weisz seems to stretch more at times, but is a great actress and has some befitting lines and good notions. Things have to be natural and they feel as such.<br/><br/>Moreover, I could not wait for the next scene. Midnight with the lamp, Weisz in the tub, Reeves with the cat - are all sensational scenes. Demonic fights are great and Gabriel is the bittersweet b---- you would expect. Some parts are sketchy, but Reeves is someone I thoroughly enjoyed in this movie. I watched it and honestly did not want to see anyone else take this part. He fit ""The Matrix"" and he definitely fit ""Constantine."" I remember a friend of mine thoroughly enjoying the Devil's appearance, yet it has nothing to do with his being a Rob Zombie fan. I concur because he's more than accurate and wild looking. I can't say much more without giving vitals away.<br/><br/>Justice is a key point in this film, but more aptly responsibility is a bigger themes. Reeves has a responsibility, Weisz a responsibility, Reeve's priest friend, Reeve's lackey, Gabriel, and down the list of characters - - they all have a purpose and a responsibility. It certainly has religious undertones and that will have you saying ""duh"" to this; however, you can partake your own opinion. The reason I say that is you're not blunted with religious irony, but rather caught up in a religious world. I mean Lucifer keeping a pact?<br/><br/>People never panic when they see these demons because exorcisms are expected and Reeves does make note of some oddities in the movie. What I liked the most was the natural occurrence of humor. It seemed like an effort to detach from atrocity, rather than lines written as such.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie works, but the ending is just outstanding. This movie breathes stereotypes, yet never tires you. There is theory and there is deep research, but nothing is beyond you in this movie. Furthermore, it is never condescending. You'll be wide-eyed at the sight of bending cars, crawlers, and shattered glass, but you'll also be well-informed."

","I never found myself feeling involved by the film (it never seemed like a problem to stop to answer the phone / make a sandwich etc.). It's pretty, with some nice effects, but not amazing. More a collection of scenes & images, with a threadbare plot linking one to another.<br/><br/>The visuals are (almost) arresting - a post-apocalyptic (almost Terminator 2) vision of Hell with 'Lord of the Rings' style demons. Exorcist/Zombie style possessions. One shot of demons in the night straight out of 'Pitch Black'. Lucifer played not as a fallen angel, as a fat, odious looking evangelist. Gabriel as a tall, strong, somewhat androgenous figure (but still with nice hair and funky laced-flares white jeans). Balthazar(?) as a Jude Law-ish yuppie. Transitions / visions / premonitions are all very slick, but ultimately lightweight. The bug demon screams CGI, as does the floor dragging at the end. It's all a bit too 'perfectly rendered' and might have had more weight - literally and figuratively - if the effects were more a mix of CGI, make-up, modelcraft and puppeteering. Rachel Weisz seems to be stuck with some bad lines, an under-developed character, and avoids a blatant opportunity to take her clothes off. But this is Hollywood, where sex is evil but violence is cool. Keanu is Keanu, which I don't have a problem with, but doesn't bring much in the way of characterisation.<br/><br/>Although a comics fan (including Vertigo) I never read Hellraiser, and cannot comment on the translation - but I won't be holding my breath for a sequel. And maybe it was my DVD, but the dialogue seemed very muffled and quiet - I even watched sections with the subtitles on. 'End of Days', 'Devil's Advocate' and 'Dogma' are all better films than Constantine."
"morbidangel897","5","0","6","5 July 2005"," Other comment is just a Keanu hater
","The comment above must have written by someone who wrote a bad review simply out of spite towards Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>There are parts that could be better and more sensible, but I don't think we have to exaggerate to weigh out the good parts. But if you follow the movie, instead of hating, it is easily understandable.<br/><br/>Now for the actors- Keanu Reeves does a great job of bringing pain to the character, sarcasm, and human-like qualities. When does Constantine NOT believe in himself? What's up with praising Rachel Weisz? She isn't a bad actress- but this isn't her greatest role. There's hardly any emotion- she seems to much like the cop we always see in movies. There's nothing outstanding about her.<br/><br/>And Djimon Hounsou, I will finally agree, does a good job. He's a great character - sleek, but humane. He brings real characteristics.<br/><br/>I think people get too uptight about movies- and 'Constantine' isn't one of those dramas that either move you emotionally, or move you off the couch to change the DVD. This is more of a sit back and have a good time, but it definitely makes you bite your nails at times.<br/><br/>The plot is original : Constantine's going to hell even though he's been trying to buy his way back. Along the way he meets Angela Dodson, a detective who's sister committed suicide- but she believes only something else unworldly could convince or make Isabel kill herself. From there the plot takes off, and they realize Satan is planning some earth-domination thing with HIS only son. It took me a time or two watching to understand that demon-baby thing coming out of Rachel Weisz (Angela)'s stomach is Satan's son, Mamma. Of course the plot is thicker, but that's a brief. It brings amazing effects- the beginning scene with Constantine performing some kind of excorism is amazing to watch, and the sarcasm and jokes Constantine gives are funny and delivered greatly by Keanu. Like when he succeeds in the exorcism, he flips off the demon and says, ""For your boss"" and other lines like that are kind of a relief.<br/><br/>Almost everyone's favorite effect though is the tub scene- where Angela wants to cross over to hell to see the demons her sister saw. Well, she climbs in, and once she's crossed over and come back, the water burst out of the tub, she falls out, and the force breaks the tub.<br/><br/>The movie really is amazing if you can get past some faults, which really all movies contain, it'll entertain if you let it. Let's have an open-mind people!! P.S. I will warn you, the first time you see the end is excruciating to watch- you might not know why they say some thing and it'll seem slow but I've seen it a few times, it got better."
"gvf","4","0","6","1 July 2005"," The Matrix meets End of Days... **yawn**
","I really expected more from this movie, what with all the hype it has been getting. Arguably one of Keanu Reeves's biggest mortal sins! It's kind of like a strange mix of key elements of The Matrix part one and the Schwarzenegger epic ""End of Days"". Also thrown in are some neat but not top-notch visuals (Adobe After Effects and the latest filter plug-ins still seem to go all the way) - and that's ""Constantine"" for you.<br/><br/>The storyline is paper thin and can be summed up in one or two sentences: Mammon, the son of Lucifer, wants to gain control of the earth and erect a kingdom of horror on the earth's surface. John Constantine, played by Reeves, tries to stop him, ultimately willing to sacrifice his own life. Where have we heard that one before? <br/><br/>Everything else, the numerous sub-plots and unresolved threads of the story (like, whatever happened to the Mexican guy after he carried the Spear of Destiny all the way to L.A. and went for a swim in that pool? Was that even him right there? What really happened to that fat priest? Why exactly did he die on that supermarket floor?) are really beside the point and kind of look like they were just needed to blow up a story into a two-hour movie that could have been told in just under 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Moreover, we all know that talent-wise, Keanu Reeves will never make a second Marlon Brando, but his acting (or lack thereof) in particular was a big disappointment here - just as unimaginative and unemotional as ever! Same with the other actors, maybe except for Peter Stormare with his brief, offbeat portrayal of the Devil himself towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The ending scene however still tops it off - first we get a shot of Reeves and ""that girl"" standing in front of a dark blue sky as if they are about to kiss (think of it as a poor adaption of your typical late 40's Hollywood ending - off color in more ways than one, at any rate). Then we get a real ""Matrix moment"", where Reeves threatens to come back in a sequel, muttering the words ""I've got a lot of cleaning up to do!""<br/><br/>Please, somebody talk some sense to the producers, and make it fast! The last thing we need is a sequel to this trashy pseudo-epic........<br/><br/>4/10"
"moviemanMA","7","0","7","1 July 2005"," Constantine will Blow You Away...
","Keanu Reeves has found his look in his new movie Constantine as John Constantine, a man wanted by the devil and rejected by God, trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to where they came from.<br/><br/>Along with Reeves (The Matrix trilogy) is Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Enemy at the Gates) as Angela Dodson, a young detective who mourns the loss of her twin sister Isabel, also played by Weisz. The two cross paths when Isabel commits suicide, which Angela can't conceive as possible, for her sister is a devout Catholic. <br/><br/>Reeves with his ability to see demons and angels will help Angela find out what happens to her sister after her death and essentially save the world from being taken over by the spawn of Satan.<br/><br/>Reeves gives a performance that will satisfy audiences, with witty remarks and a will to do anything. Constantine's smoking makes him not a superhero, but just another person with lung trouble. A character some folks can relate to makes him likable and not appalling.<br/><br/>The character John Constantine first appeared in the DC comic series Swamp Thing as a background character developed to look like the artist Sting, and evolved into a mentor to Swamp Thing. In 1987, the series Hellblazer was introduced and would be passed onto British writer Jamie Delano, bringing Constantine to life. The series attracted a cult following.<br/><br/>The first time director Francis Lawrence changes the pace from directing music videos for Brittany Spears and Aerosmith to making movies. This attempt at recreating DC Comics Hellblazer comic series is one that fans will love, but others might be turned off.<br/><br/>Lawrence's attempt at bringing Constantine to life works. The edgy and mysterious Constantine has a presence that is quite powerful, much like Batman. His reckless attitude are fueled by his unknown origins and interesting barrage of weapons used to drag demons out of people and ""deport"" them back to hell.<br/><br/>Lawrence uses the eyes of the characters very well, giving demons a red hue, and angels a gold coloration. This minor detail gives them more of an evil and menacing look to them. The special effects department did its job very nicely. Whether it be heaven, earth, or hell, the effects will please everyone.<br/><br/>The movie uses religious symbolism a lot. The movie takes place in Los Angeles or ""The City of Angels"" if translated into Spanish. The characters Angela, which sounds a lot like angel, and Constantine, who was the first catholic Holy Roman Emperor, also have religious connections.<br/><br/>The movie isn't completely well done. The beginning of the movie leaves you confused and unsure of what's going on. The action is present way too early. After the opening scene of a man being crushed by a car and walking away, Reeves casts a demon out of a little girl. Why or how he did this is a mystery until later on in the movie when his identity is made known. Not everything should be explained, but there are certain aspects that need to be explained. <br/><br/>Overall the movie was very good. This isn't a movie for everyone, though. Only people who enjoy comic book movies or are looking for a more involved action movie would want to see this. The action is great, a story line that goes well with the comic book series, but the subject matter is not intended for all audiences. This movie is worth the money."
"krank23","6","0","5","21 June 2005"," Nothing left...
","OK, do it like this: Take one blond ex-punk rocker Englishman who's a magician, usually spending his time in a comic where critique against current society and ""realistic"" portrayal of occultism is the norm, and who is of the opinion that heaven and hell are just as bad - a bunch of w*nkers. Do well past ten years of dissecting the mind of said Englishman, creating a wonderful plethora of great stories, characters and depth.<br/><br/>Then, make this Englishman an American, dark-haired yuppie, played by what might be considered the worst actor ever (whose only real claim to fame was to star in one of the most overrated wannabe-deep action flick trilogies of all time). Place him in New York, and remove all elements of social critique, make sure all occultism is portrayed in as daft a light as possible. Make him WANT to go to heaven. remove all interesting characters, and transform the remaining ones beyond all recognition. Oh, and rewrite his entire personal history, since someone didn't like the years of hard work done by the original authors.<br/><br/>This is what you will end up with. A mindless, mind-numbing kinda-action-flick, incapable of stirring even the least bit of intelligent thought. The most profound thought I had during the entire film can be summed up like this: ""Whoa. Nice effects, dude"".<br/><br/>Not that it's a bad thought. I just expected more from the movie version of one of my absolute favorite comics.<br/><br/>Anyways, if one completely disregard any connections to an actual comic book, ignoring the title and the names of some characters - well, then one might think of this as ""kind of a decent action-flick"". Not great, not really mediocre (compare with the complete drivel that is ""Daredvil"").<br/><br/>In short summary - This is not Hellblazer. This is not John Constantine. This is an action flick who needed the popularity boost of the comic-book readers. No more, no less. See it for what it is, and you might just enjoy it. And for (insert deity)'s sake - go read the comic.<br/><br/>---"
"thdude44","8","0","4","19 June 2005"," A fun, smart, and stylish thriller
","Keanu Reeves returns to play yet another savior in dark clothing, I'm sorry, but no shades this time around. Reeves plays Constantine, a chain-smoker who has been ""blessed with a gift"" to see the evil and good spirits that roam the earth. During a near death experience, he finds himself in Hell, and having no faith at all, he then knows there is truly a Heaven and a Hell. After finding out where he will end up when he dies, he tries to use his ""gift"" to buy his way back into Heaven by vanquishing the demons that do not follow the rules of The Balance. The Balance is a wager made between God and the Devil, seeing how each side influences the world without doing it themselves. There's a problem though, apparently killing off the demons doesn't buy him into Heaven, and he will need to do something better than that before he dies of cancer from all his smoking. Constantine soon meets a detective (Rachel Weisz) and helps her figure out if her twin sister actually committed suicide. <br/><br/>Constantine is based on the popular DC comic book, Hellblazer. At first, Reeves isn't what they really had in mind to play the main role, being that Constantine in the comic is blonde, muscular, and British. And surprisingly enough, Reeves did very well. I mean, I like the guy and enjoy watching him on screen, but about 80% of the time, he's just not that good of an actor. As it turns out, he was perfect for the role and played it beautifully. Also, Peter Stormare, star of films such as Fargo and Windtalkers, comes in for a little cameo as Satan. He gives a quirky, yet demented performance in which I thoroughly enjoyed. Director Francis Lawrence has an eye for well, eye candy. The visuals in this film are absolutely a wonder to look at, with the sort of green shade over most of it, not to mention the special effects that came with it. Usually, I can really notice the stuff that isn't real, but this time, everything looked so realistic; the demons, the possessed, Hell itself, it was the best I've seen in a while. From the advertisements I've seen for this film, it looks like an action flick, but is far from it with only one action sequence (which is worth the price of the ticket all by itself) it is more of a supernatural thriller/drama/mystery. This is not another Keanu Reeves Matrix flick. This is spiritual, interesting, smart, and has enough eye candy to withstand that of any other film I've seen for a while. Constantine is a different type of movie all together, nothing like it has ever been done."

","There are so many things to enjoy in this movie that I was too busy enjoying them to complain! Here's my 2 cents.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the film has excellent camera work, editing and sound. Above par is what I would call it. Color scheming is amazing and the dark style is right on.<br/><br/>Even if you hate Keanu, the supporting actors in this movie are great. Pruitt Taylor Vince is extremely under rated as an actor. Shia was awesome as the kid, Djimon was fantastic.. Even Gavin was extremely effective as a soft spoken hate peddler. AND I have to say after seeing that movie, the first thing I said was.. ""Keanu actually did something that approximates acting."" I'm a fan of all that hocus pocus, religious artifacting. Growing up with movies like Indiana Jones, I have a soft spot for that type of thing. And the Lance of Longinus is the most powerful one of the bunch. Little things like the wilder beasts falling over, dead.. the cat and water deal.. The vermin man.. Even their version of hell were really well thought out. The angels and demons even stand out with that eye lighting technique.<br/><br/>Just for Peter Stormare, this movie was worth it. That whole last scene was one of the most intense climaxes I have seen in years. Just when I thought it couldn't get any cooler, things kept getting better and better. The whole action-reaction and consequence domino effect kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>For my money, this movie really hit it out of the park. Going in I kept my expectations adjusted for Keanu, but I was completely surprised. I wasn't expecting such a well made film. Take it for what it is, you may enjoy it too."

Constantine pretty much lived up to my expectations but it had a couple of problems that stopped it from getting a higher vote.<br/><br/>The cast was generally pretty good, I'm still confused as to why Keanu keeps getting roles in big movies considering his limited acting ability but he's saved by a quite able supporting cast. Keanu's dead pan demeanour does fit his characters permanently miserable outlook however. The special effects are all fairly good and the action scenes are well executed but what lets the film down is it's script and the general pace of the film.<br/><br/>The script isn't a huge problem the dialogue just seems a little clunky in places but the film feels quite slow. When the philosophy starts to take over the film looses all momentum and then has a hard time building it up again. A couple more set pieces may have stopped this from happening but if the people behind this film are considering making a franchise out of it then this problem may disappear like in the first x-men film when a little too much time is spent in setting the scene.<br/><br/>Overall Constantine is a bit stupid in places and a little slow but this doesn't stop it from being one of the more enjoyable films to have been released in a while."

","Oh dear, its like they took the worst parts of Men In Black and The League Of Gentleman and came up with this tripe. Don't get me wrong if your not ahead of the game in realising some of the greatest stories are graphic novels (and that they should make excellent films easily, as after all, they have already done the 'graphic' and the 'novel' part) then you should be entertained watching this film. If your like me, unfortunate enough to have enjoyed Constantine before he hit the big screen, you will leave disappointed.<br/><br/>This was always going to be one of the harder graphic novels to convert to film, as one of the key features to the suspense was you never knew what old John boy was capable of, you just knew not to mess with the *cough* Keanu *cough* I mean man. This leads nicer than a holy shepherd into my main gripe with the film, its been Americanized. Making something Americanized may be a good thing if I trademark the phrase, as sadly this is becoming an all to common phenomenon, but if your just a lover of film this is becoming the most blasphemous of dirty words. Once again we see a fantastic British story from British Writers shifted over the water and this time we are not even given the good grace of casting a Brit in the lead role, John has applied for his visa and has left Blighty. Also Like The League Of Gentleman an American sidekick worms his way into the story, though it looks like higher powers did step in as it seemed most of his scenes were cut.<br/><br/>The film also departs pretty conclusively from the original Hellblazer story's with John now running round with a gun straight out of MiB and basically kicking ass, instead of what I firmly believe would have made this the rival to Sin City by sticking with the witty and clever John who outsmarted his enemies. If they'd have stuck with this they could have put their SFX budget to much better use as what we do get is pretty much pomp and fanfare rather than contributing anything to the story.<br/><br/>It should get 0 out of 10 as the fact Hollywood have now made this means we wont get a decent English remake for many years if at all. End of the day it boils down to a watchable 6 out of 10, only because I'm a CG student so have a weak spot for cool SFX."
"gracegenevieve","Null","0","3","2 April 2005"," Don't sweat the theology
","'Constantine' is a very clever re-working of the so-called Manichaean heresy, which has been bothering the Catholic Church on and of for centuries. Manichaeism is a dualistic concept of 'good' and 'evil', which posits that God and the Devil have equal power and status, and sees the universe as a battle ground between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. Mainstream Christian theology, whether Protestant or Catholic, takes the view that the Devil is just another created being, and so can never be a full counterweight to God: he (it) is simply the Tempter, the one who influences people to reject God, (a bit like these 'demon half-breeds', I suppose). The Christian view is that human beings are already redeemed and the devil has been defeated by Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. However, in the world of Constantine, it's all up for grabs, although I admit the scriptwriters seem to have doubled back on themselves at the end when they have Gabriel (is it?) pointing out that all Constantine had to do was genuinely repent his suicide to be let off the hook. I would only add, not because the suicide attempt had doomed him to hell but because it hurt God. (You've got to repent for the right reasons - it's not enough just to feel sorry because you have to live with the unpleasant consequences of your bad behaviour!) As a Catholic myself, I don't get annoyed when film makers appropriate the rituals or symbols of Catholicism for their own ends - it's all tremendously THEATRICAL, after all!. I loved the film simply because it was such a good take on this old, old chestnut which has been around for centuries - the Albigensians, the Cathars, etc - all convinced there was a war between the Two Super Powers, Heaven and Hell, and the exciting thing was, they never knew how it was going to turn out ...<br/><br/>Love from the were-cat."

And a more realistic look at religion and very interesting characters.But I like just about everything from The sound of music to House of a 1000 corpses.So if demons with half heads and a devil whose nickname is Lou and feet drip with tar isn't enough for you than I would not suggest you see this movie.But if you like twisted angels and a glimpse of Hell.a. give it a chance.I think you might be surprised. Oh yeah and a hottie Gavin Rossdale as a demon in a dapper suit .Hell yeah."

","I have just got back from watching Constantine at the cinema. I had been desperate to see it and thought it looked fantastic and have eventually just seen it. I can not make my mind up what I though of it. Yes it was quite possibly a good film, the special effects were excellent (I normally hate special effects with a passion, but these were very very good), but I felt a lot of the subject matter was offensive, disturbing, and quite unnecessary. I felt extremely uncomfortable throughout the film and found a great deal of it hard to watch. There was a surprising amount of references to suicide and mental health difficulties. This was my problem. I do not think it was necessary to have so many links to suicide, or to show them in detail or treat the issue in the way they did. The was one part in particular, I think it was quite probably the most triggering scene I have ever seen in my life- where he puts a cigarette out in his own blood after he had slit his wrists.. I really don't know how they managed to get that shown so easily with no objections. I think it is the most disturbing thing I have ever seen, I just sat shaking in my seat afterwards not sure what to do. Have other people thought this or is it just because I have similar problems that they upset me? Either way I think people should be more aware and considerate of these things."
"filmbuff-36","7","0","3","1 April 2005"," Interesting but flawed Gothic comic book tale
","Apparently God and the Devil made a bet. Not the one involving Job, but you'd think that after that debacle Satan would have learned his lesson. In any case, they both promised to stay in the background and simply influence people's actions, with the fate of mankind's souls being in a cosmic toss up. But every now and then, a demon decides to sneak around the rules.<br/><br/>Within this neutrality agreement lie certain people with the ability to see what's really happening behind the scenes. One of these gifted few is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a chain-smoking world-weary rogue who uses his powers as a mercenary exorcist in Los Angeles. Constantine himself has been to Hell briefly, having committed the mortal sin of suicide before being saved by doctors, and now is trying to redeem himself by sending demons back where they came from. Recently diagnosed with lung cancer, it seems that time is running out for him to get back in the good graces of the Almighty.<br/><br/>His life becomes complicated with the arrival of Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a police officer whose twin sister recently committed suicide. Dodson suspects some sort of foul play is involved, and Constantine reluctantly is forced to agree when he notices a high amount supernatural activity in effect.<br/><br/>Realizing the balance is starting to shift toward the dark side, Constantine must decide if he can earn his way out of Hell on actions alone, or if there is something more to it then that.<br/><br/>""Constantine"" is a movie that almost gets it right in terms of storytelling. Based on the DC Comic ""Hellblazer,"" the film has all the prerequisites for a good fantasy-action tale. But it only scratches the surface in showcasing this world that the characters inhabit, instead relying on Gothic, moody film noir atmosphere.<br/><br/>First time director Francis Lawrence cranks up the action nicely, but is betrayed by a screenplay that assumes the audience is already familiar with the universe in which the story takes place. While it's nice to let the crowd fill in their own blanks in some cases, giving some meaning to the rules wouldn't hurt, either.<br/><br/>Also strange is the weird mix of Christianity with Eastern principles such as dualism, that is that evil and good have equal powers in the universe and both are necessary to balance each other out. The two religious views just don't mesh with each other, and as a result the story doesn't really capture either very well.<br/><br/>Reeves plays his role quite convincingly, perhaps because he already honed his ""outcast Chosen One"" skills during ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Burnt-out and perpetually throwing another cigarette in his mouth, at least when he's not coughing up lung tissue, Reeves manages to take a selfish, disreputable jerk and make him quite sympathetic. In the ten years since ""Speed"" was released, he has grown into the role of action star quite nicely.<br/><br/>Weisz basically does here what she did for Brendan Fraser in ""The Mummy"" movies  play second fiddle. While she does give Dodson some much needed angst, Weisz is trapped in stock character, and can't bring her to life. Far more interesting but sadly underused are Tilda Swinton as very androgynous angel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare who camps things up nicely as Satan. While more time with the former may have fleshed out the angel's motivations, too much more time with the latter may have worn out his welcome.<br/><br/>""Constantine"" beckons for a greater story to be told with these characters, and with any luck there will be. Just a personal nitpick, however. How come movies such as these have to be engulfed in Catholic imagery? Are there no Methodists ready to kick demon butt? Just asking.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 stars. Reeves acquits himself nicely and the movie is still good despite a lackluster plot."
"monkeybone","8","0","3","1 April 2005"," Good movie that has been to hell and back.
","O.k., Keanu Reeves is hardly Oscar winning material but somehow always manages to land some top roles ie The Matrix, Speed and now Constantine. Here he plays the title character from the Hellblazer comics John Constantine who has the ability to see angels and demons that roam the Earth in human form. It's his job to rid the world of all the demons in the hope that the man upstairs will give him redemption so he can get into Heaven. However there is a slight glitch in his plan in the fact that he is a 30 a day smoker since the age of 15, drinks heavily and only cares about number one. When he was a child, he committed suicide to escape the ability that he has but was revived after being declared clinically dead for two minutes. During that time he went down to Hell. All this adds to Constantines' character. <br/><br/>Plot wise, Constantine is fairly easy to understand with Rachel Weisz playing a cop who's investigating her twin sisters' death. She asks Constantine for help as he is the only one who can give her the answers that she needs. While this is going on, there is a far a greater evil lurking which may be tied in with all this.<br/><br/>As with all comic book, or any kind of literary adaptation, there will always be differences between the two mediums. This is something that will add annoyance to fans of the comic as there is bound to be alterations no matter how small, but this is the movies and things will be changed for whatever reason. It would be unfair to totally slate this movie as, from someone who is not a comic book reader, this is a decent enough movie, even if some of the performances are not exactly award winning.<br/><br/>The special effects are of a good quality even if things do appear a bit ropey at times. Constantine flows through smoothly and even though it doesn't live up to the hype generated by the trailers it's a fun a couple of hours."
"kergillian","8","0","4","27 March 2005"," A Hell of a Film!
","A fun-filled and exciting adaptation of the comic. If you're a purist, you'll hate it - but for those of us who can appreciate something without it having to be an exact replica down to the letter, it is a film worth exploring.<br/><br/>This is not the first film that seemed doomed when it was relocated from England to the States. High Fidelity is one of my all-time favourite novels. When I heard that they set it in Chicago, I nearly flipped - I mean, being in England is central to the book! I sensed that the relocation would completely ruin the novel. Then I saw the film. I should have known that any film Stephen Frears directs and John Cusack stars in would have a hard time being awful. High Fidelity is one of my absolute favourite films.<br/><br/>Constantine isn't directed by Frears, and Reeves is no Cusack, but when I heard it was relocated from England to LA and that Reeves was J.C., who had become a cop along the way, I kept an open mind. I knew from experience that change could be good. You have to remember that the average film-goer is not a comic fan, and few of them have read the comic. While purists will curse and moan about the changes, those making the film have to keep the film interesting to a mass audience while trying to retain as much of the essence of the comic as possible. They did a damn good job here. It's not the best film I've seen, but it was a fair adaptation, it was exciting to watch, and it had a tight script which was well-shot and well-adapted. Considering the director is a first-timer who had previously only shot videos, it's actually quite impressive. Only David Fincher and Spike Jonze have ever really made the crossover successfully (and with talent for film-making), so it's not often we see a film as well constructed as this by a video director.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is exciting to watch - especially in films where he really enjoys himself. You can tell that he really likes playing this character. Unfortunately. he is stuck with a voice that simply cannot change - like Sly Stallone and Vin Diesel, Keanu has the voice that will forever sound the same. In Dangerous Liaisons everyone complained that he sounded like Ted, here everyone complains he sounds like Neo. But once you get past the surface, you'll see a rich character portrayal, with an intensity and discomfort that Neo never really had. He can't shake his voice - which will always be that of Ted Theodore Logan - and now will always have pieces of Neo in it. But those who know the comic should be impressed with the way he carried himself - his poses, his body language, they really reflected the J.C. we know and love.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is as sultry as ever, and what an interesting performance by Tilda Swinton - who opens up all forms of questions with her androgynous characterization of Gabriel. The sexless angel - or multi-sexual angel - brings an interesting level of interpretation of heaven and divine intention to the film.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou and Pruitt Taylor Vince each performed fantastically, as is expected of actors of their calibre. If Keanu had intensity, they blew intensity off the map.<br/><br/>But not as far as Peter Stormare did, as a perfect Satan. Part playboy, part psychopath - his eyes had that same look they did in Fargo...something in them that says 'you don't want to look here, go away. NOW!'<br/><br/>And was that Gavin Rossdale I saw as Balthazar?? If he only sang as well as he acts, Bush might have been a half-decent band... <br/><br/>All in all, this is not the best film of the year, but it certainly beats most of the other films out there at the moment. With a plethora of second-rate horror films and really awful video game movies, it's nice to have a seat-of-your-pants horror/suspense/ adventure film to fall back on. Slow at times, when it's on, it's ON - and it's very impressive to look at. Not for the stubbornly purist, but for anyone looking for an entertaining, quality film, I recommend it, 7.5/10"

","Maybe the biggest advantage I had, comes by the fact of not having a clue of who John Constante was before seeing this movie. So I've been able to avoid comparisons with the comic, and I gotta say, if the comic is better than this, I've been loosing my time reading Dante's Masterpiece. <br/><br/>Constantine is so a rich character, that you won't want to get up from the sit. The kind of guy that carries a cross and keep it up. Just like if it was a habit, he continues his life, but hates it. He's rude, violent and bad-tempered, and even that, we feel secure under his personality. <br/><br/>The greatest achievement of the movie, is definitely the mix between atmosphere and characters; the amazing version of hell, and the interesting theory about earth's good and evil balance.<br/><br/>Technically superb, from special effects to photography, guys have been doing the homework, and show it up here. <br/><br/>So if there's such a thing like demons on this world, I'd really like John Constantine to be my cousin or at least my friend. Most of you will tell me that rather to be John Constantine your own, but that work is already pretty well done by Keanu. Enjoy it!"

","This movie was based off the original comic books in which the character John Constantine fights demons, but is never on the side of ""good"". To him there is a very small distinction between good and evil. He is a wizard, con man, demon slayer, and basically gives the finger to both Satan and God. He has some powers, but is really nothing more than human.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie going into it understanding this simple concept. A lot of people disliked Keanu Reeves' performance in this movie, but that is pretty much how John Constantine really is. A person who doesn't care, is an asshole, and is really only looking out for himself. Don't expect John Constantine to become emotional, have compassion, or even show fear. Now the problem with a character like that is he doesn't give that emotional kick that people are often looking for from movies. Even Van Hellsing, as bad as it was(I liked it, since I knew it was nothing more than special effects + Sci-fi), still attempted to make you really want the good guy to win. <br/><br/>Now if special effects, sci-fi, and a person like John Constantine doesn't interest you very much I'd stay clear of this movie."

","CONSTANTINE That film was amazing; visually stunning and (in my mind) quite thought provoking  yes the similarities between this movie and Reeves previous Matrix project cannot be escaped, but that said this movie I don't think is simply riding on the coat tails of the success of the Matrix trilogy and deserves to be regarded in its own right.<br/><br/>For those that don't know, Reeves' character John Constantine is a man who sees demons and performs exorcisms the theology in the movie is at times suspect but I would say takes ideas presented in the Bible but stretches them somewhat  but then, I tire at those who go to see a movie of this nature and expect it to be anything more than entertainment.<br/><br/>I think what I most loved about the movie was the filmography of it, he use of interesting shooting angles and of colour filters. Also it was fairly stylistic in its costuming with the use of black and white very clever. My favourite character though HAS to be the Angel Gabriel amazing, utterly amazing!"
"ncbrian","4","0","5","23 March 2005"," A great source poorly adapted
","Constantine's visuals are absolutely incredible. They're even better than what you would expect for a high-action Keanu movie. Although I don't rate this movie very high, its visuals are worth the price of a movie ticket, and for sure a rental.<br/><br/>Keanu has picked another acting challenge. A boring, soft-spoken, super-hero type that wears sunglassesoh wait, that's all he does well. But it's true; he's earned his place in the action movie hall of fame. This time he's born with the ability to recognize demons and angels that walk the earth in human skin. After having attempted suicide in his youth, he is trying to change his fate of being doomed to hell by confronting demons and saving souls. Even the premise it interesting which is why the comic book was such a success. But the movie is fairly lenient in adapting its source material. Not only do they not make this classic character a blond or British, but the character is barely human. The humanity is what makes him interesting in the first place. Keanu gives a supernatural approach (surprise, surprise), which ruins the entire theme.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton makes her appearance as the Angel Gabriel; raising the level of talent significantly. She steals every scene she's in. Djimon Houston does a great job too, as could be expected.<br/><br/>I can't believe I'm saying this, but the movie may have had more success if it was made into a series of movies. The reason I say this is because there is so much to contemplate in this movie. The minute you grasp one concept, another one comes your way. They pack too much into a two hour movie. Too much information just ends up in mush. When you're dealing with the end of the world, I guess two hours just isn't enough."

","Constantine is not what i thought it was going to be: And my assumptions of such a movie would be an action-packed, rapid-paced, 'thinker' movie. Well, if you are (or were) expecting the same kind of viewing experience, allow me to dispel a few of those thoughts.<br/><br/>While watching this film, I was a bit surprised of how many horror techniques it used. Jump after jump of deafening noise, louder and more encompassing than the THX sound tests that blast through the start of some movies in and out of theaters. Reader, if you have not yet seen this movie and you DON'T like movies that make you jump, please do yourself a service and do not see Constantine.<br/><br/>For those of you that can take a few jumps and blasting noise here and there, I think you may be pleasantly entertained by this flick--IF you are not somewhat knowledgeable of the Christian doctrine and Christian history. However, for these readers that do know quite about about Christianity and its ins and outs, then you might not be so pleased with this film. Constantine is more of a horror flick than a religious thought-provoking movie.<br/><br/>If Christian historical inaccuracies lower your viewing pleasure, then I would think twice before seeing it. Then again, if you are looking for a movie that is visually rapid and rich at the expense of religious precision--Constantine is quite a find.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Constantine is a good jumpy-thriller movie, but thats about all it really is."

","CONSTANTINE (2005) Dir. Francis Lawrence 'Hell wants him. Heaven won't take him. Earth needs him.' Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weiz, Djimon Honsou, Tilda Swinton, Shia La Beouf.<br/><br/>In a world, split into three parallel universes; heaven, hell and earth, John Constantine (Reeves) is a bad-ass, chain smoking, exorcist ridding the world of half-breeds (half human, half angel or demon) in order to assure safe passage into heaven.<br/><br/>There is no denying that like much of Hollywood's recent output, the film is a visual feast, including mouth-watering set-pieces involving Constantines trip to hell and numerous face-offs with a wide range of strange and interesting creatures. Reeves goes about the film without ever moving out of second gear in a performance suggesting he has the emotional range of a pea. Weiz is steady and assured but never sparkling as the sister of a suicide victim, unsure of whether she is in hell or not.<br/><br/>The plot, while interesting gets too tangled up in itself over the 122 minutes, heaping complication on complication as Constantine and Detective Dodson (Weiz) help prevent the world from falling into the hands of an exceedingly camp devil (Peter Stormare). Certain points are not concluded such as the apparent disappearance of the devil's son and the fact that the devil has brown sticky tar on his feet.<br/><br/>Though, the script could do with some work to flesh out the paper-thin characters, the premise is intriguing enough, helped by dazzling visuals and Keanu's star-power, to give a genre picture a chance with a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>VERDICT: 3/5"

Cappello for the story of Kevin Brodbin himself; tells the unnatural story of a world which stands between Hell and Heaven. It's a nice plot, an outstanding treatment from these guys. But I think it could be more enjoyable if they write it in a less serious tone. The screenplay seemed to be so serious; some times it looked like an art movie. Also the soul of Constantine given by Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt and Billy Howerdel was brilliant. The theme score was the best thing happened in this new age Movie History, it truly suited for the movie atmosphere.<br/><br/>Also in the bright side we have director Francis Lawrence who did a tremendous work. Basing from the comic he created a world which was so real, appealing and interesting. The lead casting was good, Keanu as the disturbed Constantine and Rachel Weisz as the confused Angela Dodson/Isabel Dodson. Except them all others were worthless in the movie. Major mismatch was the Satan, the way the script as well as actor treated him was the worst thing in the movie.<br/><br/>But hey the movie have some good things also; great photographic angles, visual EFX, gorgeous female cop, a great ""unspeakable relation"" and a good seed for a Sequel.<br/><br/>Constantine = Cause to tie."

","I'm a big fan of Devil's Advocate as well as most films within the religious horror/action genre, and this film is the suckiest serious attempt to make such a flick that I can recall. Sure it has good special effects here and there, but special effects have become so overrated these days. The fact is that it is filled with extremely hoaky and unbelievable spells, boring dialogue, and sucky acting. I like Keanu in some films, but he was boring in this one. He was as lifeless as a stone. I think he was supposed to be some sort of bitter, sarcastic, Dennis Leary type character, but his acting skills were unable to pull off such a character. In the film, Satan looks like a ridiculous pimp and is a pathetic joke. Occasionally characters will go to Hell and return with steam on them from their horrific journey, but the film doesn't even show us half of these journeys to Hell. So you finally think that something exciting is going to happen besides the endless boring dialogue and you are rewarded by mere steam coming off of a body and no vision of Hell or the monsters. They probably decided to not show us every time the characters went to Hell because it cost too much, well they should have scrounged up some more money to end the monotony of the dialogue. Occasionally, you see Hell, but very rarely. The whole plot is basically unoriginal. You have a Heaven and a Hell and the Earth is neutral ground between the two dimensions where angels and demons can influence events, but only to a certain extent. Who cares? There's nothing original about that. The characterization was underdeveloped, except for maybe constantine, who was acted poorly anyway. Overall, the film is hoakey (just wait for the spells and such), strains belief, is unoriginal, has boring dialogue, not much action, and basically sucks. The only positive spots are that some of the special effects and the cineamatography looks cool, and there is a little bit of character development and spats of decent acting, but just not enough to carry a film so big budget and hyped as this one."

","Watch enough horror movies and you can be forgiven for thinking that the Reformation never happened. Just once I'd like to see a Methodist demon though I'd settle for a Lutheran vampire or two. Unfortunately - or fortunately depending on your point of view - the new supernatural action film Constantine does nothing to further the protestant cause. It is firmly rooted in the gaudiest Catholic mythology with more Latin, holy water and crucifixes than in all the churches of Rome. None of it is taken seriously mind you. Thousands of years of tradition and belief are gleefully misused, misquoted and misconstrued in the service of a senselessly gory and violent movie. That it's a well made and entertaining slice of hokum probably won't cut much slack for Constantine's creators in the hereafter.<br/><br/>It seems that God and the Devil made a bet a millennia ago as to who could win the most souls to their cause. Points are taken off for direct supernatural meddling. All the rules allow is a spiritual nudge or an earthly temptation here and there, but someone is not playing by the rules! Demons are finding their way to earth and an ancient, incredibly holey artifact is about to fall into the very worst of hands. It's up to John Constantine, PI and freelance exorcist, to expose the demonic conspiracy. Unfortunately he has terminal lung cancer and is facing damnation due to a botched suicide attempt. It would be a short movie if it weren't for the pretty cop who seeks Constantine's help in solving the mystery of her sister's suicide. Further stirring the pot are various holy and unholy notables who make their agenda and themselves known as the plot progresses.<br/><br/>Constantine cries out for a tough guy lead. Like Bruce Willis say, or Samuel L. Jackson. Instead we have Keanu Reeves. In truth Reeves is not all that bad. He plays John Constantine strait, drawing humor and pathos from the character's jaundiced world view and hopeless position. Unfortunately Reeves lacks the charisma and physical presence a rough, world weary demon hunting PI might be expected to have. On the other hand Rachel Weisz is great as the conflicted cop. Emotional without being overly weepy and believably tough she seems entirely capable of handling her supernatural problems without Constantine's help. It's too bad her character devolves into a standard woman in distress. Pruitt Taylor Vince makes so much of his part as a slovenly priest we become more intrigued by him than we are with the main plot line. Tilda Swinton is righteous and more than a bit creepy as the angel Gabriel. Finally there is Peter Stormare as Satan. Funny, frightening, and truly alien, his is one of the best devils ever put on film.<br/><br/>Despite unholy cadres, heavenly hosts, visions of hell and all matter of supernatural jumbo jumbo Constantine feels more like a film noir than a supernatural melodrama. To John Constantine Satan is just another corrupt Mr. Big trying to muscle into town and God and His angels are an unreliable and suspect city hall. As the movie takes its tone from its hero's attitude it is more suspenseful than horrific. Constantine's pleasures derive from the way its detective movie roots collide with the supernatural overlay. The movie does a fine job treading this line without falling too far into parody. Park your brain at the door and enjoy."
"johnmbale","6","0","5","13 March 2005"," A vision of Hell - but not quite up to it.
","Starting with a scene that would do justice to ""The Exorcist"" the remaining film falls short of promise. The plot has all the logic of the comic strip, and heaps of Biblical babble that is mainly nonsense. The crux of the story is summed up in an old Chris de Burgh song ""Spanish Train"" wherein God and the Devil gamble for souls. Keanu Reeves is Po faced, certainly not Mr. Congeniality, but is cement set in his old Matrix role. However in fairness he does what he can in his limited range as the Metaphysical Detective of the Woeful Countenance. The female lead Rachael Weisz acts her heart out, and seems up to the task of ridding the world of unspeakables. Yet more impressive are the cameo performances of delightful Tilda Swinton as very oddball Angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as a particularly repulsive Devil.<br/><br/>Constantine is a chain-smoking demon catcher, enlisted to investigate the suicide of Weisz's sister, and finds instead the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil. He can see both angels and demons when they appear on earth which helps him sort things out no end.<br/><br/>The director manages to create a dark Gothic look to the visuals, and some very creepy moments, and the picture is at its best when the effects are played down, and the actors are played up. Visions of Hell are right out of Hieronymus Bosch, and a nice gritty feeling pervades. Things fall apart when absurd props are introduced like the Demon Demolishing Gun that appears to be left over from Van Hesling (which was a send up anyhow.) <br/><br/>It's a pity more adult concepts weren't permitted to lift the picture into a higher class of Gothic horror, and one feels a good movie lurking in the background. And is there a quit smoking message in there - yes there is."

","Constantine (2005) Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. I had no background info, no plot briefing of any kind, in fact all I knew was it was based on a popular comic book and that Keanu Reeves was in it. So, seeing as nothing decent was on, Constantine seemed to be a pretty comfortable choice to settle on. And I was right in doing so.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is set in what seems to be modern day times and is based around the main Character of John Constantine. Now, at first the movie seems a bit bland, and mediocre... looking to fall into many traps of Religious movie clichés (see Blade Trinity). Although, as the story progresses, the characters begin to form and the plot thickens, the whole world of Constantine becomes enrapturing and the story ceases to get boring.<br/><br/>Now I have been reading many other reviews of this movie and it seems Keanu is getting quite a bad reaction. Now, I won't be the first to admit that his acting skills aren't among the greatest in Hollywood at the moment but think I will be among the few in saying that I believe he did well in this movie. Now, seeing as I have never read the actual comic book, I will never know if he did in fact do the part of Constantine any justice, but with that said, I remain confident in my belief that Keanu is slowly getting somewhere with his acting talent. As for the other actors, although many of them didn't receive the time to truly focus deeply on each of their characters, the acting on the whole was great.<br/><br/>The only downfall of this movie for me was the overall depth. I believe it could have went much further into the history of the Spear of Destiny (could have been placed at the beginning of the movie after the brief WWII note) and maybe even have took time to demonstrate the facts of what was going on. I would have also like to have seen further character and sub-plot development. Other than that, I will conclude in saying that it seems you will either love or hate this film. I myself found the movie a great escape from realty for 2 hours and advise you go see it in your spare time... but don't rush yourself.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","As the streets fall quiet and the darkness approaches a mysterious Constantine creeps into cinemas with a frightening silence from audiences.<br/><br/>The film is based on the popular DC/Vertigo comic book, Hellblazer and directed by Francis Lawrence: a successful music video director. <br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles, the plot focuses on the rebel occultist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a man not wanted by heaven but instead desired by hell. <br/><br/>He was born with a gift  whereby he can see the things that others cannot. He can recognise the half-breed angels and demons that patrol Earth in human form.<br/><br/>John is a tortured soul, having taken his own life twice to escape the torrent of evil he witnesses on a daily basis. He lives in a hybrid state between the living and the dead, trying to earn his way to salvation by hunting down the demons that live amongst us. <br/><br/>When he meets police officer, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) his life begins to have more meaning. She asks him to investigate the mysterious suicide of her twin sister and together they enter a journey through the world of demons and angels existing beneath the landscape of Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Will they find the answer to a string of devastating events and find the peace that Constantine so desperately needs?<br/><br/>This Hollywood blockbuster is a disturbing film with a complicated storyline about good versus evil. The movie seemed to echo other classic films, such as The Exorcist and The Matrix and struggles to find an independent voice of its own. <br/><br/>Although the film did boast of a high profile cast with strong performances from Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz (About a Boy and The Mummy Returns) in their convincing roles of John and Angela. My favourite actors were Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and I,Robot) for his role of Chas; his impressive, laid back acting style was remarkable for his age and Peter Stormare's terrifying role of Satan. <br/><br/>So all in all be prepared for a frightening fantasy about demons with stomach churning moments that may even put you off your popcorn. Just remember not to have nightmares!"

"rickmeister","7","0","6","3 March 2005"," Dark Vision of Heaven versus Hell doesn't quite measure up ...
","When i say 'doesn't quite measure up' I'd better explain.<br/><br/>If your idea of the dark side is the kind of world we are given with the Gothic Hollywood brush of 'Underworld' - or perhaps the more urban street-samurai style of 'Blade' - then you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Reeves does a surprisingly good job of the quintessential wise-cracking anti-hero positioned between the forces of Heaven & Hell - and yes the SFX are pretty spectacular. The vision of Hell is particularly well done and a climactic end-scene with 'time-slice' photography and plenty of smashed-flying glass will keep even 'Matrix' fans happy.<br/><br/>So why doesn't it measure up? Well if your dark vision of hell isn't quite so glossy & SFX based as all the above, then you may not be quite so impressed.<br/><br/>In fact one of the problems lies perhaps in disassociating Reeves from his 'Matrix' character - add the sunglasses and he's pretty much there! And also a touch too 'Dirty Harry' or 'Snake Plisken' at times.<br/><br/>And what is the obsession with the current crop of sci-fi/horror genre with faux-techno weapons? Both 'Blade' & 'Underworld' had their 'vampire-vaporising' guns...now we have 'Demon-destructing' crucifix-shotguns.<br/><br/>But i'm afraid my main gripe is that I was a fan of the comics (oh oh comic geek) Whereas I could just about deal with the fact that the chain-smoking, hard-living, British occultist - with the signature ash blonde hair and pale trench-coat - was now a dark-haired American with an almost Armani sharpness to his image; I couldn't deal with the lack of bitter sarcasm and the fact that you were never sure in the comic books whether John Constantine would save the world or watch it burn to make a point. Reeves is made out to be too much the hero and not enough anti-hero; seemingly this version of the Constantine character wants redemption from heaven!<br/><br/>All this aside there were some highlights - Tilda Swinton as the androgynous Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as the enigmatic Papa Midnight and last but by no means least Peter Stormare as Lucifer. Now that was some great casting - the denouément between Constantine and Lucifer is probably the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Most of the male audience will probably enjoy Rachel Weisz's performance; she's an attractive lady and brings a real sympathy to her performance (as well as being in a wet T- shirt for the latter half of the movie!) But acting and screen-presence aside I found her character a little flat. And the less said the better concerning Shia Le Boeuf's interpretation of Chas, the East End Cab driver from the comic books, into some kind of plucky side-kick.<br/><br/>In summary i felt like I did with 'Judge Dredd' - to quote another film dramatisation of a comic-book classic. Hollywood has done a decent job of shoe-horning about 3 or 4 great story lines from the comic book into one average action-packed script, made the 'world' convincing enough to uphold said storyline, added an implausible but nonetheless impressive weapon and some other paraphernalia, and updated the image to make it more palatable to a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>But that misses the point with John Constantine - he should be unpalatable!"

","After watching ""The Devil's Advocate"", starring Reeves and Al Pacino, Constantine's trailer somehow reminded me that masterpiece, as for atmospheres and special effects. Well, I must say that my expectations have been dashed; I knew the flick was based on the comic-book ""Hellblazer"", but hoped it was more movie and more able to capture my imagination, whereas it kept too much its original nature. Action sequences and rhythm are not bad at all but on the whole the movie fails to capture the moviegoers emotions, as far as I can see.

"cultfilmfan","4","0","4","2 March 2005"," Constantine
","Constantine, is based on the comic book Hellblazer by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis. The film is about a man named John Constantine, who has been to Hell and back and can see demons running along the streets in the city. After his visions start to get to him John tries to commit suicide and dies for a few minutes but is reborn again. Finding out that it is a sin John, tries to rid the world of demons so he can earn his way into Heaven, because the doctors tell him that he will be dying soon due to his chain smoking. Meanwhile a detective named Angela Dodson, is investigating the strange death of her twin sister and goes to see John, because she thinks the death may have to do with the occult. Soon, John shows her his world of angels and demons and soon they have to fight humanity from evil. Constantine, has some need visual effects but that is about it. One of the big problems with this movie is that it is trying to cram so many plot ideas and situations into one movie and it just does not work and after awhile becomes muddled and confusing. The film is only two hours but it feels like forever. The film really started to drain me and for the last hour or so I kept yawning because of how bored I was and I just didn't care what was going to happen in this movie. Also near the end the film got so silly that it became laughably bad with some of the situations and dialogue. I've never read the comic book that Constantine, was based on but in my opinion it should have stayed a comic book and not a movie because we got some really good talent here that has been wasted."

"keiros","3","0","7","2 March 2005"," Only if you haven't read the comics...
","I have issues. All those issues stem from the fact that I'm a fan of the comic, and as such, I had a reasonable amount of expectations. Character-wise, story-wise, setting-wise... <br/><br/>But I'll get to those shortly. <br/><br/>Instead, I'll rate the film on its stand alone value. <br/><br/>Canoe, as always, does his standard walking coma patient. Attitude is not his forte. Gritty is not his forte. Stunned mullet is. Line delivery of the woeful script is deadpan. No emotion attached. It almost seems like a cut and paste effort on behalf of the writer (the line, ""Pulling demons out of little girls"" pops up three times). No hint of imperatives that drive the 'characters' along. And I use the word characters loosely, because there is no actual development in the movie of the support cast. They are relegated to scenery or at most, plot devices. Constantine's 'scooby gang' consists of a sidekick taxi driver named Chas, a psychic priest, and a peddler of artifacts and trinkets. I can only remember the taxi drivers name because it gets said nearly as much as the title characters. And the end result is that when any of these support pieces meet their end, we just don't give a damn. <br/><br/>The story stops and starts, like a drunk with a violent stomach disorder. At one stage a bug demon turns up, for no apparent reason, 'bugs' Canoe, then goes splat on the windshield of a passing car. The special effects were passable, but of course we can expect cgi to be at least passable unless done on a Commodore64. <br/><br/>Stylistically (I think I just made that up) the film looks alright. Very much old school film noir. Lighting making the most of clichéd sets. My mum always used to say, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it."" If that was the case, this would be my only comment on the film. <br/><br/>People not familiar with the material will be confused about some of the interactions between protagonists, but should enjoy the film anyway. A monologue during the film, done like Ridley Scott's Bladerunner, would have smoothed over these bumps as well as added an extra dimension to the title character. Who knows? But people who are familiar with the source material, will be left scratching their heads saying, ""How the hell did they screw that up so bad...?"" The answer is in the differences between the two mediums. <br/><br/>This film is set in LA. Bright lights, big city. The comic is set primarily in England, with all its traditions and history. LA literally spits on tradition and history. <br/><br/>The title character, raven black hair and dark eyes, Malibu accent, Constantine, has power. He knows the way things work and uses the rules to get the job- usually an exorcism- done. He has toys too. A flame thrower of 'Dragon Breath' and a Holy Shotgun, both only included to sell whatever dodgy film tie in Playstation or X-box game they excrete. He also has the special gift/curse to see dead people. At some point in his history, it drives him insane and he attempts suicide. <br/><br/>In complete contrast is our comic version. Blond hair blue eyes, cockney accent, doesn't have real power. He knows a couple of tricks, can-trips really, and cant see dead people. But he gets by on bluff and bluster, using his wits instead of weapons to get the job done. He has knowledge of the way the supernatural world works, but aside from that, he's an ordinary man getting by in an extraordinary world. <br/><br/>The writer(Kevin Brodbin)at least referenced the comics for his screenplay, most notably the story arc, Dangerous Habits as a back story. Constantine giving the Devil 'the finger', was about as close to the character that Canoe was ever going to get, and was the films only redeeming feature. Really though, Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis should have been the ones to write any film adaption of their own work. <br/><br/>This film rates an eight out of ten. (On the disappointment scale)"

","At times dark and brooding, at times edgy and fun, and at times drab and floundering, ""Constantine"" is a decent outing, yet doesn't quite live up to its rollicking and intriguing premise. Keanu Reeves breezes through his role as an energetic, yet ailing, supernatural detective, who has ventured to the depths of hell (and even plunges into hell in consciousness) and decides to abet a confused, agnostic fellow detective (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) in her sister's mysterious suicide. By the numbers action ensues, with the eerie visual effects confounding and the drab, cloyingly ponderous dialog compromising an otherwise arresting and exhilarating piece of entertainment. Instead, what with Reeves' typical wooden acting and some bedraggled, destitute dialog (""Welcome to my life""; ""Not like in the movies, huh?""), ""Constantine"" is scarcely engaging, or much convincing, in the absence of its outstanding visuals, often coming across as a tedious visit to the ""dark side"" whose menacing premise can hardly be complimented by factors gone awry. Is it faithful to the comic book of its inspiration? I wouldn't know. Does this sound uncannily familiar: brazen, glum ""hero"" repels invisible evil threatening war upon mankind? Hint: ""Whoa..."" It's seldomly inventive, and the surprise twist is as befuddling and ""so what"" as Reeves' signature dismal performance. Hey, if you're into ""Keanu condemnation"", supernatural drivel, or fascinated by a lavishing Rachel Weisz, then you might thoroughly enjoy ""Constantine"" for what it's worth. For me, it's a bit ponderous and grim to be action dynamite, another squandered premise with hackneyed and lifeless execution. Nothing more than a bang-bang, snooze-snooze action/horror rehash, akin to a lame version of ""The Matrix"" meets ""The Terminator"" meets ""The Punisher"". **1/2 out of ****"

Now, despite being a comics collector, Hellblazer is one comic I've never read. However, I did know the premise, so I was kind of standing with one leg in each camp.<br/><br/>I went to see it with eight other people. Half of them thought it was really cool, the other half thought it was pretty boring. The latter half, which included me, were the ones more thoroughly grounded in both comics and movies. Constantine offered nothing new or surprising for me, and I thought far more could have been done with the concept. The story was predictable; I knew where it was going and it just kept on going there. The effects did not impress me.<br/><br/>Although, there was one thing (well, two) I did like. Tilda Swinton as the arch-angel Gabriel was absolute androgynous perfection, and worth watching the movie for. Just about the only part of the story I liked was Gabriel's reason for unleashing Mammon: To make people worthy of God's love. As if we have it far too easy, just being allowed to have our sins forgiven if we repent. I liked that. Secondly, Peter Stormare as Lucifer was also an excellent choice for the part. But other than these, I thought Constantine was a lack-luster, typical, pedestrian Hollywood project with no real bite whatsoever.

Luckily the movie is saved by Satan and the Archangel Gabriel. Peter Stormare is wonderfully insane as Lucifer, perhaps the best cinema interpretation of the devil I've ever seen (in a really nice suit).

Lucifer was creepy enough yet dandy in his attire which fit the mold. The cop chick never smiles. The priest was OUT there, but for once one of the good guys."
"Craig-9","6","0","17","24 February 2005"," Not bad, but why completely re-write the back-story?
","Constantine wasn't a horrible movie, though it does blatantly rip-off the series of Prophecy movies with Christopher Walken (as others have noted here). What I don't understand is the complete trashing of the comic character's back-story. John Constantine is British, for crying out loud! Obviously, some bright studio exec got ahold of this and said ""Couldn't we write this as a vehicle for Keanu Reeves?"" and true to all the Hollywood clichés, the end result bears only a tiny resemblance to its source. The John Constantine from the Hellblazer comics would make for a much more interesting movie character than Keanu's occult detective/fix-it-man. The real John Constantine is much more of a bastard, perhaps the most selfish character to ever carry a series. And he's pretty much an expert on all things arcane--wouldn't need a weapons man holed up in the pin-setting works of a bowling alley to act as a low-rent Q. All this aside, I didn't completely hate the movie, but it certainly wasn't the revelatory breakthrough that some critics have branded it. There are some undeniably impressive visuals, but the story is weak and confusing and, ultimately, not very original (rent The Prophecy to see what I mean)."

","I guess I've just had the wrong expectations. Not knowing it's a comic adaption I expected a horror movie like the exorcist (which is fantastic, by the way) Actually ""Constantine"" is absolutely not scary, but I liked it nevertheless. The story is really great, especially if you like paranormal films like ""stigmata"" ecc. Another thing that makes this movie worth seeing is the soundtrack. It really adds a lot to the very dark mood of the film. You don't have to be a comic lover to follow the story and get what the movie is all about. Keanu Reeves (John Constantine) tried to do a great job but after doing the Matrix trilogy he'll be Neo forever. The other actors (i must confess the only one I knew was Keanu Reeves) are not that bad, but their acting is definitely not worth the Academy Award. To finish my comment: Constantine is a movie you like because of its nice and easy story, the great soundtrack and its special effects. It's not a film you really got to spend money on, but it's better watching ""Constantine"" than some f****** teen comedy."

Big screen adaptation of cult DC/Vertigo comics/graphic novel ""Hellblazer"" is a hodgepodge of incoherency with Reeves as world-weary and cancer riddled cigarette chain smokin' John Constantine, an LA based detective of the supernatural who must face his demons (metaphorical and paraphysical to boot) in order to attempt buying his way into heaven by eradicating the world of all its evils while assisting an LA police detective (Weisz) investigating her identical twin's apparent suicide that appears to be linked to The Spear of Destiny  got all that?! The visual effects are a mix of god awful and awesome which may be the best way to describe the carnage dichotomy to Reeves' brooding, implosive turn that is the glue barely holding the film's elements all together no thanks to the screwy screenplay by Kevin Brodbin and Frank A.

","More Proof That a Committee Can’t Write an Action Movie.<br/><br/>“Constantine” wouldn’t have been as bad as it was—Oh, and it was VERY bad—if it could only have been made by one person. As it was, it was just another demonstration of the wickedness of ‘art-by-committee’—another instance of a budget in search of a script. It might well have been dazzling if one person could have made the movie as a matter of personal vision—as an honest interpretation of the comic book on which it is based—but as it was, it had to do more things than any movie should be expected to and still be put in front of a poor, suffering audience.<br/><br/>Constantine’s second big problem is writing: it comes close to, but never really reaches the quality of writing that made people read the Constantine comic books. Despite its emphasis on action, its plotting is nerve-janglingly tedious in places; leading to a movie with a target audience divided between two main groups: comics fans who will pay to see anything that had ever appeared in sequential art, and people so stupid you wonder how it is they don’t need life support. In the long run, neither of them will be fully happy with this movie.<br/><br/>The first of “Constantine’s” burdens is its never-to-be-understood, need to give Keanu Reeves a job: this does bad things to the movie on many levels.<br/><br/>For people who wanted to see the comic book character, John Constantine, convincingly brought to the screen, Reeves is a disappointment. In the comics, Constantine is a blond Englishman from (at best) the lower-middle classes with all that you come to expect from that in terms of accent, slang and devastating sarcasm. Reeves’s Constantine by contrast has none of the original character’s, well, *characteristics* and isn’t enough of an actor to recreate them. This leaves Reeves straight-jacketed into playing the ‘for dummies’ version of a film-noir detective. <br/><br/>For Reeves, this means a flat and angry affect while spitting out one-liners about the nature of Christian theology with its view of God and the Devil (one really good line describing God as a guy with an ant-farm), which are the real point of the Constantine books—unfortunately if you have ever read them, coming from Reeves’s mouth, they serve only to remind you what the movie lacks. It is truly hard to do justice to how really bad Reeves is and what that does to the movie until you’ve seen it and, mulling it over an hour afterward, you suddenly realize that everyone down to the bit-players—pretty much everyone with a speaking role—acts circles around him.<br/><br/>Warning: spoilers below!<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz, a British actress talented enough to portray Americans in several previous movies is entrusted with wordless reaction shots that a director would hang himself before giving to Reeves.<br/><br/>The occult bar owner, Midnight, portrayed by, Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, the Four Feathers et al), puts an intense and nuanced performance into his five minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Even Peter Stormare, who makes a brief appearance as Satan, infuses his performance with intimations of things going on beneath the surface, overlaying a human face on a contained embodiment of unimaginable evil.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton’s performance as the angel Gabriel (who desires to see mankind be worthy of divine love that it makes her attempt to destroy the creation) gives a wonderful performance as a gigantically smug, self-satisfied, higher being.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, “Constantine” is a movie and it is worth seeing, but not for ten dollars in a theater. It’s worth the cost of a video rental if you live in a small town, can walk to the shop, and get it back in time to avoid the late fee, but that is exactly what it is worth and nothing more than that.<br/><br/>Constantine is made to please a bunch of non-people; theaters filled with Frankenstein-like statistical abstractions. Written to please comics geeks whom the studios and critics hold in contempt while attracting equally faceless action movie-goers, Constantine is a document incapable of keeping faith. It isn’t true to writing, it isn’t true to the idea that we are individuals with individual tastes, nor is it, as the scene where the ultimate nihilistic cynic’s giving up smoking demonstrates, true even to itself. <br/><br/>It isn’t entertainment, its information."
"FilmOtaku","5","0","15","21 February 2005"," Not great, but entertaining
","John Constantine (Reeves) is a thirty-something detective who hunts a certain type of criminal; they are demons from hell that are now on earth. As a teenager, Constantine tried to kill himself, was declared dead for two minutes, but was brought back to life by some pretty good doctors. Since it was an attempted suicide, he is technically destined for hell right out of box, so he has dedicated his life to trying to get back in the good graces of god by hunting down demons and saving lives. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite cut it because Gabriel (Swinton) is not very impressed. Meanwhile, Angela Dodson (Weisz), a police detective (of the ""normal"" variety) learns her mentally disturbed twin sister has just committed suicide, and when it is suspected that she was under the influence of a demon, Constantine gets involved to help Angela solve the mystery of her sister's death and to possibly get her out of hell.<br/><br/>The plot to ""Constantine"" is actually kind of complicated, so hopefully I managed to encapsulate the plot enough to give a hint as to what is going on with the film. Frankly, I wasn't very impressed with the story, but I pretty much enjoyed the characterizations and the visuals. Constantine is a great, complicated character; it is really easy to tell that the film is derived from a comic. His constant search for redemption based on a mistake he made years prior lays a great foundation for a tragic character. Throw in the fact that he has cool metrosexual hair, the always hip white shirt and black suit combo, is an unabashed chain smoker and has such wonderful toys only adds to his appeal as a good character. Reeves actually did a pretty good job in this role; I was really expecting a ""Neo II"" based on what I was seeing in the trailers, but he managed to distinguish this role well. Weisz's Angela was not bad as far as heroines go, but some of her acting bits were kind of funny, particularly after she ""crossed over"" in the tub. I really liked the character of Gabriel  Swinton has always been able to play androgynous well, and she brings a lot of class and intrigue to the role. The mirth that she obviously feels when she is dealing with Constantine is obvious, and enjoyable to watch. Though their scenes together are short, they definitely had a decent chemistry. There were other small roles (Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's apprentice/whipping boy, Chas, Djimon Hounsou as Midnite, an intermediary between heaven and hell, and Peter Stormare as a very memorable Satan) that made up a pretty interesting cast.<br/><br/>The only other Marc Forster film I've seen is ""Monsters Ball"", and though I was less than impressed by it, I was interested to see what he would do with a film that is of a completely different genre. Stylistically, ""Constantine"" was pretty cool. There was nothing very futuristic involved, but his shots of Los Angeles - both the shiny skyscraper areas and the back street underground-type areas  were pretty stunning. The film itself was actually pretty religious, (and sacrilegious depending on who you talk to) but there was never a time when I felt this theme was becoming overbearing or obnoxious. Unfortunately the film was rife with pacing issues (there was one time when my boyfriend asked me if I was sleeping. I wasn't, but I sure could have been) which really dragged the film down, and frankly I felt some of the intricacies of the story a little complicated for what was, technically, an action film. There is also a moment when Constantine flips off someone (I'm not going to spoil it here) but instead of laughing, which I think was the intended reaction, I wanted to get a big IL' foam finger and flip off the film for stooping to such lameness.<br/><br/>When you mix the good with the bad, you get so-so, and that's how I felt about ""Constantine"". Actually, time for rumination has probably raised my opinion on it because I was pretty disappointed when I first left the theater on Friday. But upon further reflection, I do think that it is a pretty decent comic book movie, and that overall it was less, rather than more painful than it probably could have been. If I could rate films with a half scale, I would give this one a 5.5/10, but since only whole numbers are allowed, I'm going to give it a 5. If the film continues to do well, watch for a sequel, it's inevitable.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

"shakawtwf","3","0","15","20 February 2005"," Interesting beginning but horrible ending(s)
","I have little tolerance for movies that begin well and end poorly. (I have far greater tolerance for movies that start shakily and end well.) ""Constantine"" was one of those movies that made me feel that it didn't know what it wanted to be about. Or it had too many ideas and didn't feel confident to run with any of them so it tried to use them all.<br/><br/>We have Constantine who is an exorcist dying of lung cancer. Okay, that's a little different. We have Rachel Weisz whose twin sister dies suspiciously. Okay. We have the two of them meeting ostensibly to find out what happened to the sister. Fine. These are the salient points of the movie as I see them however at the end of the movie, we seem to have false ending after false ending involving the son of the devil and Gabriel and going to Hell and we have the Mexican gentleman carrying that Sword around. Maybe I wasn't paying attention but who were all of those people in the mental institution that Keanu killed? Apparently they were demons but I didn't see an explanation for their presence. They were just there and then they were killed.<br/><br/>The one gaping flaw in the logic of this movie is that Constantine considers himself damned without chance of salvation because as a teenager he attempted suicide. The thing of it is is that he didn't succeed which gives him the opportunity to ask for forgiveness. Gabriel tells him at the beginning of the movie that his situation is hopeless (although he/she uses a different phrase). If Constantine wants to be saved, he simply has to ask for forgiveness. Period.<br/><br/>This renders all of his actions in the movie unnecessary (if they are, in fact, being done in order to save him)."

And when cattle eat, cattle ... well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the odor emanating from ""Constantine"" evidences a diet of rotten theology. Turncoat angels, attempted suicide as an unforgivable sin, post-death salvation -- the screenwriters must have had a volume discount at Heresies ""R"" Us.<br/><br/>Although the idea of the Bible having extra chapters in Hell (would that be the King Flames Version?) does elicit a chuckle, it's definitely of the ""at, not with"" sort. Max Baker's Beeman -- a sort of religio-occultic Q dispensing demon-fighting gadgets to Keanu Reeves' metaphysical 007 -- is also good for an I-can't-believe-this eye roll.<br/><br/>That's not the only scavenged plot element.<br/><br/>Mysterious Artifact?

Points which would seem critical get a line or two of dialogue -- and there's nary a hint of foreshadowing as to why one of the ""good 'uns"" might switch sides.

","I'm not familiar with the Hellblazer comic series upon which this film is adapted. I'm reviewing this flick strictly on its own merits. I trust that most moviegoers who peruse this kind of reviews are merely interested in opinions about the quality and entertainment value of the opus, not whether or not the art bears total allegiance to the original material. So, is this movie good or bad ? Well, this flick is not the ne plus ultra of cinematic excellence, yet it is worth watching. Sorry for the ambivalent repartee, but the truth of the matter is that Constantine is neither a very good flick, nor is it a bad one. What works here is that you have a somewhat different genre in the realm of horror motion pictures. The plot is interesting, and relatively complex. You must bring your full armada of cerebral endowment to the movies with you, because if you don't understand the Kafkaesque sub-plot sequences, you will not enjoy this film. I watched the flick with a lady friend who at the end revealed to me that she didn't like it. When I asked her if she understood what was going on in the climax involving Constantine, Lucifer, the angel Gabriel, Satan's offspring, and Rachel Weisz' character, she responded that she was completely oblivious as to what was transpiring on the screen at that moment. Well, no wonder she didn't like this movie, because if you don't comprehend the climatic scene of a film, how can you like it ? If you don't understand the plot, you can still achieve a modicum of satisfaction with fiendishly impressive montages of Hell, and a pretty slick exorcism scene that dramatically improves on Linda Blair's The Exorcist "". The acting here by the main characters is good, but as with any Keanu Reeves' movie, it is overwhelmed by the paragonless special effect work which makes this flick worth watching."
