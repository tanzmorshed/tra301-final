"Jonathon_Natsis","8","60","62","25 July 2011"," How Kelso lost his mind.
","Every so often we all seem to move away from the usual nothings we talk about amongst our friends, and instead get into a deeply philosophical conversation about the workings of Chaos Theory and the existence of parallel universes. No? Okay, just me then. In any case, this discussion just the other day led to a friend recommending The Butterfly Effect, a film that puts both a stylistic and sinister spin on the idea that even the mere flapping of a butterfly's wings can result in drastic changes in another place or time. Being initially sceptical because of the generally negative reaction from critics, I was certainly not disappointed by film's end.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher couldn't be more different that his concurrent role as the dimwitted Kelso from That '70s Show in his lead performance as Evan Treborn, a man who has suffered blackouts since his childhood, and realises that he can access and relive vital gaps in his memory through the help of other sources like journals or images. He uses this skill to, in his eyes, right the wrongs of the past. Namely, injustices that were performed upon his friends Lenny and Tommy and only love Kayleigh (Amy Smart). What he doesn't realise is that the changes he thinks are made for the better actually result in a severely changed future that threatens his own life.<br/><br/>Without trying to sound like a sadist, The Butterfly Effect excels in presenting a consistently dark, melancholy atmosphere. Indeed, there is hardly a happy moment in the entire film, although that may be untrue depending on which ending you watch (more on that later). Any event that looks as if it might provide a slim ray of hope for Evan to make things right is quickly dashed by a sudden escalation of the plot, maintaining the viewer's interest the whole way through. The film doesn't shy away from heavy subject matter either, including prostitution, murder, paedophilia and drug use, all of which culminates in an enjoyably gritty, underground tone.<br/><br/>Positively, the menacing nature of the movie isn't weighed down by comic relief. I suppose when many of us think of this sort of plot, we first think of the Simpsons Halloween special when Homer invents the time-travelling toaster. Not knowing quite how dark the film would turn out to be, I was concerned The Butterfly Effect would go down a similar path, in which Evan keeps returning to the present to find that all humans have grown wings or Pauly D has become President. Instead, any changes are limited to the persona of the characters, rather than altering the physical environment, which was definitely the professional path to take.<br/><br/>The pacing is another strength. For a film that comes in well under two hours, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber deserve credit for packing a lot in, and doing it well. Certainly, some thrillers benefit from slow-moving scenes to draw suspense (the superb Eyes Wide Shut, for example) but Butterfly manages to combine compounding urgency with engaging character development in constructing a fast-moving film that requires both thought and stamina to decipher, without being needlessly confusing.<br/><br/>Oddly, the film possesses four different final scenes, and so the lasting message of the movie may differ depending on the copy viewed. My favourite ending is the 'official' one applied to the theatrical release. It is satisfying, yet open-ended, as is the case with its alternate cut. Another is uncharacteristically upbeat and illogical, perhaps suggested in the editing room as a way of appeasing confused screen-test viewers. But if you really want to get down to brass tax, go with the Director's Cut: a far more morbid conclusion with a surreal twist. Intrigued? Don't let me stop you.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","I seldom come out and write movie reviews in IMDb but I felt this one deserved some effort from me. I don't recall any movie which made me shiver thinking about what was gonna come next when I hit pause to go for a pee or any other reason. This one is really something. There is a ""Lost Highway"" feel to it and the themes are closely related but...The Butterfly effect is in fact more complex.It is a really disturbing movie, not so much for what it shows, but for what it keeps you guessing - like all true thriller masterpieces - , about events that take or might take place, and above all, about human sanity and the subtle twist there is between the average Joe's walk of life and outright perversion. Requires multiple - rewarding - viewings."

","First of all, a fair warning to EVERYONE... this movie is NOT for all audiences. The ""R"" rating was very well earned in this one; you'll be thinking about how seriously twisted the movie dares to go LONG after you leave.<br/><br/>If you are mature enough to get past the fact that this movie introduces themes that most movies nowadays are too hesitant to venture into, this movie is a beautiful and moving piece of art.<br/><br/>I, like maybe most everyone that went to see it, went off of the trailer that it was just another ""going back in time to change the future"" movie, which has been done before.<br/><br/>This one is COMPLETELY different.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect starts actually in the early stages of each character's life, which I think is effective. You don't really see Ashton Kutcher or Amy Smart until about 30 minutes into the movie, and just when you think the movie won't get any more sick and twisted... you figure out what's ACTUALLY going on during Evan's childhood blackouts.<br/><br/>Every character is built from the ground up, and they maintain true to the plot, even if their roles get switched up a bit.<br/><br/>Some might say that special effects weren't really needed for this movie, but its the special effects that make this all believable.<br/><br/>Every actor in this movie pulls off their parts just right (I feel sorry for the kid that plays Tommy.. I won't throw a spoiler - see it!), and they all come together to make a masterpiece. I was surprised this movie got so many bad reviews.<br/><br/>If you throw the fact that time-travel isn't possible, and that there will always be obvious plot holes in a movie such as this one, and are ready for an emotional roller coaster (you'll either cry or grimace about twice the amount of times you crack a smile), go see this beautiful movie.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 9.0/10 <br/><br/>Overall score: 9.5/10"
"christian123","7","342","429","14 November 2004"," Surprisingly a great movie
","Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a troubled man who suffered blackouts as a child. When he discovers a way to travel back into the body of his past self, his time trips start to cause negative results on his present. As he uses his powers to try to fix his past and present, the effect escalates, creating alternate realities, many of which are worse than the past that he is trying to change.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is a terrific thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The previews looked very intense and the whole film is pretty much like that. It held onto the audience right at the start and it didn't let go until the end. The plot is nothing new but the execution was very nice. It offers a bunch of interesting and unpredictable twists so it's hard to see where things are going. The whole film is like that, just one long engaging thrill ride.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, some people did better than others. Ashton Kutcher is surprisingly good as Evan and he does a good job for his first serious movie. Amy Smart is very pretty and talented and she plays Kayleigh perfectly. The only person I didn't really like was Melora Walters. She was pretty wooden and unconvincing. Besides for her, the acting was pretty good and convincing. No one really did a bad job.<br/><br/>This film was directed and written by both Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. They did make their mistakes but the film is still pretty good. The critics never gave this movie a chance. As soon as they heard Ashton Kutcher was in it, they all prepared to give it thumbs down. The movie moves around a lot that its hard to keep up but it also keeps you paying attention. Plenty of movies have gone back in time before but this one does it so more effectively that its almost original in that sense. The beginning is done well, the middle it starts dragging but it starts picking up and the ending is done extremely well. This is one of the best films of 2004 and certainly an entertaining one. In the end, this underrated gem is worth checking out. Rating 8/10"
"saarvardi","10","171","214","28 July 2007"," What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence?
","What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?<br/><br/>A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher  but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.<br/><br/>What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.<br/><br/>Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor  a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers' talents. I'm eagerly waiting for other outings by these young folks."

","Man... Whew... Wow! I'm at a loss of words to describe this high octane, tantalizing, brain-stimulating movie. The acting: excellent. The plot: superb. The story: great. The drama/suspense: mind numbing.<br/><br/>How the writers were able to put this story together so flawlessly, I don't know, and how the director was able to actualize it, even more amazing. There was plenty of visual stimuli as well as mental stimuli as you waited to see the outcome of each alteration made by the main character, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher).<br/><br/>The movie kept me guessing and kept me at the edge of my seat, and the writers outdid themselves by making sure the movie didn't peter out with some lame ending. The ending was icing on the cake and it capped what should be a classic."
"doner_morferelli","Null","294","393","25 January 2004"," Haunting, Tragic, but ultimately Brilliant
","I have seen this movie just a few hours ago and i have to say that it is brilliantly conceived. Definately not a feel good film, but rather dark and tragic in every sense of the word. Yes the performances were above and beyond etc etc... and it helped, but the film itself is an emotionally provacative piece of work that had me feeling sad, morose and depressed. Nonetheless i think that this makes it a very powerful film to evoke such strong feelings while watching it. It is, for lack of a better term, very human. On a different note there were also many complexities to do with chaos theory inderlying the raw emotional turmoil that the characters endure such as time travel, alternate universes and such, but rather than rely on these interesting ideas and theories to carry the movie, it is instead simply used as a background setting for an incredible story. I loved it for what it is, but not something you see to be entertained. See this movie but don't take your family."
"daugaard4","10","438","595","4 January 2005"," See it more than once!
","The film has never been showed in Denmark, (where I come from) so the press has never reviewed it. It took me 2 times to get the point but when I realized every part of the film, I felt a huge rush! I'm sure when I see it the 3rd time it will be an even bigger experience to me. Every part of the film plays an important role to the main thread. Every details have a role! The film is like reading a poem from the 18th century, where every sentence means something. The director is a pure genius! Those who've criticized the film, should really see it again, because you'll then notice all the details which makes this film excellent! Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen!"

","OK it's a bit to late to write a comment about this movie but let me tell you about it. Don't by any means watch the theatrical version!!! The first time I watched the movie was when I rented the Director's cut version. I was fascinated, really stunned by this movie. It kept me wondering why I haven't heard of that movie before and the answer was that people didn't see the Director's cut but the Theatrical version instead. Oh yes there are no similarities between those versions. The theatrical version is a light version if you like, a version at the end of which you will say ""well OK nice movie"", but(!!!!) the Director's cut gives the real meaning of the movie. It changes the whole idea, it adds new scenes and omits others, it changes the whole movie with a new outstanding ending and the plot in general is more concrete!!! I won't say anymore so jump to the Director's cut at once and if by any chance the TV broadcasts the theatrical version just change the channel!!!"
"Mappyman","9","173","235","2 January 2005"," Change one thing. Change everything
","Evan has always suffered from something that causes him to ""blackout"" during times of extreme crisis. All through his childhood he would blank out right before something drastic happens and not remember anything that happened. Now in college, he reads through a journal he used to write as a kid to notice that all of a sudden these harmful memories are coming back to him. When he goes to ask his childhood sweetheart about it she doesn't want to talk about it. He finds out however, that he can actually tap into his past and change what happened in these events. Unfortunately, every time he changes the past, even in the slightest way the future is also effected. <br/><br/>All scores are out of a possible 10: <br/><br/>Story: 9 - VERY interesting story on psychology and how the mind sometimes blanks out events. Also playing on the theory of Butterfly Effect which is explained in the very beginning of the movie ""If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, the ripple effect could cause a tempest on the other""<br/><br/>Acting: 8 - The lead girl in this movie did a great job. Since she was the result of many of the alternate realities, she had to go though as a crack whore, a sorority princess, a broken waitress and other things. Kutcher seemed to do what he does best... playing a crazy college kid. He's not as comedic in this role, but adds his charm in for fun. This isn't a comedy but its got its moments. <br/><br/>Music: 8 - A few good scores. On the more peaceful moments it sounds real well. <br/><br/>Sound Mix: 8 - Freaking scary! There are parts that really jump out at you. Since one of the dramatic events in the main character's life was dynamite going off, the sounds of him blacking out goes off like the dynamite exploding. I'll admit, i even jumped a few times. <br/><br/>Camera-work / Lighting: 7 - It suited the scenes real well. In some of the fight scenes it gets pretty wavy for effect that does real well and makes it more intense. <br/><br/>Editing: 9 - This must have been one of the hardest things in this movie. Since it involves alternate realities as well as time, a lot of thought must have gone into making all world seem to make sense. Since changing the reality effects where the main character is when he wakes up in the present, all of his ""missed"" memories flood back into him. They did really well with keeping the continuity up to par. <br/><br/>Uniqueness: 8 - Its not horror. It is scary most of the time, but its also a romance for the most part since his largest goal is making his girlfriend happy while keeping everything else in the world tame. It doesn't go into the sci-fi time travel stuff either which is good since its more of a mental thing than flux capacitors and DeLoreans.<br/><br/>Worth: 8 - Worth seeing. Even if you aren't a fan of Punk'd or Dude Where's My.. you'll enjoy seeing Kutcher in this role. The story is very gripping and almost makes you review how things could have changed in your life had some different events altered it. <br/><br/>Overall Score (Not an average): 8 - Really good movie. The sound is powerful, there's a good romance about this which should be cute for the tearjerkers who want something new. The acting is really good for the most part and the shock of some of the scenes will definitely grab people. <br/><br/>Reviewer's Insight (Including bias): Time travel has always been an interest for me. BackToTheFuture, my favorite book ""Replay"" by Ken Grimwood and some others. This movie isn't ALL about time travel. Its what small events in life end up resulting to, whether it be the biggest event in your life or a small one. Changing reality isn't truly the answer to happiness. As they say in the movie, You Can't Play God. Time will catch up to you no matter what you do to change it. ""Change one thing. Change everything"" as the movie's caption says and it definitely shows in every alternate reality he tries to effect."
"zetes","9","134","182","6 July 2004"," The critics really dropped the ball and turned a cold shoulder on a fine film here
","(note: this is a review of the director's cut of the film, which has a completely different ending than the theatrical release)<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect was either ignored or ridiculed by most major critics. Most minor ones, too. In reality, while it has its flaws, and some rather big ones, too, it is one of the best films to be released so far in 2004. It is already being rediscovered by audiences, and I think it will find a home amongst the lovers of gimmick films such as Memento and Donnie Darko. I am a fan of all three of these films, and it's not because they're based on clever gimmicks. Plenty of films have clever gimmicks and completely fail. I like these three particular films because they're intelligent and have strong stories that move them beyond their central gimmicks. The Butterfly Effect is about a young man (Ashton Kutcher) who experienced severe blackouts during traumatic moments when he was a child. As an adult, he discovers that he can travel back to these forgotten events and change their outcome. Unfortunately, every time he changes things for what should be the better, some individual always gets the shaft. Besides himself, the major players in the story are his mother (Melora Walters), his girlfriend, Kayleigh, her brother, Tommy, and their friend, Lenny. The story is gripping. It's hard not to imagine situations in your own life that you'd want to change, so the appeal is universal. As Kutcher changes time and time again, he starts to lose grip of reality. His desperation grows deeper each time he changes the past. <br/><br/>The movie does lose its footing as it nears the finish. One can imagine how hard it must be to end a story like this. It looked as if they were going to go with the 'It's all just a dream' ending, which really p***ed me off. Then they cheated their gimmick a little, which, as annoying as that was, it wasn't as annoying as the previous option. Then came kind of an ugly ending which really angered me, and which upsets a lot of what happened in the film in the first place. After a bit of time thinking it over, though, it didn't seem quite as bad as it first did. There are still some major holes this way around, but it made sense thematically. <br/><br/>As for the technical feats, The Butterfly Effect is very well done. The writers/directors, Bress and Gruber, may not get everything right, but they have delivered an ambitious and thoughtful film. Better yet, they delivered it right to a multiplex audience who doubtless went in expecting escapism. What they'll get is something ten times more challenging than anything else they'll see this year. The look of it is good, it's well edited, and there's really good use of music and sound. <br/><br/>The final question has to be this: so, can Ashton Kutcher deliver a dramatic performance? The answer is yes, but not an unqualified yes. Truthfully, the protagonist of the story could have been improved. He's more of cypher than anything, and a lot of the emotional value comes from the side characters whose lives he effects. Kutcher isn't asked to do too much. Still, he holds his own in plenty of scenes. He was quite good, for instance, in the sequence where he goes to prison. I wonder if all the pans this film received came because it was a drama starring that goofball from Dude, Where's My Car? I think, in the long run, if Kutcher wants to become a dramatic actor, he could pull it off. He's a handsome guy with a lot of charm. 9/10."

","THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- THEATRICAL CUT (4 outta 5 stars)<br/><br/>THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- DIRECTOR'S CUT (3+ outta 5 stars)<br/><br/>Now normally I tend to prefer movies that let the writer/director tell the story that they want to without having to water it down for mass consumption. In this case I have to say that the ending they they were forced to re-shoot for the theatrical release of this movie is a much more emotional, resonant and appropriate ending than the bleak, cold and grotesque finale they had originally planned. On the US DVDs you get the choice of which version to see (foreign editions only have the less compelling director's version)... so North American viewers can make up their own mind about which ending they prefer. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut first... and then check out the director's cut... which would you prefer to think of as the ""real"" ending?<br/><br/>As for the movie itself... don't be put off by the idea of Ashton Kutcher in the lead role. He does quite a good job in a serious part quite different from his usual TV persona. He plays a college student who, having been plagued by mental blackouts all his life, devotes himself to the study of human memory. Eventually he finds that by re-reading old journal entries he can will himself back in time to experience the events he had blacked out... and even CHANGE THEM using the knowledge that his older self possesses. Unfortunately one small change in the past causes some HUGE ramifications in his present day world. Can't say too much more about the plot without giving away the many fun surprises. Believable performances and a basic seriousness give the film an urgency that is sometimes missing in modern fantasy films of this type."

There have been a lot worse performances on film in much better reviewed movies. I tell you, you will NOT be disappointed watching the Director's cut Alternate ending. It is a story of how one action causes a series of reactions...no matter the intentions, be careful what you wish for. This film's biggest mistake was promoting it in the horror genre. It is NOT! It is a nice dark fantasy film, nothing more, nothing less. There are 2 different endings, with 2 different meanings for me. I preferred the Alternate ending in lieu of the Theatrical ending.

Not just any old thriller, this one would keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to the finish. A weird title however, but the tag line explains all. Change one thing, change everything.

","With over 1000 reviews, chances are not many are going to read this, but I just have to say how much I love this film, which I just discovered about a month ago, and have now watched 7 times, once the theatrical version and six times, the directors version, which I greatly prefer, as it fits the overall script better and what was intended originally. I am 70, and hardly expected this or any new movie to make it to my top 10, especially since I am not a fan of fantasy or time travel movies generally, but ""The Butterfly Effect"" has become my 4th favorite of the nearly 3000 films I have viewed in my life. The movie has many disturbing scenes, but the pace is amazingly fast, the acting excellent for the most part, and the characters physical continuity from childhood through adolescence to adult was the best I have ever seen in a film with 3 separate periods. The plot has been so thoroughly reviewed, I won't waste time telling the details again. Suffice it to say, if you can handle the elements of child abuse and animal mistreatment, (not graphically depicted) and can ignore the critics and watch the film at least twice, I think you will appreciate what a great film this is. And I have recently watched the director's commentary and deleted scenes, which further illustrate what an ambitious film this is. It should have been a classic, and it shows how off-base the critic's fraternity can be. Roger Ebert was fairer to the film than most of the others among major critics, but I think they were determined to knock the film because they didn't like Ashton Kutcher, and the film came out in January, which predisposes most critics to expect a bomb. Do yourself a favor if interested, and rent this Infinifilm. If you like an intense and entertaining movie experience, you won't be disappointed, and you may be enthralled, as I was, and hope you will be."

","For a Start Aston Kutcher does a surprisingly good job in this role, easily his best film to date (although that alone is not really a good reason to watch this) <br/><br/>As with all movies that play with the notion of altering time, there are plot holes (and some of them are big - e.g. why are his journal entries always the same, regardless of what he has changed?) If you can get passed these plot holes, and view this film without trying to find them and just go with it, you'll find a massively enjoyable film. <br/><br/>As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film) <br/><br/>Definitely worth watching<br/><br/>Original Release 6/10 Directors cut 8/10"

","Director's cut: 8, Theatrical release: 6. Seriously, can you destroy a movie any worse than by putting a sappy ending on a serious movie? I mean, can you? No, you can't. So do yourself a service and avoid the pap that they fed the audiences in the theater because they are gutless worms and go with the actual story. I just thank god I saw the Director's Cut first. It sort of gives me the creeps to think how many movies I've seen that were lobotomized and left me feeling they were just ho hum.<br/><br/>That said, it is only a few minutes at the end that are different.

"sikobabel","6","23","34","7 July 2004"," Like swiss cheese - tasty but full of holes.
","I should state up front that this review is for the director's cut.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, this movie suffers from having a smart heart and a stupid brain.  Any movie like this requires the viewer to suspend disbelief.  In doing so the storytellers have the option to establish replacement rules to govern the universe they've created.  This movie sets up well, giving the main character (Evan) blackouts which it will fill in later.  However, once Evan ventures into his past to 'fill in' the empty spaces, the movie begins to contradict itself.  This would be excusable if it was a lighter, more amusing movie.  But this is far from light material.  It is extremely morbid.  The audience is bombarded with this darkness, which attempts to engage us, to give us something deeper.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take much digging before you get frustrated.<br/><br/>For me, there are two particularly frustrating aspects to this film:<br/><br/>First, the tagline of this movie is ""change one thing, change everything"". As such, I expected that when Evan goes back to change something, everything from that point forward will be different.  In other words, if Evan has ten blackouts, and goes back to visit the fifth one, then all the following blackouts would either vanish or be completely different.  Instead, the blackouts are always the same.  Evan jumps around to whatever blackout is convenient.  However, this betrays the movie's central concept.  This could have been fixed with a more careful storyline, where the blackouts were visited in reverse order.<br/><br/>The second frustrating aspect is the gross simplifications in Evan's revised histories.  When Evan goes back and changes over a decade of history, the effects of his change are summed up far too easily and conveniently, almost as if the other people are all in on some cruel joke being played on Evan. I understand that this is done to keep the pace moving, but again the central theme of ""change one thing, change everything"".  But even after multiple changes, a lot of the world stays pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Donnie Darko are inevitable.  Donnie Darko was a superior film in this regard because it did not make the mistake of laying down ground rules and then breaking them.  Instead, it hides the rules from the audience and leaves them up for discussion.  As a result, you have a much more interesting conversation piece.  The Butterfly Effect essentially outsmarts itself by trying too hard.<br/><br/>For some, my comments may seem like cynical over-thinking.  This movie has a lot of polish on it to make it look good, and if you want to keep your brain turned off, you may enjoy it considerably.  Some people may not like Ashton Kutcher and discredit the movie based on that, but honestly I thought his performance was far more convincing than the script itself.<br/><br/>Like I said before, this movie does have a smart heart.  It tries very very hard to bring something interesting to the table.  The setup and ending are good, but the path between is too dark for its own good and ultimately a mess of contradictions.  6 out of 10."

Going on it fall into the banality, always worse going to the end. It seems like they had this starting idea, but they were not able to evolve it for the rest of the movie, so it remain as an embryo. It become obvious and often pathetic. The only message escapes is the classic and obvious:""if you want to change the future it could be worse"". Another problem: actors! Incredibly not able to act, Kutcher (I don't know if famous in the States) is not ""strong"" enough to have such a responsibility, Amy Smart is beauty, but just that, Melora Walters is always crying, very far from the good interpretations with P.T.Andersson.

"jpschapira","9","21","33","24 September 2005"," The effect of ""The butterfly Effect""
","I should have written about this film the first time I watched it. Now it's been the third time and although I loved it as much as the first time, my head has added up lots of things and I can't say something straight. What I'll do, is try to summarize all my thoughts in some paragraphs. I'm just going to say one main thing, because there were bad reviews and lots of opinions; this is a great film. Other subject<br/><br/>You have these two guys who got together to do something. Yes, they knew it would be a script, but the relevant thing is that their union, I believe, departures from this concept: cheating all the stereotypes, avoiding common places and typical ideas; working hard to achieve the constant surprise of the spectator, because his logical expectation is always betrayed. You may criticize this film, but you can't deny that it is anything but predictable. There are some resolutions, things or parts I thought about many times, that are not totally perfect; but it happens with any film of any type, and we tend to forgive.<br/><br/>I tried hard (although it wasn't difficult) to find the reasons that could make this movie unlikable for some viewers. I resolved that mainly it is because it presents itself as an action piece, better yet, an ""entertaining even""; and these are usually underestimated works, with no further purpose than making someone spend a good time. If ""The Butterfly Effect"" was that, I spent an awesome time. The other reason is a name: Ashton Kutcher. Yes, how can a movie with this guy who played the most stupid roles be appreciated? And he produced it? Not good signs.<br/><br/>However, and for my pleasant surprise, this was and still is Kutcher's best performance to date. He composed something really interesting, like Amy Smart, who sows off here, and leaves not one doubt of how promising she is. Merit of the casting directors was the selection of the younger cast, occupied by very talented kids, like Logan ""Bobby"" Lerman, Jesse James, Irene Gorovaia, and specially John Patrick Amedori.<br/><br/>Those two guys I was talking about are called Eric Bress and J. Mackie Gruber, and they are not just writers, but also directors of this unappreciated beauty. What a way of telling a story and representing it visually! It is true that their feature is betraying, and has lots of twists (what could tire out our patience), but I believe for some motive they knew we would die to see what happened; that we would stick around. So they play with our thoughts, and keep us awake. When I was having little sleeping time last year, this was the one thing that woke me up. I didn't even want it to end, and when it did, I didn't want to get out of theater, I wanted to see more.<br/><br/>It is also true that their movie is very powerful; everything. The cinematography, the sceneries: a crafted work. While it is not common in this type of film, there is an emotional power beyond. The words the characters speak, the things they live...We feel for them, and at the ending, WowI mean: Wow! They inserted ""Stop crying your heart out"" and an ending so incredible that hit (or probably impacted) me the other day for the third time; but it felt just like the first."
"kylopod","6","35","60","28 October 2005"," Promises more than it delivers
","If we want to analyze where this movie fails, we can look no further than the title. It alludes to a popular metaphor in chaos theory, the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a storm on the other side of the world. It also draws heavily on Ray Bradbury's classic short story in which the entire history of mankind is affected by someone stepping on an insect.<br/><br/>Based on this background, you'd think this movie would be about how tiny, trivial events can have monumental, unpredictable consequences. I would have liked to see a film that truly addresses this possibility, since most time-travel movies ignore it. In ""Back to the Future,"" for example, I could never believe that Marty would ever be able to set the past straight after his initial interference. Just his setting foot in the 1950s ought to have threatened his existence. Why? It's quite simple. Even though his parents will get married to each other, how can he be sure they'll have the same kids? ""Back to the Future"" set the standard for the genre by narrowing the scope of possible changes when dealing with time paradoxes.<br/><br/>The main problem with ""The Butterfly Effect"" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. Take the scene where Kutcher tries to stop the exploding mailbox. The chain reaction of events that result from this act may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about it. He affects a crucial event in his life and the result is a straightforward, logical consequence, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent recurrent child abuse simply by threatening someone on a single occasion. That scene, in any case, is not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.<br/><br/>The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of ""Bedazzled.""<br/><br/>This is sort of entertaining, but I was hoping for more. I may have been influenced by the fact that shortly before seeing the film, I read ""Bid Time Return,"" the Richard Matheson novel on which the 1980 movie ""Somewhere in Time"" is based. This book, even more than the movie adaptation, strongly leads us to suspect that the time-traveling experience occurs only in the protagonist's mind. ""The Butterfly Effect"" has a similar ambiguity that it never truly addresses, perhaps because mainstream audiences would have found such an approach too disturbing.<br/><br/>You may notice that I have so far not talked about the acting, and I will resist the temptation to rag on Kutcher's performance more than others have done. He's not terribly engaging, but it's not all his fault (especially considering that his character is played by other actors for a good portion of the film). The real problem lies at the level of the script, which doesn't give Kutcher much to do. The film is so plot-driven it doesn't spend much time on its characters.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to."
"vertigo_14","4","43","76","3 April 2004"," It should've been called-how to be excruciatingly stereotypical.
","I was rather surprised with this movie, not expecting much from something with Ashton Kutcher in the lead. I just can't seem to him picture with him any kind of real acting ability. I just always see a Michael Kelso. But, Butterfly Effect changed my opinion a little.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is another one of those science fiction stories in which characters, distraught with their present reality, can change that reality by revising their past decisions, even slightly.<br/><br/>Evan (Kutcher), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (Stolz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become. And it isn't always pretty.<br/><br/>As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to ""redo"" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life. Now granted, the story is a cool idea, but the idea may've been pushed too far. Why are the possibilities for a second chance endless? Why can't there be some point, or at least some possbility of Evan not always being able to go back, or not being able to revise things?<br/><br/>The problem with this movie at first glance is that the complexity of the story creates problems with details. For instance, in one of the times that Evan goes back, he is able to make some of the friend's life nearly perfect. Say, Evan is able to start off this perfection by going back to age 7, then we would not expect the bad events that took place at age 11 to involve him, as his line of perfection would've already been set in place. Yet, the journal entries never change. And that's a problem with this movie. Evan's life may change, but his journal entries never seem to, not even after his age of revision.<br/><br/>The second problem with this movie is that it is so excruciatingly stereotypical. When Evan improves the present for he and Kallie, she is the sorority girl and he the frat boy. They live in a nice place, he drives a brand new luxury car. When things go well for Tommy, he is a sweater vest wearing campus crusader for Christ type. Evan's roommate, Thumper, is the by-the-book version of ""goth."" There is no character that simply seems to exist as just normal, and not the stereotypical version of perfection or being utterly dismal. In fact, this movie may best be titled, ""Equations for Being So Stereotypically White."" But then again, mainstream pop culture exists on lumping people into one generalized group or another.<br/><br/>As a sigh of relief at least, thank goodness this did not turn out to be another piece of obnoxious teen movie garbage."

So, all the people making fun of the flaws and loop holes in this movie must just appreciate the imagination and not the logic of this movie.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart, are really convincing in each character in the movie. This movie really shows how one small moment can change the whole life.

The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder,"" an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release. The ending that I saw really made this movie for me. <br/><br/>Very respectable even if not completely successful effort for Kutcher to do something different than Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), My Boss's Daughter (2003), and Just Married (2003)."
"LorNic","6","11","17","26 June 2005"," One Big Butterfly!!
","I found ""The Butterfly Effect"" to be a pretty good movie for the most part. I saw nothing wrong with the acting and had no preconceived notions about Ashton Kutchner to poison my view (have never seen the Dude, Where's My ... movies). He played Evan well given how one would react to these events if they were to occur to one in real life.<br/><br/>The storyline was good and the powers that be brought the events together well, for the most part. The movie kept me interested throughout, although the mysterious events (blackout moments of Evan's childhood that are not shown to the viewer), while well hinted at before and after the blacked-out portion, were not handled well. Let me elaborate. Evan's friends would not tell him what had actually happened during these periods (for one reason or another). This, I felt, was a downfall of the storytellers. While it supposedly produced the effect on the viewer in wanting to know what happened, it left in me a feeling of unbelievability in the plot (somewhat).<br/><br/>As to what the Butterfly Effect is and Chaos Theory in general, note the following quote: ""The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen. Or maybe one that wasn't going to happen, does. (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, pg. 141)"".<br/><br/>Chaos Theory can be explained using the Butterfly Effect but it's relation to the movie is in name only. I say this because the wing flaps (childhood events in the movie) are HUGE events in anybody's childhood. Changing these events would, of course, have a huge impact on any child's later life. So, this butterfly is one whopping big one.<br/><br/>The movie has some inexplicable events and doesn't tie everything up neatly for us, the viewer. This is a good thing in that it leaves them open for discussion as to what there meaning is. This is bad in that the lesser-thinking viewers may be left scratching their heads and disliking the movie because of it.<br/><br/>It all relates to the idea of time-travel and what happens in the original time-line. Will it, in fact, be affected by the subsequent time travel events? I don't want to get into the specific details as it would give spoilers. I can only say that these are the things that one is left pondering."

In the movie this is represented by a gimpy bloke making a series of rather large changes to his past, each time leaving him in the same university with the same people (who randomly switch between a grab bag of zero-dimensional stereotypes): ""Oh,look, now she's a crack-whore."" ""Ha, now he's a cripple!""<br/><br/>Thus, actors who struggle to convince in just one role are impossibly tasked with playing many.<br/><br/>If brutalising general logical consistency and weren't enough, the film manages to include just about everything you'd expect to find in a crap short story by a 14 year-old Evanescence fan.

","I watched this film on Sky Movies a while ago, was intrigued by it because of comparisons with ""Eternal Sunshine..."" and David Lynch, but ultimately expected to be disappointed due to the appearance of smug celebrity twot, Ashton Kutcher.<br/><br/>Obviously with a film like this you're meant to leave all logic at the door, because there's no way someone could alter their present by using their brain as a time machine. I found every ""flashback"" scene to be more hilarious than the last, particularly when he stops his future girlfriend from being sexually abused by her father. There's nothing believable about it and each character is incredibly one dimensional. Kutcher as the confused but ""sensitive"" main character; Melora Walters as his constantly upset mother; Elden Henson as the consistently angry model plane enthusiast, Lenny and William Lee Scott as the overprotective criminal older brother. Amy Smart is so transparent I don't even remember any of her performance.<br/><br/>The filmmakers clearly intend for ""The Butterfly Effect"" to be taken as heart breaking drama, which most of it's cretinous audience praise it as being, but to the intelligent viewer it's more of a riotus comedy.<br/><br/>It sort of jumps the shark though when Kutcher awakes from his ""time travelling"" to find his usually angry best friend is now cured and staying in the same college dorm as him. Kutcher is about to go back to sleep, when he notices that he has no arms and is now a hugely deformed cripple, that everyone seems to enjoy poking fun at. His best friend Lenny - the one who is no longer angry and enthused about model planes - is now dating Amy Smarts character. This depresses Kutcher's character. When being wheeled around the college campus the ""jocks"" and ""nerds"" continue to mock Kutcher's armless state, which depresses him even further. So, he decides to end it all and attempts to drown himself in the bath - cue the gratuitous 'turning on the water with my stump' shot. But of course, the disabled are useless so Kutcher's character even fails at suicide. ""I can't even kill myself!"" he yelps as Amy Smart clutches his wavering stumps.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good drama, avoid this film like the plague but if you're looking to be cheered up one solemn winter night then look no further than ""The Butterfly Effect"".

"fedor8","Null","38","79","10 January 2007"," The unintentional hilarity saves this junk from the lowest rating.
","First of all, I haven't laughed during a ""thriller"", much less a ""sci-fi thriller"", this much in years. They should have called the film ""Those Damn Vibrating Letters"". Or perhaps ""Comedy Of Errors"", because whichever new reality Ashton creates - it turns into a complete disaster, either for him, for someone else, or for everybody in his life. I can see Laurel & Hardy in Ashton's role, screwing up one time after another  in a zany slapstick comedy. But Ashton in this role, and in a THRILLER?! I think not.<br/><br/>This film is a cross between the very good ""Sliding Doors"", in which alternate destinies are explored, and ""12 Monkeys"", which plays with time-travel. Just having one of these two premises is complex enough to handle for such lousy writers as the two who wrote ""Butterfly Effect"", but to have BOTH these ideas meshed into one script  that is truly far too ambitious for writers of this caliber. ""Sliding Doors"" handles its theme with intelligence and control  unlike ""BE"" which is frantic, and manic, and so overly dramatic that it quickly becomes funny instead of suspenseful. ""12 Monkeys"", which was a solid movie, stumbled on logic because time-travel plots rarely work because of the inherent traps they entail due to the (scientific) complexity of the idea..<br/><br/>The way the destinies of the four central characters changes with every one of Ashton's ""experiments"" often makes no sense. For example, we are lead to believe that Tommy would be a raving lunatic/psychopath in the first 2-3 realities, while a totally religious do-gooder in another! The writers actually want to make us believe that the way Stoltz brings up his son will make THAT much of a difference! Excuse me, but psychopaths are born, not created  and Tommy's behaviour in the first half of the film leaves without any trace of a doubt that he IS a psychopath, and that means that Tommy cannot be a nice guy in ANY reality which Ashton creates.<br/><br/>""BE"" is overly dramatic. Everything happens with extra weight. The girl is like De Sade's Justine, always being the victim, always being attacked, ruined, whatever. The movie wants us to feel for her  FINE  but why the pathetic exaggerations? Examples: 1) she gets blown up by the dynamite: this is like a scene out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon! I.e. funny because Ashton does his best to correct things and he just ends up blowing up people!!! (Or himself, later on  sorry, but I thought this was absolutely hilarious); 2) when Ashton visits, seeing her for the first time in 7 years, he observes her working in a diner, and what does he see??? Within seconds she manages to drop her tray, and then gets pinched in the a** by a customer! Talk about clichés! Talk about slapstick comedy! Talk about OVERLY DRAMATIZING THINGS! 3) when Ashton finds her working as a whore: I mean, fine, so she has hit rock-bottom in that particular reality/experiment, but they over-did it, what with the make-up, and her attitude and everything. Why the OVER-DRAMATIZATION? It would have been enough to show her as a prostitute; there was no need to make her look as the most MISERABLE PROSTITUTE IN THE WORLD! Other silly things in the movie? Here we go: 1) when the black teacher shows Ashton's Mom the drawing he (supposedly) did; all they do is comment on the content of the drawing  no-one mentions just how ultra-talented Ashton would have to be to draw like that in primary school! 2) when Ashton meets his father for the first time, guess what happens? His father dies! Talk about drama! You see, they couldn't write a script in which his Dad gets killed on their 3rd or 4th meeting, oh no  it had to be on the very 1ST visit. Why? Because that's how real DRAMA works  at least according to the nitwits who wrote this silly script. 3) it is never explained why it takes Ashton 7 YEARS to finally visit the girl whom he is supposed to love so much; she even ASKS him this, but neither her nor the viewer get ANY answer! 4) Ashton's mother getting so sick in a later ""experiment"" (the one when he blows himself up so spectacularly), and then later his mother DOESN'T get sick in another experiment when Ashton kills the girl! Wouldn't that event and her son's subsequent demise as a nut-case be enough to make her sick, too??? 5) Ashton's fat, Gothic college room-mate: now, why would they include that character? It only made the movie less serious. Either you make a serious thriller, or you make a teen romp; make up your mind.<br/><br/>Now for the funniest moments, the ones that had me laughing very loudly indeed. The scene in which Tommy beats up somebody in the cinema is HILARIOUS. This little twerp (i.e. the young actor Jesse James(!) who plays him) just looks funny acting like an adult ultra-psychopath! Like a 12 year-old Joe Pesci! But hands-down the funniest part of the film is the entire part in the jail. There are so many over-the-top, silly things happening to Ashton in jail, so much cliché prison-movie stuff going on, that it almost seemed like something out of a ZAZ film! Hilarious! Oh, yes, and Ashton is a bad actor. Almost forgot that.<br/><br/>Everyone in the film is over-acting, over-reacting, everything is over-dramatic. I'm sure many people thought this was a brilliant picture, but I think many of them haven't seen similarly-themed  and better  movies, so they thought ""how original!"". Original only in its silliness and absurdity. Not to mention far-fetchedness. If a circus clown could take the shape of a movie, it would be ""The Butterfly Effect""."

Sure the script is weak and smacks of late night pot sessions, sure the direction is alternatingly sloppy and overwrought, and sure I reached the movie's end thinking 'why the hell should I care?'...but all these considerations are nothing compared to the mess that is Kutcher's acting! The kid can not act his way out of a paper bag, and I don't know what would possess anyone to put him in such a demanding dramatic role (more demanding, honestly, than popcorn fare like this should ever expect). The only reason I can see to have put this guy -- whose previous credits included portraying the chowderhead on 'That 70's Show' and HIMSELF on the idiotic 'Punk'd' -- in this role was to get ANYONE to see it! Seriously: would anyone have gone to see a movie about the paradoxes of time travel if some schmuck nobody knew was in the lead role? Almost certainly not. At least with Kutcher on the posters you'd at least snag the poor suckers who thought 'Donnie Darko' was the deepest thing ever... Aside from they abysmal Kutcher, this movie had certain things going for it. It is, essentially, a clever premise, but a tough one to tackle. A writer could never be certain how far to go when trying to calculate the changes one could effect in one's own life and the world if able to go back and change key events in one's past. And the creators of 'Final Destination 2' are not necessarily up to the task. But why should they be? Nobody expects much of them, and this movie will assuredly become another short-term classic for high-school/college half-thinkers to hash over as they play it again and again, searching for greater meaning than will ever be there. See this movie only if you're a time-travel nut...or a 13-year-old with pretensions toward genius. Otherwise, anyone could sit this one out, and spend the time changing their own life."

It's a normal time-travel story in the same manner as 'The Time Machine' and 'Back to the Future' - but not that fascinating because the aspect of time traveling seems completely natural and not weird at all to all the persons in the movie. This way, the fun of 'discovering' time-traveling by the main characters is not enjoyed in this movie. <br/><br/>Second, the in itself always interesting idea that it's possible to change the past, is not worked-out correctly in this movie. There is always a paradox in time-traveling, and nothing can ever be completely solved, but in this movie, everything fits in the end. That's misleading and an insult to the viewer. It's also a very cheap way of making this movie 'happy ending' after all - probably for the kids watching this.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the movie is very depressing. Sometimes, depressing movies can unsettle you, teach you something or make you think about the sad state of the world - or at least entertain you because they're well made. But this movie actually is just a sequence of scenes that make you feel bad, that depress you and that ultimately have no other point than to make you feel bad. Sure, it's all solved in the end, but the main characters don't seem to have used the bad images to turn into better persons, so why was it necessary to show all this in the first place?<br/><br/>Finally, the title is badly chosen. Supposedly, the 'butterfly effect' is the effect that when a butterfly flaps its wings, it can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. However, in this movie, when something is changed in the past, only the lives of the main characters change. That's very un-butterfly-effectish, which basically says: change one thing in the past, and *everything* changes, not only the lives of the main characters. Therefore, this whole movie seems based on a wrong conception of the very theory it's trying to work out. Sloppy, to say the least. <br/><br/>These are some of the reasons why this movie is in my opinion at most average and can't possible receive such jubilant reviews on here. People who like this movie perhaps like it because they haven't seen any other time-travel movies, or because they like the main actors, or because they just like easy teenage-thrillers that you instantly forget after you've seen them. It's a choice, but this movie is ultimately just disappointing and leaves a pointless bad taste in your mouth."
"Mighty_sheman","1","38","82","16 May 2005"," WAAAAY beyond awful! An utter disgrace in every way imaginable! This film will give you nightmares.
","The Butterfly Effect has it all, and in huge super-sized servings. Well I was simply blown right out of my seat by this one. I can not believe it, ""Ashton Kutcher you have just been Punk'd!""<br/><br/>Suspend disbelief, sit back and strap yourself in for the (probably final) ride of your life! Welcome to the Butterfly Zone. The most horrifying, spine chilling and unbelievable thing about this movie, beyond the gruesome, meaningless violence and horror, is that it was ever made in the first place. Mercifully this film did not seem to last any more than 5 hours at most so I was still breathing by the credits. Low and behold, further proof that there IS indeed a conspiracy going on, the IMDb users and shock horror, a gang of those so called movie critics loved this! I heard such words as ""dark and intelligent"" and ""gripping and stylish,"" used to describe this film... Piffle! Dark it may be but intelligent it is not, even slightly, at ANY stage. If like me you are a sucker for hype and you're often left bemused by what junk gets praised these days then you absolutely HAVE to see this film, it really has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>I often babble about how so many 'thought provoking'(I use the term loosely, reflecting on recent films of this breed) films just don't have anything happening in them. So let me get this films plus points out of the way quickly, + has many things happen in it. Unfortunately we will now have to move swiftly on to the negative. - has many stupid things happen in it, bad acting, stupendously outrageous storyline, Ashton's hair is more animated than he is, sooooooooo bleak and depressing you may well need to be rushed away for immediate psychiatric treatment and just so utterly stupid that anyone who considers it 'deep' must surely be smoking the green stuff or they have suffered such horrific trauma at the hands of this disaster film that they can no longer be considered the full article. OK a bit OTT, I believe we all have a right to our own opinions, and to each his own but I just could not wish this film upon anyone. You have been warned.<br/><br/>*spoilers* Well I won't go too deep into the story as I simply do not have the will, but if you're expecting an intelligent time travel tale with a meaningful moral message about dwelling on the past, like I was, sorry but this is not the movie for you. There are so many plot holes in here and the ending (which ever one you have been burdened with) is just sooo poor your head will probably implode. If only the directors had been more creative and had the decency to finish this up in a way that explained away the preceding hour and a half of complete and utter nonsense and buffoonery as the fantasy of a dangerous and deluded psychopath then they may have just got away with some sort of credibility. What they provide is an unbearable and lame, not to mention pathetically executed, 10 minutes of further lunatic behavior with Ashton even running around like a demented gorilla! Fabulous! The possibility of it all being a silly fantasy is seemingly offered but then events get even sillier and by the time you have seen the ending you don't even care either way. What happened in this film? Where do I begin, well this film features Ashton's character getting his arms and legs blown off which contributes to his mum getting cancer (was that the same story strand? I can't remember and don't care), a dog getting burned alive in a sack, a pedophile daddy, kids murdering each other AND a mother with child, people committing suicide and getting blown up and a whole lot of other poop. You think I am making this up? So would I if I hadn't seen the film! All of it might make some sense to someone and might be watchable to someone and might even be entertaining to someone but my advice to the latter would be ""seek urgent psychiatric attention!"" Had the whole thing not been so hilariously lame (while taking itself SOOOOO seriously) to the point of being passable as a low form of comedy it could have been seriously damaging to anybodies mental well being. Some of that stuff could have been considered as part of the story but most of it, like the film, is completely unnecessary. It was like this rubbish was stuck in to make the film hard hitting and perhaps make up for the fact that the script could not deliver any punch so some disturbing images were ready to fill in for it instead. Nice try guys, but it just didn't work. You will be glued to the screen alright and you'll feel ashamed for it, but you'll be looking for some method to the madness, something good to come out of all this bad taste and even worse acting, sorry, there is no deep meaning, there is no thought behind it all. This is just a bad movie, too bad, they exist and that's a fact of life, but I had to come back and see for myself that, YES, it WAS given 7.6! There was also rampant discussion about how intelligent and profound it was, and how if you move the t in the main character's name it spells Event Reborn, wooooooooo, that really freaked me out, I almost fell out of my seat. Good God!"

","If pedophilia, burning animals alive and maiming kids with explosives are your thing, your movie has arrived. I heard the bad press, but felt that at the very least it would be a mind-numbing thriller. Through the course of the story, we are subjected to the most horrible fringe elements of humanity. The characters ricochet from bad circumstances to worse as Ashton travels through time until the viewer is wondering if this story will ever decide to end.<br/><br/>This movie made me almost physically ill and for the first time ever I considered leaving the theatre early. Unflinching violence is the standard for this movie. It contributes nothing, other than to create an atmosphere some mistake as 'gritty' or 'dark'. Sickening is more accurate. For this, many will consider me a prude, or that somehow I don't 'get the movie'. No, I got it when Issac Asimov was writing stories about these same ideas fifty years ago. Miraculously he didn't feel the need to involve kiddie porn and prison rape to get the point across.<br/><br/>There is such a thing as cheap shock value, and the Butterfly Effect is choked with it."
"bgordo81","3","12","22","22 July 2006"," A real downer
","This movie did not start out on the wrong foot. A child growing up who suffers periodic blanks in his memory when parts of his and his friends' lives take very traumatic turns. Unfortunately, after Evan found out a way to remedy all this by using his diaries, it goes downhill from there. His efforts seemed very compulsive, clumsy, and sloppy with little forethought, which might be understandable for the first couple of time jumps but frankly gets old after a while. Every change made screws up more and more of his life preventing him from fixing the previous mistakes he made as he is no longer able to write the diaries from that point on. Finally, at the end, unlike in the movie ""Groundhog Day"", he just plain gives up (in both the theatrical and director's cut).<br/><br/>The director's cut, while probably more in the spirit of this dark, depressing film, was even worse than the theatrical, not only because of the ending but also the creepy fortuneteller and sickening political correctness. You could think of that version as the ultimate twisted antithesis of ""It's a Wonderful Life"".<br/><br/>I mean, come on. Life isn't a bowl of cherries, but it isn't a bowl of offal either. If everyone thought the way the directors of this movie did, the human race would be doomed to extinction. And if you're trying to simply send the message that messing around with time can change the future in ways you don't want, the body of the movie did that in spades, making the failed ending unnecessary. Murphy's Law prevails throughout the film, with no respite and to a rather ridiculous degree. Two thumbs down.<br/><br/>Also, I would keep this movie away from children. It's rated R for a reason. And if you're an adult, only see it if you're a perpetual optimist or high on Prozac."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>So we've got a film about a teenager with mental problems, mixed in with a love story about a hero who has to go back in time to change the future for the better for his loved ones. Ring any bells?<br/><br/>Not only is this appallingly scripted, laughably acted and ill-thought-through film living off the success of Donnie Darko, it also has no ideas of its own to support itself. There are so many holes in the plot, and the logic of Evan (Ashton Kutcher)'s time travel is left completely unexplained, and for good reason. There isn't an explanation, because it doesn't make any sense. There are an outrageous number of huge coincidences in order to make each time-shift work (for example, Evan is always with the same 3 friends throughout his life) and at some moments, the characters' actions beggar belief. Tommy, first at 13, is absolutely ridiculous. I don't want to heap blame on a young actor because it isn't fair, so instead, I'm blaming the script. This poor boy has to wear a leather jacket, brutally beat up a 21-year-old jock, and deliver a fantastic 'evil laugh' on his way to being escorted out of the cinema. I hoped somebody would escort me out at the point where 13-year-old Evan tells Kayleigh, spontaneously, ""You have no idea how beautiful you are.""<br/><br/>There are a few horror moments too, for the audience. I don't mean scary, I mean horror at the inclusion of some atrocious scenes. If it isn't enough for a 13-year-old boy to persuade a grown man to cease his paedophilia merely by shouting at him (which left me laughing), the scene in which Evan wakes up with no arms is one of the most terrible pieces of cinema I have ever witnessed. I have absolutely no idea what Gruber and Bress were trying to do here, but if it was a poignant effect they wanted to create, then they missed the mark. Admittedly, that scene DID make me think. But only of puns (""He's 'armless"", ""Give me a hand"" etc.)<br/><br/>All in all, one to miss. I'm bowled over by the amount of good reviews of this film, because it is definitely not worth seeing."

","The Butterfly Effect - Directors Cut<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is directed by Eric Bress and Bress co-writes the screenplay with J. Mackye Gruber. It stars Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz and Ethan Suplee. Music is by Michael Suby and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.<br/><br/>
The title refers to the butterfly effect, the chaos theory of a popular hypothetical situation that illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time. The plot pitches Kutcher as Evan Treborn who suffers blackouts during during critical mments in his life. When older he finds that through reading the journals he has written since a child, that he can go back in time to the significant events and change what happens. Unfortunately each time he does it comes at a great cost...<br/><br/>It was mercilessly kicked by the pro critics upon release, not helped by coming at a time when Kucher was something of a kicking post to critics. To compound the misery for the makers, they released a theatrical cut that featured a quite apalling ending. Inspite of these trevails at the time of release, the pic made a pot load of cash at the box office. Once the Directors Cut surfaced, with a key scene added to cement the different - quality - ending, time has seen the stock of the pic rise considerably. So much so that it currently sits at a 7.6 rating on IMDb and a 75% rating on TMDB, wile there are some critics who have come out and admitted they were too quick to judge the first release back in 2004.<br/><br/>What we have is a time travelling corkscrew narrative that is immensely sombre in telling how ones actions can have far-reaching consequences. It's a compelling and often thrilling picture, one that can spark hearty debate about the thematics at work - notably we the audience being forced to contemplate our own actions in life. The pic demands the utmost attention, switching off for a few minutes is a definite no no. Some scenes linger long in the memory as we trawl through the evil that kids and men do, right up to the unforgettable finale.<br/><br/>There's plot and logic holes, that are small irritants, and even though this definitely could have been better cast with more senior actors, none of the youthful cast members hurt the picture. It packs a punch, that is on proviso you only see the directors cut. 7.5/10"

","Do you like to be challenged while watching a movie? Do you like to really think about the repercussions of the actions transpiring on screen? If you answered ""Yes"" to both of those questions, then ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a movie for you!<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Butterfly Effect"" tells the story of the rather unique Evan (Ashton Kutcher), who as a child begins to experience strange blackouts that frighten mother Andrea (Melora Walters), whose husband had a history of similar experiences. As Evan begins to age, he discovers that his blackouts all revolve around a series of traumatic memories spent with childhood acquaintances Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). I wish I could delve more into this wonderful film, but to do so would give away too many spoilers and ruin the experience.<br/><br/>There are two things to know about this movie right off the bat:<br/><br/>1. Do not be scared away by Kutcher. No, he is not God's gift to thespians, but this isn't goofy Kelso here. He plays a very good role.<br/><br/>2. Do not give up after the first 30-40, which will seem rather random and disjointed. If you can give the movie at least an hour, you will be hooked.<br/><br/>This is very much a ""thinking person's"" movie at its core. It deals with relativistic physics and the like. If that is not your cup of tea, then don't bother. If you love to be challenged by your theatrical fare, though, then this one will astound you!"
"pricedominic","9","2","2","30 January 2012"," Interesting and original
","A conveluted and quite complex plot, written brilliantly and acted very well indeed by Ashton and his co workers. I state 'Ashton and his co workers', because this really is Ashton Kutcher at his best. The support cast are credible, but at a time when Kutcher was trying to break away from his fun but forgettable roles such as Dude Wheres my Car, and his stint on Punked, this film couldn't have been any better. This is definitely a film you need to concentrate on for every minute, as one moment of the story you miss, may lose you in the following events that occur. I have seen many films that use time travel as a plot line, and i have seen many fail because of it. But this film gets it bang on, and by the end you are really anticipating how Evan will sort the whole mess out to make everyone happy, because if you shred away the many layers of this film all he is trying to do is exactly that, bring happiness to people who only know despair. i would love to see Ashton Kutcher in similar roles to this, as i feel his career has begun to tail off into mondane and mediochre rom-coms. A truly great film, very underrated and very understated.<br/><br/>On another note, DO NOT WATCH THE SECOND ONE. It is the biggest smack in the face to any film franchise, completely loses the whole ideology of this film, and becomes a poorly acted farce.<br/><br/>P.S Very clever use of character name Evan Treborn. Say it as one word and you will understand why :)"

It was very astonishing watching Ashton Kutcher's great performance, since i thought he was a 'trash entertainment' actor, suddenly I realize I was wrong.<br/><br/>It's a kind of a mid-budget movie with a lot of contents.<br/><br/>A 'must see' movie for those who want to experience the effects of the chaos theory (or the butterfly effect)."

","Well, I saw this interesting movie. And I found it susceptible of more than one interpretation. On one side I agree that this movie can be about time traveling and about those unintended consequences which may result after a person modifies the past, if it is possible. But in the other side I see maybe a more reality-anchored movie telling us the story of a schizophrenic young man (Evan), trapped in his mental illusions. And the movie gives us very clear clues in this direction: his grandfather and father suffered of the same illness and maybe he did inherit it after them. And it is possible that all those early very traumatic experiences he went throughout had an effect of accelerating his mental fall. Throughout the movie he is often visiting or staying for a while at the mental hospital. Trapped in his fantasies he dreams of changing the past in order to save his girlie friend from the childhood. This movie reminds me of Donnie Darko, another ""time-traveler"" with clear connections to some mental disorder or lack of capacity for approaching Reality."
"starman2765","7","2","2","12 July 2008"," Not based on the Ray Bradbury novel of the same name.
","Not a bad movie at all! A bit convoluted, at one point I found myself reviewing the narrative so that I could be on point with the story, and was able to do it. The main actor gets a chance to show more range of emotion than many actors, or perhaps it is more a tribute to him then to the script. While it has a Hollywood ending there is a bit of a bittersweet quality to it, suggesting that the best of all possible worlds may not be the one that we would most like to inhabit. Another tribute to the scriptwriter to pull off such a feat without being preachy or (other than already noted) overly convoluted.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is first rate; employing a restrained use of dynamic techniques at the right moments. It might have been better with more beauty, but not everyone needs that to be suitably impressed. There was also a quality to the flashbacks that at once was recognizable, and at the same time suggested an urgency that drove the movie forward. Kudos to the special effects crew here for a subtle point well taken.<br/><br/>The actors all did a fine job considering the roles that they were presented with, though not all of them had the impact as the lead. The prison sequences, I think, were most impressive and visceral. The gritty childhood sequences were a bit overly intense (due to the subject matter) and underplayed (due, I suppose, the ratings board). I think that this is one of the places where the script faltered, and could have been fleshed out (ala Pan's Labyrinth) or reworked (the better choice I think) for the better. Still, it works in a better than average way here as well.<br/><br/>Again, overall, the movie was really good! I'd see it again to dissect it with a friend, but don't think I'd want to see it by myself again. Thumbs up.<br/><br/>Plot synopsis: Convoluted mess of journals. The boy is subject to blackouts. These happen at intense moments of his life. We later learn that these blackouts coincide with his future self going back in time and mentally inhabiting his younger self's body, spewing out words and actions that change the future. Never with overtly amusing consequences. It's not that kind of movie, unless you happen to be a sadist, in which case the ending will be disappointing (unless you have nurtured you inner happiness monger).<br/><br/>So the child witnesses events both disturbing and emotionally charged that he blacks out over; and the future self keeps finding himself in different alternate realities. Did I mention that it's kind of convoluted? So there is no linear storyline associated with this picture. Instead there are multiple aborted story arcs that leave various of the main characters in stages of emotional or physical damage. As one example, the main actor goes back in time and stands in front of a powerful fire cracker. When he finds himself in the future, his has no arms from the elbows down. The same firecracker kills his (later to be estranged, no, make that never even flirted with, let alone dated etc.) wife. You get a sense of how convoluted the story line is by these parenthetical asides, so it is a testament to the story writer that the movie was as easy to follow as it was.<br/><br/>These various alternative realities continue to play out, and the main character continues to hold on to the memories of them. The other characters amount to figments of his imagination (albeit flesh and blood ones, with there own hidden desires and life paths) since they are continually moved from one alternative reality to another with out even the whisper of a doubt in their minds that the one that he (or is that He - the stigmata does apply here) is currently inhabiting is the only one that ever existed, and any other ones that he might be talking about are clearly fictional.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the girl happily alive and wearing all white; and he's apparently a businessman (though actually he could be a drug dealer, a gigolo, an antiques salesman or a presidential candidate for all we know; all we really know is that he's done playing with the past (and therefore the future)) just going about his businessman's life.<br/><br/>It's a movie that suffers from this kind of linear, didactic exploration, and would be better suited to a discussion of the themes involved, which I have already touched on.<br/><br/>May you reading this be well and happy."

","I can't figure out Ashton Kutcher. On That 70's Show I thought he had potential. He did Just Married, which I personally found quite amusing, and thought he was good in. Then he became tabloid fodder and was everywhere, being the annoying, obnoxious guy we all see him to be. I blame Punk'd. I admit, I find some of them very funny, but he just comes across as so completely immature and obnoxious. But then I see this film, and again I think he's got something. He played his role quite well, and never once resorted to his usual style of lowest-common-denominator humor.<br/><br/>I'd probably closest compare this to Final Destination. It's something different, very well done, with its own tone and style, and not driven by star power. New Line Cinema continues to impress me as a force in the genre. While not anything groundbreaking or spectacular, this film is satisfying. Here's hoping Kutcher continues to make good project decisions."
"ttansell","7","2","2","19 August 2006"," Stick with it
","The plot of this movie is tangled and at first appears to be disturbing and weird. Thankfully we stuck with it and it develops into a clever and innovative storyline and the seemingly random scenes at the beginning come together in a brilliant fashion. Ashton Kutcher is surprisingly deep considering his performance in other movies. It may merit a second watch as I think it will be one of those movies where you miss things early on that link into the plot later. Drama/Fantasy/Scifi/Thriller certainly describes this movie as it has a little of everything and yet it isn't overly graphic and doesn't rely on shock factor to be compelling."
"shoguntee","7","2","2","29 January 2004"," Surprise surprise
","I'm as surprised as anyone that Ashton Kutcher has done a good movie, but he has pulled it off. The Butterfly Effect is the very violent, depraved story of a guy who has suffered blackouts his entire life in order to block out painful and traumatic experiences.  When the memories start flooding back, he discovers that he can go back in time and change the future by altering events of the past, with disastrous results. This is a good, strong suspenseful movie with superb acting by the mostly reliable Amy Smart and Ethan Suplee(Mallrats represent!) and a decent performance by Kutcher. I don't think Suplee's part was big enough to warrant the starring credit he's received but that's not a big deal. About 3/4 of the way through the movie you start to figure out that the writer had no idea how to end the film, and the abrupt unsatisfying finish only proves it. Still, this is a good movie for fans who want to see a new twist on the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" theme."

The main reason for me not wanting me to see it was because of him, and perhaps I would have liked it more if someone else had played his character. But the movie stunk with or without him. I do think it was a good story in some ways. Sometimes it kept you interest, but most of the time I was just waiting to figure out what really happened in the blackouts and get the stupid movie over with. This movie only keeps people's attention because it just keeps dragging on! And what is this movie- a sci-fi thriller or some cheesy romance story? I must say some of the ""what could have been"" scenarios were just plain stupid. I was getting really annoyed with the little Ashton calling the dad ""f-bag."" The part where they burn the notebooks, so cheesy! Ashton with stubs for arms and then trying to commit suicide? Come on! The bad kid turning into a Jesus freak?

","This is one of the worst films of the year - a true howler. The plot is ridiculous (and I love time travel scenarios). Kutcher simply cannot carry a film, and I can't say much for the acting of the other ""leads,"" either. I watched this with five friends, and we all found it laughable, at best. The script is a cheat, never explaining exactly ""what"" is going on. And, if Kutcher is able to keep changing the past, resulting in a different future, how does he manage to remember all that happened in every single variation? Personally, I found the acting and dialogue of the childhood version of the characters to be distracting and annoying.<br/><br/>WHAT is that fat,""goth"" college roommate even doing in this screenplay?<br/><br/>The whole ""frat"" alternate universe totally disregards Kutcher's character's personality, regardless of what changes he makes."
"Mario64","3","8","14","30 August 2005"," A pretty bad psychological thriller
","I won't deny that The Butterfly Effect, staring Ashton Kutchor, kept my attention throughout. It isn't the kind of bad movie that makes you want to run away in artistic disgust. It is, however, a bad movie plain and simple from beginning to end; piling on so much ridiculousness and poor writing and stupid clichés one after the other that it makes you wish that you, like the movie's star, could go back a few hours and tell yourself not to watch this dribble.<br/><br/>The whole movie revolves around Even Trebon, played by Kutchor, who finds out he can relive memories and even change things in the past by reading a journal of his he kept as a child. This movie doesn't bother explaining anything about this main facet, while it shows annoyingly in action again and again. The biggest problem though isn't that they don't try to give this aspect any depth, it's how it's used in utterly absurd fashion. It's a back and fourth film that gives very little credibility to any of its chapters.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie, revolving around Evan's childhood, is merely mediocre. Right off the bat it's somewhat interesting, though clearly tries too hard for its own good. The next two-thirds of the film don't get any better, in fact they get much worse. Kutchor gives basically a one note and pretty weak performance of being initially shocked at how his life has changed after these flashbacks, followed by a journey to get his journal and relive the effect once again. Amy Smart gives the film's best performance, and while not a great performance that often revolves around the movies over-reactions, it's the biggest bright spot in the movie. After all the overacting, lethargic time changes, and just stupid and often unnecessary scenes in prisons, college campuses and mental institutes, it becomes clear that this film really never tried to give itself much credibility. The conclusion is as unimpressive as anything and by that time, while I was still watching, I really didn't care.<br/><br/>I give the movie points for Amy Smart and some interesting ideas, but that's about all it has. It wasn't a dreadfully boring movie like many bad films are, but it's bad in the nature it plays out. Of all the going back in time films I have seen this is by far the worst and most ridiculous. Back to the Future and Terminator expanded the mind and intrigued the hell out of us with quandaries of effecting the future. What the Butterfly Effect does is explain nothing, and try so many things that don't work that it practically oozes as something made by someone with a severe case of ADHD. I'm shocked how well this movie has been received by IMDb voters. I think it's officially the most overrated movie ever on this site. Critics pounded the film as it deserved to be. It's not plausible, it's not even the least bit credible, and you'll do yourself a favor by not seeing this steaming pile of crap.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."
"alexbowyer","Null","8","14","16 April 2004"," Enjoyable, disturbing, thought-provoking original film
","There are a great many films that cause us to question the ""realities"" that we are presented with, this is a good example of the genre. It causes you to ask questions and re-analyse things you have been presented with along the way, and will leave you with questions when you leave the cinema. This is what I look for in this sort of film, so I would judge it to be a success. It's maybe not quite as clever as Donnie Darko, and it's certainly a million times better than the dull and incomprehensible Big Fish.<br/><br/>But it isn't really fair to compare it to either, this film is original enough to be judged on its own merits. The central idea, that changing small events in the past can have profound and unpredictable consequences in the present/future, is a very intriguing one, which is explored very thoroughly and thoughtfully in this film.<br/><br/>** Spoilers **<br/><br/>Sure, it isn't perfect, there are a few logical mistakes in the plot and a few things that don't quite sit right - the fact that he has memory left over from pasts that never happened, for example.<br/><br/>And the film does get perilously close to doing that thing that made the Matrix sequels suffered from - thinking that so long as ""this bit"" makes sense, people will not remember in too much detail what happened earlier.<br/><br/>But I'm willing to overlook all this, because the film is an enjoyable and thought-provoking experience, it never bored me, i was drawn into empathising for the main character, and it left me wanting more.<br/><br/>It was a completely different film from what I expected, it wasn't a sci-fi at all really, it did what Groundhog Day did and took a sci-fi concept into another film genre and thus generated something completely new.<br/><br/>It was a very dark, at times disturbing, psychological thriller, and in the end I'm quite glad they went down this route - the same subject matter could quite easily have ended up another unmemorable teen comedy if handled differently and if they had ""fun"" with the concept as another reviewer suggested. I'm glad it wasn't, it would have detracted from the experience. They got close with the ""frat"" scenes, but thankfully that episode didn't last too long - that wouldn't fit in this movie.<br/><br/>I thought the versatility of acting was excellent - particularly Amy Smart, who was surprisingly more believable as the prostitute and the loser waitress than as the frat girl. The kid who played the young Evan was excellent as well, and the film did a great job of showing how a bad childhood can really disturb someone and you can always read it on their face.<br/><br/>I thought the film had some great moments - like when the Goth roommate doesn't recognise Evan, or when we piece together why Evan drew the knife-wielding killer and took the knife out in the kitchen. It's all very cleverly woven together so we piece the jigsaw together bit by bit.<br/><br/>I even liked the ending (on reflection), the way they almost recognised each other but not quite, managed to avoid being cheesy but still leave things open (I'm thinking of ""Serendipity"")<br/><br/>One minor gripe is that they didn't make more use of the reality where he is in the mental home and told there are no diaries and that his brain made it up - this is also a compelling idea the film could have spent more time on. I would have like to have seen a more Total Recall or K-PAX -like ending where we are left with two equally possible realities - is he insane or is it really happening. Instead we realise it is really happening, I would have liked them to have left it open. I also think they could have had more interaction with his Dad. I look forward to seeing what scenes they deleted when the DVD comes out.<br/><br/>All in all, an enjoyable & thought provoking, if a little disturbing film that deserves every success. 7/10."

","The Butterfly Effect is a special example of the very worst kind of film. If it had merely been dull or boring it would have just been another bad film that simply vanished over time. If only.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is so mind-twistingly stupid, so incomprehensibly brainless that it can sometimes manage to trick you into thinking it's clever. It's what people do when they're not intelligent enough to make a consistent, engaging story. They take a concept, string a bunch of bizarre and confusing scenes together and end it with some asinine ""twist"" in an attempt to stun the audience so they don't notice that nothing makes any sense.<br/><br/>The film endlessly contradicts itself, thinking it's getting ever more thrilling when really it's just digging itself a deeper hole. It doesn't even adhere to it's own rules or logic, and in a film that is supposed to be about the nature of cause and effect, it's only real obligation is to be consistent to itself. Sadly, this is all too hard for the makers of The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>The concept of a magic diary that sends you back in time is a hard thing to sell at the best of times, but when you give up trying to sell it altogether and try and pass it off as 'surreal' or 'abstract' then you're just adding insult to injury."
"jimboduck","6","11","21","9 May 2005"," An interesting concept hastily put together – 6 (A little disappointing)
","So I'm watching the BUTTERFLY EFFECT with eyes peeled to Ashton Cutcher's mom. Where have I seen her before? Ten minutes later, it hit's me like a time-warped flashback, and I'm sitting on my couch back in Massachusetts watching Magnolia again. Yeah Cutcher's worried to death mom, Melora Walters, was also that strung out coke-head girl in Magnolia! But how did she end up in a movie with Ashton Cutcher? Before my question is answered, the flashback ends and unfortunately I'm back in my Japanese apartment watching THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT. Wait, I want to finish Magnolia! I have to go back!<br/><br/>I selected this movie without knowing what it was about. That is undoubtedly the best way to watch any movie, whereupon surprises flow like the salmon of Capastrano. But because of struck-over-the-head obvious hints, I soon deciphered the concept behind this Luke-warm sci-fi Oldsmobile. ""Your father thought he could ... could ..."" Yeah, mom, I thought, just say it and get it over with. He thought he could change the past! Walters was definitely more convincing in Magnolia. What happened? Could I go back in time and tell her not to do this movie?<br/><br/>OK, I'm a big fan of sci-fi time travel movies, because they touch upon that most guttural of human emotions – regret. What would you give to go back and change the past? If you had that second chance, your life might turn out to be totally different, like the alphabet might have a new letter or worse, former president Richard Nixon might not have been elected. Think about that one.<br/><br/>The tradition of altering the course of history jumped onto film with It's a Wonderful Life, skipped from body to body in Quantum Leap, and actually had a scientific basis in several episodes of Star Trek: Generations. I raise a toast to those works of art.<br/><br/>Thus THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT automatically gets a better-than-average rating in my book at the get-go for having the guts to take on the rich concept of time travel. But even though the chick-flick in sci-fi clothing starts off with a lot of potential, several production and writing shortcomings drag THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT back down to mediocrity.<br/><br/>First of all, the story seems to have been written by a sixth-grader. Is Ashton Chritchner really traveling back in time, or is he just wandering around the corridors of his confused and twisted psyche? It's a mystery, which is okay, but if I were to portray this mystery on film, I'd try a smarter approach. Sure, Ashton Cutcher's fan-base might have yet to reach puberty, but every dog sniffs out a questionable screenplay. There are too many loopholes and contradictions. Are we to swallow the idea that Cutcher's brain is a time-machine, or worse yet that he doesn't want to change real world problems like South Africa or the former Bush Administration? My throat is not deep enough for hook line and sinker, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The scenes where he goes back to his childhood body and bosses Eric Stoltz around is laughable. Maybe Eric Stoltz's feelings really are that easy to manipulate. Or maybe the scriptwriter ran out of clever ideas to fuel this groundless time travel movie and was desperate to get the script in on time. Instead of time-travel, the crew should have focused on the concept of a 26-year old trapped in a ten-year-old's body. You know, something akin to Travolta's Look Who's Talking. That's something worth exploring.<br/><br/>Another questionable aspect of the production behind THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is slapdash and thinly transparent speed. Too few actors and too few props are spread over too many time leaps, which amounts to something like a high school skit more than anything else. Where the movie starts to get creepy with nicely orchestrated music, it stops halfway. I would say, up the creepiness behind the insidious molestation theme, tone down the obvious references to fraternity life, and come up with a scientific basis for the time travel. That would automatically bump the movie up a point or two, even though it might confuse some of Ashton Cutcher's most die-hard fans.<br/><br/>JY<br/><br/>Jimboduck dot com"

I found the film to be thought-provoking and it is one of the few films in recent memory I've seen where I actually gave a damn about the characters. I found myself actually flinching at parts of the film and wishing certain bits wouldn't happen, even though you knew they would. The best acting jobs in the entire film are done by the children. Those playing Kutcher and Smart and especially William Lee Scott in thier troubled years do outstanding jobs. My advice to anyone wanting to see this film is to go into it with an open mind and don't try and pick holes in the time-travel theory. Suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to say ""well maybe this is how it would happen"", only then will you get the true experience. It may suffer from ""Back To The Future"" syndrome regarding time-travel, but that's only an annoyance if you let it be. Don't. In my mind this film will deserve more recognition than it gets. 9/10"

"dunmore_ego","7","6","10","29 April 2008"," The Teen Model Effect
","Ashton Kutcher courts credibility by sporting a beard that looks like the direct result of losing his shaver and sleeping in his clothes for two days. It worked for George Michael.<br/><br/>As far as I can gather from *The Butterfly Effect*'s totally illogical storyline, a teen model time travels backwards to rectify sins of the past so that in the ""present,"" he can hook up with another teen model.<br/><br/>Noble? No. Hot? Definitely. <br/><br/>We must remember whom this wiffle of a movie was created for  girls. But despite its attempt to sabotage itself by casting Kutcher in the lead role, this thriller succeeds as a very effective and entertaining film. Directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber move the action at the pace of a car salesman's pitch, and twice as slick, designed to specifically deceive your brain through the muddled logic and irreconcilable paradoxes for exactly the length of the movie. After that, you're on your own<br/><br/>The actual ""butterfly effect"" is a chaos theory syllogism (attributed to an early pioneer of chaos theory, Edward Lorenz), which posits that ""the flapping of a butterfly's wing will create a disturbance that in the chaotic motion of the atmosphere will become amplified eventually to change the large scale atmospheric motion, so that the long term behavior becomes impossible to forecast."" (Michael Cross, Professor of Theoretical Physics, CalTech). Put more simply, ""the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil may set off a tornado in Texas."" (ibid.) <br/><br/>Consequently, *The Butterfly Effect* movie is based on chaos theory in the same way that *Achy Breaky Heart* is based on *Bohemian Rhapsody.*<br/><br/>But the notion that the filmmakers attempt to impart is simple enough. Whenever Evan Treborn (Kutcher) jolts himself backwards in time to try to change one thing for the better (to ultimately end up with his dream girl, Kayleigh, played with varying degrees of conviction by Amy Smart), his action sets in motion a wave of unpredictability for the ""present"" that he returns to.<br/><br/>Or at least, unpredictability for the principals only. Evan, his mother and his teen friends change dramatically whilst every other person in their orbits is more or less unaffected. They don't seem to have made any new acquaintances, business partners or lovers along the way who influenced their lives  these few teens only seem to have affected each other and the outside world just came along for the ride. <br/><br/>So the world DOES revolve around teen models!<br/><br/>The method by which Evan achieves his temporal travels is by reading his childhood diaries; read a certain page with the concentration of a teen model and he is jolted back to that point in time, as per Einstein's Theorem of Teen Model Time Travel. Upon finding a mess in the ""present"" after each backwards jaunt, Evan steps up his jaunts to the point where we are watching him with the expectancy of another episode of Gilligan's Island; that is, the serious nature of his unique power dissipates and we wonder how that crazy Gilligan is going to mess up THIS week. Ultimately, the plot goes past chaos theory and straight to chaos.<br/><br/>Weighted issues like pedophilia (shabby Eric Stoltz making a cameo as a child molester), letter bombs (remember the good old days when not even a bomb placed in your letterbox would make you puss out and cry ""terrorist!""?), animal abuse and baby-killing keep the movie above the fluff level. Some would say *below* the decency level. <br/><br/>The kids playing younger versions of the teen models are such fine actors that, in a fit of disassociation, we incorrectly attribute their talent to the overall character of Evan, Kutcher being only the eldest incarnation, but nonetheless garnering our misplaced respect. Mediocre actor as read, there's no doubt that Kutcher is on a different plane of maturity when it comes to his professional life: an ex-Bioengineering student from Iowa, the 6'2"" ex-model is a producer, executive producer, writer, restaurant owner  and married to the hands-down-hottest Brat Packer (Demi Moore) who was married to the hands-down-hottest action hero in Hollywood, Bruce Willis. Dude, where's my bitchslap?<br/><br/>The fact that Evan does end up performing a noble deed which leaves him Without The Girl is a brave choice for a Chick Flick of Kutcherian proportions, raising the sobriety level of the film even higher. (The director's cut inserts a very disturbing ending indeed: Evan goes back to the womb for his noble deed - how he got there, his fetus not having made any diary entries, is a question for the chaos theory mathematicians to answer. Anyone got Edward Lorenz's number?)<br/><br/>If taken at face value, *Butterfly Effect* is a crafty, hip, infuriatingly enjoyable jaunt. If taken with a shred of logic, it retains about as much credibility as - well, Ashton Kutcher."

","The concept behind this film is an interesting one that will surely captivate the audience as it did for me. However, I think somewhere down the line in the production something went wrong. The movie starts out brilliantly and Ashton Kutcher's acting really impressed me. The flashback scenes with the children are some of the most powerful, moving and disturbing sequences I have ever witnessed in cinema. I am not exaggerating they are fantastic!! <br/><br/>I think the problem is that there are two different films here, one is a big budget time travelling bonanza and the second is an indie flick about one man's disturbing past, quite similar to 'Mysterious Skin'. I realise there has to be a reason for Evan to go back in time but the flashbacks overshadowed the scenes where we see Evan's changed future in quality. I also felt that (although talented in this role) Ashton Kutcher was a strange choice due to the fact that the fans that he would attract would not necessarily be drawn to this film.<br/><br/>The film seems to get steadily more and more insane with its changing futures and the ending just appalled me with its over obvious, over the top dramatics. It was clear that he had to kill himself and I can only guess that the horrendous foetus incident happened because they couldn't show a grown man killing himself to the 13 year olds that would watch this for Ashton Kutcher. <br/><br/>Basically I wish that there was some way to take the flashback scenes and put them in another film. I still would recommend this film to anyone to watch as the concept is great, the flashbacks are riveting and it is very entertaining. Just be prepared to want to block the ending from your mind after watching it."

","*** contains minor spoilers but nothing you couldn't figure out from the trailers*** <br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect was well done as a movie but I always get annoyed when the time travel is internally inconsistent.<br/><br/>There are two ways to imagine time travel, The ""Somewhere In Time"" (SIT) way and the ""Back To the Future"" (BTTF) way. In the BTTF way there is a base reality involving no time travel. Someone goes back in time, changes some stuff, comes back to the future and things are different so Marty fixes his life. In the SIT way there is no change. The original time line already has the time travel and any changes the character makes in the past only make the original future possible so Christopher Reeve is doomed. If you only use one of these types your story should make sense.<br/><br/>In ""The Butterfly Effect"" the black outs don't work. He has a black out because he goes back to that time but in the base reality sometimes he changed something and sometimes he didn't. One example is when he picks up the knife. He wouldn't pick up the knife until he messed up a lot of other points in his life but the movie continues on and those points aren't messed up yet so he had no reason yet to pick up the knife. Almost all of the black outs are sloppy like this but I don't want to reveal the whole movie.<br/><br/>Even though much of the movie is very well done, the lack of a sound foundation makes the whole thing flop. You go away from the movie saying ""That wouldn't work."""

The film does lose a bit of momentum in the second half and there were some missed opportunities for more twists and turns, but overall ""The Butterfly Effect"" will keep your attention and make you squirm a time or two.  Today's Mr. Overexposed, Ashton Kutcher (""Dude, Where's My Car"") flashes some dramatic promise, especially when called upon for the deer in the headlights look.  He effectively sneers his way through the college boy moments, but doesn't really pull off the prison time.  Amy Smart (from the underappreciated mini-classic ""Outside Providence"") is remarkable in her many roles within a role. Hopefully this will boost her career and she will continue to be pushed artistically.  Melora Walters (fresh from her spot-on performance in the over-hyped ""Cold Mountain"") delivers as Ashton's frightened Mom who just can't make the right move to save her boy.  The story takes time travel to an entirely new dimension - it's definitely NOT ""Back to the Future"".  It does have a touch of ""Seven"", which not coincidently, plays a role in the film.

"TerminalMadness","2","13","27","12 October 2004"," A very stale awful rip off of ""Donnie Darko""...
","""The Butterfly Effect"" is a rather ludicrous hybrid of two very good movies ""Donnie Darko"", and ""Frequency"" and what results is the bastard child of the two, a pretty dumb and utterly pretentious jumbled drama that is never sure what it's trying to say, or what in fact it's trying to mean. Is it a tragedy? Drama? Thriller? Science Fiction? Fractured Romance? Does the butterfly effect really apply to this, or is that theory just used as a plot device for this? I was never really sure what exactly, but what I was sure of in the end is that this definitely is none of the more complex dimensions above, instead it's just more like a really long practice in human misery, and cruelty than anything else.<br/><br/>As I stated in the aforementioned paragraph above, this tries to be two movies, firstly like ""Donnie Darko"" a film about a troubled boy attempting to seek a purpose in a world he's not sure he's supposed to be in and seeks to stop tragedy to strings of events even including the usual Christ references, and then there's the concept on which the events in the future, with the help of a special ability, can change the past and tragic events, but somehow, the slightest change only makes things worse.<br/><br/>""Frequency"" was a very good study of the Chaos theory and while creating a very engrossing thriller also managed to demonstrate the complexities and sheer fascinating results by it, while ""The Butterfly Effect"" uses it more as a mere plot device rather than a concept to revolve around. The butterfly effect or The Chaos Theory discovered by Edward Lorenz is the theory that the slightest alteration in a current environment can alter the people, the situation, the time period, and environment with humongous and many times disastrous repercussions, and regardless of how much the environment has been repaired, the results can continue to remain disastrous regardless of the length of repairs, thus was examined by Lorenz after he mistakenly altered a series of numbers during an experiment and no matter what he did couldn't go back to the original series of numbers.<br/><br/>Now, if ""The Butterfly Effect"" revolved around the concept of the actual theory for the purposes of the story, examining it further, dealing with the mass complexities, and at least practicing in originality, this may have been such a good movie, but instead it never deals with the actual theory, and instead just proceeds in dealing out themes and contexts that reminded me a lot of snuff film, and most of which I felt were just shown for shock value on the writers part to keep the audience cringing, most of the time it left me cringing but not for the reasons you'd think. Many times the events are so ridiculous you can almost hear the screenwriter manipulating the audience for shock value including one scene when the kids stuff a large firecracker in a mailbox as a prank, and it just happens to go off at the ""right moment"" which you'll see. It's a scene that I'm sure was intended for people to gasp in shock and cover their eyes, but from where I sat, it was just so darn ridiculous.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" is not an intelligent film thought it deals with fascinating themes, it's still just a really one-dimensional quasi-thriller with nothing going for it except a script that copies ""Donnie Darko"" page for page, but there was a difference, ""Donnie Darko"" was a very good, thought provoking thriller that never went to extremes for the purpose of shocking the audience, while this deals with a grab bag of ""taboo"" plot devices that wants to be daring, but is just manipulative.<br/><br/>Dabbling in suggestive but very uncomfortable themes of incest, pedophilia, child abuse, animal cruelty and extreme violence that, again, borders on snuff for the sheer purposes of making the audience gasp, this will be a very uncomfortable experience as it was for me. The story is ultimately very skewed in its approach taking a more routine approach that we've seen before in ""The Twilight Zone"" and the short lived and hardly remembered ""That was Then"" but they were done a lot better though they never acknowledge the concept.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" has the ability to observe what their story is working with but is just filled with constant miserable sequences including a lot of violent content, a lot of sexual references, and delves into the incredibly campy by the climax, with one ridiculous result from the main character's attempt to alter life, and then, as if the writers have given up, the concept is thrown out the window and the whole plot is stretched and changed becoming very insulting towards the audiences intelligence with an attempted surprise ending, but by then we realize we've just wasted a lot of our own time we can never get back."
"Falconeer","2","11","22","4 November 2006"," Two hour MTV music video
","'Butterfly Effect' is the kind of movie that is quite entertaining the first time around, but on subsequent viewings the flaws become glaringly evident. The original idea was a good one, and in the hands of a competent film-maker, this could have been a classic. Unfortunately, the film looks like crap. The whole production has a cheap, MTV style look. Totally devoid of artistic flair, such as impressive camera angles or stylish lighting, this looks exactly like a cheapo TV show. I cannot fathom how something that looks like THIS has such a high rating on IMDb. The acting as well, is just about on TV show level as well. And I could not for one moment take the airhead 'surfer dude' Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic, serious role. This 'actor' doesn't look like he has ever experienced a real emotion in his life. Every character here was such a complete, phony stereotype; Hayley, molested by her dad, isn't just a wreck of a woman; She is the crack whore from Hell, complete with the facial scar. Or when things go right, she isn't merely a normal, well adjusted young woman; No, she is a living, breathing TV commercial, sorority girl in pink with the dork boyfriend. Ready to rule the world, just because she wasn't molested after all. And how did people contain their laughter at seeing Ashton Kutcher, fraternity boy with the yellow windbreaker and sports car? Everything here was just sooo extreme, and so outrageously;y exaggerated, as if we as an audience are so stupid, that we can only understand things in the most extreme stereotyped characters conceivable. Thumper, the obese roommate/buddy, absolutely laughable. Not only was the film poorly conceived, but it was offensive as well. exploiting subjects like sexual child abuse, prostitution, drug addiction, for the sake of making this tacky movie, pretty bad. And the absolute worst thing about this mess is that it seems to be making the arrogant, and highly ridiculous claim that it is somehow a film in the same vein as 'Seven', a film that is so superior to this MTV nightmare, that it is just ludicrous. During the scene where the kids, (who were the films only saving grace) were watching 'Seven' in a movie theatre, I really was wishing that I was watching that film instead of this one. And during the totally unbelievable 'prison sequence' I was wishing that I was watching 'American History X', or Sean Penn in 'Bad Boys'. Anything more realistic than a film where a 20 year-old Sorority babe says things like ""You said we were gonna be together forever, come Hell or High Water!"" Are we supposed to believe that anyone under the age of 65, much less a Barbie doll sorority bimbo, actually uses terms like ""Come Hell or high water?!?"" 'Butterfly Effect' has a good idea, but it has no idea of how to present it capably. I can see how people under 18 might think this is 'a cool flick', but it mystifies me that any intelligent adult would see this as a legitimate film. Yes, it is somewhat entertaining, and yes it is an ugly, 2 hour MTV video."

Furthermore, for every action, there's a reaction, and so even things you make ""right"" in the past can still lead to things going ""wrong"" in a different way. Fine. But here's the problem; actually, there are many problems: The acting was worse than what you find in really bad community theater. The script was weak and, at times, ridiculous. There are one too many scenes that are long, drawn-out and painfully boring. Last, ASHTON KUTCHER MAKES THE MOST ANNOYING FACES KNOWN TO MANKIND! By the end, there are some ""Oh, now I get it"" moments which is good; however, I don't know if those moments are worth it. You have to sit through GARBAGE to get to them.

","In an ideal world, this movie would have been a clever little movie that explored its cast of characters through a series of experiments in cause and effect. Unfortunately, in reality The Butterfly Effect falls short. The movie shows plenty of signs throughout that it's simply trying too hard to be clever and suspenseful - some scenes feel forced, especially towards the end as it starts trying to tie everything up.<br/><br/>I could imagine that this film might have hoped to be a sort of sci-fi Memento, though it falls plenty short of that lofty mark. Memento did a far better job of developing its cast of characters (which, in turn, was portrayed by a stronger group of actors) and was much more tightly written. The Butterfly Effect would probably prefer that you brush over the details as it's filled with inconsistencies and even contradicts itself at times.<br/><br/>Still, the ""gimmick"" central to the movie is actually pretty interesting and, as I'm a sucker for these kinds of things, I appreciated what mileage they managed to get out of it.

He sure is trying, and it really isn't all that bad for his first attempt.  The movie has some pretty interesting story developments and makes you think.  However, a lot of the time spent thinking is over the plot holes that just don't seem to make sense.<br/><br/>Evan Treborn suffers from a disease where he blacks out events of his life and can't remember them.  Through reading through the journals that he keeps Evan is somehow able to go back in time and change events.  His decisions later influence the future and how he and his friends turn out.  Apparently the changes only effect major events, as Evan can still go back to his blackouts after things have already been changed.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting science-fiction trip, but the story just fails to make sense sometimes.

","As an active member of the Internet Movie Database, I was anxious to watch this movie because I had read about it's good reviews; as a matter of fact, it had it's place in the best 250 films ever, although only for a short while (of course it is no longer there nor will it ever climb that high again)... but I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The clue to this film is that it brings an almost (almost) absolutely new script line, which -I must admit- get's you caught until the end.<br/><br/>The bad news are that the film has (in disgusting order): 1)Completely unnecessary rudeness and violence. I keep wondering how can it be possible that when I watch any film made 20 years ago, I do not have to worry about my little kids being around, while when I watch *any* present time film I do have to be extremely careful! 2)Serious script flaws. I'm not script flaw obsessive, but this one has HUGE script flaws.<br/><br/>3)(this one's local) Some imbecile-alike executive in South America took the liberty of discarding pan-scan/widescreen DVD aspect and leave *only* a 3/4 distorted old TV aspect ratio, resulting in silhouettes 1/4 higher like in that old English terror series of the '70s. Awful.<br/><br/>Anyway, -relax-, it's not a bad film.<br/><br/>Still it's a pity, because given this script to Stanley Kubrick it would have been resulted in a multiple Oscar winner (yes, I do know he's dead).<br/><br/>Director Adrian Lyne also, would have been astonishingly good in this line; as a matter of fact, his unique and never fairly appreciated ""Jacob's Ladder"" might be one of the only two films I know of, that resemble this one, only that ""Jacob's Ladder"" is simply a masterpiece (so this is the one film you should watch first in any case).<br/><br/>The other one is the (very complex but) great thriller ""Mulholland Dr."" by David Lynch (which you *will* have to watch at least twice)<br/><br/>The ending, however, is very good.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a 5/10 film; maybe a 6/10 one if you are happy the day you watch it, but that's it.

But there is an underlying issue with the film which just feels frustrating and very forced. It's definitely worth a watch as it is thought provoking, and it would be good to have your own opinion on it. But it is best not to go into this film expecting to see a masterclass.

This is primarily an intelligently executed drama where the time jump mechanism is used to highlight the dramatic consequences of people's lives from childhood to adulthood. It is an intriguing exploration of how people's personalities and life can be determined by the events of their childhood, environment and friends. The film then projects how people's lives drastically change from the ""butterfly effect"", i.e., when an element of the past is slightly change. As the film progresses, we are pulled by the scruff of your neck into a spiral dive towards hell with our flawed hero trying to ""fix"" things. With many twists and turns in the tunnel, the pace is quite relentless bringing us to what I feel is a superb, sad, clever but satisfying conclusion. The ending provokes different reactions so you may not feel about it the same way as I do but that is the film's power. I love time travel movies and this one is placed in my top 5.

","If you listen to those who follow the chaos theory than something like the flutter of a butterfly's wings can cause a ripple effect that could be catastrophic and that's the primary idea here in this film as someone keeps trying to change events by traveling back in time. Story is about Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) who by reading his journal entries can travel back to a certain time in his life when he was young. As a youngster Evan suffered from blackouts and was unable to remember things that he did and he's advised by his doctor and his mother Andrea (Melora Walters) to write his day to day life in journals.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Upon reading passages in his journals Evan travels back to when he was young and finding out what exactly happened during his blackouts but he discovers that when he tries to change things in the past it has repercussions that effect not only himself but his friends. The events in his childhood also changed the lives of his girlfriend Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart), her brother Tommy (William Lee Scott), and their friend Lenny Kagan (Elden Henson) so Evan continues to travel back and forth attempting to straighten everything out.<br/><br/>This is directed by both Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber and it comes from their script that has been kicking around Hollywood for years until Kutcher expressed interest in it and helped get it made. We have all seen our share of time travel flicks before and the reason they keep getting made is that the basic premise is always intriguing and it's hard not to be interested in a story like this. I think the jury is still out as to how good an actor Kutcher is but I have to admit that he's pretty good here and he keeps things moving even though the film is clearly too long. My main complaint about this film is that Kutcher time travels endlessly and there is so much flip flopping going on that it grows tiresome after awhile and it does test an audiences patience. The performances are all pretty good and Smart gets a rare chance to show her versatility as an actress as her character goes from a waitress to a sorority queen to a badly scarred drug addicted prostitute. As far as time travel films go this is of course nowhere near the classics ""The Time Machine"" or ""Time After Time"" but it is a fairly entertaining film that boasts an attractive cast and I guess you can call me gullible because I'm a sucker for these types of films."

Ashton Kutcher is a mediocre comedy actor, an he is totally unconvincing when trying to do serious acting.

","On December 10th (a day before I am writing this review) I had to watch this movie for the second time- just to make sure that it was still the best movie that I have seen all year.<br/><br/>It is.<br/><br/>By watching this the second time, it simply drove in the fact that this movie was as ingeniously put together as I originally thought.<br/><br/>Please, if you have never watched the film, do not be put off by its peculiar, seemingly mediocre beginning. I almost was, and I nearly missed a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I was expecting- as many of you reading this probably are, or were- something totally and utterly different. The trailers gave the impression that this would be yet another thoughtless slasher horror flick. Ashton Kutcher's presence in the movie did not help. I had never previously watched any of his movies, and you would hope that ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" was at least as good as ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"", but I have my doubts.<br/><br/>In this, however, Ashton Kutcher displayed for us his ability to both act in a serious role, and act in a serious role with excellence.<br/><br/>More importantly, this was not at all the bloody teen horror film that I expected, but an intricately sewn together thriller that was based (although loosely) on the theory after which it was named- The Butterfly Effect. This theory states that small events can have catastrophic effects- such as the flapping wings of a butterfly acting as the prerequisite to a hurricane.<br/><br/>Of course, you probably know the synopsis. After losing the woman that he loves, a man learns how to go back in time (no, I will not tell you how) and attempts to change the past, but each time he tries to change it, he ends up changing too much.<br/><br/>Apart from being deliciously entertaining, The Butterfly Effect helped to drive in something that I had always known, but never wanted to believe. As cheesy as it may sound, The Butterfly Effect has made me realize how important it is to be grateful for life exactly as it is. I will quote from the movie, ""There is no perfect. You can't change what people are without changing what they were."" And, ""You can't play God."" This movie does not fit into just one genre. It is a science fiction, a fantasy film, a romance, and a drama, all rolled into one. Some may think this makes it disjointed, but I believe that it gives the film a depth that so many others lack. At times it made me laugh, other times it made me cover my face with horror, but for the most part it always had me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I also cried when it ended- which despite me being a sappy female happens very seldomly with movies. Yes, it was just that moving.<br/><br/>Of course, I have my own opinions about what Evan should have done (the part of me that was in support of him changing things at all) but I will leave them to myself. What he should have done is not as important as what he does do. As a popular band once said, it is about the journey, not the end or the start.<br/><br/>Now, if you do not get the movie the first time, try watching it a second time. Doing that helped me, too, even though I got most of it on the first try, and it has helped other viewers as well.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must address the way this film is constantly compared to Donnie Darko and Memento- both of which I have seen before. The Butterfly Effect is not nearly as confusing as either of those, and the plot is radically different. Memento is played backwards for one, and Donnie Darko is sometimes more allegorical than it is literal and much darker a film than either one. They have almost nothing to do with each other in my opinion, apart from the fact that I liked all three, and that they do not follow the chronological patterns of your average movie.<br/><br/>There ends the similarity.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way? The movie really is very violent, and its R rating quite deserved. The violence, however, is not the focus of the film, so please do not allow this to deter you from watching the movie."

","We could only watch about the first thirty minutes of this movie, we stopped watching after the evil brother had burned a dog alive with lighter fluid in a burlap sack.

Perhaps we are wimps, but this movie is quite disturbing and not what we personally like to see. I'm sure it has appeal to those who are more jaded to the violence to which we have sadly become accustomed.<br/><br/>I find myself agreeing with the critics in panning this movie and cannot understand the viewpoints of those who find this movie watchable.

Watch the movie and make your decisions based on the movie as a whole, regardless of your personal feelings towards Kutcher.<br/><br/>While, I thought there were a couple things left unexplained, this movie was quite enjoyable to watch.

Years later, he tries to destroy something and goes back in time and that's how he ends up with the knife in his hand. But, that doesn't explain why he did that in the first place, unless he'd already been in the future.<br/><br/>Also, when he's in prison and is attempting to prove to his cell mate that he can change things, he goes back in time and slams his hands over spikes.

This is a movie in which a dog is doused with gasoline and burned to death; a young boy is choked repeatedly by his father, then his father is beaten to death before his eyes; two 7-year-old children are ordered to strip and have sex by a pedophile with a camera; and when the main character is sent to prison for murder, some skinheads develop a queer eye for the straight guy.

","I had the opportunity to see a preview of this film last week, and am glad I didn't have to pay for it. Overall, it's a great concept - probably was a fabulous script - but the execution is terrible.  I didn't expect great acting from Ashton Kutcher, but he's apparently studied under the Joey Tribianni school of acting (i.e., portray emotion by pretending you smell a fart) and probably didn't graduate. The special effects are nice, and there are some cool plot points - and others which are infuriatingly stupid and nonsensical.  (A 7 year old boy convinces a pedophile to stop his with four minutes of dialogue.  Yeah, right. Too bad the mental health community never tried that.)  Some of the most suspenseful moments are destroyed by bizarre acting choices, as when Ashton throws in a goofy run during what should be a highly dramatic and tension filled escape scene.  The audience I saw this with cracked up then - as they did at other unintentionally funny moments. Somehow I think the success of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise is to blame, but for me, slapstick is a distraction when I'm watching something pretending to be a serious suspense thriller.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an entertaining film about going back and changing the future, rent ""Groundhog Day"" or any of the ""Back to the Future"" films. In those, at least you are supposed to laugh, and your laughter won't be followed by a groan."

","There are those who say this movie has real 'brio' - whatever that's supposed to really mean. The bottom line is that nothing measures up. And although others say one is not supposed to regard this movie as science fiction, this is exactly what it is - what it is supposed to be. And it does win a science fiction award or two. And as for those who so opine, let's just say it's their relatively low IQ coupled with their total lack of understanding that they're so singularly untalented. There are no extra points for being a nerd when it comes to this one.<br/><br/>Not to say the movie isn't executed in a professional manner. From the direction to the acting everything is well done with Smart being the outstanding one on screen.<br/><br/>But to the story itself. Naturally you're not supposed to understand what's going on initially, and it is this desire to figure out what you're watching that leads you on.<br/><br/>And when you finally understand what oversimplified plot prop the writers are using you find yourself blurting out 'ridiculous' over and over again.<br/><br/>The difficulty with this one is that it has pretensions of being so much at once - and of course that the writers have a predilection for lots of unsavoury things - so for that matter if you're experiencing an unsettled stomach you might want to try an episode of The Simpsons instead (and it will probably work better as science fiction too).<br/><br/>If you're going to get into subtleties like chaos theory then you'd better think through things better.

They have notebooks there and we'll buy one. And no matter people use computers today to jot things down - as do the campus cretins in the movie - we're going to write an entry about on this evening having seen this movie.<br/><br/>And then we'll concentrate on the page, and concentrate real hard, and then suddenly everything around us will go a big blur and we'll hear lots of pseudo-impressive 'dts' sounds, and in the end we will never have seen this waste of time at all."
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","5","6","12","13 November 2004"," Flashbacks, Disturbing Sequences
","""The Butterfly Effect"", to my understanding, is attempting to achieve an effect of consternation, calamity, and ""flash-forwarding through time"", and for its credit, makes a good presentation in displaying the confusion, curiosity, and self-discovery of Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), through some of the most gritty, dizzying, and even maddening editing to ever be approved for film. This is a troubled story about a troubled soul, seeking to alter his troubled life through somehow ""rewriting his own history"". Sounds quite confusing and maybe preposterous? Well, add this seemingly inane plot to the consternation of some terribly giddy editing and include some really bizarre characters such as Evan's Gothic friend Lenny (Elden Henson), and ""The Butterfly Effect"" is virtually nothing more than a series of constant, confusing flashbacks, brazen plot and character development (why is Evan the way he is, what is the logic behind his ""unworldly epiphany""?), and a puzzling and maddening roller-coaster of editing. The purpose of Evan as a child becoming a narrator for the events at hand remains to be untold: the little boy, chronicling Evan's revisions in his journal as he reconfronts various experiences, should have merely played those experiences out, rather than analyze every tumultuous detail of his existence! This movie really offered an intriguing plot: time-warping, revising periods of blackouts and reliving and correcting certain inadequacies in life, and this would have been perfectly enjoyable entertainment, if the plot, editing, and story were coherent enough to not come across as merely disturbing and zany! Perhaps the story has a profoundly larger message that can only be conceived by the most curious and attentive of spectators who view it, yet as far as I am concerned, ""The Butterfly Effect"" offers little more than confusion, delirium, and one head-splitting headache... *1/2 out of ****"
"jcanettis","6","6","12","1 November 2004"," Good Idea, Complicated Implementation
","""The Butterfly Effect"" is not a typical movie. With its weird story, its many and sometimes difficult to follow plot twists, its dark and depressing atmosphere, it definitely is a film which can be described as ""different"". But is it also good?<br/><br/>The answer to the above question is not easy. The idea that the ""TBF"" plays with is clever, that's for sure: The story is about Evan Treborn (Kutcher), a boy who faces mysterious memory black-outs when faced with unhappy events. Doctors attribute this to stress, although his mother (Walters) suspects that this might be related to his hospitalized father's mental illness. Things get really nasty though, when a mischief conducted by him, his friend Kay (Smart), her brother Tommy (Scott), and their friend Lenny (Henson), goes really awry. This event makes the life of everyone take a dramatic turn, but the problem is that Evan (and the viewer), have no clue of what happened due to a black-out he faced. Then suddenly after many years, Evan discovers that there is a way to reveal his lost memories; however, this brings some unintended and strange side-effects...<br/><br/>If this sounds a bit confusing, then rest assured that it is much more complicated than that; in fact, the main weakness of the film is that although it is based on a very good idea, the scenario gets too complicated and over-stretched. If it was kept a bit ""lighter"", then I would sure grade the movie 2 notches higher in the 10-point grade scale than the 6/10 grade I have given it.<br/><br/>The performances are more than satisfactory, especially if you take into account the fact that there are no grand names involved. So is the direction, despite the difficulty posed by the frequent flash-backs and twists that are required by the scenario.<br/><br/>In brief, the film is overall OK, but had the potential for meeting even higher expectations."

","Got a sneak preview of this flick on January 21st.  Seeing it for free never hurts the review.<br/><br/>
This movie is good.  The performances for the most part are pretty strong. With the one exception towards the end of the movie when Ashton asks the doctor for his notebooks in an intense voice but doesn't pull it off and just sounds like goofy kelso acting angry.  For the most part, Ashton's acting wasn't that bad.  To be honest I expected much worse and therefore wasn't that disappointed.<br/><br/>
The movie also started to get ridiculous when Ashton started using his time travel power capriciously.  All he needed to do was be able to just see his old writing on a piece of paper and BAM he was instantly in a trance and into time travel mode.  This was a little silly in the jail sequence when he runs into the cell, grabs the notebook, reads a few words as the goons are chasing and BAM, like a magic spell he is warped out of there.....<br/><br/>So in short, the screenplay is average with some pieces of the plot a bit too contrived.<br/><br/>The director did a great job.  The camera work and editing and sound effects were excellent.  Simple conversations that turned really intense shocked the viewers as they should.<br/><br/>And the acting is good, with Ashton doing a decent job and the rest of the cast doing very well I might add (the guy who played Tommy needs a bit more polish to be believable).<br/><br/>So overall, a good but not great movie."

","The Butterfly Effect starts as seven year old Evan (Logan Lerman) suffers from strange black-outs just like his institutionalised father Jason (Callum Keith Rennie), his friend Kayleigh's (Sarah Widdows) father forces the two to engage in a paedophile video & he abuses both Kayleigh & her brother Tommy. Six years later & the three decide to play a prank on a woman by making Lenny put some dynamite in a mail box, unfortunately the prank goes terribly wrong & a woman & her baby daughter dies in the explosion. Things go from bad to worse as guilt tears the four friends apart, eventually Evan & his mom leave the area. Seven years later & Evan (Ashton Kutcher) goes to college & is studying human memory & uses his own experiences to aid him, while reading from one of his childhood journals Evan travels back in time to relive the point during which he had a black-out & discovers that he is able to change the future. However while trying to create the perfect future for himself & his friends he only succeeds in making things worse...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber this is an odd little film that sort of defies explanation or any attempt to pigeon hole it as it's unlike any other film I have seen or heard about. Originally released as a 110 minute film a 'Director's Cut' was subsequently released on home video which is longer & most notably changes the ending, while I will be basing my comment on the theatrical version I have actually seen the alternate ending & although slightly darker in tone & not as 'happy' I don't think it makes a massive difference & could come across as a bit silly too with an unborn foetus committing suicide a bit much. Anyway, the film is a surprising mix of sci-fi, drama, romance & thriller with heavy emphasis on the drama. You could say that The Butterfly Effect is a darker variation on the romantic time travel/alternate time-line comedy Sliding Doors (1998) but with a much more gritty & downbeat tone as every successive attempt Evan makes to try & change the future for the better makes thing worse for himself &/or his friends. The film is a little slow going at places & the changing time-line plot gets a bit old by the fourth or fifth time it's used, in the end though I suppose the point that The Butterfly Effect is trying to make & the one which Evan finally realises is that once you change something you can never go back to the way things were before & in a nutshell that's what the film is about. The ending is also quite poignant as Evan realise the problem isn't anyone or anything else, it's himself & the only way to rectify things is to distance himself from everyone he has ever cared for & it's these dramatic revelations that the film with either sink or swim for you, if you find the plot compelling & the character's engaging then there's a fair chance you will enjoy this.<br/><br/>Not much, if any, explanation is given to the actual time travel process here which may be an issue for some but the plot & character's are both strong enough in my opinion to sustain ones attention. The butterfly effect itself obviously is a reference to the chaos theory & that the flap of a butterfly's wings on one side of the world can cause a hurricane on the other. More of a drama with sci-fi elements there no real effects scenes or anything that violent. The film playing at the cinema is Se7en (1995) & the odd clip is seen.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $13,000,000 this was shot in Canada this was one of the most read unproduced scripts doing the rounds in Hollywood & it took the presence of Kutcher to get the thing made. The acting is alright but nothing special & this is the type of film where it needs to be great & not just alright.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect requires you to put some effort in watching it & while it can come across as a somewhat dull drama at times there's enough going on to warrant a watch. Followed by The Butterfly Effect 2 (2006) & The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations (2009)."

","This movie has so much unfair bashing, and negativity surrounding it, it makes me sick. If you're the kind of person who will automatically hate a movie because of logical errors in the plot, you should not watch this movie. That is the exact reason why mainstream critics should be completely ignored. People should also give Ashton Kutcher a chance. He CAN act, as he proves in this. Unfortunately, his presence must have also contributed to the critical failure.<br/><br/>The film follows Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffers a traumatic childhood alongside his friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), her brother Tommy, and the insecure Lenny. Evan turns out better than any of them when they are adults, because at all the most horrifying moments, Evan would black out and have no idea of what just happened. This prompts him to keep journals about everything he does. When Evan is in college however, he reads his journal, and experiences a memory he lost as a kid. He discovers that by reading the journals, he can possess his childhood self, and stop such horrible things from happening. His quest to fix his present begins when a traumatized Kayleigh commits suicide. Evan starts going back to his most upsetting memories, and changes them. Unfortunately, the things he does in order to prevent the tragedies have a ripple effect over time, and when Evan returns to the future, he often discovers that his present is far worse than what he was trying to prevent. <br/><br/>The story is loaded with plot holes, but don't worry about it. If you have an open mind, and don't nitpick, you can highly enjoy this movie. It's a shame that Ashton Kutcher's presence doomed the film, as the performances are all brilliant. I actually cared about his character, and felt that he did well at showing emotion during the sad parts. When he tells the hooker version of Amy Smart that she was once happy with him, I nearly cried (one of the few things in a film to ever do that to me). And while I can't help but find Ashton to be rather humorous in his comedies, I think he's far better in this film than any of his comedies. Amy Smart is outstanding in this. She is not only stunningly beautiful, but she is a comforting presence in this movie, a voice of reason among all the insanity. Her character is very likable, and would definitely be worth all the sadness and pain that Ashton goes through to save her from sadness.<br/><br/>My only complaint with this movie, is that it feels a need to include many gratuitous, unnecessary elements of extremely harsh subject matter, only for the sake of being cool. I couldn't care less about stuff like that normally, but I felt that few shocking elements (prison rape, child porn, various sex scenes) were totally unnecessary, and just thrown in there to make people go ""wow"" this is a cool movie, and make teenagers enjoy it more. Ashton Kutcher endures a childhood worse than nearly any child you could imagine. Kids constantly endure life-changing tragedies but Ashton is molested, witnesses his dad get beaten to death by prison guards, sees his dog get burned alive, and even becomes an accessory to manslaughter. The rampant grimness diminishes the believability, but the entertainment value remains intact.<br/><br/>If you forget the plot holes, the logical errors, and random shock scenes, you'll enjoy this fun film. Plot holes don't matter, the film is a thrilling suspense ride that will keep you guessing non- stop, and will keep you glued to your seat until the credits roll. I award the film 10/10.<br/><br/>It is very correctly rated R for Violence, Sexual Content, Language, and Brief Drug Use. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 8/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 5/10"

They all live in a special little town where everyone except the main character's mother and his therapist seem to be psychotic or sympathetic to the drek they are acting in. The scene of animal abuse drove us out, simulated or not, it did nothing to further the plot, and caused nothing but revulsion.

It's hard to get into the specifics of the plot without spoiling the experience, so I will simply say that this is one movie anyone who has ever thought about how great it would be to change their past should see.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is a rare breed of cinema, which is not nearly as Hollywood as the movie poster might lead you to believe. This film is dark and gritty, almost hard to watch at times. The first thirty minutes is unlike anything you'll find in 99% of films in America which receive major release. Of all the traumatic childhood events I've seen movie characters in turmoil over, these are the only ones I've ever really bought.<br/><br/>But by far this film's greatest aspect is it's story, which unfolds similar to Memento. No we're not watching everything backwards, but  seeing bits and pieces that come together later. Much like the memories of the main character played by Ashton Kutcher.<br/><br/>Kutcher has caught a lot of grief from the critics about his performance in this film, but I couldn't disagree more. Quite frankly, I couldn't picture anyone else more fitting. While his acting may still not be ""Oscar Worthy,"" I think its safe to say he owned this role and has at least earned himself one new fan.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 4 out of 4 Stars"

","The Butterfly Effect is one of the most innovative, the most shocking, and one of the very few movies that I've had to watch twice to make sure I understood what I jut watched. It's a love story, a personal drama, and a thriller all in one. The main story in my opinion, and the most effective one had to be the love story. Evan's childhood at the start of the movie had to be some of the most disturbing stuff I have ever seen, I mean they really pushed it. It's been a long time coming, since I felt that squirmy in my seat, not only that the kid actors completely blew me away. What amazed me most about the movie, and there was a lot of amazing stuff, but I would have to say Ashton Kutcher's performance was the most remarkable, considering he didn't really have any prior serious acting experience. The point I think about Butterfly Effect is this. Leave your life the way it is, accept what has happened in your life, because if you try to change past occurrences in your life, you'll just be more of a mess, so you should try to move on with your own.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!. If you don't wanna be spoiled, don't read any further.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut Vs The Theatrical Version.<br/><br/>The Theatrical Cut. This is probably my favorite version. I liked The Director's Cut version, but this ending seemed more fitting. When Evan sees Kayleigh in the end, you sense hope, you get happiness wondering if things will work out in the end, after all it gave us a nice sense of hope. I also thought it flowed a little better.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut. Very good, but a little bit too dark at times, and a tad overlong. I thought the ending was excellent, but I'm a sucker for happy endings, therefore I'm partial to the Theatrical Cut, I didn't like the thought of Evan not existing, though even though he's not meant to be.<br/><br/>Performances. Ashton Kutcher has grown up here, it's evident. His performance blew me away, and the fact that he had no serious acting experience prior to this, makes it even more remarkable. He is the heart of the film, and he did a wonderful job. Amy Smart is absolutely gorgeous, and does excellent as Kayleigh. Her multi layered performances are extraordinary. From the country club girl, to the drugged up prostitute, to the haunted girl working in a basically abandon cafÃ©, she was terrific. Elden Henson best known as Fulton from The Mighty Ducks, gives great performance as Lenny, I liked his soft side the most, though he did great as a loony too. John Patrick Amedori did excellent as the 13 Yr old Evan. His range or his age was phenomenal, I loved his performance. Kevin G. Schmidt|13 yr old Lenny| and Jesse James|13 yr old Tommy| were both phenomenal and intense. Eric Stoltz is great as the pedophile father, then again he excels at these roles. Melora Walters is good as Evan's mom, though she had her off moments.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Butterfly Effect is officially one of my favorite movies. Butterfly Effect shows the viewer that going back in time, isn't all fun and games, and shows the bad side of it all as well. It really is a brilliant film, and dare I say a masterpiece?. Go see it, I would put it on your films to see soon list, immediately!.<br/><br/>10/10"

""The Butterfly Effect"" makes the world poorer in spirit and likely will provide misery for those too weak to avoid it.<br/><br/>I once saw a nice film, ""Flowers for Algernon"" and though it has been a while, once I'd hit the eject button on the player and thrown the ""Butterfly"" DVD across the room, I wish there were something better immediately to help cleanse my thoughts. I don't believe in censorship, however, I'd never want my children or those I love to be exposed to this crummy idiotic film."
"fiteni07","8","4","8","10 January 2005"," the director's cut was much better
","I really thought this movie was underrated because no one wants to take Ashton kutcher seriously. I feel that critics were waiting for him to fail in this movie. I did not see the movie until it was out on video and was shocked by how much I liked Butterfly Effect. It was a good movie that made you think. But the Director's cut was much much better. I thought it made it a more unique movie and kept you thinking even after the movie was over. I think it would have done much better if they stuck to the director's cut. The theater cut ending was very typical Hollywood ending and took away the point of the ""butterfly effect""."
"Theo Robertson","7","5","11","10 June 2007"," More Enjoyable Than That Other Similar Time Travelling Film
","It seems that word of mouth has affected peoples' enjoyment of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT with many comments reflecting bitter disappointment . In many ways these feelings sum up what happened when I saw DONNIE DARKO , a similar type of movie featuring teen angst and time travel . The main difference though was that I'd heard all the lavishing praise thrown at DARKO while I'd had no knowledge of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT until the credits started on Channel 4 last night <br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece of course but many of the complaints can be dismissed that it's utterly depressing featuring scenes of animal cruelty , sex , violence etc but would you have preferred a film with Michael J Fox going back to 1950s High School ? Much of the film works simply because protagonist Evan finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place and despite the criticisms of casting Ashton Kutcher by some people you really can believe that a good looking pretty boy would find them self popular in prison for the wrong reasons <br/><br/>The screenplay by Gruber and Bress does raise an interesting point that destiny will always win out in changing the past . You might be able to stop a bad thing happening to someone but you'll never stop something else terrible happening to you or someone close to you by changing a big bad event . The plot might be full of mystic mumbo jumbo but it's a film that is much easier to follow than DONNIE DARKO which makes it a superior film"

","I was *thoroughly* disappointed by this movie. I went (vicariously, of course) through all this horrifying abuse -- sexual, physical, mental, perpetrated on children, no less, by a FATHER -- and it was all for nothing.<br/><br/>The author doesn't even end up following the premise; whoever wrote it has no clue about the butterfly effect. Going back to give himself stigmata? Just sneezing -- as opposed to violent self-mutilating -- that he hadn't done the first go-around would've landed him in an entirely different place, not to mention already having the stigmata precluding their use as appearing-out-of-nowhere proof. Ugh. The 2 main characters' acting/screen presences, and maybe the mom's, are the only reason I didn't give the movie a 1. I guess it's nice to have an *attempt* at intelligent entertainment, but the lack of understanding of how the butterfly effect works, coupled with all the hell the characters endure, plus the depressing ending (don't misunderstand me -- sad endings are fine, even necessary [example: Peter Jackson betrayed us and Tolkein in an otherwise almost perfect adaption by crapping up Eowyn's resolution, suggesting that he didn't understand her at all -- but that's for another review!]) make this movie a miserable waste of time, compounded by the fact that it had such promise. VERY disappointing."

","I really wanted to love this film.  As it was, it was alright, but it could have been much better.  First of all, there was some serious acting issues in the film.  Ashton wasn't so bad, but other parts of the cast, like his mom, really was.  The story was cool, but there were some really forced plot points in the beginning, and in the very end which hurts the film.  It seems to me that the makers had this great idea, and knew in general what they wanted to do, but needed a quick way out because they just couldn't figure out what else to do.  All of the plot problems could have easily been solved though with just a little reworking.  No other real major complaints, and fairly enjoyable."

","This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The cast does a great job changing their personalities for their characters for each of the alternative timelines. The connection between all the characters is very believable and makes viewers fell in love with the characters very easy and even hate others. And even if you totally hate one of the characters you will totally forget that you hated that character after Evan changes his past and making the present much different. But probably the thing I like the most about the movie is that it has so many alternate times and each of the characters act in a different way depending in how their past is changed. Also I like that it makes you even care about Evan's problems with his life, and that keeps you engaged through the whole movie, and it makes you hope that he finds a way to make things right, and even at the end that he makes his mind to just move on and stay away from the girl the loves in order to save her it makes you wish that he actually managed to stay with her at the end."

","This is a great movie everyone should see, not because it's perfect, but because the message of the movie is very deep and powerful if you are receptive to it.<br/><br/>In the movie the protagonist has a ""gift"", but in reality it represents a gift that all human beings have. In real life it's not so supernatural or dramatic like how its portrayed in the movie, but pretty much the same thing. The gift is that ultimately we have the ability create our own reality through our choices on how we perceive it, the movie focuses on the pitfalls of using that ability. The protagonists' mistake is he can't accept the past, and keeps trying to control other people. Only when he lets go, and when he is willing to sacrifice his immediate desires, and instead use his wisdom to make a choice that he knows will create the greatest good for the most people in his life, does his world end up in a harmonious state.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was kind of disappointing at first, it's kind of ambiguous and open-ended, I wanted a happy ending. But for this kind of movie, perhaps an open-ended ending is best.<br/><br/>Read some Darryl Anka and Esther Hicks books and then watch this movie and make the connections, it will blow your mind!"
"abhay168","8","2","3","3 January 2009"," excellent n intelligent...............stop crying your heart out
","For a Start Aston Kutcher does a surprisingly good job in this role, easily his best film to date (although that alone is not really a good reason to watch this) The Butterfly Effect starts actually in the early stages of each character's life, which I think is effective. You don't really see Ashton Kutcher or Amy Smart until about 30 minutes into the movie, and just when you think the movie won't get any more sick and twisted... you figure out what's ACTUALLY going on during Evan's childhood blackouts.<br/><br/>Every character is built from the ground up, and they maintain true to the plot, even if their roles get switched up a bit.<br/><br/>Some might say that special effects weren't really needed for this movie, but its the special effects that make this all believable.<br/><br/>Every actor in this movie pulls off their parts just right (I feel sorry for the kid that plays Tommy.. I won't throw a spoiler - see it!), and they all come together to make a masterpiece. I was surprised this movie got so many bad reviews.<br/><br/>If you throw the fact that time-travel isn't possible, and that there will always be obvious plot holes in a movie such as this one, and are ready for an emotional roller coaster (you'll either cry or grimace about twice the amount of times you crack a smile), go see this beautiful movie."

"bowmanblue","9","1","1","19 April 2020"," Surprisingly deep sci-fi
","'The Butterfly Effect' may not be remembered as one of the all-time great science fiction films - probably because it's (a) not an epic blockbuster with wall-to-wall action (b) limited star power and (c) contains a bit of a mind-bending plot that isn't necessarily as easy to follow as some of the other sci-fi films that deal with time travel. Therefore, I guess it was always destined for more of a 'niche' audience. Luckily, it's developed a reasonable cult status - and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Normally, when I write a review I tend to use the second paragraph to give a brief summary of the film. However, I really do think that if I say too much I may give away a 'spoiler' that may well ruin your enjoyment of the film. You could say it's a love story which involves time travelling and one man's (Ashton Kutcher) attempts to right various wrongs of the past - and the consequences which messing with time brings about.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's science fiction, but not overly so. There are no trips to space age futures or flying cars and a fair proportion of the 'whys' of how time travel is possible isn't really explained. You just have to go with it. If someone walked in halfway through the film they could be forgiven for thinking it was a 'teen love story,' but just because a relationship between Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart is paramount to the overall narrative, don't think it's a 'date movie' or will ever get too soppy for a guy's taste. In fact - quite the opposite - it's pretty damn dark!<br/><br/>I know that Kutcher has a bit of a reputation for more goofy comedic roles, but here he plays it straight well and it's a pity he didn't take more parts like this as he's quite capable of headlining a film like this, yet these days he's pretty much dropped off the radar (as has Amy Smart!).<br/><br/>It's probably a little longer than your average film, but there's a lot to it and, although much of the marketing for this movie centres on Kutcher and Smart, at least a third is spent in the company of their younger incarnations (who are all nicely believable and not at all annoying as some child actors can be!).<br/><br/>Ignore what you may think of Ashton Kutcher (or 'MR Demi Moore' as he's normally heralded as). He holds the film together and there's definitely chemistry between him and Amy Smart. The plot is never a rollercoaster/action epic - it's far deeper and brings up areas of the genre designed to make you think. Definitely worth a watch when you're in the mood for a deep-dark-dive into time travel (just make sure you get the 'director's cut' - I hear the ending is very different in other versions and not half as good)."

I recommend the director's cut, which may be too disturbing for theaters which was why it is only available on DVD, but it's better than the regular version in my opinion.<br/><br/>And there's great acting all around. I was surprised at Kutcher's performance, being so accustomed to seeing him play the stereotypical dumb guy in THAT SEVENTIES SHOW for all those years. But I have heard that he is actually very smart in real life. Eric Stoltz gives a great performance also, as always. Don't waste your time with the sequels though, as they were just made cheaply in order to capitalize on the success of this one. But the first one is top notch. Recommend."
"Bored_Dragon","8","1","1","3 January 2019"," Event Reborn
","Someone in my FB movie group recently mentioned this movie and I couldn't recall it in my memory, so I went to take a look at my own review. But there wasn't one. When I saw it again, I understood why I didn't write anything after the previous watching. I had to sleep on it, for impressions to settle, before I was able to evaluate it, even subjectively.<br/><br/>""It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world."" - Chaos Theory<br/><br/>And in essence, this is the basis of the film's plot. Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who finds a way to change the details of his own past, thus completely changing the present and the future. Unfortunately, every time he fixes one thing, he simultaneously messes up something else, embroiling himself in playing God more and more.<br/><br/>It's fun to watch actors from your favorite series (""That '70s Show"", ""Daredevil"", ""My name is Earl""...) all together in the same movie. When actors go from film to film, there is not enough time to connect them closely with the characters they interpret, as is the case with actors who interpret the character in the series from episode to episode for many seasons. And when they appear in a movie, after we've watched them for years as the same characters in a series, it is a bit strange. And when there are more such actors in the same movie... confusing.<br/><br/>For its relatively small $ 13 million budget, the film is technically great, the acting is good, and the story keeps your attention from start to finish. I mostly like the fact that the film has a mindfak charm, although it's not one, because everything's pretty much clear all the time. There are four alternative endings and both times I saw ""director's cut"", which has the most striking finale. I don't want to write spoilers, but if you saw or will see this version, pay attention to the relation between the scene where Ashton's mother tells him that she had a few miscarriages and the way our protagonist resolves the whole situation. When my brain linked these two things, the entire movie significantly gained strength.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The Butterfly Effect is about regrets, and the closing sequences emphasize this. The film is engrossing enough to minimize such misgivings, however; few who enjoy unconventional pictures and see The Butterfly Effect will regret the experience. This is a compelling and intriguing movie that toys with the powers of choice and chance in a way that is not overused. Sure, there are plot holes (some of which are quite substantial), but most of them don't become apparent until long after the end credits have rolled and the film is being analyzed in a post-screening discussion. The ending is a cheat, and Ashton Kutcher is perhaps not the best choice for the lead role. Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is a good film."

I was surprised how perfectly he managed to express the changes Evan went through. Great acting and thrilling plot would deserve 8/10 rating if it was not for the plot hole that disappointed me at the end.

"basilisksamuk","8","1","1","29 March 2013"," In which I am impressed by an actor unknown to me
","I nearly didn't get past the first five minutes of this film. All I knew about it was that it involved time travel so I really didn't understand why the first thing you see is a paraphrased quote about chaos theory. The butterfly effect when used in conjunction with time travel is entirely different to the butterfly effect when used in chaos theory.<br/><br/>However, I went on to enjoy this time travel fable in which the main character, Evan, keeps going back in time to try and change the future for the better. The characters were well established by showing the younger versions in extended scenes first, making them more believable. The increasing desperation of Evan as each attempt makes things worse effectively increases the tension and there are some clever devices, lighting and set dressing etc., which effectively code the different realities. You have to accept that the time travel mechanism is just magic but then every time travel portrayal relies on some bogus explanation. If that's going to hang you up then don't bother with any time travel film, ever. It's only a metaphor in any case and done more honestly here than in other films; say, The Time Traveller's Wife, for example.<br/><br/>And just to show how hilariously out of touch I am with some aspects of modern culture I was very impressed by the acting of what I took to be a bunch of unknowns. It was only afterwards that I discovered Ashton Kutcher is apparently well known. I can therefore honestly say I was not affected by knowing anything about him beforehand. As far as I'm concerned he did a good job with this."
"htmidas","8","1","1","4 December 2012"," Remarkably Compelling, Though Less Than Perfect
","I was ready to review this movie with a 10 out of 10 after seeing it for the first time, but I knew I should sit back and think about it for a bit before I did - and I was right, my thoughts are somewhat different now that I've had time to process.<br/><br/>I still think The Butterfly Effect is pretty fantastic. It gets at some pretty heavy stuff - it's difficult to watch at some parts - but that's what hits you and stays with you and really makes you think, because it explores psychology and human nature, more specifically how what people experience as kids affects the rest of their lives. Though using chaos theory's butterfly effect as the title and premise might be slightly misguided (the butterfly effect suggests that infinitesimal changes in initial conditions result in completely different outcomes, which is not exactly what happens), the idea that this film develops is still an interesting one.<br/><br/>Evan, our title character, has a chance to go back and change specific moments in his life - moments he recognizes as pivotal - in order to change the future into something better, but each time he changes something, there are unforeseen consequences that alter the future for the worst. Despite the multiple futures he writes for himself, however, certain things remain constant: for instance, he always ends up at the same college. Most importantly, the four kids who form a somewhat dysfunctional group of friends in the first timeline gravitate towards one another in other timelines, even when they don't become friends as children. In the endings where Evan doesn't erase himself completely, he and Lenny are roommates, and when Evan and Kayleigh pass each other on the street, she seems to recognize him.<br/><br/>A note on endings, because there are four (two main ones), and whichever one you see colors your view of the film: I'm glad that they didn't go with the ""you're in a mental hospital, it's all a hallucination"" cop-out, although that would have accounted for plot inconsistencies I mention later (if it was ""all in his head"", the fact that some things don't make sense would... make sense?). I definitely got the feeling that they weren't quite sure what to do at the end if not the ""nothing's real"" route, though. I didn't know what the movie was leading up to, or where it SHOULD go, and after watching the theatrical ending and then the other three, nothing is really satisfying, although the director's cut comes the closest.<br/><br/>What adds a worthwhile layer to this already complex film is the shift in Evan's priorities that leads to him accidentally killing 7-year-old Kayleigh. Up until that point, every trip back in time was to save Kayleigh, or to undo Lenny's emotional trauma, or to set Tommy on the right path. When he ends up in a future with no arms and no romantic relationship with Kayleigh, everyone else is happy - but he is miserable. In his mind, saving Kayleigh and being with Kayleigh have become inseparable goals, and when he learns that this mom has lung cancer, he is almost relieved, jumping immediately to the conclusion that his accident caused her chain smoking. This gives him an excuse to go back and ""fix things,"" which backfires catastrophically. Kayleigh's death is a wake-up call. He finally understands what his father tried to tell him: he can't play God, especially for his own selfish reasons.<br/><br/>The actors who play the characters' younger selves (particularly 13-year-old Tommy) are superb, and Ashton Kutcher - who I didn't realize had ever been in a serious movie (I would feel bad for how typecast he is except that he's fabulously wealthy) - is actually quite good as well. Evan is a very likable character, and you really care for all the people whose lives intersect with his.<br/><br/>There are some plot inconsistencies that didn't bother me upon first viewing but kind of bother me now. How does Evan convince Carlos of his powers? If he goes back and gives himself those scars, his entire history should be rewritten; though the scars would seem to appear to him, Carlos would remember them being there. Also, what was the point of having the blackouts if he can actually go back to any point in his past, even if he remembers it? However, overall, this was a film that moved me. It left me saying ""wow"" (albeit feeling temporarily depressed), and it's kept me thinking long after the credits rolled. It's not for the faint of heart, but for the mature audience this is definitely a worthwhile watch."

I felt as if in the end.. you could sort of decide yourself which part of Evan's memory was real and which was imaginary. I like films with something psychologically out of the ordinary and this wad interesting. The acting wasn't bad but what the hell was the point of the fat goth guy? Seriously?

How it got such a low rating from critics I am still not sure.<br/><br/>The IMDb rating is much more accurate - it's a good film and this is reflected in the score.<br/><br/>The plot it very well done, thought-provoking, original and I found it entertaining.<br/><br/>**Spoilers** <br/><br/>If you have watched the film and don't understand it. the following might help: <br/><br/>The reason Ashton Kutcher's character blacks out is because those moments in his life - as a child - haven't happened yet. They only happen for the first time (for his conscious mind) when he comes back to those moments through his journals in the future.<br/><br/>The way he acts in those early moments of his life, sometimes alter his life drastically - such as when he ends up as a frat boy, or not much such as the cigarette burn and the stigmata when in prison. The film works on Chaos theory. The whole idea is that it is very unpredictable. Every time he goes back he makes changes that he hopes will be change his future life for the better - but rarely does it end up that way.<br/><br/>You could argue a minor plot flaw is that the number of times he can go back to a time he blacked out as a child in unlimited. So he could (in theory) just go back to the same point every time and keep trying until it worked out the way he wanted. However, that wouldn't be at all entertaining for us as the audience.<br/><br/>It was revealed when he ends up with no limbs that she and her brother stayed with their abusive father (rather than their mother) as children because she didn't want to move away from him. After hearing this he decides at the end that staying away from Amy Smart's character is the only way he can protect her and ensure her brother doesn't end up a total psychopath.<br/><br/>When he ends up in a reality he can accept he burns his journals so he can't travel back in time due to the problems he suffered when doing so.<br/><br/>There is also an alternative ending to this movie.<br/><br/>If there are other elements you don't understand check the FAQ for this film on IMDb and there is a full explanation here: http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/butterflyeffect.html"

After heading off to college, he begins to have the blackouts again. Evan soon realizes he has the ability to alter reality through time-travel. <br/><br/>Directors / writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber created quite a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie here. It makes you think about your actions in life and the sort of repercussions they have on those around us. It's a disturbing reminder that the things we say and do really affect people. <br/><br/>This was Ashton Kutcher's first real dramatic leading role and he handled it well. It can be hard to push the image of an actor's character out of your mind if it gets stuck in there. I think Kutcher's biggest obstacle was getting audiences to see him as anyone but Michael Kelso from ""That 70s Show"" at the time. He succeeded in my opinion. <br/><br/>http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html"

","I watched this movie in 7/2012 and I have to say that this goes into my list for one of the most underrated movies. The movie has a cinematography of a teen movie which is why people underestimated it, but it worked toward this film's advantage because the audience can overlook the flaws in the premises of this film and start enjoying the what if scenarios that follows. Once you accept the basic premises, the movie is incredibly fun and at more than one occasion clever in their use of this foundation. I think Aston Kutcher was probably not the most perfect actor for this role, but he definitely fits nicely into the character he's portraying. In my opinion, this movie came out when CGI was all the craze in Hollywood cinema and people couldn't see past the lower production quality to see the brilliance in storyline. This movie is definitely unique and deserves more praise than 99% of the predictable all-flash-no-bang movies Hollywood has put out in the past decade."

","I have long been searching for a first-class film and thankfully, my pursuit has not proved to be futile. This was by far one of the best pieces ever created in the film industry, and here's why; The plot was original and the dialogue flowed throughout the film's course. Every character was portrayed with flawlessness and the directing was done with perfect execution.<br/><br/>I remember watching this movie as a kid, I remember liking it. And even though it is seldom that I re-watch a movie, I just knew this one was in dire need of a second look.<br/><br/>It was very refreshing to see Ashton Kutcher in a serious role for a change, one where he depended on his ability to connect with the audience rather than solely relying on his charisma and wittiness to earn our admiration. This is without a doubt his finest work to date, and it is quite saddening that he has chosen to selectively pursue comedy roles when he is obviously a talented young man. The butterfly effect definitely showed us a side of him we haven't been given a chance to see before, which I doubt we'll get another glimpse of in the future.<br/><br/>The film grabbed my attention from the get-go, and never did it fail to lose it – it kept me interested with every scene.<br/><br/>And unsurprisingly, this film was produced in 2004, back when films had a hardcore story line – it is quite heartbreaking that the quality of movies has severely deteriorated since then.<br/><br/>This film is well worth the watch, and it leaves you with the satisfying thought that maybe ""everything does happen for a reason"" and that even though we may contemplate the past and ponder on how things might've ended up differently had we made different choices, it wouldn't necessarily be ""for the better"". For you see, life and all of its consequences are tightly linked by a series of events and should one of those incidents become somehow altered, it leads us to a downward spiral and ultimately, another life. We may strongly believe that fate is not on our side, but somehow, it always comes together eventually.<br/><br/>There was a prevailing message in the film about how sometimes the only thing we can do is to let someone go, and how every now and again we are faced with situations where we have to make the tough decision of being selfless for the sake of others.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"fdm25892","8","1","1","13 January 2012"," Surprisingly Brilliant
","What a surprise this was! Having not seen any previous reviews or heard any opinions on ""The Butterfly Effect"", I was expecting a low budget, churned out B-movie with a mediocre cast and a boring story. What I got was the total opposite! The cast are superb in this non-stop thriller and each actor displays their versatility since their personalities change with each alternate reality. The story had me gripped from the very beginning and is so spectacularly clever that it is damn near impossible to pick any holes in it. <br/><br/>What surprised me most was Ashton Kutcher as the desperate protagonist who is unwillingly caught up in trying to change how his life turns out. When I saw that he was playing the main character, it put me off the film and I assumed it would be another soppy, goofy character he would be playing. Afterall, he is rarely seen elsewhere. However, he truly managed to change my opinion of him as an actor in this outstanding performance.<br/><br/>The film represents chaos theory in a fantastic light, showing that every decision we make, every mistake we have the chance to correct has a totally unpredictable outcome. The one thing I would say is that the film tends to focus on the bad side of it, it doesn't really explore the prospect of everything turning out well for the characters. Then again, if it had, it wouldn't have made for much of an exciting movie. Yes, the ending may be slightly depressing but it is beautiful nonetheless. <br/><br/>The direction of the film is marvellous, lighting and make-up as well as the construction of the settings and the visual spectacular makes for a stunning view that in my opinion has a somewhat Spielbergian vibe at certain moments. <br/><br/>Great film, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys thought provoking films and can appreciate a good story, twists and turns at every corner and a brilliant cast including a well cast chorus of child actors. Don't be put off by the names involved, it will leave you very pleasantly surprised."

"JRmf","8","1","1","1 May 2011"," How Evan might solve his dilemma...
","We've all thought at times, ""If only I could relive that event, I do it so much better.."", but we all know that's impossible.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Well, alternate realities, time travelling to the past while retaining the knowledge of the present, to do just that, is at the heart of this movie as countless reviewers have no doubt discussed.<br/><br/>The problem, as the movie unfolds, is that every time central character Evan does this, it does fix some or even much of the problem, but something else goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of when Evan returns to the pedophile movie session set up by his supposedly trustworthy babysitter and rebukes him, thus changing the future to a rosy one where he, his girlfriend Kayleigh and friend Lenny enjoy happy times at college. Kayleigh's brother Tommy is still as psycho as ever, but I guess you can't win them all.<br/><br/>Where this scenario went wrong was when Evan overreacted to Tommy's aggression and killed him. Clearly Evan could return to the same timepoint (as indeed he does in another scenario), avoid that specific crime and the prison which followed.<br/><br/>So my point is, Having made a specific attempt and noting what went wrong, why not return to the same point-in-time (instead of going to a different one) but this time avoid the bad outcomes? Hone the scenario until you get what you want.<br/><br/>This systematic, ""scientific"" approach would no doubt make for a pretty boring movie, but it does seem at least a logical way for Evan to tackle his dilemma.<br/><br/>With the movie as it is, Evan alters the past/present in ways which increasingly limit his options to change matters, finally resulting in him dying before being born, the ultimate ""time out""...<br/><br/>Clever movie, but so frustrating to see how this power - if it could ever exist - was not being used intelligently.."
"mia-manns","Null","1","1","22 March 2011"," Re-watching the Butterfly Effect
","""You can't change who people are without destroying who they were. ""<br/><br/>Always a fun watch, if a little holey. Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has had something of a tragic life that has taken him away from his childhood friends and left them all miserable and alone, particularly his first love, Kayleigh (Amy Smart). As he nears completion of a psych undergrad, he begins to uncover the past, including memories that he'd ""blacked out"" before and couldn't remember even moments after they happened. He soon finds that he can do more than revisit these blackout moments - he relives them with the ability to change them, and completely change the course of his life.<br/><br/>It's a neat way to demonstration what Chaos Theory calls the Butterfly Effect - ""It has been said something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world."" By changing a moment in his past, Evan can completely re-write history and end up with a completely different life. (Spoilers beyond this point)<br/><br/>The only thing is, where something like The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror satirizes the idea that squishing a bug in prehistoric times can change the course of human evolution, The Butterfly Effect goes the other direction and allows Evan to make really minor changes that don't effect where he ends up at all. For example, when he ends up in prison for the murder of Kayleigh's brother Tommy, he has to prove to his cell mate, Carlos, that he can go back to his past and make changes. He goes back to when he was 7 years old playing at school and draws a picture - which is part of the original timeline that we, the audience, already saw - and stabs spikes through both of his palms - which creates a changed timeline so that Carlos can see them instantly appear, as if a mark of God. If we're trying to demonstrate the butterfly effect here, shouldn't changing that day when he was 7 have some ripple of effect through his life so that his situation would be just a little bit different now? Whether he was taken to the nurse's office or the hospital, if his mother took him to the psychiatrist at a different time, if it made him more freaked out about his blackouts, if it changed his vision of himself or his attitude towards life in any way, wouldn't every event leading up to his prison sentence be somewhat eschewed? We're supposed to believe that he would still end up in the exact same prison cell with the same prison mate at the exact same moment and the only difference would be a new set of scars?<br/><br/>Not to mention the nonsensicalness of having the scars appear instantaneously. Usually when Evan changes the past, he has altered the timeline leading up to the present, so he would have had those scars since he was seven and Carlos would have thought he'd always had them.<br/><br/>""So now I need some information to make things right again."" ""There is no right!"" ""That's bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I made everything perfect again.""<br/><br/>It's also interesting to note that no matter what Evan changes, he always ends up at the same University, with the same circle of friends and the same series of past events. Would Tommy really have still killed Crocket on the same day in the same circumstances after all of the earlier changes Evan made to the timeline? Would Evan's mom still move away to the same city in every situation and Evan still be a psych major at the same school? The movie pays up a little bit with the line ""Tomorrow I can wake up in a dirt farm in Bangladesh."" This is more in the spirit of chaos theory, I think. He really doesn't go far from his original path - the only difference is the mental and physical state of the people he cares about.<br/><br/>Then again, for the sake of a unified plot and a movie that makes sense, it is probably for the best that he stays far away from Bangladesh. That would make for a very silly, Treehouse of Horroresque movie, where what we really get is a masterful, dramatic story with some neat sci-fi elements. Kutcher is really excellent in this movie, and has only very few ""Kelso moments"". The end resolution, while sad and unsatisfying, is exactly what we needed, because this is not a fairy tale. Life is making the best of the situation, and sometimes that means you can't make everything perfect."
"fatehsmann","8","1","1","18 December 2010"," The smallest choice could change your life in ways unforeseen
","I saw my friend watching this movie on his laptop and when I saw Ashton Kutcher in it, I assumed it would be a teen flick. Then one day, in the mood for a comedy, I put this on.<br/><br/>And boy, was I surprised. Not only was Ashton Kutcher acting in a serious movie, but he did a good job!<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, who in his childhood used to suffer from blackouts, similar to his dad. Taking the advice of his doctor, he starts maintaining a dairy of his blackouts. Eventually these blackouts reduce in frequency until they completely stop. Then after a few years, as a college student, he chances upon the notebooks and goes through them. A powerful flashback then hits him. He later realizes he can go and change his past. But changing the smallest possible detail can have the greatest consequences, as he finds out eventually.<br/><br/>Ever since the start, the movie grips you unrelentingly until the credits are rolling, and it leaves you something to chew on other than your popcorn. The plot is smart and intriguing with its essence (How the smallest choice could completely change your future) driven home in a convincing manner by the end of the movie. <br/><br/>As already mentioned, Ashton Kutcher puts in a surprisingly good performance as a lead backed up ably by his cast. In fact, the entire crew did a great job on this one. The camera-work, editing and sound mixing combined to give the movie a continuity and intensity that must have been hard given the storyline of alternate realities, besides creating an atmosphere of suspense and desperation. At its heart is a beautiful love story between two very endearing characters. And the ending is beautiful, though it could have been even better.<br/><br/>A must-watch. 8/10"
"someofusarebrave","8","1","1","5 November 2010"," better than I thought, tells it like it is--definitely worth seeing--tells
","I went into this movie with various negative critical reviews on my mind. Imagine my surprise when the movie turned out to be decently written, which is more than I can say for most movies these days; well acted throughout; very well cast; gritty in a realistic rather than a sensationalized way; and incredibly brave throughout.<br/><br/>In fact, I felt this movie was so very good that I began to wonder whether the critics who saw it reacted to the realistic nature of the violence depicted in this movie and decided to hate the movie instead of hating the violence that exists in this world. We live in a society that does indeed make sociopaths of small children at the hands of cruel, misogynistic and dictatorial fathers; where children are often judged to be 'exactly like' delinquent parents, regardless of whether this is a fair impression or whether the child is old enough to truly reveal themselves yet; where countless children across the U.S. are forced to perform in 'homemade' porn movies at the hands of the adults given responsibility for caring for us. <br/><br/>This was definitely a movie of the twenty-first century, a coming-of-age film of a sort that reveals our generation's tendency to look at the violence around us unflinchingly with a numbness and callousness born of being raised surrounded by horrors on a scale previous generations could never have dreamed up in their worst nightmares. The film depicted these horrors realistically, as well as showing our tendency to respond by either 'tuning out' using drugs, self-abuse or becoming bullies ourselves. The only other choice we seem to recognize is to become overly sensitive and to live our entire lives trying to make everything better for anyone who happens to cross paths with us. We try to make things okay again for our parents, for our friends and anyone else we happen to feel responsible for. We become overly sensitive and take on an inordinate amount of guilt, more than our fair share, because no one else seems inclined to take responsibility for anything at all. These oversensitive types overcompensate and wind up hurting everyone in our quest for justice if we do not temper this quest with a good dose of humor and self-awareness--and joy.<br/><br/>I am deeply appreciative of the way this film takes apart the concept of giving to other people to one's own detriment as having anything to do with morality or a genuine desire to give. When people give to others in way that hurts us, we are simply trying to feel superior.<br/><br/>This film also was very accurate in its depiction of <br/><br/>I think this film could have used some sort of consultant on female behavior. The woman lead--Amy Grant's character--was firmly characterized by her role as the lead man's fantasy of what she was like, rather than having any relationship to what women actually act like. At times, witnessing her anger, this was refreshing. At times, though, knowing how traumatized people tend to behave, I found it frustrating to witness a woman who maintained her independent thought and sense of self in the face of such cruelty. People may well maintain their spirit, their will to change and desire to control their own reality. However, most women do not step out of such extremely abusive homes with such hearty senses of self that they then impassionately defened. Indeed, what mostly happens is precisely the opposite.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a very excellent movie with aspects people genuinely need to be exposed to. Thank God for movies like this one."
"BA_Harrison","8","1","1","17 October 2010"," Ashton Kutcher in good film shock!
","Ashton Kutcher isn't generally regarded as being synonymous with great movie-making (I can appreciate that not everyone loves 'Dude, Where's My Car?' as much as I do), but if there's one title in his filmography that genuinely excuses the guy for his endless forgettable roles in crap rom-coms, it's gotta be The Butterfly Effect—the dude puts in a sweet performance!<br/><br/>Kutcher plays Evan, a young man whose troubled life has been blighted by memory loss; when Evan realises that by reading the journals he has kept since a child he can travel into the past, he gradually begins to fill in the missing pieces of his memory. Meddling with the past, however, is not without its risks...<br/><br/>Admittedly, The Butterfly Effect is in danger of unravelling in a big old mess of improbabilities and impossibilities if studied too closely—that kind of thing happens with even the most meticulously plotted time-travel/alternate time-line movies— but if you allow yourself to just sit and accept things as they happen, you'll find the film a rewarding and very entertaining experience that will take you through the gamut of emotions and really drive home the importance of making the right decisions in life."
"puttputtk","8","1","1","13 September 2010"," original way of telling a used story
","The Butterfly Effect (2004)<br/><br/>It seems like a story that everyone has thought of and wanted to do. Travel back in time and mess with it and it changes the future. Easy and obvious to think of and do, but the Butterfly Effect figures out a way to do it in a different way. <br/><br/>Though it takes a little more brain work or imagination than your average time travel film that just uses a time machine, it's still a pretty easily followed movie. Creative and intriguing. It's actually more of a fantasy film than a sci-fi film because the main character travels in time using his brain rather than a machine.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect has a couple surprisingly good performances. Ashton Kutcher in a non comedic performance seems like it will be awkward, like Jim Carrey's early serious roles, but he does great and you would never guess that that's not his normal style. The supporting cast also does pretty decent for the most part, but nothing spectacular. To be honest most of the younger cast does better than the grown up cast. <br/><br/>The writing and directing are both pretty good. They did a good job keeping everything new and original and kept things in order pretty well, for the most part, which kept the film very easy to follow. I also enjoyed the cinematography. <br/><br/>If you are watching this on DVD you will probably have the option of theatrical cut or directors cut. I have seen both and they both have their positives. The theatrical cut ending makes more sense and is easier to believe (not that the film is believable to begin with.) The director's cut on the other hand is cooler and I think has a more interesting and thought provoking ending. If you have a choice, I'd recommend the director's cut. <br/><br/>Butterfly Effect is a new and cooler twist on a simple idea, and it's quite a thrill ride. It seems more liked by the younger crowed but I think just about anyone will like it. Anyone into psychological thrillers, or dark fantasies should try out this film. It's a fun film that most will enjoy.<br/><br/>8/10"

Movie's very similar to Frequency, except for the protagonist's problems are numerous and considerably darker. I find bits and pieces of Stephen King's stories in various parts. Like the Jail and the Dog burning part.<br/><br/>The story tries to convince you the fact that changing the past is impossible and every time you try doing that you end up making it equally or much worser.

","OK, of course, when people think of Ashton Kutcher, they think of characters like Kelso from That 70s Show, and Jesse from 'Dude, Wheres My Car?'. Most people don't really think he can do much beyond that. But, in 'The Butterfly Effect', his first non-comedy role, I think he did pretty well. Nothing Oscar-worthy or anything, but he was bearable and believable. But, I don't have very high standards for acting, I guess. If they're not so obviously awful that it makes me cringe, then I usually kinda like them, pretty much. I thought the story was really cool. I've heard that this movie has a lot of endings. I've seen two. One on TV, and one online(the one i saw online was the one where he went back to when his mother was having him and yea..i don't wanna give it away even though I'm putting a spoiler warning on just in case). Anyway, I preferred the one I saw online. It was really dark, and I love dark, yea I'm weird like that. That's probably why I loved this movie, cuz it was really dark and a lot of horrible things happened. So, if you don't like really dark movies, then I wouldn't recommend this one. If you do, I would."
"minx-pietz","7","1","1","8 May 2006"," this film is about a man who wishes he could change his life for the better
","this film was fairly strong at the beginning, which is where a lot of films are at their weakest. The way that it was set out at the beginning left the viewer with a lot of questions, which I think helped relate to the confusion of the character. I liked this in a film because I often think films tend to give too much away to the viewer, and I personally like to guess and try to work it out myself, partly because when you're relating to the confusion of a character it helps you understand the emotions they encounter in the situations they are put in, and I found this a lot in this film. A lot of films kill characters and perform a lot of similar acts as though they mean nothing, which doesn't seem realistic, but this film kept it more realistic, and i found it easier to relate like this, because events were treated in such a way that they all seemed to have meaning. Although I thought this film was good emotionally, and kept the viewer entertained at the beginning, I found that after a while I began to understand the point and found it slightly boring, and I found the ending fairly predictable. But in spite of this, the ending left me feeling uneasily satisfied, questioning the rights and wrongs I encountered during the film, and trying to make sense of them all, which I found rather interesting, because, in a way, it showed me the daring to question right and wrong, and whether thats what matters, and also questioned happiness. Overall I quite enjoyed this film but it could have been a bit shorter in the middle."
"parhat","6","1","1","3 May 2006"," Great Story, Great Concept, Unethical Ending
","A good movie needs a good premise and a good ending, usually an ethical one at that, such as Casablanca. Apparently these movie director haven't watched Casablanca. All Emmerich's movies have great concepts, wonderful technical excellences, but usually falls apart on the second half of the movie, such as the ending. <br/><br/>Anyway this is a movie I am meaning to review desperately and for a long time due to a heated debate with fellow watchers which resulted in me being badly injured from a heated fight as a result of a bad ending! I guess this is where movie review critics comes in to solve problems???**spoilers ahead** <br/><br/>Much of the controversy lies in the issue of the ending. Either the theatrical version or the director's cut. The theatrical version had a good ending, albeit an unethical one. The idea can be summed as ""I don't know you, you don't know me so there is no problem."" In other words, ""see no evil and no evil will exist"". The director's cut ends with the leading actor dying in the mother's stomach, so technically he was never born, which is also unethical, because it begs the question that human problems (the Millers) will still continue with him or without him. In other words, the father who made the kiddie porn movie will continue to make it with him or without him. <br/><br/>The preferred ending should have been that he goes back to that house, make demands to the father who make the kiddie porn and make a threat not to do it or else he will report to authorities or at least destroy the camera projector anyway. Much of the conflict between Tommy and Evan arises from the fact that Evan had sex during with his sister while his Tommy father filmed the whole thing. Initially he was going to film his own son having sex with his daughter, but since Evan Trebor came, he decided to replace Tommy for Evan. So whichever the outcome, if Evan never knew the Miller family, the Miller's family life would not have gotten for the better since his father would continue making the kiddie porn anyway. Yes the father did mentioned that Tommy was supposed to lead but Evan was replaced the last minute. So the theatrical ending the fact that Kayleigh Miller had a better life and walked passed by each other in New York City was entirely unrealistic. Her life should have been a whore and so is her brother, to that tune anyway. So there you have it, two endings and both endings were unethical since the cause was not eliminated. Just remember that the theatrical ending we see the What you don't know can hurt you, what you do know can hurt you too, but what you can do to stop it at the source of the problem is what makes the difference. The entire problem of this movie actually revolved around a deranged pedophile father, which the movie totally lost focus of, but that is the real source of the problem of Tommy's unusual behavior and which bought about a chain reaction for Lenny murderous ways and his own personal problems. This problem can be resolved if he made some mention near the end of the movie to the effect, ""Yeah, come to think of it all these problems I am having with Tommy and Lenny all came from this crazy Pedophile Father, no matter what I do! Yeah, I better go back and resolved this in a more direct way, but without the dynamite or punish Tommy! How stupid of me!"" Perhaps, I should tell the producers, the Emmerich, but then they won't care anyway, but it would be nice to add this addition to the DVD version on the alternate third ending, at least in a storyboard form anyway."

","Past, present, future! You can't change your past, you can affect your present and you definitely can affect your future. But does it always work how you want it to work, or how you want it to be? I think this movie perfectly shows us what happens when we try to make things better that aren't supposed to be changed, but what if we succeed? But I think this movie also shows us perfectly that sometimes, if you have the right motivation some things can be changed. I think that in the end, we can see the value of love when Evan, trying to save Kayleigh, takes some decisions that affects his own life. Evan knows that something always can go wrong and maybe he and Kayleigh could be happy together, but... he knows that he can make her totally safe, by stopping their friendship in it's beginning. It is hard but it shows the true love! This movie should definitely be seen by everyone because it is truly wonderful... and realistic."

It is a pleasant film, diverting and interesting, demanding that the viewer be an active participant, not merely cruise along.<br/><br/>I saw the movie on TV, and it had me thinking from the start: through carefully setting up the important scenes, a story is told (involving parallel universes). The conclusion is so obvious:but only because the preceding multiple universes do not have the desired effect.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, and the film is gripping.<br/><br/>It's much better than the overrated documentary ""What the bleep do we know"" and, while not as tightly or artfully structured as ""Sliding Doors"", it raises issues and doesn't try to answer these glibly.<br/><br/>An interesting film."

It's a shame because Donnie Darko and the butterfly effect are both pretty good movies. I would have to say that Donnie Darko is much better though. My favourite part of the butterfly effect is probably when the kids put the bomb in the mail-box. I was really shocked that the filmmakers would show a baby so young about to be killed. What do you think is better, Donnie Darko or The Butterfly Effect? Give a reason for your answer. I really want to know what other people think.

","I think people are coming to this film expecting WAY too much.  Come on, you can even see from the trailers that it is about TIME TRAVEL.  This should give you a clue that the audience is expected to suspend some belief.<br/><br/>Within the context of the film the acting was credible especially considering the actors had to play the same character but in many varied circumstances.<br/><br/>Also a lot of reviewers complain that the abuse and violent scenes were way too disturbing. This had to be because they are the catalyst that makes Evan want to endure the obviously painful process of going back in time.  A more mundane reason would give no urgency or suspense to the film.  It would not been much of a story if the reason everyone's life was in the crapper was because of a bad hair day.<br/><br/>Granted the film is derivative of Memento, It's a Wonderful life, Twelve monkeys, (among others) but what film these days does not `borrow"" elements from other films.<br/><br/>I found this to be an enjoyable film that actually makes you think and reflect"

","Okay, so is this movie perfect....no, but close to it. I think a lot of people are sick of hearing about Ashton(like Bennifer before him) and bash him for him, not the movie. I was hesitant about seeing this movie, with bad reviews and all, but like with LOrd Of The Rings movies, the reviewers are way off. This movie is great. It doesnt show massive violence like some old hens here have tried to say. It isnt funny and I doubt the whole theatre was laughing, like the last poster. I laughed more in Return of the King, with the whole Merry and Pippin....will they/wont they get it on and make baby hobbits together. I dont really like Ashton, but he was alright here. Only one scene, wheres hes popping wheelies in the hospital, was horrible acting. Amy Smart, Elden Hensen and the others were good too. I liked the idea of this movie, and am dumbfounded on all these allegded plot holes, cause nothing made me think twice through the movie.

","The Butterfly Effect is the socialization process that people go through as a child that determines their psyche, their future behavior and the type of person that they will become. There is a myriad amount of things at work here. One of the important is the relationship between youth and adulthood. Every childhood experience shapes and molds the life of adults, which is essence with every flashback that alters something new in the present. This is not just a sci-fi thriller it is a morality play on power, compassion and happiness. The title character wants to geninuely help his friends but not to a sacrifice his own happiness. When he has no hands, but everyone is happy he refuses this alternative reality, because he is crippled. He says he is doing it for his mother but he is not. Everything in life cannot be perfect or else it wouldnt be life, it would be a false reality. The center of the movie is the scene between the lead characters father and the younger version when the father tells him he cannot play God and begins to choke him. The diary is metaphor for keeping everything that encompasses your experiences with you. You will never forget what happens, but you cannot let the past dictate the future."
"skeether","8","1","1","27 January 2004"," You can't play god...
","Like it says in the various trailers for this movie, playing god is never a good thing. The Butterfly Effect is a great little science fiction/thriller, with quite a few things going for it.<br/><br/>I admit, I was skeptical of Ashton Kutcher's ability to pull off a dramatic role. Thankfully, he does very well. After seeing Butterfly Effect, I look forward to Kutcher's next run at a serious film. The supporting cast were all excellent, all convincing in their altering roles.<br/><br/>Time travel films come in two varieties. Those that succeed, and those that don't. The Butterfly Effect is the former. Yes, it has some plot holes, but what sci-fi movie doesn't? These, however, are minor flaws and don't really detract from the overall experience.<br/><br/>That said, there are also some very touchy subjects used in this movie and it received an ""R"" rating for a reason. Definitely not one for the kids.<br/><br/>
The Butterfly Effect is much more than I expected, and continues to impress me. It's a refreshing delve into the time travel genre, but you have to be into science fiction to enjoy it, and be able to look over the few plot holes. Butterfly Effect is solid, and worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 5)"

However when the charters got older the story got worse as did the acting. By the end of it, I wasn't totally disapointed but i wasn't completely happy either. It was the same as every other movie that has been coming out recently, a disapointment. When will hollywood start making some better movies? We can only wait and hope."
"campbejp","Null","1","1","27 January 2004"," Entertaining - Would watch again
","I had been following this movie for a while, and was intrigued when I finally got to see a trailer a few months ago.  The trailer was very well done, set to great music.  Setup for a pretty good film.<br/><br/>This movie is very entertaining.  It has a great concept, and I liked the way it was shot, the lighting and colors used.  They all added to the feel of the film, which stays consistent depending on the lifeline of Evan (Ashton) that your viewing.  Some very original ideas here as far as a time line type film, and the visuals are also well done.<br/><br/>The group of friends I was with all agreed that it started out a bit heavy as far as what the characters go through growing up, and what they experience in their childhood.  But it starts to lighten up a bit here and there as you get explanations for why what happened and so on.<br/><br/>
*Spoiler*<br/><br/>The entire cast did a great job in my opinion.  Ashton Kutcher was completely believable in a dramatic role, I like it when actors take roles that go opposite of what their associated with.  He takes on each new lifeline realistically.  And when he realizes what he has to do, the part of himself he has to let go to make things right....well, I was touched and very happy with the entire film.  What gets annoying, about other reviews, and people that don't like this film is this:  Some movies are entertainment, stories, fantasies that can't or won't happen.  They are to be enjoyed, and or make you feel a certain emotion(happy, sad mad, etc). This is such a film.  Lets remember this when we watch movies, and if we want realism, turn on the 6 o'clock news, or watch a documentary or based on a true story type film.<br/><br/>7/10"
"skettios","Null","1","1","27 January 2004"," A welcome surprise to counter low expectations
","As a young man, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) experiences blackouts during key events in his life. These blackouts leave holes in his memory, that his mother and doctor try to restore by encouraging him to keep a journal. When the chain of events leads to the loss of someone near to him, Evan finds that he can relive these events, and even change their outcomes by reading his journals. However despite his good intentions, each permutation seems to lead to a negative outcome for someone in his inner circle... thus The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>The idea that reading a journal can change the past is silly, but required for the premise of the movie. If you can put that aside, you'll see that this movie is quite a gem in the same vein as 'Donnie Darko'. The directors of this movie do a wonderful job of telling the story. They take seemingly insignificant details, and patch them together to make a rewarding puzzle for the viewer to put together. Through each variation, you want to see Evan succeed, but you also hope that he doesn't as the terrible consequences of his actions are what drives this movie. This movie is definitely not afraid to be dark. While the whole plot sounds contrived the story moves very smoothly, and in the end it will all make sense.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is believable and even at times funny as Evan. Amy Smart, William Lee Scott, and Elden Henson do a nice job of acting like different people with the same core in each variation. The music is well done, the direction thoughtful, and the transition sequences are pretty intense.<br/><br/>
I thought this movie was going to be a flop, mainly because I was prejudiced against Ashton Kutcher's acting ability. While it isn't going to win him an Oscar, it's certainly not bad. I went to the movie anyway in the hopes that it would look as good as the previews suggested, and I was pleasantly surprised that it did.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie an 8 out of 10."

I thought it was very thought provoking, and even thought the acting was not ""terrible.""  Now, I'll agree it is not the best film I've ever seen, but it does not deserve the dogging it has been receiving.<br/><br/>I've seen and heard people saying it is Back to the Future with a dark twist. To some extent, it may be, but what this movie is really dealing with is a person's psyche. Think about what you really saw throughout the film. Let it all simmer for a minute or two, then think about the situation Evan (Ashton Kutcher) found himself in. Think about some of the subtle things dropped in throughout (i.e. the Mr. Hyde poster next to the pay phone) and then question if everything truly ended up happy like a cheery Back to the Future.<br/><br/>If you like a thought provoking, relatively original idea, you'll probably enjoy your two hours at The Butterfly Effect."
"canadianemokid","Null","1","1","26 January 2004"," I recommend you see this movie!
","This movie had an excellent storyline, unexpectedly great acting, suspense, and most of all--originality.<br/><br/>Some people say that this story has been done before and the Butterfly Effect didn't do a good job copying it.  I think this script was very original.  It didn't have the same ending where everything is perfect and everyone is happy.  It showed that some sacrifices have to be made to save those you care about.  The moral is not everything can be made perfect--you can't play God.  That was not a very original moral, but the movie was a unique way of portraying it.<br/><br/>I believe that the reason a lot of people say the acting in this movie was not very great was because Ashton Kutcher was playing a serious role for once.  It's true, Ashton has been know to play the stupid hot guy in, well, all his movies.  But you need to look past the fact that he was the one playing a mature guy with more troubles than where his car was.  This was a serious part in a serious movie which was in no way unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>I would also like to mention that this movie was not supposed to be scary. I've read a few reviews and heard people say that it wasn't scary.  It was suspenseful in a way that some things would pop out and make you jump a little.  But it was supposed to be kind of a suspenseful drama.<br/><br/>
In conclusion, the Butterfly Effect was an outstanding movie and most people aren't giving it credit for the awesome film that it is."

","Let's start with the title ""The Butterfly Effect"", throw in a simple cool tag line, ""Change one thing. Change everything.""  Then, throw in a killer Trailer with Staind's ""it's been a while"", and some cool sequences and you just sold your movie before the release.<br/><br/>I went into this movie like I do most movies opened minded, yet after seeing the trailer to the movie, the anticipation was there, and that's when disappointment pokes it's ugly head in and might ruin the experience. That never happened.  Filmmaker brilliance for the architect of the trailer, gave you just enough without giving anything way.  Suprisingly, the format of the story didn't go as planned, yet there was a reason for it.  Basically the childhood is explained a lot more thorough then first expected, but all of it for a good reason.  As much as I would like to go into detail about Evan's abilities, that's for you to find out, but you will walk away understanding it.  Promise.  Another aspect of the movie that I liked, in this is in reference to time travel and changing the past, is that Evan kept trying, despite how things appeared to get worse, he kept trying, unlike the movie ""The Time Machine"", where as Alexander goes back ""one"" time after creating the time machine, and assumes he can't change the past.<br/><br/>This movie is solid and the actors give really good performances.  I'm sure the biggest with drawl about people's hesitation to see this movie is Ashton Kutcher, but he pulls off in a really good performance.  Don't judge this movie before you see it, go see the movie for what it is, good entertainment.  8/10<br/><br/>Enjoy<br/><br/>Zoo"

"moviechic_Carrie","Null","1","1","26 January 2004"," What an amazing effect....
","Synopsis : Having experienced black out session when he was a child, Evan Treborn (Kutcher) tries to relive incidents of his childhood to bring back his memories. Using the journals he kept as a child brings the moment back to play, more realistic than a dream. <br/><br/>
 Plot : Please note first and foremost, this movie was billed as a Horror/Drama but it falls into the Sci-fi/Drama category to me.  I classify anything dealing with some form of time travel to be considered science fiction.  Now, on with the show......This was an amazing movie filled with all forms of emotions; sincerity, disgust, betrayal, hopefulness and the neverending question - should one person play ""god"" over everyone else's lives? <br/><br/>
 Cast/Characters : I know what you are thinking, oh my, Jekyll actually sat through an Ashton Kutcher movie. Trust me, I amaze even myself. But in all honesty, he does a fantastic job in a dramatic role. You don't even realize who the actor is you are swept up in the moment. Powerful performance also by Amy Smart as we get to see her in different stages and ""lives"" - how she can be beautiful and glamourous in one scene and a totally wasted out drug addict in the next.<br/><br/>   Pace : The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but did well in building up the story of each character and allowing us to get into their heads for a moment. Once the main character was grown and in college, the rest of the movie went pretty fast, jumping from ""life"" to ""life"" smoothly. Overall smooth sailing to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>   F/X : Not really a special effects type of movie, other than the sequences of Evan going from present time to past time. I WAS impressed with the use of sound and colors though in the movie.  Depending on which person he would meet up with would determine the colors used to surround that person, wether they were happy or sad. In one scene we have a very happy, well adjusted girl surrounded by pinks and yellows and a very sunshine-sort-of-day and then within the same scene a very depressed, hurt and angry boy with just minimal colors of grey, white and black surrounding him. Truly an amazing sequence to me. <br/><br/>
 Jekyll's Final Thoughts : This was definitely a surprize movie for me. Low expectations for me entering the film in having to sit through 2 hours of Ashton turned out to be 2 hours of an emotional roller coaster of a movie. I plan to watch this one again just to grasp on some moments that left me wondering. This is a must see movie - 5 stars!    Just remember that it isn't a horror movie...I can't be refunding everyone's money!!!"

I kept thinking about things that I thought might not make sense, but every time I thought of something else, I realized that it was all pretty well covered.  Then, about two hours after seeing it, something just clicked and I was like, ""Wow.  I get it!  THAT was an amazing movie.""  Not like I didn't understand it, just that I didn't really ""get"" it until then.  I definitely wanted to see it again to see if the plot holds its continuity (the same reason you watch The Sixth Sense again).  It's definitely worth seeing in theaters, but just realize that it's going to take a lot of thought, and you won't be able to shake some of the images from the movie for a few hours afterwards.

","This movie was quite disturbing, from the first jump(the first of MANY) it'll either ensnare you or lose you. I do have one piece of advice to anyone reading this review before you see the film: Give Ashton a chance. So many people were on the forums here judging his performance based on the previews, and these were people who'd already made up their minds to hate the movie because of him, but it was unfair because he is more than competent as Evan in what was a very challenging role(calling for him to be humorous, serious and deeply disturbed all at once.) This is NOT a movie for children either, excessive swearing, some sex, drug use and heinous violence(I like my violence in movies, but the fact that many times children are committing it makes it very wrong). The movie delivers on jumps and a very good plot, though I am reminded of the Simpson's Halloween special where Homer time travels(which I know was based on something else). All in all, the movie is certainly above average in terms of overall quality, but it is DEFINATELY bizarre and very graphic and disturbing. Tremendous acting all around, nice to see Ethan Suplee back on the big(big BIG in his case) screen and nice to see that hopefully Ashton Kutcher won't succumb to Jim Carrey syndrome and be typecast until he has to make a series of movies just to prove he's more than ""the goofy actor"""
"gbozoki","5","1","1","25 January 2004"," Quite a disappointment after all...
","Well, this movie has a great (although not entirely original) story about a guy who - because of some ""illness"" - can go back to his past and make changes there (which of course changes the present.)<br/><br/>Now, acting is fairly good in this one (Ashton Kutcher was surprisingly believable in the role, Amy Smart played all the different roles and the kids were all good as well.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie starts pretty slow and it just wants to be a horror/thriller at all costs - even by ruining the movie itself. Although this could've been one of the best movies, it isn't, because of bad directing, overused and meaningless special effects (some are good though) and bad editing. I was very disappointed at the end, because of the huge promise this movie had. 5 out of 10."

But it was even worst when the mom had to go to school to see the kids drawings. I guessed it before it happened because every horror movie does that "" oh no... look what the kid was drawing"" line.

"Ithilfaen","Null","5","12","19 October 2004"," Good story. Deserved better acting.
","The storyline is reminiscent of GroundHog Day... going back and forth to the same events trying to change things. The drama treatment did improve the topic but not to the point that it could become a cult film of sort.<br/><br/>The love story that is the motivation of the whole movie somewhat falls flat and impairs the movie harshly. I apologize to fans of Kutcher but his acting bordered on ridicule in some scenes. I was half waiting for the laugh tracks and having never seen anything with him before I was not biased or disappointed. The kid who played Evan as a teen was soo much more credible, it's not even funny. And there was a complete absence of chemistry between Kutcher and Amy Smart that somehow just made the whole storyline pointless.<br/><br/>It definitely would have been more than just entertaining if it had not been so resolutely geared towards the teen viewers. Most of the love story plot felt a little too much like Dawson's Creek. The story would have benefited from much better less known actors (who may not have been on the cover on Seventeen but... who cares?) who would have made the whole scheme work. Not having to go very far to find them, I think Elden Henson (Lenny) would have made a PERFECT Evan (yeah I know, he's not as 'sexy' as Kutcher... my point, exactly!) and ANYONE would have been better than Amy Smart (I think newcomer Dallas Howard would have been just wonderful) but I'm not a casting director... apparently neither was the person who gave the two key parts to up and coming teen pleaser's.<br/><br/>Overall a meager 6/10 that could have easily been a 8!"
"iago-6","Null","5","12","9 August 2004"," Ludicrous and SOOOOO ""Teen,"" yet a lot of fun
","There is MANY A SPOILER BELOW, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this review!<br/><br/>This movie is very bad in many ways, yet totally enjoyable and definitely a fun, mind-bending rental. It's main flaw is just its immaturity. It SCREAMS 'teen' in how overly emotional and overwrought it all is. It screams 'simplistic writer/directors who think their movie is SO HARD-HITTING and DEEP but is really rather juvenile.' Chief among the reasons it creates this effect is the inclusion of subject matter WAYYY too dark for a film this silly. Child porn, animal torture and killing, killing of infants, drug abuse and prostitution, loss of limbs this movie is really rubbing your face in horror, cruelty, and sadism, ostensibly to make it all more 'serious.' Unfortunately the rest of the movie isn't up to the seriousness these subjects demand and I think it really does a disservice to the viewer's ability to take the story seriously. <br/><br/>Another problem is that the filmmakers seem to mistake stupidity for destiny. The idea carried in the film is that whatever Ashton does to correct the future only makes it worse. Well, maybe if Aston didn't do such wholly stupid things, the future would have turned out better. For example, maybe it's not that great an idea to go stand right next to a mailbox you know is going to explode in a few seconds? Maybe a lit stick of dynamite in the hands of a ten year old is not the best intimidation tool against an aggressive adult? The film treated the outcomes of these situations as 'destined,' but maybe if the characters weren't quite so stupid they wouldn't have turned out that way? This makes the ending of the theatrical version all the more ludicrous as thus far EVERYTHING has gone wrong when Ashton tries to fix the past, but then at the end--presto!--everything's fine! <br/><br/>There were other off-the-chart suspension of disbelief aspects, like that you can go back in time just be reading your journal, that Ashton's MIND doesn't change even though his whole past has now changed, etc., etc. The GRAVITY with which the film approaches all this SHEER LUDICROUSNESS only makes it that much more fun.<br/><br/>But accept it for what it is, and it's a totally enjoyable 'Woah dude, like what if that really happened?' kind of movie. I was completely engrossed all the way through, and there were many mind-bender twists like when I realized that if Ashton goes back BEFORE he started keeping his journal, then he won't be able to change anything, and also when I pieced together that when he was blacking out as a child, that was when he was 'visiting' himself as an adult. The movie never explains why he can't just write a new journal page about the past and use that to go back, but quibbling will get you nowhere with this one.<br/><br/>The contrast between how SERIOUS the filmmakers seem to think this movie is (and I didn't listen to the commentary, but others have described it as VERY SERIOUS) and just how TEEN the whole thing comes off as is really precious. I ADORE how in one incarnation Ashton is supposed to be a weird, not-especially-popular or fashionable college student who is best friends with the overweight goth guy, yet he is dressed at the ZENITH of hipster GLAMOUR. And then all the soundtrack selections you half expect a little shot of the soundtrack album cover to come up in the corner with a 'Now Available!' line. The whole aesthetic and execution of this film is SOOOOO MTV.<br/><br/>The director's cut ending follows through on the seriousness the movie has been operating on until then, and actually achieves a kind of beautiful grace note at the end--provided you are willing to go along with all the ludicrous conventions the film has set up before. This film sort of makes a good contrast with 'IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE' in that the conclusion here is that everything would have been much better is the main character HAD NEVER BEEN BORN. I liked the darkness of all that, and the final show of how everything went 'right' since Ashton wasn't ever born was kind of moving.<br/><br/>The theatrical cut ending has all the hallmarks of running scared from test audiences. Like I said, Ashton changes one more thing and then--as if by MAGIC!--everything's fine! I also like how audiences could NOT be left without a feeling of hope for the romance, so it gives the indication that Ashton might meet the girl again later in life--and everything will work out OOOOOOKAY! <br/><br/>Overall, NOT a 'good' movie by any stretch of the imagination, but still completely enjoyable and fun to watch.<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","This movie succeeds where the underdog Donnie Darko didn't hit at the box office like it should have. Although it does pretty much steal the base premise of DD, it seems to be much better received.<br/><br/>Unfortunate, IMO. Donne Darko was a beautiful attempt with great style and an excellent dialog. The Butterfly Effect is a fully CGI-treated rendition of the same base story with pretty much the same outcome. I don't understand its success where DD is so vastly under-rated, but such is the way of things in Hollywood, I would imagine. The Butterfly Effect is an ""A"" production while Donnie Darko was a ""B."" That just goes to show you that money and effects mean more than a really good movie.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this on any level, do yourself a favor and check out the ~real~ movie which started this entire line including the ""Left Behind"" series. The performances are much more realistic in DD, and the photography and effects, while not as well done, meant more to me, for the obvious budget differences. DD had to try harder, for lack of funding, if that makes sense to you. <br/><br/>While the Butterfly Effect was quite good (very enjoyable), Donnie Darko was the first movie (of late) to do this.<br/><br/>All the same, it rates a 7.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","In The Butterfly Effect, Ashton Kutcher stars as The Guy With The Worst Childhood, Ever. Not only does he have a bizarre, hereditary brain defect that causes him to black out the stressful experiences in his life, he has to deal with pedophiles, sociopaths, an angry/jealous brother-of-girlfriend, separation from his friends, regular visits to a creepy sanitarium, a crazy dad, and being an accomplice to manslaughter. Seems like a lot, right? And it certainly takes a long time to set all that up, particularly when you have to include a number of carefully timed blackouts to drive the plot of the second-half of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, though, we reach present-day, grown-up-and-going'-to-college Ashton, and you'd think that now the film will get rolling - but you'd be wrong. There's quite a bit of noodling around, showing how screwed up everyone's life is, and quite a bit of time goes by before Ashton figures out that he can leap, Bakula-like, into the times of his blackouts to change things. Then - well, you can't really say that a film this slow-paced really gets rolling, but it does begin to show signs of movement. First thing he does is attempt to straighten out his girlfriend, Kaylee (I'm not sure on the spelling, but that'll do). He manages to turn her and himself into boring frat clones, but screws her brother Tommy up worse, ends up killing him in self defense, and gets sent to prison. (Could anyone explain to me how someone with no priors, awaiting trial, and with an iron-clad self-defense plea gets sent to the general prison population instead of getting bail or release? I didn't think so.) <br/><br/>This, of course, sets off a string of further quantum leaps, each one erasing a traumatic event from his past, but screwing up everyone else's life worse. Things finally get so bad, Ashton decides to erase his own existence by leaping back to his birth and strangling himself in the womb. We're then treated to a montage of how wonderful everyone's life is without him. That's right, folks, the final message of this movie is that a world without Ashton Kutcher is a world without pain. Come to think of it, they might have a point."
"preppy-3","8","4","9","9 October 2005"," Not as bad as you might think...
","When this came out in 2003 it was doomed. Nobody could take the idea of Ashton Kutcher (known just for comedy) in a serious sci-fi movie. Predictably it bombed at the box office. That's too bad because this is actually a very intriguing (if disturbing) film.<br/><br/>Evan (played as a 13 year old by John Patrick Amedon) does not have a happy childhood. His dad is in a mental institution; his mom has to work constantly to pay the bills and is never around; one of his best friends (Tommy) is a borderline psycho and Tommy's dad is a pedophile. Evan keeps having blackouts and keeps a journal from age 7 on to maybe help him. When he reaches college age (played by Kutcher) his life is a mess...but he finds he can go back in time (by reading his journals). He goes back and tries to change everything...but things get worse and worse. Soon he's spinning through alternate realities and losing his mind...<br/><br/>The story itself is intriguing and it's pulled off beautifully. I'm not a science fiction fan but this movie pulled me right in. The direction really puts this across--all the different realities are shot in different film stocks so you can tell where you are and the film never stops moving. And it did make me think--would I change anything if I could back in time? The acting is (almost) uniformly great. Amy Smart plays Kayleigh--Evan's girlfriend (sometimes). She has to play different variations on her character. Not an easy task but she pulls it off. Also William Lee Scott (playing Tommy) has to do the same and also does well. As for Kutcher--he isn't terrible but he's really not up for the role. He was OK but he needs to be more than that to put this across completely. He doesn't destroy the movie--he just lessens the impact. And Amedon deserves credit for playing Evan at 13--very well done.<br/><br/>This movie is disturbing. There are quite explicit dialogue about child abuse and Tommy's behavior as a child (brought on by his sick dad) is downright horrifying. This is NOT a movie for kids. It does have a happy ending--sort of. I'm giving this an 8--I might have given it a 10 with a better actor in the lead.<br/><br/>Recommended--just with reservations about Kutcher."

","The Butterfly Effect  What a brilliant film. It answered many questions that I had in my mind about the relationship between storytelling, script, the scriptwriter, direction and the director. This film tells a massively engaging story and tells it damned well. It has wonderful technical affects to suit the story without letting the affects overshadow the telling. It is filmed very well avoiding the trap of being too beautiful. It stays WELL AWAY from the trap of being what my grandmother would have called 'too arty-farty'. None of these excesses are present in this movie, it is very well balanced indeed. It has a wealth of one liners amid a very intelligent script. There is not a hint of ham acting anywhere in sight. This film went straight into my top ten films of all time and I am in my forties. The large group of teenagers I watched it with, a tough audience, also gave it the highest accolades I have heard. PS - Nicole (16) says Ashton Kutcher is 'hot'. Who am I to disagree. This film is a triumph of storytelling."
"MLDinTN","6","4","9","11 January 2005"," the problem with movies like this...
","is no matter what, there are numerous plot holes. I get how in the beginning with Evan as kid, the blackouts he suffered occurred because in the future he was time warping and changing events to create an alternative future. OK, so I guess this makes perfect sense to everyone, right! I mean, with this idea, then every time he went back, he created a new blackout and wouldn't that change everything from that day on, but when he wakes up in present time, he has no memories of how his past changed. We see flashbacks of him reliving some parts of his life, but when Evan comes too, he doesn't recall any of it. And every time he goes back to change something, he corrects one thing, like Kayleigh from committing suicide, but it always leads to some other bad situation, like when he got his hands blown off.<br/><br/>It was interesting when he ended up in the psych ward and no access to his journals. You wondered how he would get out of that one, plus we see how his dad ended up there and stayed there.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but too confusing. And it makes you ask to many questions that start with ""what if"". Plus, it's hard to take Kutcher as a serious actor; he's in the tabloids too much. So, I only recommend it if you like sci-fi films."
"aptpupil79","4","4","9","11 October 2004"," wasted potential
","may be some spoilers...looking at the filmography for the two writer/directors of this film gave me a warm feeling inside because, for once, the world makes sense. both had previously worked on ""final destination 2"" which also had a decent enough idea, but was executed very poorly. the butterfly effect, literally from the first frames, is an unintelligent film. ashton kutcher isn't an actor of any real merit, though he did play a somewhat slow witted amputee fairly well. amy smart did the best acting job of the bunch - going from crack whore (literally) to sorority girl without missing a beat. i wouldn't call her a great actress, but she's got some chops. oddly enough the film did have a certain degree of potential (most films do). the idea is good enough to carry a film that is average in every other way, unfortunately the film was below average in most categories. the directors, though having almost no artistic ability or sense of ebb and flow, did manage to compose a few rather nice shots. one shot was over kutcher's shoulder, looking down into an open grave - they employed a long lens to accentuate the distance between the grave and kutcher. another example came after kutcher had one of his blackouts and the camera was tilted 90° to create a disorienting effect. these moments were brief and few, but they were there. it led me to believe that these guys are capable of making a better than bad film so long as someone else wrote the screenplay. as it stands, though, this film was not better than bad. also, i'm commenting on the director's cut of this film which has a few extra minutes of footage and a different ending. after it was over i watched the theatrical version's ending and that one was even worse.

"keram","3","4","9","30 August 2004"," Nothing to do with the butterfly effect (or chaos theory)
","If you like violent thriller stories based in (and limited in scope to) small-town USA, this might be a movie for you. But if you expect insights into the theory of the butterfly effect or chaos, go look elsewhere, because - contrary to its title - this film has nothing to do with these things. The plot jumps back and forth in time, exploring different pathways in the lives of the main characters, but the implied effects small events have on these lives are hugely exaggerated and completely neglect the fact that a change in the human personality is also a dynamic process that takes time and is generally influenced by a lot of factors. Instead, in order to drive the whole story, the plot is stuffed with a hefty load of cliches and stereotypes, and the same characters in the alternative scenarios are often portrayed like very different people. The result is that the presented versions of events are hardly believable, differing essentially in who kills (or otherwise harms) whom, or whose life is completely ruined, in which of them. The movie had a few interesting twists and not too bad an ending (in the director's cut), but this doesn't change the fact that I was looking at the watch every two minutes or so for most of the time, wondering whether I would have enough strength and patience to see it to its end."
"movieguy1021","5","4","9","11 July 2004"," The Butterfly Effect: 5/10
","Ashton Kutcher is one of the most, if not the most, overexposed ""celebrity"" now. Most people can't even name a movie he was in. I'm not a big fan of That 70's Show, where he made his name known, but after he made Dude, Where's My Car?, I don't think anyone thought he could ever be a credible actor. And The Butterfly Effect proves it. From a story that has been floating around Hollywood for years (it took someone with the star power and epic acting skills of Kutcher to get it greenlighted), The Butterfly Effect has a great idea but is executed in such a mixed bag kind of way it's hard to like it.<br/><br/>Evan (Kutcher) has gone through a troubled childhood (filled with the stupidest kids you've even seen on film), and had experienced numerous blackouts. He's better now, but finds a way to go back in time to change the horrifying events of his past. What he doesn't realize (until the end-most people would've caught on as soon as possible) that everything he does affects his whole life ahead of him. It seems to affect Kayleigh (Amy Smart) the most in each one, where she goes from sorority girl to waitress to prostitute. The like happens to everyone else Evan knows. But no matter how much he screws it up, he keeps on truckin' so that his life is perfect.<br/><br/>This story is much like Donnie Darko (as it has been said multiple times), but Darko knows where its going and has a purpose. In The Butterfly Effect, it takes itself way too seriously. The first half of the movie is basically Evan's past, where troubling events take place. The second half is Evan going back to fix his mistakes. The worst part is, Evan doesn't even think of helping others with these powers of his. There's a scene in a movie theater (where they're showing two New Line Cinema movies, obviously), and some people unrelated to him get hurt. Why not go back and stop that? Also, when Evan goes back to save a mother and daughter, he does it for himself, not for the people that would be killed. And we're supposed to feel along with this selfish character? In a movie as dark and serious as this, it deals with silly topics, like time travel. Time travel only works humorously (Back to the Future) or when explained properly (Donnie Darko). Neither occur in The Butterfly Effect. I had been told many times that to like this movie I couldn't take it seriously. I tried not to, but the events that occur in the movie (including child porn and animal abuse) are impossible to take lightly. At least the movie deals with them in a serious matter.<br/><br/>The concept is a pretty cool concept, but once again, it's destroyed by the actual dialogue written. It's all so basic and clichéd I could basically guess what they were about to say next. Also, why must they have begun with a scene of the climax? Movies always do that, often for a purpose. There was no reason here. The whole movie was uneven-half of the movie was basically revisited over and over again in the second half, which unnecessarily spends much of its time in a prison. On another note, I liked the way that everything tied together (I'm not talking about the ending) and that the unanswered questions from throughout the movie were eventually taken into consideration, such as the purpose of Evan's blackouts. I watched the director's cut, and the alternate ending seemed gutsy, but I really liked it. I read about the other ending, and I prefer this one.<br/><br/>This almost seemed like a typical teen movie (more so than it already is) by the acting. Kutcher can't act worth beans, and Amy Smart isn't exactly Katherine Hepburn either. The only two remarkable people in the cast were Eric Stoltz (as the aforementioned child pornographer) and Ethan Suplee (as Evan's Goth roomate), who always put in great acting jobs. But this movie, which is sure to wow the MTV generation, has a great idea at its fingertips, but can't seem the right way to execute it.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, sexual content, language and brief drug use."

The acting was sub-par not to mention the plot itself (nothing but a direct Donnie Darko rip-off). Darko, released briefly in 2001, is a much more in-depth film about one's mental reality and time travel, but Butterfly Effect tries fancy camera tricks and plot complications only to leave the viewer saying they loved it but are truly confused. The main problem I had was the story never really took off and never even had something to take off from. There's no exposition that helps the audience understand why these characters do what they do. I found myself not<br/><br/>caring one bit if the past gets changed or even if this guy or the other dude or the girl or whoever dies right then and there. I will say this: it had a slight sliver of potential near the end with choices people have to make, but ultimately fizzles away into a bland, lackluster attempt at teasing one's brain. Look away."
"MovieManMenzel","4","4","9","24 January 2004"," A thriller, which at first seems well done, and original but then turns into pure garbage
","I went to see the Butterfly Effect after my friend Jen went to see the movie. She said to me she did not know what to think about it yet she did not really like it. I started getting a bit leery about the film after her opinion of the film. Well what can I say, I am not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher but to me the Butterfly Effect from the trailer looked liked something so original and interesting that it really didn't matter that Ashton was in it or not. Well I read a lot of reviews for the film; most of them were not good at all. I also read an article on imdb.com that the film was screened at Sundance and the viewers hated the film. If that wasn't enough in the article it also stated that Ashton Kutcher himself was not going to promote the movie due to all the bad reviews. Boy when I read all the bad things about the film and I found out Jen wasn't crazy about the film neither well I had Butterflies in my stomach (Thank you ladies and gentlemen I will be here all week) when I decided to go see the Butterfly Effect this afternoon.<br/><br/>The film is basically about a kid named Evan (Ashton Kutcher) who has a messed up past and then finds a way to travel back to his harmful past to correct the horrible death of his girlfriend/childhood pal Kayleigh played by Amy Smart but here comes the twist, his plan does not always turn out the way he aspects it to. And he learns that whenever you change the past something else in the past has to be changed as well! Does this plot remind you of something? Ding Ding Ding Yes Scott do you know what it reminds you of? Yes its Back to the Future with a dark little twist. <br/><br/>
At First, The Butterfly Effect comes off as an interesting film. I enjoyed the scenes within the first thirty minutes of the film which make the film seem very dark and unique as you start asking yourself the question what the hell is wrong with these kids? But after a few flashbacks and my pal Ashton Kutcher appears on the screen the movie goes downhill. A lot of flashbacks, incredibly bad acting, and unintentional funny movies follow<br/><br/>Well let's start this off by analyzing the acting. At first when all the characters are children the acting is decent. The kids who played Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tom when they were younger did a good job. As for the films more known cast of Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart well there performances weren't good at all in fact they sucked!!!! I am going to start posing the question How does Ashton Kutcher still get work? Did anyone not see Dude Where's My Car, Down to You, Just Married, Or My Boss's Daughter? I guess not since he still is being offered roles. I mean his best performance was in Cheaper by The Dozen where he did nothing more than make fun of himself stating he isn't a good actor but his face gets him places. I could not agree with him more. As for Amy Smart, well I don't know, her whole role was so small but her on screen presence was so dull and badly acted.<br/><br/>The geniuses behind this movie where the same two guys who wrote Final Destination 2. Am I seeing a pattern here? A movie with a great trailer but turns out to be nothing more than a script with lousy dialog and unintentional funny moments. These guys ruined Final Destination! The first Final Destination was an original film with decent acting and suspense but the second one was a laugh out loud riot to everyone who watched the film. These two guys J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress both wrote a directed the Butterfly Effect. I have to actually say these guys were on to something when they first started the script but then after a while it seems as though they got lazy. It's sad that the movie turned out the way it did. I mean it has an interesting premise although not totally original but the premise could have been used to make a really good film. I mean with a better script, and actors it might have been one of the best films of the year. Well to give these guys some credit they did do a good job on directing. I loved the camera angles and movements. I also liked the flashback sequences they were cool and neatly shot. J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress you guys did a good job directing but what happened on the script after the first 30 minutes? Come On Guys you can do better! <br/><br/>Another thing I found hilarious about the film was that it had four producers and seven Executive producers. Why the hell did they need so many producers on one film? Does that tell anyone anything about the film? <br/><br/>
Well what can I say I wanted to really like the film and when it started out I thought I was going to, but soon into the film did I start hating it and laughing out loud at some of the films unintentional funny scenes. The people responsible for advertising this film should be giving all the money this film makes because wow they did one hell of a good job marketing this turkey. Getting me to actually want to see an Ashton Kutcher movie that stars him, as the main character is such a challenge but boy did they accomplish it! I give this film a 4/10 only for the great camera work and for the first thirty minutes. If you want to watch this film, I advise you wait for it to hit VHS or DVD shelves in a few months."

Every time I see this film I am left with a fog like feeling as if I am trying to either remember, or understand something. It always takes a few minutes to snap completely back to reality. No other film hits me quite like this one for some reason.<br/><br/>This film, not unlike Ray Bradbury's short story ""A Sound Of Thunder"", is definitely a mind warp. It's one of those films which no one can really like or hate. The only way I can explain my reaction to this film is that strong, and strange feeling you get sometimes while waking up from a dream, in this case not completely sure whether it really was a dream.<br/><br/>What overwhelms the senses most in this film is the raw truth to it. The evils of the story are inevitably something that consumes your own life or that of the lives around you.<br/><br/>I don't truly know what else to say about this film. Think back to your childhood. Whatever the recollection, try and remember everything you can right down to the most futile of details. Lay back, darken the room, and just remember.

","*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind Buy<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect (Director's Cut)"" takes a unique concept and seems to take every step to ensure that the finished product is terrible. The movie is about Evan Treborn, a 20 year old college student who shared a troubled childhood with his friends. The first half hour is used to set up his childhood while leaving certain holes to be filled in later for shock value. Evan suffered from black outs as a child and in the hopes of recovering his lost memories he kept journals. These journals, years later, opened up his ability to travel back in time to change his childhood. What follows is the butterfly effect at work in which every little change alters reality in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>The script is the first to blame for this film's downfall. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes that were meant to show us Evan's troubled childhood. That was only the beginning. When Evan first goes back to change his past he goes to one particular memory involving Kayleigh's father. Evan prevents the incident by yelling and threatening the man. At the time of the incident Evan was 7 years old. Kayleigh's father was suddenly intimidated by the young Evan when he began talking back to him. I found this ridiculous as the man so easily went from commanding the children to being terrified of Evan. Most of the exposition in the first half hour of the film got the same response from me. <br/><br/>I will admit that the film did get slightly better once the characters grew up and the actual time traveling began. However, it was only a small step up. The acting improved quite a bit from the childhood sequence, but the film was marred by the complete lack of chemistry between Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. Ashton Kutcher surpassed my expectations of his acting ability in the movie, if only slightly. His acting was still bad but it wasn't terrible like I expected it to be. He delivered his lines with little to no emotion throughout most of the film which eventually got distracting.<br/><br/>
I watched the director's cut of the film which included a different ending than the theatrical version. I have read about the theatrical ending and was happy I saw the director's cut. Even though neither ending is fantastic I prefer the one I saw, no matter how predictable it was, as it matched the dark tones that were present throughout the rest of the film. I give ""The Butterfly Effect"" a * rating.

","First off, the is only slightly entertaining, but that is about all it is good for. The profound meaning that everybody keeps talking about, that everything in the past can affect the present (or future)... who cares? Time travel is impossible. What's done is done. Second, this is not an original idea at all. The Simpsons Halloween Special IV has an episode featuring Homer traveling through time and everything he does has an adverse affect, finally he settles with something that is close to how things were. Other movies such as Donnie Darko also use this idea, but Donnie Darko was a much better film. Thirdly, the film had too many flaws, the fact that he was so confused after his first time travel despite the fact the film showed his new memories being created. He would have known how he got there, and he was not confused the second, third, etc. time that he traveled through time. Also, the fact that he was still in prison after the stigmata holes. The dog burning? That was completely unnecessary, it really showed nothing and was just cruel. The movie would have been infinitely better had it turned out that Evan truly could not travel through time as the doctor tells him when he demands his journals, that would be an unexpected ending, and made the movie less cheesy. I do not see what the hype is about, the movie is good for entertainment purposes only, and it even falters in that. 3.5 stars (out of 10)."

","I've written at least five reviews explaining why sci-fi movies everyone finds oh-so-original aren't original. Everything from 12 Monkeys to Déjà Vu, it seems there isn't a single sci-fi movie that can stand on its own two feet anymore. They all use tired, unoriginal plot lines that have been used over and over again on The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, if not both. It's just sad. The Butterfly Effect follows their example. But what makes The Butterfly effect even worse is that it it isn't clever like it thinks it is; there are so many plot holes, it's simply laughable to anyone who has enough intelligence to understand the plot of a children's cartoon. And I've seen plenty of cartoons that are insanely more intelligent than The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect opens with a cliché ""hook"" that your 9th grade English teacher taught you about. A guy can change his pastI'm sure if I hadn't seen it a hundred other times, I'd be interested.

If it were something that only a hundred other movies have done, not thousands, I may be slightly less sarcastic when I say: how creative! A ""psychological"" undertone with no more intelligence than saying ""crazy people are crazy"". What movie would be complete without one these days? The problems I just mentioned are enough to earn the score it did from me, but from there the movie only gets worse. Minus Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart, there isn't a single actor in the movie who doesn't act with such an over-the-top vibe I laughed more than once. The cheesy dialogue brings the unintentional comedy even further. The cinematography is very amateur. What did the two directors do all day? It takes two directors to direct this terribly? Now for a taste of the major plot holes: - In more than one case, if he were to go back and change ONE variable to what he just did (ie: not stand by the mailbox) everything would have been fine. The writers must have realized this but thought it was too anti-climactic, so they decide to have him to contentiously try different pasts to get one right. Am I all the only one who finds this laughable? - Then there is the times the movie just downright lacks logic. One character is thrown in jail for . . . self defense? And there are plenty of other scenes just like that. Are the writers really that stupid? Did I mention the movie has the overall entertainment level of watching a tree stump die? Disregard whatever you thought this movie was going to beit's a stale, cliché drama and nothing more. The movie moves along at a medium-slow pace, and at some points it may even seem somewhat fast . . . until you realize it's just repeating itself. There is no entertainment value. Yes, I guess I can say it is somewhat compelling at points, but in the end what does it matter? It's forgettable. I watched it for the first time a day ago and I've already forgotten everything that I didn't write down in my notes to write in this review.<br/><br/>Yet ANOTHER problem was the immaturity of the entire movie. Sure, I give it props for at least trying to be anti-politically correct, but it's done in a fashion that is just immature. Instead of actually making the anti-politically correct scenes a part of the movie, they're there for cheap shock value. I, personally, love shock valuebut when it's a part of the story. Not to mention none of the wannabe shocking moments (that didn't shock me) are off-screen because the directors obviously don't have the balls to actually make a movie that lives up to the R-rating this film received.<br/><br/>Overall, I just see no point in watching The Butterfly Effect unless you were deprived of cartoons as a kid, because I've seen this plot used on every show Nickelodeon has aired. That's how immature and unoriginal it is. Some people will find the cliché boy-must-save-girl plot compelling, but, to those people, can I ask why? Maybe it's because you prefer safe, tired plots that have even less audacity than a cliché metal band writing lyrics about the nonexistence of God. As if we haven't seen either beforecountless times. And what bothers me so much about movies like this is how they always think they're so original, or so punk.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect = pointless.<br/><br/>0/10"

The use of children in scenes with graphic violence and gross sexual implications here is too far over the top. Two children are standing naked in front of a man taking pictures in a dark basement. A child bludgeons a teenager at a movie theater while smiling. A child puts a dog in a burlap bag and pours gas all over it. Enough already! I shut it off after that (my wife assured me that she was not going to watch anymore as I came to the same conclusion)! <br/><br/>It's painful enough to read this let alone watch it.<br/><br/>It is absolutely possible to make a point without resorting to such measures (tasteful being the operative word).

The basic plot of the movie was like he doesn't like something-fixes it-something else goes wrong- he fixes it...not much of a plot there. And a complete no-brainer.

","Young boy with a perplexing, unexplained medical condition--blacking out at crucial points in his life, only to wake up later confused about what has transpired--grows into a rambunctious college student proud that he hasn't had a black-out in seven years (I would think the fact he has avoided jail-time after his run-ins with delinquency would count for much more). After re-reading his childhood journals, he finds he has the ability to go back in time and change the past, which gets him into more trouble. Written and directed by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a supremely crass, supremely empty movie. It wants to be audacious and button-pushing, but for whom? Disenfranchised, multiplex kids with bad manners? It presents its supernatural hook only to dress up a much more familiar issue: why unsupervised, anti-social teens turn to violence. In the lead, Ashton Kutcher, also an executive producer, walks through the picture hunched over, rolling his eyes; if its possible that the movie represents anything--such as, say, a lobotomized society of young people--Kutcher's non-acting does nothing to give us hope. Kutcher is not rebellious, nor alienated, nor intrinsically smart. He's not a funny wise-ass. His vacuousness is used for guilt--not shame, just boring old guilt--and yet his expression barely changes in between ghastly episodes. The film is targeted at audiences of the lowest common denominator (much like the characters depicted on-screen). They will surely praise it...to put the movie down would be admitting self-defeat.

As the doctor said toward the end, Evan (and his father before him, who was deeply disturbed too) had created a disease that ""doesn't exist.""

I prefer the commercial happy sappy ending showed in the deleted scenes of the theatrical version. I do not know how common this system is in USA, but in Brazil, we do not have any Infinifilm DVD.

"nick_812","3","3","7","7 November 2012"," Thank god I didn't pay money to see this.
","The Butterfly Effect starring (the young and almost desperate to be taken seriously) Ashton Kutcher, is an utterly horrible film. The content was truly gut-wrenching (as it should be), but the filming of it all was utterly appalling. You'd think that with two directors, you may be able to get a small amount of continuity flaws and plot holes, but it seems that double the chefs, double the poison in the stew.<br/><br/>I can say however, that the content of this film is very much in the style of the mind-bending, psychological thrillers of the 90's, such as Se7en and Fight Club. The pure gut wrenching moment as the mother holding her baby walks towards the bomb triggered letterbox, puts you on the edge of your seat. However, the character of Tommy Miller, a sadistic young man who started out being friends with Evan, until Evan expresses his feelings towards Tommy's sister Kayleigh, is a bit too spontaneous. The character starts off as an immature prankster, but suddenly he is this assaulting, foul-mouthed, homicidal arson. Tommy does feel neglected when his father always 'shows his sister more attention' when he puts her in his molestation films. But again, it's a far-fetched idea.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was depressing, confusing, sickening and deplorable. I would strongly suggest that you avoid this film, if you are not strong with extremely sudden shocking images. This film is very confronting, in more ways than one."
"karlhinze","5","3","7","8 January 2007"," Gripping isn't the word
","I think this has to go down as one of the most encapsulating and thrilling movies I have ever seen. From the off, this has you fixed, and it doesn't let go right til the end.<br/><br/>The film is about a young man who has blackouts as a child and later in life finds a way of remembering and returning to his blackouts. He also realises a way to change what happened with the help of his journal. A journal that he'd kept since not long after his blackouts began. Except each time he changes his past, there are relatively unforeseeable consequences. Bad ones. That's where this movie revels. Each consequence is quite unpredictable. What's going to happen next? Now I think his last return is, even if the most predictable, a brilliant touch.<br/><br/>This was actually the first film I'd seen Ashton Kutcher in, and I hadn't heard good things about him. But I was actually quite surprised with his performance. OK he wasn't exactly worth an award or anything, but he certainly wasn't bad.<br/><br/>The only reason I've not given this a higher rating is that there were 2 different endings, one made for US audiences and one for the UK, so I believe. I've only seen one of the endings - the one I hear is the happier of the two. It was a great finale, but it was as if you can choose which film to watch, based on how happy you like endings to be. I think a film should end how it's supposed to. Which is why I refuse to see the other ending.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it's still a brilliant film."
"Coventry","7","3","7","17 October 2005"," Good film, surprisingly raw and obscure!
","Although the twisted premise of ""The Butterfly Effect"" definitely sounded like my cup of tea, I was reluctant to go and see it right away, simply because I feared that the film would revolve too much on the popular teen-idol Aston Kutcher and also because it was very likely that sentiment and feel-good twists would overrule the obscurity of the basic story. Well, I'm happy to admit that I was totally wrong (happens quite often) and that ""The Butterfly Effect"" is, in fact, a powerful and honest thriller. Unlike other nowadays so-called thrillers that star popular names, the directors of this film are not afraid to add despair and in-your-face shocks, which makes it an involving and often unsettling cinema effort. Kutcher, these days better known as Demi Moore's toy-boy, also proves himself to be a fairly strong actor, capable of showing a wide range of emotions. He stars as Evan, an adolescent who suffers from severe blackouts every time he faces a trauma or difficult moment. He learns that, through these blackouts, he can cause a time warp and travel back to his childhood years when he and his circle of friends made some horrible, future-defining mistakes. He can then alter the past for everyone involved, which makes the film feel like a amalgamation of ""Stand By Me"" and ""Time Cop"". This mood-setting introduction is already quite good, with nice character developing and some hard sequences (Eric Stoltz in his vicious basement!) but the film even gets better when it seems that every time-travel goes horribly wrong. The moral of the story thus is that life can never be satisfying for everybody at once and that certain sacrifices eventually seems inevitable. You know that you've been watching a good film when you and the people you've seen it with are still discussing the story (and more particularly, the climax) hours after finishing it. ""The Butterfly Effect"" is such a film."
"juliankennedy23","4","3","7","12 May 2005"," Can I Blame a Butterfly in China for this Film?
","The Butterfly Effect: 4/10: The first 40 minutes of The Butterfly Effect are tough sledding. It's not incompetent film-making mind you. If anything the film is simply too effective. Literally showing the world's worst childhood. It is so much of a downer with child molestation, baby killing and burning puppies that it's almost a Stephen King parody. I guess there is a reason we repress memories after all. I would repress that childhood as well. <br/><br/>The film to that point kind of reminded me of Sleepers where it was so unpleasant it didn't matter how good the movie is. It's certainly nothing I would ever want to see again. Then the movie takes a wild turn as Ashton Kutcher shows up. As easy a target as he is I hate to admit the second two-thirds of the film are really not his fault. <br/><br/>Some notes to writer/directors Eric Briss and J. Mackye Gruber. If your going to have scenes in a prison you might want to visit one first, or at least watch a documentary on the same. Speaking of documentaries ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and other eighties comedies are not a documentaries on college life. Sororities do not resemble the Playboy Mansion. And twenty-three year old crack whores often look bad but they tend not to resemble a Dawn of the Dead extra. <br/><br/>If The Butterfly Effect didn't keep flashing back to the puppy and baby horrors, then the second two thirds would be a hoot. There is even a ""hey there is a psycho chasing me lets take a walk in the dark woods"" scene. <br/><br/>Since Kutcher's time travel effects only his friends and family and nothing else at all. The Butterfly Effect inadvertently substantiates the reverse of the Butterfly theorem.<br/><br/>Needless to say the change in tone from the childhood scenes and adult scenes is jarring. Though most of the humor in the adult scenes is admittedly unintentional. Kutcher travels back in time by staring at notebook paper. I tried the same technique staring at my screen. It didn't work I still lost two hours."

Aston Kutcher has the inexplicable power to go back in time by reading his journal entries, and change events. But every time he does so, he hurts someone else. This film carries some emotional depth, but Kutcher seems out of his league. After watching it, I was reminded of the movie Bedazzled with Brendan Fraser, which suffers from the same problems. The problem is that by showing us all these possible futures, it's too much of an information overload. Also, you don't really get to know the characters because they change so many times. There are some interesting elements, but i ultimately detested this movie. It was derivative, nauseating and overdone. 4/10"

""The Butterfly Effect"" tries the same thing with a straight face, and it simply does not work. The worse things got, the more I would laugh. The performances are all solid, but cannot overcome the banal script. I was also annoyed by the fact that the actors portraying Ashton Kutcher's character as a child were obviously much older than the ages given in the film. (And what young boy could draw a picture that well, anyway?) The ending of the Director's Cut is more effective, but not enough to recommend this.<br/><br/>** (on a scale of zero to five stars)."
"jrfranklin01","6","3","7","30 June 2004"," Great idea but denies title
","The title The Butterfly Effect refers to the ability of even the beating wings of a butterfly to upset the balance of the world. For time travel, even the slightest change can dramatically alter the future. While this movie excels in creativity, much like Donnie Darko, it presents too many holes in direct violation of the premise of its title. <br/><br/>For instance, (SPOILER) when Evan (Aston Kutcher) is trying to prove to his prison cellmate that Jesus talks to him, he goes back in time as a child and stabs his hands into two sharp points. When he comes back to the present, he is still in the prison cell with the scars on his hands. If even a butterfly's wings can alter the course of history, then surely that act could have completely altered Evan's future to where he may not even be in prison anymore.<br/><br/>Maybe as a way to compensate for this paradoxical display, the movie goes overboard in the opposite direction by showing how Evan can alter people through words (such as his confrontation of Kayleigh's dad). And in almost all the scenarios Tommy turns out a bad seed, except for his illogical saving of a mom and her baby. He then becomes something of a born-again Christian. It's too big a stretch. <br/><br/>Basically the concept is very creative for this film but more attention to detail could have been given to make for a more convincing and concrete story. Granted, it is hard to manipulate alternate futures to reach the best outcome, but then again, that is the theme behind the movie."

The Butterfly Effect is a great combination of deep themes (making smart choices in life) and action. <br/><br/>Similar to the films Big and Face/Off, it has a wacky premise but the film glosses over it and gets right to the action rather than fumbling around trying to explain it.<br/><br/>The plot is as consistent and tight as Back To the Future, and it's thrilling throughout. Since the film is a series of disconnected vignettes (similar to Memento), the acting and direction have to be really good to not get the viewer lost. They are. The only critique I might make is that the themes are a little too adult to be used as a moral <br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Teenagers<br/><br/>-- Everyone who's up for an action drama, it's not really sci-fi<br/><br/>I'll give ""The Butterfly Effect"" a solid 9 out of 10.

I think it would have had much more impact with the 'twist' being that there were no journals and the explanation of time travel being a figment of Evans imagination to justify the death of Kayleigh at his own hands.<br/><br/>This obviously would have meant that the climax was a downer and maybe this would have resulted in fewer ticket sales, but this would have been much more compelling and powerful ending and would certainly have been more plausible than leaving the audience to swallow the time travel as fact.

Anyways, my point is this. This movie is trying so hard to be serious, and Ashton tries, he really does. But even though the performances are worthwhile, this film is ridiculous. The premise and outcome make absolutely no sense, and the rules that apply to the gimmick of the ""Butterfly Effect"" don't even apply logically, just only when called for. It's also a little sad because I read the movie as something for trauma-victims or just people who have been ""victimized"" to watch. Some of the content in here about younger victims and sex and violence verges on cheesy exploitation, both in narrative, and exploitation of the actors who had to perform the scenes on film that served no purpose to a film that could have thought of a billion different ways to shoot something and didn't. I just think this film has a little bit of a ""Final Destination"" quality to it that it shouldn't have. Sure, trauma and violence is real, but this film plays both like they are candy to be consumed, glossy entertainment products with ""shock value"" that will actually produce laughter instead of sympathy for the characters involved. It tries so many things. It does a ""Stand by Me"" thing with all the kids. It does a ""Final Destination"" thing with all the shocking violence. It does ""Kiddie Porn Dungeon Sequence"" that's just TRYING to make you squirm(this is the exploitation of which I speak), it does the spoofy sci-fi gimmick that has been around forever. What it doesn't do is stop for a moment for it's characters to reflect, and I think with a certain amount of reflection, the main character would have committed suicide a long time before the chronological time line that this film started in."

","Have you ever wondered how differently your life might have turned out had you taken a left turn instead of a right on the day of that fateful accident, or chosen a different college or career path, or not gone to that dance the night you met your one true love?  All of us have played this `what if' game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?<br/><br/>This is the premise for `The Butterfly Effect,' an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.<br/><br/>Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early Â‘20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core. <br/><br/>Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.  He's a young man who genuinely wants to make things better for the people he cares for, yet the mental anguish he is going through as he attempts to piece together some semblance of comprehensible reality from the jumbled fragments of his life comes through loud and clear.<br/><br/>`The Butterfly Effect' is not your usual mind-numbing, schlock thriller.  It has intelligence and style and a very intriguing storyline.  It will probably get you rewinding some of those key events in your own life, wondering might have been."
"jpintar","3","4","11","6 July 2004"," Worst movie of the year
","The Butterfly Effect may be the worst I have seen this year.  It has good performances and an intriguing story, but all for naught.  The film is too long, too dark, and too depressing.  What were the writers of this film thinking by making a film about time travel in which none of the alternate realities is appealing?  I know Ashton Kutchner,Demi Moore's boy toy, is trying to stretch as an actor, but he is overshadowed by his much better co-stars who are much better.  No matter which ending (the DVD has no fewer than four) you choose, it is not worth going through this grim tale.  If I wanted to watch something depressing, I'll make a movie about my life.  My advice: just talk to a therapist and skip this piece of junk.  You may need therapy after this downer of a movie.  3/10"

","The trailer for this film made it look like a mess. Giving us far too much information in a few seconds and turning me completely off it. I only saw it at the cinema because there was nothing else on and I'm glad I gave it a tiny chance.<br/><br/>The concept is intriguing and the execution is brilliantly done. Set at three different stages in the lives of the four main characters we are quickly familiar with the sometimes curious, sometimes devastating events that shape their lives. The relationships between Evan, Kalley, Lenny and Tommy are very well developed and it's very interesting to watch them twist and change as Evan suffers from constant black-outs, Tommy goes totally insane and Kalley and Lenny even insaner. Almost all of them end up in the nut-house at some point.<br/><br/>It's at this point that the older Evan (a horrifically bearded, pre-packaged, homogenised and sexually neutral 'pretty boy' Ashton Kutcher) decides to time travel back to his childhood, thanks to his incredible memory (how this is achieved is never explained!!!) and put right what once went wrong. Only each time he tries he just makes things worse and worse.<br/><br/>
The storylines involving the younger quartet are truly the best bits of the film. The young Tommy is one of the most evil and depraved characters I have ever seen and the younger Evan is far more interesting than his future counterpart. Whenever the film flashes forward to the college years I found it extremely lagging and wished for another time travel scene. Ashton Kutcher was far less expressive than his younger actors.<br/><br/>
And am I the only one noticing several nods to Se7en? Not only do they go see the movie as kids (how they got in is never explained either but I'm assuming they got tickets for Dumb and Dumber and sneaked in) but Evan's journals (his method of time travel!) are exactly the same as John Doe's and are written in the same manner. A curious bit of trivia indeed.<br/><br/>
For a film with a great story, a few scares and wonderfully (if not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out. Tho I have one thing to ask the older Evan. What do you think is going to happen to your body if you stand in front of a mailbox being exploded by a lethal stick of dynamite???"

","This is American psychological thriller film directed by Eric Bress and Mackye Gruder. This is story is made from the butterfly effect, one of the chaos theory's idea. <br/><br/>The protagonist named Evan has sometimes lost the small part of his memory. In the case of losing any part of his memory, he has written diary since he was young. One day, he found out his ability to go back in time when he is reading his diary. His childhood friend, Kayleigh, has misery living with his father. Evan knows this Kayleigh's situation is owing to Evan. He decides to change his destiny to use his time travel skill. He challenges but cannot make it. Every time he go back in time and make different decision, something wrong is happened and somebody is going to be unhappy. He wants to make Kayleigh's life happier with no sacrifice. But he understand this is impossible. Then he goes back to the time when they met at the first time.<br/><br/>Skillfully made story is amazing. Particularly, the last scene is moving. I think time traveling is the dream which everybody has wished at least one time. But this film shows us that changing the past is very risky. If I were Evan, I will do the same thing even if how sad I am."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","4","21 November 2015"," Quite simply one of the best supernatural thrillers ever made
","I feel like The Butterfly Effect wasn't taken as seriously as it could of been, or awarded the kind of praise it deserves because of pretty boy Ashton Kutcher taking on the lead role. I wouldn't blame people, because most of the time the acting choices he makes are asinine with a side of silly. This is a huge exception, however. He not only chose a mature, super interesting script, but put in a good effort and played his lead character with surprising skill. The film was marketed as a stylish, disturbing psychological thriller with paranormal undertones, which is exactly what it is. What it didn't plainly advertise was the core of the story, an extremely tragic romance that jerks at your heartstrings, making the otherworldly elements count for something more than just thrills by anchoring them in the simple, intimate story of two people dealing with hard lives, dangerous forces and unbreakable love. Plus, there's time travel, which automatically puts any film in my good books. Kutcher stars as Evan, a young college lad with an extremely troubled past that he's gone a long way to forget. Parts of it are harrowing, parts of it are confusing, but they're tied together by his childhood friend and one true love Kayleigh (Amy Smart), who by an unfortunate chain of events, ended up lost to him. He's constantly haunted by these recollections, and finds a vague, esoteric way to revisit them, through a mysterious diary he finds. This, however, provides a volatile link to the past, and entices him to attempt to sift back into the sands of time and try to prevent the suffering that him, Kayleigh and their childhood friends went through, by their own hand, and at the behest of other nasty people in their lives. Warned in flashbacks by his mentally troubled father (underrated Callum Keith Rennie) about the ramifications of his actions, he ventures forth into the great supernatural unknown all the same. In any film about time travel, the results of going back and meddling with the past always result in some shocking twists back home in the present. This film takes this idea and runs around the bases with it. Every attempt he makes to alter the mistakes and horror from his past only make things achingly worse every time he arrives back in his own when. The film also has a very bleak, unhappy tone that leaves you in an emotional gutter, but it's in that sadness and despair that I get a cinematic high a lot of the time. I guess I'm weird that way. Every valiant attempt at saving Kayleigh from her sick, abusive father (Eric Stoltz in a rare grimy turn that will make you shiver and want to run) turns sour, as does whatever he does to alleviate suffering brought on by irresponsible actions of himself and other two friends who grow up to be more messed up than him. The story is given way more care and attention than you'd expect from trailers or marketing, and remains a favourite of mine in the grisly sub genre of paranormal/psychological fare. It's also just a damn good story, focusing on character development and deeply reflecting on the actions of one man, and how they might ripple through the psychosphere and do more harm than the initially intended good. Ethan Suplee, Eldon Hanson, Cameron Bright, Kevin Durand, Melora Walters and Logan Lerman also make vivid impressions. There are two versions, a theatrical and a director's cut. Though considerably different in their conclusions, they both offer endings that will have you choking back tears for different, equally heartbreaking reasons. I prefer the theatrical one, as it's not quite as suffocating as the other, and just provides the perfect drop of hope in the sea of sadness that we've just witnessed, and just suits the film more overall."
"AbhiMathews","10","2","4","26 May 2014"," Chaos Theory
","Life is unpredictable. The very stroke of a pen, random smile you glance upon, or even the flutter of a butterfly's wings can completely alter the future. Often we try to play God, but the reoccurring theme is that it's futile.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is an exceptionally beautiful movie since it eloquently outlines the persistence of man to continually search for the ""perfect"" change despite constant failures. Humans work tirelessly for goals yet don't quite realize when it's time to let nature run its course. It's hard to accept we are inadequate; it's even harder to let something we love go. <br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is: thrilling, endearing, lively, romantic, disturbing and thought-provoking all simultaneously. It's a film that explores the boundaries on psychiatry and misunderstanding, phenomenology and free will, and is one that will undoubtedly impress."

","The reason I gave this movie 10/10 is because of its ability to explain what most of our parents cannot. Like.. go to school... don't do drugs... watch out for your sister etc. Well yes perhaps many of you listen to your parents. I for one did sometimes... but that is because my parents couldn't explain why (I'm not one to really obey but a learner, I needed reason). Well if you have kids that are much like me this movie is a great tool to put things into preservative. If I do this now what will it cause? Of course the the butterfly effect or chaos theory is a long known theory. Some things you do not want to learn on your own (that's why there is parenting). I gave this movie a 10/10 for alternative perspective plus the meaning of good parenting and life lessons. (not saying the mom in the movie was a bad parent)"
"sanddragon939","10","2","4","26 July 2011"," The Bittersweet Effect
","The Butterfly Effect is one of the most intriguing time travel films I've come across. A lot of time travel films focus a lot on temporal paradoxes, how to avoid them, and their consequences, or alternatively on the idea of predestination and the unavoidable fate...The Butterfly Effect though completely disregards all conventional time travel theory and talk of paradoxes, and instead seeks to use time travel as a means to convey a meaningful message-even if one had the power to play God, one can never truly set everything right because there is no such thing as a perfect world...<br/><br/>This is the lesson which the protagonist Evan Treborn (played masterfully by Ashton Kutcher) rather brutally learns, when he discovers his ability to revisit certain pivotal and traumatic events in his past and change them. When he returns to the present, he discovers that the smallest of changes he made to the past have compounded over time to literally create a new reality. As Evan explores these alternate realities and alternate lives he's created for himself, he discovers that in each of them, something has gone horribly wrong, either for himself or for his friends and family. This compels him to go back and change things again, only to make them worse each time. Ultimately, he does succeed in creating what is arguably as close to a 'perfect' world as is possible, but the sacrifice he's had to make has turned what should have been a 'happy ending' into a bittersweet one at best.<br/><br/>I think one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie is that how the smallest of changes can completely change the course of an individual's destiny and shape his or her personalities in completely unpredictable ways (much like the real-life concept of the 'butterfly effect' teaches how the smallest of actions can have unprecedented results over time)...and Evan's reactions to these alternate versions of his friends and family are interesting to behold. So in one reality, his love interest's a traumatized young waitress, in another she's a happy sorority sister, in yet another she's a prostitute, and she actually ends up as a corpse a couple of times...another childhood friend of the protagonist goes from being a psychopathic potential murderer in one reality to being a devout Christian missionary in another! And let's not forget the numerous avatars of Evan himself in each reality, some of them hilarious, others tragic...<br/><br/>The cast have all done a pretty good job, but ultimately its the story, and the underlying moral behind it, that makes this film a winner..."
"LittleBella","9","2","4","24 August 2008"," Bad Reviews? Really?
","Okay, I guess I can see why some people wouldn't like this movie. It's not for everyone to love. It definitely shouldn't have been labeled a horror movie. It's a good, thrilling fantasy that really makes you think.<br/><br/>I loved the beginning with Logan Lerman (future star of the short-lived but amazing Jack and Bobby). The blackout scenes were done very well, and Logan was very mature. Moving on, six years later, John Patrick Amedori plays Evan at 13 and does a spectacular job. The scene where Tommy burns Evan's dog was absolutely heart-wrenching. Jesse James, who played Tommy, was appropriately creepy and sociopathic and horrifying. Irene Gorovaia was not given much to work with for Kayleigh, but she did a very good job nonetheless.<br/><br/>The later scenes with Ashton Kutcher were a little weird for me. I've never seen the Dude, Where's My... movies, but I have watched Punk'd a little and I understand the stereotype that comes with the name ""Ashton"". But seriously, people should give him a chance. He wasn't flawless as Evan, granted, but he was good. Amy Smart was amazing, spot on in each reality for whatever Kayleigh she was playing.<br/><br/>Overall, the story really drew me in and captivated me. I am very interested in the Chaos Theory and this movie definitely gave me something to twist my brain around. I really liked the theatrical ending when he goes back to when he first met Kayleigh and tells her he hates her. It was very bittersweet, because Evan would always be able to remember her as she was in the other realities, and she would have no idea that Evan even knew her name.<br/><br/>9/10. Come on, critics, what were you thinking? Although I guess they were the same ones who praised No Country For Old Men, which I hated."

But I stayed away. Because of him.<br/><br/>So when I watched it, I was completely blown away. It's very well done. Maybe some of the ideas weren't fully explored, but they did an excellent job with what they did explore, given the time constraints on a feature-length film.<br/><br/>By the end, I'd totally forgotten the main character was Ashton Kutcher.

","I watched this film when it came out on DVD and was fairly sceptical.. Before this I'd only seen Ashton Kucher in That 70s Show and he can do comedy but wasn't sure about anything else..But from the 1st minute Iwas gripped every time it went back in time he made it worse and you just feel for him by the end when he has to make a horrible decision in both the theatrical and Directors cut versions. Even Amy Smart acts well in this one as she has to take up several different personalities during the film and she does so with great success. I could watch this film over and over again it is just that good.<br/><br/>P.S. There is one big plot hole, you are sat there for a bit thinking why doesn't he go back to the same point again and again to change what he messed up??? They do however get round this by saying that his memory bank is too full and keeps on writing over itself so not actually sure if it was a plot hole or just a poor excuse Apart from this though GREAT FILM 10/10"
"eaaaw","8","2","4","28 January 2007"," This film did not deserve to end up in the trash bin.
","I found the director's cut DVD of this amazing movie in a special deals bin -- the kind of place where the duds end up -- how undeserved that turned out to be! Coupled with a total lack of publicity in Europe (where complex stories and ambiguous endings are perhaps better appreciated) I think that a few heads need to roll in the marketing department.<br/><br/>The title attracted me. Of all the time travel stories I read, Ray Bradbury's story about the death of a single butterfly affecting life millions of years in the future is one of my favorites. Edward Lorenz might have known about the story or not when he coined the term ""butterfly effect""... in any case the kind of butterfly effect that happens in the movie is Ray Bradbury's as much, if not more, than Lorenz's.<br/><br/>I just finished watching it and I must say that it's an excellent film. Much, much better than I expected. The story is good and wonderfully terse. The mystery is well paced. The acting, particularly the performance of the young actors and the two leads, is good. The humor is sensibly toned down in favor of the suspense.<br/><br/>From the start you are exposed to the main character's uncertainties and you follow him along his agonizing journey towards his inevitable ultimate conclusions. Evan's bewilderment and the way his friends react to him are shown quite well. The irony in the story is that the more Evan finds out about himself and the more he thinks he can change his destiny and the fates of his loved ones, the more things are slipping out of control. <br/><br/>Alternate universes give actors and actresses plenty of scope to portray their characters in different ways, and we get to see some fine performances here. Not only depicting what differing circumstances might do to their development, but also showing that they have a potentially happy and balanced person inside of them that only needs to seize the opportunity to come out.<br/><br/>It is a little over-simplistic to say that single events make or destroy a person's chance of a happy life. Minds are trapped more effectively by a bad combination of circumstances than a single circumstance, and modern society has many public servants trained to recognize children who are at risk. For the sake of the story, schoolteachers, health officials and police who might have saved the children from their traumas were all sleeping. In the real world they would be a little more astute, I am sure.<br/><br/>In other ways, once you suspend your disbelief in time travel, the action is very realistic and told in a refreshingly unadorned manner. Attention to many small details make viewing the movie several times a pleasurable experience.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoyed the classic SF time travel stories. It is a time-travel story well told, mixing the butterfly effect, making changes in the past, and the frustration of not being able to do good.<br/><br/>For those who love the movie who haven't read the SF time travel classics -- you'll love them. Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder"", the original Butterfly story. Isaac Asimov's ""The End of Eternity"", with its many plot twists. Poul Anderson wrote no less than three classics on time travel, ""Time Patrol"", ""There Will Be Time"" and ""The Corridors Of Time"", all very different. All these books were published in the fifties and early sixties."
"houndtang","8","2","4","21 September 2005"," Unusual film
","Considering that 'The Butterfly Effect' is a mainstream Hollywood film with a teen-movie cast, it is surprisingly dark and imaginative. The time travel plot is reminiscent of an excellent novel 'Replay' by Ken Grimwood but is fairly fresh in cinematic terms. There are some very bleak themes in here - paedophilia, mental illness, prison rape, murder and the interesting idea that no matter what path the hero chooses he makes things worse either for himself or his friends. This is also one of the few films where the studio ending is better than the director's cut - the original ending where he chokes himself to death in the womb crosses the line from dark to plain silly."

","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>I saw this movie in theatre and I saw directors cut at home. I can tell you what: I disagree that just changing the end can make this movie the more valuable contribution in cinematography then it really is. Ending alone is NOT enough to change the movie rank. This is a simple non-sophisticated entertainment movie in either case with only difference is director's cut has a non-Hollywood, non-standard ending which again, alone can not make this movie stronger than it is in theatrical versions. <br/><br/>Looks like to me director just pretends here that he or she makes something like another ""Amerrican Beauty"" or ""The Cuucoo over the nest"" . Just flipping ending can not make him Milos Forman. I'll tell you that this just looks ridiculous. The whole movie is meant to be a Hollywood-cheesy-entertainment-destined thing with standard ending. In director's cut it is the same but now it is Hollywood-cheesy-entertainment-destined thing with NON-standard ending.<br/><br/>Big difference.:) <br/><br/>But I do not think I lost something watching this thing. Just saw some directors can not only pretend, (I mean fool themselves) they do something valuable but also put a big part of public in deception. But I understand the feelings of this part of public. We all are tired with standard Hollywood flicks but again flipping ending is not the way to do serious work. The guy obviously tries to pursue both targets: 1. Get as much box office as he can to justify big budget so voila, happy end and 2) have some naive public thinking he (the director) is worth more then he really is.<br/><br/>In single the word, this is a shame for director."

","You know, I liked 'The Butterfly Effect,' but I cannot fully explain why. Because of the original novel, the movie feels like a derivative measure through adding up to an audience who wouldn't understand it any other way. Add to the implausibility of some scenes, and this movie would simply stink. But the acting is good. Great and convincing in fact, with Kutcher pulling out all the stops. Sometimes you can tell when actors give it their best.<br/><br/>A child is raised with blackouts during high stress moments and is asked by doctor and mother to record what happens through his diary. 13 years later, blackouts gone and working hard at University, Evan's actions in the past come back to haunt him. Through his newfound discovery and written diaries, he hopes to change all that.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the idea behind 'The Butterfly Effect.' Chaos is tested in its utmost (and stretched) form. It works, even if the movie doesn't. Add to the acting of the movie (the child actors are just as good as the adults), and you have a solid production that works around a wonky script."

If you are a young, good-looking male such as my self then maybe you might enjoy this film. Not to make this feel like a Personal(by the way I actually do like long walks on the beach) I am a very smart, Human Biology major and a self described ""film enthusiast"", I actually liked this film a lot. Some people that are a little bit too uptight may be mad that such a good looking kid like Asthon Kutcher got the lead part (Somone that time travels, just can't be hittin' Demi Moore) however he actually blends very well into the part of a confused young person that does not know what is going on, because if you time travel as much as he does in this film you might just have that ""dude where is my (insert lost item here)"" look. Ashton does a great job, hands down, no questions asked. Amy Smart proves beyond her ""plain-looking-cuteness"", as my frat boy friend described, that she is capable to pull of a semi-complex role and that is more than a lot of Hollywood actresses can say. The supporting cast is just that, Supporting. No one steals the role, no one shines, but they do an excellent job of just being there....no matter what life is chosen. <br/><br/>Alright, no matter what, if you have ever been interested in time travel and you are NOT pretentious or a very unlucky bastard that wishes that everything had gone your way instead of ""pretty-boy-ashton-kutcher's"" way, then watch this film, you will enjoy it just for the concept and for the way that a fellow human beings life plays out by the choices made in life."

","* some spoilers *<br/><br/>The underlying philosophical issue of this film is: It is with the lightness of the flutter of a butterfly's wings that we make day-to-day decisions, but those decisions can ultimately lead to radically different outcomes in our lives.  One of the characters, when her parents divorce, decides to stay with her sexually-abusive father instead of her kind mother and that makes the difference between her becoming a crack whore instead of a sorority girl.  This issue is dealt with more formally in Milan Kundera's great novel 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'<br/><br/>The film goes further to ask the question 'What if?'  What if we could go back and change the bad decision -- would that make for a better world? Unfortunately, no, because the choice to avert one disaster may in fact be the genesis of another.<br/><br/>These are questions that you can find yourself debating long after the plot of this wonderful movie fades from your mind.

","I just saw The Butterfly Effect tonight and I was so amazed. I absolutely LOVED it! It was so good. I was not bored for one moment and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next. Some of the scenes were disturbing and hard to watch but they were significant to the movie. Ashton Kutcher has proven himself that he can do drama. I think he did a very good job. I kept thinking to myself, was that really the same guy who was the host of Punk'd and who was in Dude, Where's My Car? (Although I do like that movie.) It was kind of unbelievable. I really enjoyed how they didn't make is character mean and sadistic because of his traumatic childhood. He was a real softie. Every time he would do something bad (mainly when he was an adult) he would have this scared look on his face and he couldn't believe what he had done. For example, when he killed Tommy he wasn't happy that he did it. He realized that it was an accident. And when he yelled at the fellow frat boy when he asked him the Greek alphabet he truly felt sorry for what he had done. That made me enjoy the movie even more. I did get kind of puzzled because there were so many jumping-back-in-time events and the sound in the theater would get so loud every time that they would happen I would have to cover my ears. But this movie was just great. I couldn't explain it to anyone if I had to. I'd just have to tell them to go see it for yourself! I'm glad Ashton took this role. It was a good change for him. The Butterfly Effect is now on my favorite movie list. I will own it when it comes out on video. I wish I didn't have to wait 5 months though! But it's worth it. Anyways.

I didn't expect much because its Ashton Kutcher but holy crap I think he was extremely close to an Oscar nomination. He blew me away. Great movie. Great acting.

","Let me try to describe this complex movie in a nutshell, Evan gets severe headaches that cause him to suffer blackouts. While unconscious, he is able to travel back in time and alter the past but this causes drastic changes in his present life.
Writing, Directing and Acting in this kind of complex movie requires much of the efforts because altering timelines are always tricky as every detailing needs to be addressed every time and Kudos for Writer Director and the lead Ashton Kutcher for doing all the things effortlessly. The Film is intriguing and disturbing also I felt that film tried harder to convince its audience and provided much more then a one can digest so much happenings which were to a point looked imposed. If creators could've sum this saga within 1hour 30mins I believe then it would've been a spectacular gem but nevertheless the film is still recommended as it is little different from other sci-fi thrillers and you can see the efforts behind its creation."

","It can be seen that when one of the details is changed in the past, people's destiny will change in different directions. That is, people's life will be changed in different ways by a little bit inadvertently. This should be the reason why the film is named the butterfly effect. But the meaning of the film is not limited to the explanation of the chaotic theory of the butterfly effect. It seems to imply such a problem: if you want to make the status quo better and have the opportunity to come back from the unsatisfactory past, the ending Can it be perfect as you wish? The film also seems to give the answer: when a hypothetical tragic ending is attempted, trying to change them from the beginning often goes against the wishes, leading to a more tragic ending. This should be the theme of this film.
There are infinite possibilities in life, we can only experience one of these infinite possibilities. We always think that if the past is not very good, it will be better now, but the fact is often that if the past is really not the same, your Part of the goal is achieved, but worse things may happen to yourself or those around you. Because you are not God, you can't let things develop in the direction you set up. Even if you have the superpower to go back to the past, you still can't lead the future to your design blueprint, and you can't accurately control the direction of destiny. When you are happy to achieve a certain wish, there will always be another regret waiting for you, and there will always be things that you did not expect. Because there is always an unexpected flapping of butterfly wings, no one can grasp this except God.
The accidental flapping of butterfly wings will bring a hurricane thousands of miles away. A change in detail may bring a completely different fate. If we cannot predict or avoid when and where butterflies will flap their wings, we cannot predict or avoid which details of life will bring us huge changes. So we have to believe that existence is reasonable, and you and everything around you are the best. Do n't regret which intersection of life you have taken the wrong way, because every choice you ever made was the result of a mixture of countless antecedents and countless details in the background of space and time at that time. Make the best arrangement. It is better not to imagine changing the past. Accepting reality and moving forward is always better than indulging in the fantasy of changing the past."

"filipemanuelneto","8","0","0","16 November 2019"," A good story on a complicated subject.
","When I saw this movie I had few expectations. I had read very little about him, but I knew I would address the subject of time travel. It's a tricky subject, which requires some contextualization and script effort to make it credible on screen, and that's been covered a lot in action movies or sci-fi giving rise to arguably quality movies most of the time. So I didn't expect anything particularly bright. However, the film has shown courage in the way it addresses the theme.<br/><br/>In fact, the roadmap focuses on the issue of time travel, which is not really physical but mental travel. The main character, Evan, has a gift (or curse?) Whereby she can mentally return to her own past and modify it. However, the past can never be changed without radical implications for future events. So with each trip, Evan's life changes dramatically as, on the other hand, his mental health deteriorates. Complicated and debated issues among scientists, such as paradoxes or ""alter egos"" are addressed in a simple, easy to understand, and above all, credible way.<br/><br/>The cast is not the strong point of the movie. Ashton Kutcher did what he had to do as a protagonist, but he had the advantage of good material and a character that captivates our sympathy from the start. Logan Lerman, who gave life to the same character as Kutcher, but in his childhood also seemed very good to me, and has everything to be an excellent actor in the future. Amy Smart and Elden Henson (in some scenes with a very hard-rock costume) also appear in the cast, but only provide some support to the protagonist.<br/><br/>The special, visual and sound effects are regular and the soundtrack is pretty bad. But this is easily understood: it is a film with a limited budget, but a good story, so let the story be the focus of public attention, minimizing the effects and trying not to disturb the flow of the story told. The result is an engaging movie that doesn't creep into unnecessary scenes most of the time."
"tabuno","7","0","0","25 January 2019"," A Decent, Above Average Multi-Universe Movie
","24 January 2004. In the footsteps of the Lath of Heaven, the multi-universe (time travel), chaos theory movie of The Butterfly Effect is an effective fantasy, sci-fi, drama containing a hard-edge of violence. This movie contains depictions of juvenile sadistic behavior and pedophilia. Ashton Kutcher does a commendable job with an intelligent, though somewhat forced script. Evan as a boy of 13 is given at times a much more harsh demeanor as well as Evan as a young man who personality seems to vary as much as his world does. There are effective psychological scenes as well as emotional tender moments. However, there are those artificial plot devices that seem to be inserted for audience impact rather than a natural flow of chaos. Eventually, the story and plot line get more convoluted to the point of confusion as to the cause and effect of changes being made. The movie had a decent ending with a message, though Evan's experiences as the move progressed seem more the product of a writer's mind than a real person's. Evan's reaction to his friend's violence seemed unnatural. Evan's relationship with his mother is never fully developed. There is also the confusion between Evan's memories and how he presents himself and also how his attempts to portray himself as somehow godlike was convincing if the new universe changed as it was supposed to have. This serious effort deserves recognition for its attempt to push the envelope along with a provocative conclusion and the meaning of sacrifice and of love. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","The Butterfly Effect is not only one of the ultimate edge of your seat thrillers, but it is also so mind-twistingly good that you could not even predict the outcome for the characters. Watching this when I was 11 I never appreciated how thought-provoking it was, until now at the age of 25. The Butterfly Effect goes on the chaos theory, ""something as small as the flutter of butterfly wings, can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world"". Evan is a troubled boy who lives with his struggling single mother in a small town. The troubles have led to the boy blacking out and he is ordered to write in journals to remember events.
Now a college student, Evan looks over his diaries to see what happened in his childhood before deciding he wants to free himself of all the memories. When Evan discovers he can go back in time, he tries to change certain aspects of his childhood friends (Kayleigh, Tommy, and Lenny) disturbing pasts so they lead on to have better lives. However, these minor changes will cause far bigger problems in the future."
"tdrish","8","0","0","18 November 2018"," Powerful film with disturbing themes, The Butterfly Effect will ripple your wings!
","This movie was an emotional shock fest. It delivers a brisk pacing in quickly unveiling a story that will haunt and challenge the way you feel about the life you have lived, and the choices you have made. Let me ask you two questions, and be very honest with your answer, because no one will know: Have you ever been hurt as a child? Have you ever hurt a child? Now let me ask you one last thing, if there was a way to change things, would you? Could you? How would you? The Butterfly Effect, simply put, is a supernatural phenomena of trying to go back to a time when something went wrong, and try to make it right again. Doing so, how would that change things? The question isn't how would it change things, the question is how would it alter other events. The film explores deep and troubling subject matter. I don't want to give away anything big, let's just say a couple of young children are put in a situation that no child should ever be in, and from here, we set a the concrete on the foundation that The Butterfly Effect will be built on. From here, we have a chain of painful events. Very bad things happen in this movie. Very bad things! We don't question why they happen, we just accept that they happened. The film pursues the possibility that you CAN go back and change things, as our hero does unusually just by reading his journal, which he uses to try to remember phases in his life blocked out by blackouts. What he doesn't realize, is that by going back and trying to do things for the better, it's really turning out for the worse. The movie silently begs the question: Is it really better to be dead then alive? What good is it saving something thats broken? From here, I developed a deep caring for all the characters. Not justifying what some of them have done, but understanding why they've done it. And it's all about how we handle ourselves once good or bad things have been done. For everything that we do, good or bad, there are either rewards or consequences. For example, a practical joke is pulled in the movie, but a family was severely impacted by this cruel prank. The film will continually knock you around with one emotional blow right after the other, but the last twenty minutes will leave you feeling as if you've been uppercut under the jaw. Very powerful, very moving, very difficult film to watch, but I think this is one that has to be viewed more then once if you really want to get it. I think the first time you watch it, you just feel it."

","According to the scientific theory, the butterfly effect can be understood as the idea that small acts or facts on present can have huge impacts on the future. It's the idea that every little detail matters. For example: imagine that you drunk two cup of coffees this morning. The butterfly effects believes that if you had drunk just one, your day - and maybe even your future, in long terms - would be totally different. <br/><br/>This movie is about Evan Treborn and his incredible capacity to go back to his past and change some events. However, he doesn't see this ability as a good thing, because every time he ''comes back'' from his past, he sees himself in a whole new version of his life in present.<br/><br/>Evan starts to live in a cycle, then: he goes to his past, change some events he believes were mistakes he committed, but when he goes back, he sees himself in a strange version of his present, that he's not happy about. So, he goes again to the past, tries to change the event he believes is the cause for his ''not so good present'', but then, when he comes back again, the present version still not the one he was looking for, and this keep happening until he finds out that, for him to get a better life, he will have to give up the only thing he never wanted.<br/><br/>One of the facts that I love the most about this movie is that it shows that maybe you just have accept what comes to you.

Sometimes you can think back and wonder if you did things differently how it might all turn out. Kutcher's best movie performance, but that's not really saying too much. I always find him irritating but notso much in this. The amazing child actors stole the show. A dark, twisting story with an original time travel gimmick that makes for quite a gripping movie. Its rewatchable many times. I liked that this movie was not overly complicated as some time travel movies can be. Even though the film has its flaws and doesn't always make sense, it is fun to watch and entertaining.

","The movie starts with quoting the chaos theory - Small change at one place can cause big ramifications somewhere else. It is an interesting concept and makes you think what butterfly effect have you caused in somebody else's life. For good or for bad. Just like in physics, butterfly effect has its place in social life.<br/><br/>Though movie is based on chaos theory, in a sense it showcases the order that is present everywhere and how an unwanted element can cause disaster. Evan is that unwanted element in this narrative. He is a miracle child, but has his own flaws. He suffers from blackouts at life defining instances. Once he figures out the cause of those black outs and strange power that he has he tries to play God. He tries to change things around him to make them perfect but fails every-time until he figures out who is the cause of those problems.<br/><br/>Movie would have been much better but for its weak script and narrative flaws. Some scenes have been forced just to make way for the story to continue. At the end the movie seems rushed. The climax normalizes the way life around us works and it hurts the moviegoer's experience. <br/><br/>Apart from Evan's character no character sees any growth. It was not possible either. Ashton Kutcher is good as Evan but he has shown lack of range in emotional responses especially for a person who is playing God. <br/><br/>This movie resembles Mr.Nobody but it is a better version of it. If you are new to movies based on chaos theory then it would be a good watch."

It is suspenseful, fast paced, thrilling and has a lot of imagination; however, it falls into a serious problem: the ""what if"" matter! And if I changed that moment, how would it be? And if that instant was changed, it would be different This film is a constant roller-coast of ""what if(s)"" that turns it unrealistic beyond unrealistic! <br/><br/>What I mean is that the film ""forgets"" about one important detail: our lives and this reality where we live (I won't even discuss the time and space matter, and possibility of time travelling, which is also brought up in this film) is a constant of ""what if(s)""! So, even if he could change a moment, in a very distant past (all the changes he does are from a distant past, when he was a child or a teenager) nothing could assure that this distant future would only depend of that particular change! That's what I find more unrealistic in the movie! He changes a lot of years based just in some particular moments when he was a child or a teenager. And in those years, nothing happened that could have changed his life? There's a kind of a hole between when he's seven, when he's thirteen and when he's twenty! Nothing happened in his life during those years?! <br/><br/>However I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie.

This is a very haunting film with plenty of tragic events and I must say it made me depressed and upset, mainly because of the great acting and film direction.

But, I have to give credit where credit's due, this is a good film. The thing is - it makes you think! Now, I'm all in favour of safe films like lighthearted comedies and so on, but one feels that one has to expand one's mental horizons on occasion. For those of us who have seen and enjoyed ""It's a Wonderful Life"",this in its outcome is effectively the opposite premise - this time people's lives are altered for the better because someone chooses NEVER TO EXIST! There's an element of Donnie Darko here (which reality is the ""real"" reality?!) and I was actually (wrongly) expecting the story to be based on a Ray Bradbury short story about a guy who goes back in a Time Machine and accidentally changes events by killing an insect - but actually this storyline is more subtle and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it."

","At the instant I found out Ashton Kutcher (not sure if I'm spelling his name right or not) was in this movie, I thought it was going to be silly. At first, due to all the hilarity of all the other films he was in, I couldn't properly see him in his place in the film. This didn't last long, however, as he actually did surprisingly well, even for his character. After a while - that all faded away entirely, and I was more or less absorbed by the Butterfly Effect. Ahh, what a great movie. If you haven't seen this one yet, it is most definitely worth a watch. I might be rating it a bit high due to the fact that I thought it would be a waste of my time, but what can I say, I thought it would be terrible, and I walked out *more* than satisfied. A great movie, and definitely worth a watch. I recommend it."

","As described above, the movie has a lot of plot holes, but it you can get past that, and the mental set you have for Ashton Kutcher's acting, you can really enjoy this movie. One plot hole mentioned above is that he pokes his hands down on the spikes to prove to the guy in the jail cell that he is in fact a holy being(which he is not, it's just to get protection for his little bitch ass). I'm not going to go about explaining this but you should be able to understand when you see it.<br/><br/>Aside from little things like this however the movie is one that has some powerful messages, and conveys to the audience a new image of Ashton, and I believe this will be his break-out role. It will show casting agents that he's capable of these roles, they just have to be directed properly and have the proper dialogue. An instant where this innability to create efficient dialogue for Ashton is when his arms and legs are blown off in an explosion, he wakes up and says ""HOLY F***!!!""..... pause..... yes the audience is still laughing. I believe, however, that this was not Ashton's fault but instead the director who must not have realized that he was a comdian before this thriller/drama.<br/><br/>Anyways, I highly recommend seeing this movie as it may change your way of thinking if you've never pondered the effect yourself before. If you've seen the simpsons episode where homer travels back in time through his toaster<br/><br/>however, this movie should not escape your mental abilities *lol*"

","The Butterfly Effect (2004) <br/><br/>*1/2 (R)<br/><br/>BY JASON YOUNG<br/><br/>Science fiction often utilizes time travel to explore the chaos theory. The butterfly effect is an aspect of that theory which states that a butterfly could cause a hurricane half way around the world simply by flapping its wings. This intriguing principle is applied to the lives of four seemingly life-long friends in the ultimately ridiculous thriller The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>Evan Treborn has journals documenting his childhood that he reverts back to while in college. When Evan reads a passage, he is somehow launched back in time to the event described on the page. He is then able to relive what happened in the past, change its outcome, and, therefore, alter the present.<br/><br/>`Great Scott!'<br/><br/>Why would someone want to play God, you ask? Enter Kayleigh Miller, Evan's childhood sweetheart. We see their relationship as children in early flashback sequences, as well as in a reunion outside of Kayleigh's current workplace. Evan has suffered from blackouts his whole life, so he asks Kayleigh about what really happened years ago when Kayleigh's father made a home movie of Robin Hood with them. Later that night, Kayleigh is driven to suicide over her conversation with Evan. And so it beginsÂ…<br/><br/>Everyone knows who Ashton Kutcher is: whether it is from his role on `That 70s Show' or as the host of MTV's `Punk'd' or even alongside Demi Moore in any tabloid across the country. Within these, excluding the latter, he is best known for his comedic style. Working primarily dramatically, Ashton makes what is known as a star turn in The Butterfly Effect, but where it has worked for other comedians, like Robin Williams, Bill Murray, and even Adam Sandler, it fails for Ashton. His performance isn't bad; it just isn't one to convince audiences that he is a serious actor.<br/><br/>I was reminded greatly of Lawrence Kasdan's Dreamcatcher throughout much of The Butterfly Effect. Both have the ambition to become great movies, but clearly they are not. They are abundant with bad acting, bad writing, and even worse direction. Although, Dreamcatcher does one-up The Butterfly Effect in one crucial element: no matter how outlandish the situation is in Dreamcatcher, you always believe that the four main characters are friends. We never really feel this about the four in The Butterfly Effect. Also in Dreamcatcher, we see how their parts in an alien invasion affect the whole world. While in The Butterfly Effect, their lives seem to have no effect on anyone but themselves.<br/><br/>If the characters in The Butterfly Effect don't seem to have much of a reason for living, should we feel as if we have any reason to spend $10 to watch them?"

","Extremely impressed with this movie. Going with my better judgement after hearing from critics it was a hopeless attempt for Ashton Kutcher to salvage his career, I went with my wife to see it. I was impressed at how disturbing the first half of the movie was and the way it makes you feel the longing that Evan (Kutcher) has to change his past. The movie sucked us in by the first 20 minutes and didn't let us go till the credits. A thriller, sci-fi, love story all wrapped into one.

"casablanka-1","Null","0","0","5 February 2004"," Disturbing, but worth a look...
","I was told by a number of friends to see this film because of a lot of interesting ideas.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes are intense...The teacher with the conversation about Evan's (Ashton Kutcher) disturbing drawing, the pedophile scene, the meeting with his institutionalized father, Tommy, Tommy and Tommy are all psychotically intense.  Hence the need for Evan to journal his life because of the many blackouts he experiences.<br/><br/>These first 15 minutes may perhaps lead you to ask yourself ""What possessed me to see this film?""<br/><br/>However, what WILL grab you is the very notion of what happens when Evan decides to bravely relive his lost experiences in his journal.  The first scene actually brought a smile to my face when Evan extends a brutal revelation to the pedophile father(Eric Stoltz) about the future of his daughter Kayleigh (Amy Smart). It is further enhanced by the fact that this is a very young child speaking dramatically as an adult would under these circumstances.<br/><br/>""Look f__k bag!""...<br/><br/>Other than the room and the words of Evan's journal intensely shaking combined with his bloody nose, there's really no explanation for his apparently real journeys into the past when he reads dark areas of his journal.<br/><br/>The concept is really interesting enough that you will continue to watch because you can't wait to find out more about how it works and what he does with it...<br/><br/>But as most ""time-travel"" concepts go, there are flaws.  One in particular is the trick he does to convince a prison cellmate of his power.  He goes back to his early grade class, the one where he drew the disturbing picture, just so he can jam his hands on -- well, you'll see. I'm scratching my head how the author or screenwriter actually made the judgment not just to write it in, but then to go through and direct the scene. That very act certainly sent him and a lot of his history somewhere besides the same exact prison with the same exact cellmate.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, The Butterfly Effect has a promising premise in that even though Evan has this power, he has to choose between being with the girl he loves or everyone's tragic future. What will he do?<br/><br/>While flawed, and disturbed, much of it was interesting enough to keep me awake throughout the film, which is a big mark in my book these days. Most films with all the exaggerated and overused CGI effects  actually put me to sleep.  Go watch it, you'll have something to talk about and you may actually grow to like Ashton Kutcher.  :)"

In many ways the writers that come up with some of the coolest s*** are able to pull it out, dust it off and do it again. For example, the ground Quentin Tarantino opened up, or the Farrelly brothers, The Coen brothers. It comes down to the minutia that can help to twist and make something cool. When details are buried deep, or even just nonstop. The Family Guy, Futurama. Anyway, in a field of reality changing pre-cognitive manipulation, there has been elbowed some room, and Bress and Gruber, or is it Gruber and Bress.

"sober_gaijin","Null","0","0","2 February 2004"," Intense ... intensely stupid!
","First, let's get the whole ""intense"" argument out of the way.  Yes, this movie was intense but not because of any miracle of storytelling. Basically, it seemed as if the writers opened up their Fodor's Guide To Disturbing Plot Elements and ran down the checklist.  Child molestation ... check!  Cruelty to animals ... check!  Baby-killing ... check!  Prison rape... check!  Living life as an amputee ... check!  Having a psycho take an aluminum bat and go yard with your skull ... check!<br/><br/> Intense subject matter does not a great story make.  The basic premise of this film is that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) thinks he can go back in time and make the lives of those he loves better by eliminating one or more of the aforementioned miserable life experiences.  Of course, every time he goes back, he throws the space-time continuum out of flux, thereby creating a ripple effect of alternate miserable life experiences and making things worse for himself.  Not a bad premise--who among us has not wished for this power?--but the story exposes itself as a sham by the second act.<br/><br/> Case in point.  Evan goes back to being seven years old, and averts a lifetime of child molestation for his friend Kayleigh (Amy Smart) just by getting in her abusive father's face.  Do these writers know anything about abusers?  Do they really think an alcoholic abuser would back down from a mouthy child, do a 180 and transform from a pedophilic creep to a loving father?  But no, this one act is the difference between Kayleigh become a suicidal basket case and her evolving into a lovely, balanced college girl. Thank God one child was tough enough to say, ""Leave us alone,"" and one pedophile was rational enough to stop.  It don't happen that way, folks, and anyone who's been molested will say as much.<br/><br/> Trouble is, this one act may alter Evan's adult reality, but it still leaves a lot of other events in his history (events that by virtue of the butterfly effect should have been changed) unchanged.  If his one act stops the child molestation, would the other events in his life--the murder of his dog and the death of the baby--also be different?<br/><br/> The biggest problem with the movie, though, is the utter irresponsibility of it all.  During the first act, when we get to see all of the horrors of Evan's existence, the film works itself out like a piece of shock exploitation.  You can almost see the writers yucking it up over scotch and soda by their word processor saying, ""And then let's have Tommy put a dog in a sack and set it on fire!  Boy, that'll freak people out!""<br/><br/>Okay, if this had been exploitation along the lines of ""Ilsa"" or ""Salo,"" maybe this crap is appropriate.  But this is a mainstream Hollywood movie, starring Kelso from ""That's 70s Show,""  being touted by the blurbs on the TV ads as a ""rollicking, high-speed, suspenseful rollercoaster ride""!  This movie pushes the envelope, brings up some disturbing images that will traumatize those who have, unlike the writers, really experienced such horrors ... then it tries to wrap it all up with neat little answers.<br/><br/> Rated PG for Pure Garbage."

I firmly believe that a great deal of the negative reviews are made simply because the viewer did not understand the movie. This is one of those films that you HAVE to pay attention...be ready to think about it long after you have left the theater. I am not too familiar with Ashton Kutcher's work aside from ""Dude, Where's My Car"" and ""Just Married"" but this film was a great tribute to Ashton's versatility as an actor. Equally commendable was Amy Smart's performance as well as the young cast members who played Evan and Kayleigh as children. This movie will definetely make you think about all the times that we have wished for the ability to go back and relive one moment in time.  To anyone who believes that there are holes in the plot of this exceptional film...please take some more time to really think about the story, see it again if you must, but when you are able to recognize the depth and the brilliance of this film, you will surely correct yourselves for saying that there are holes in this plot!!!

The movie is best enjoyed as a ""study"" of that - in particular, a study of ones inability to really predict the effect of the change. You don't need a microscope or a seminar to find holes and slips in the story or logic - if you can resist that and instead see it as an idea that's worth doing even though the details aren't perfected, then you can enjoy it (in spite of some pretty uncomfortable moments (violence, etc.), even if those things make you uncomfortable (as they do me)). After all, ""What if I could do things differently?"" -  is a question that everyone must toy with at one time or another.

Ashton put up a great effort and with a little more drama work, then man could be pretty good. Aside from that, I thought the story great aside from a few blemishes where the storytellers could have made a few details clearer. For instance, the picture Evan draws as a young child should have been connected to the prison scene better. A minute long flashback and different reaction when Evan goes back could have easily done this. I also would have liked for them to show that Evan didn't want to live in the sorority life because it was not him and was a very selfish life where Thumper and Andrea's brother were still living horrible lives. Two things that could have made the movie a better all-around package. 8/10"

And determined that it was going to be a really good movie. Plus, I've never seen Ashton Kutcher serious, so that was another big turn on. Apparently, my spidey sense was right because I loved it.<br/><br/>The movie is about this kid named Evan. He has these blackouts about traumatizing things that happen to him, so his mother takes him to a doctor, and he advises her to have him write in journals to trigger his memory. You go through moments when he was seven and thirteen and discover that he goes through a lot.<br/><br/>After seven years, he doesn't have any more black outs, but one night his girlfriend finds his journals, and makes him start reading him-bringing back a memory he didn't know he had. He then revisits a childhood friend who was there, Lenny. Now he is very disturbed, and goes kind of insane when Evan asks him to look back on the memories.<br/><br/>He reads a journal from when he was seven, and discovers another disturbing memory. He goes to his other friend, Kayleigh, and asks her to reminisce. Things were said, and she killed herself. Then Evan discovers he can go back to the memories, with his twenty year old brain in tact, and change things<br/><br/>that had happened.

","I read some terrible reviews on Butterfly before I saw it and was not expecting much going into it.  Ashton Kutcher plays a Evan, a fellow with a history of blacking out at some pivitol points during his life.  Following in his estranged father's footsteps, he finds a way to relive these accounts by reading or viewing the events that took place before the blackout occured. What seems like better results turns into one tragedy after another as Evan attempts to change the events for the better.  The main stronghold of this film is the sometimes horrorish and sometimes humorous results that happen from Evan's ""time fixing"" endevores.  Child violence is another piece of the movie that grabs you, and if that isn't your cup of tea then you should at least find it mildly amusing.  Ashton Kutcher is in a role that was better suited for Tobey Maguire or Jake Gyllenhaal.  His acting consists of alot of mumbling and some outbursts of rage.  The supporting acting helps the film move along, particulary Ethan Suplee as Evan's gothic roomate Thumper.

I just needed to know what was going to happen next, and every move Evan made just twisted everything up and made the plot even worse for him, but better for the viewer's pleasure. I  love that the whole movie is based on the chaos theory and I love how perfectly chaotic this movie is. It had me on my toes for the entire movie and if that is a bad thing then I don't want to watch the movies you think are good. The Butterfly Effect gave me and my four friends about an hour worth of conversation as we all fought to get our words out about how we felt. We each had to comment on how we loved Ashton's portrayal, and how we were so moved and touched and just in awe of this movie. It made us feel so many emotions, and that is how I measure how good a movie is, by how much the writer/director/actor makes me care so much about something I know is fake. If I could I would watch it over and over again, it was a smash hit that everyone must go see. It really gets you thinking, which is also another great characteristic of a movie done well. But don't take mine or anyone else's comments as enough, go and see Butterfly Effect and then come back here and comment on how it made you feel, how completely awesome you felt, and how good you thought the movie was. And don't let other people scare you away from seeing this movie, because it was good quality and Ashton can act."

","I went to see this as part of my friend's birthday present. I wasn't looking forward to it, as I didn't think that the previews made the movie look interesting. I was pleasantly surprised. Although not the best movie in the world, I enjoyed it. Ashton Kutcher is not bad, not excellent, but not bad, as the lead. This movie had good points, although the execution was not always as interesting as they could have been (some were a bit generic). I recommend that people should see it, but there are some spots that are... disturbing (child porn, animal mutilation). If you are squeamish, this might not be the movie for you."

","Firstly, I was at Sundance and waited on line for about an hour in SLC to get a ticket to the premiere of this movie and it did not get booed, or walked out on. The movie was received very well, and actually, at the end of the movie, the audience gave the film a standing ovation when the directors took the stage.  Ashton was called to the stage before the movie started by the directors and actually choked up, and thanked them for taking a chance on him.  I was surprised, but it was a nice moment.<br/><br/>I think the reviewers have been a little too harsh.  I don't think the movie is perfect, but I do think it is original, and took a lot of chances.  I also think it was a brave movie for Ashton to choose.  He easily could be doing ""Dude, Where's my Car II and III"".  What's coolest about this movie is that it actually got made.  Given the subjectmatter and Ashton doing a rated R movie and first time directors -- this is not the typical hollywood schlock being dished out week after week.<br/><br/>Give the movie a chance, it's definitely worth seeing and I think, like myself, you'll be pleasantly surprised."

","First, don't read if you do not want any spoilers.  Second, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie (and this was shocking given my low expectations and skepticism regarding 'kelso' in a dramatic role).  Second, I just saw this tonight, have not fully processed the movie, and have had numerous cocktails before writing this.  Now, on with my comments.<br/><br/>Though I enjoyed this movie, I left the theater torn between 2 interpretations.  In one interpretation, like just about every review I have read in the last 2 hours, I viewed it as a time-travel flick focusing on the idea that trying to change the past has unintended consequences-nothing new or earth shattering here, but I still felt that they did a good job at pulling it off.  My other interpretation, however, is a bit more interesting I think.<br/><br/>Consider the idea that the entire movie is a delusion (as is alluded to in the 2nd to last 'revision' of his past).  Evan had some horrendous experiences as a child no doubt, and also inherited his father's 'disease.' What if Evan did in fact have a tumor of some sort that caused psychotic symptoms (certainly feasible given our knowledge of structural brain abnormalities that can lead to schizophrenic-like symptoms), in addition to having actual repressed memories, his blackouts, due to childhood trauma. What if the entire movie, from his college year where Thumper tells him ""Maybe you shouldn't read those journals because maybe there is a reason you don't remember that crap,"" is a dramatic recreation of his subconcious struggles with the recollection of previously repressed memories (similar to ideas in Identity).  Evan is dying of a brain disorder (tumor, etc.), and he decides to attempt to recollect his repressed memories and ""rewrite"" his own personal history.  In an attempt to prevent this (possibly because his subconcious realizes that he cannot handle it-i.e., memories are repressed for a damn good reason) his subconcious will not allow him to 'trick' himself into believing a false reality.  Before his death he wants to create a ""nice"" story of his life, but his subconcious, which knows the grim truth of it all, won't allow it-thus, every attempt to rewrite his past turns out horribly.  Instead of the message being ""You can't change the past without changing just about everything else, often with horrendous consequences,"" the message may be ""You cannot rewrite your past, and sometimes we repress memories because that protects us from the harsh reality of what truly happened.""<br/><br/>I am aware that there are likely numerous flaws with this interpretation (remember the cocktails please), and please share any that you may have. But I am just throwing out another idea that may or may not make sense upon closer inspection (and yes, i realize that at the end we supposedly see Evan '8 years later,' but isn't it possible that this was just a dying man's attempt at peace before he is gone from this earth).<br/><br/>On another level (the supernatural one), more similar to the thoughts of many others, the film was about Evan's attempts to create the perfect story for himself (notice the self-interest).  Only when he decided to change the past and not try to make everyone in his own life happy (thus making himself happier) was he able to ""get it right.""  Thus, things turned out OK only when he put Kailee's future (even if it was without him) ahead of his own. Maybe it's OK to manipulate the past as long as we are not trying to make our own present better."

","The reviews of this movie provide more evidence that critics have lost touch with what is entertaining to the general movie-going audience.  The reviews in my hometown paper gave Butterfly Effect a ""D+"" and Lost in Translation an ""A"".  Did this critic actually see the same movies that I did?  Lost in Translation, which has already been awarded a Golden Globe by the Hollywood foreign press, is so BORING that you can hardly sit through it.  Butterfly Effect, on the other hand, grabs you in the first five minutes and never lets go.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially (but not only) for science fiction buffs.  It is one of those movies like Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, or Memento that will give you plenty to talk about after you see it.  The critics seem to dislike this movie either because (a) they don't like Ashton Kutcher-actually he does a creditable job of acting, or (b) they think the movie is too violent-it actually has very little graphic violence and is no more disturbing than Mystic River, which critics LOVE, or (c) they think there are holes in the plot.  As for this last criticism, virtually every action or science fiction movie has holes in the plot.  If critics like a movie, they just ignore them.  The bottom line is that the current IMDB rating of 7.1 makes a lot more sense than the average movie critic rating of 4.8 (from www.rottentomatoes.com)."
"wraith-13","Null","0","0","27 January 2004"," Not as bad as the critics say
","Butterfly Effect is not nearly as bad as the critics will have you believe, but that's not exactly high praise. The plot concerns Ashton Kutcher's Evan, a college psych major who discovers that by reading aloud from his journals he can return to the most traumatic moments in his life and change them, thereby changing his own past present and future and that of those around him. <br/><br/>The critical savagery of Butterfly Effect is probably fifty percent due to the omnipresence of Demi Moore boyfriend Ashton Kutcher in the media, and fifty percent due to the fact that it's an average execution of an intriguing premise. The thing that surprises me most about the reaction to the film is that many of the critics who hate it attack Ashton Kutcher's persona rather than his performance. It's as if they can't forgive the star of Dude Where's My Car and MTV's Punk'd of trying to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, these same critics give the film a pass for it's irresponsible depiction of children. <br/><br/>The film takes a while to get going (Kutcher's does not appear in the films first half hour, which is essentially back story). The first act of the film belongs to the main characters as children, first as grade -schoolers then as teen-agers. In rather rapid succession we see these kids coerced into sex and child pornography by a pedophile, murder a dog, inadvertently kill a mother and her infant child and engage in brutal physical attacks upon one another. <br/><br/>Now, I'm the last one to call for the censorship of an artist, but I feel that it takes a very sensitive filmmaker to approach topics such as these without appearing to exploit the children it presents. This is true even when the subject of the film is child abuse, and it certainly true when child abuse is merely a plot device in a sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>In his dramatic debut, Kutcher give a competent performance as do his supporting cast who must inhabit several different versions of themselves in Evan's different realities (particularly Amy Smart, who goes from waitress to sorority girl to prostitute). The casting of the kids at various ages was very well done. I'll even forgive the gaping plot holes that seem unavoidable in time-travel movies (like when a prison bound Evan goes back in time and changes one thing about his physical appearance, but it has no further repercussions, when the whole point behind the butterfly effect is that small changes can have huge and unpredictable repercussions).<br/><br/>However the film is overlong, feels rather structure-less and completely falls apart in the end. The characters and their dialogue are perfunctory for a thriller. It's average at best before you factor in the rather callous treatment of very sensitive issues regarding children."

The whole premise is laughable and hilarity ensues from the beginning frame to the last . The gist of the plot,what there is of it, concerns Kutchers ability to go back in time and rearrange moments in time . Never guessing that this would have profound effects on the present. The premise is so stupid that the script is a waste of time. Time travel films have been done much better,even the laughable 'Timeline' is better than this jumbled mess of a movie .

","The tag line for ""The Butterfly Effect"" is ""Change one thing. Change everything."" The title of the film comes from the principle in chaos theory that even the flap of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world can, by a concatenation of causes and effects, trigger a typhoon elsewhere on the planet. The premise of ""The Butterfly Effect"" is thus that change is possible.<br/><br/>However, what Evan (Ashton Kutcher) keeps trying to change is the past. This is patently impossible, yet -- defying all logic-- he ""achieves"" it several times in the course of the film. Each time, he only succeeds in making a bad situation worse, until he finally ""makes it perfect"".<br/><br/>The problem is that the final adjustment he makes does not really solve anything. The one piece of the puzzle that causes the entire problem remains unchanged, and that is the character played by Eric Stolz. If he is not eliminated from the scene, his evil influence continues to poison the lives of those around him. ""The Butterfly Effect"" thus fails miserably in terms of plotting and script, no matter how well the characters may be played.<br/><br/>This is indeed a pity. I went into the film with high expectations that it might provide a breakthrough role for Ashton Kutcher, one that might free him from the stereotype of being someone's toyboy. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. And so, I bet, was Ashton."

It's an excellent story; more people should have read it before they see this.  We read it during freshmen year in high school so I guess it was useful for something.  The story goes like this in a nutshell.. it takes place in the future where peopel can go back to prehistoric times and hunt dinosaurs, but they have to keep on this hovering path so they dont touch anything and change history, because if they changed one simple thing in the past it can create unbelievable effects millions of years later (hense the quote at the beginning of the movie), but this one guy goes back and steps off the path, and not realizing what hes done the group of hunters go back to the present time and see that everything is different, because the guy had stepped on a butterfly when he went off the path.

In fact, it is a decent metaphor for AK himself in that it is nice-looking but there seems to be very little substance. Too many scenes that either made no sense or were basically not believable even in the realm of science-fiction/fantasy. A lot of nonsensical behavior and just plain idiotic moves made by our time-traveler, that nobody watching would have made. Much of this is likely due to what can be called relative immaturity of the director/writer, relative being a key term here. Most directors with some years on them would not have allowed such moronic behavior by the lead to remain in the script, nor would have created such stereotypical behavior by the characters, and also would have attempted to seal up the plot holes.

Kutcher's expression brings to mind the sentence I used as a title of this comment.  There are other, slightly less glaring examples of horrible miscasting.  Is Kutcher to blame or perhaps it is the preconceived image of him that most viewers brought with them?  I believe it's mostly the first.

I like to think of this as a poor man's Donnie Darko. That movie is everything that this movie isn't. You may disagree with my review if you want, but this is really how I feel about it."
"The_Void","5","3","9","21 April 2005"," It's Not Such a Wonderful Life
","I must say that I was surprised, after seeing this movie, to come to it's page on this website to be met with a barrage of largely positive reviews. While I can certainly see the attraction of this movie; the fact is, it simply isn't very good. The version of The Butterfly Effect that I saw was the largely more liked 'Directors Cut' version, so whether or not the theatre version is better, I don't know. The muddled plot follows Evan Treborn; a young man that suffered from black outs as a child, and has found a way to not only remember these black outs as an adult, but go back in time and change them. Which is something that has a massive effect on his current life. As you might expect, this plot opens up a number of plot holes; and that's the first thing that is wrong with this movie. If you want to make a movie about something confusing, at least make sure that everything makes sense...and if that's not possible, at least make some sort of story that could be used in conjunction with the audience's imagination to fill the plot holes. And that's only the start of The Butterfly Effect's woes.<br/><br/>The film's main problem is simply that it's RIDICULOUS. The whole thing comes off as being very phoney and just about every event in the film can be described as either 'over the top' or just far too convenient. The action, therefore, is just stupid and hard to fully connect with because of that. At several points in the movie, I asked myself how one guy could be so unlucky; and you will too. When you cant believe in a film's plot, that film has failed and that is what has happened to this film. Before seeing it, I thought that Ashton Kutcher might have been the film's downfall; but ironically, he's one of the best things about the movie. While his performance is far from brilliant, at least Kutcher has fun with the role and his verve helps the film to swing along. Another thing that can be credited to the film is that at least it doesn't get boring, which is something that it could well have done due to the muddled plot. However, the good aspects are sapped up by the terrible ending, which swallows both any point that the film may have had and also betrays all the confidence put into the film by the viewers up until that point. The film draws it's substance from the idea that we are products our memories and the effect that our actions can have on ours and others' lives. As you will see at the end; the movie never really knew what to do with it."

","As a child, Evan Treborn suffers from blackouts. Her single mom Andrea (Melora Walters) leaves him with Mr. Miller (Eric Stoltz) as his babysitter. However Miller would film him in pornography with Kayleigh while Tommy watch. As a teen, Evan, Tommy, Kayleigh and Lenny have an incident but Evan has another blackout. His treatment in Sunnyvale Institution doesn't reveal his blackouts. Kayleigh continues to be abused by her father. Tommy's anger sends him on a bad path and he grows to hate Evan for his love of Kayleigh. Evan moves out of the neighborhood and vows to return for Kayleigh. In college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has left behind his past and his blackouts. He's living with wild man Thumper (Ethan Suplee). He reads his old notebook and flashbacks to moments in his childhood. He returns to the neighborhood to find Lenny as a volatile recluse. Kayleigh (Amy Smart) is a defeated girl working as a waitress. His return drives her to commit suicide. Tommy is an ex-con. He starts to go back in time and change history.<br/><br/>The premise is intriguing. It starts off great but the whipsaw changes are too much. It's too wild. It does allow Ashton Kutcher and to some extent, Amy Smart to stretch out their acting skills. However it just goes too wild and too crazy. It becomes a cartoon rather than something to be taken seriously but Kutcher does a relatively good job."

Amy Smart, another actor i'm not a fan of does a really good job as Ashton's best friend and lover.<br/><br/>this film really is powerful and has a lot of heart in it. don't expect your typical Ashton Kutcher garbage because this really is a winner that i think should of been awarded a few Oscars, especially for its staggering original screenplay. the music in this film really goes well with the film and adds power to it. words really couldn't describe how i felt when i watched this for the first time, its a brilliant piece of cinema. be sure to watch the directors cut of the film if you haven't seen this film yet as the ending to the original version isn't as good. i wont spoil it for you. plus stay clear of the sequels to this, there appalling. a masterpiece.............. 10/10............j.d Seaton"

"graphi","10","2","5","14 February 2007"," An under-rated masterpiece
","The Butterfly Effect ranks among the best movies I have ever seen. It proves that you don't need big names to make a film that will have lasting appeal. Although everyone involved in the film, from directors Bress-Gruber to main actors Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters and Amy Smart are not household names, they prove to be artists in the truest sense. And the soundtrack is so appropriate. When I decided to watch the movie, I was admittedly skeptical that something so obscure could be as powerful as a friend described it to be. But my friend was right. The Butterfly Effect is that rare gem of a movie that entertains while giving the viewer food for thought. The edition that I borrowed from my local DVD club had an accompanying disc with interviews where renowned academics define the ""butterfly effect."" The movie and the accompanying interviews are a truly thought-provoking experience."
"Knoxvicious","9","2","5","1 February 2007"," Good movie!
","If you like movies with lots of drama then this is it. It's a very good movie that holds a very good story. If you've heard about somewhat scary sick parts don't worry. A dog gets burned alive in the movie but you do NOT see it happen. A little girl gets a hold of a dynamite and (Obviously) dies but you do NOT see it happen. You see a kid get stabbed but it's not like it's gory. A couple of kids stick a dynamite in a women's mail box while she's opening it and has her baby in her arms and you hear a explosion but you see NOTHING. Just happens like that, one, two, three and then it's done. Also, you see a man taking photographs of his daughter and her friend naked but it'a not sick. You see no private parts and they're just standing there, not doing it, not doing ANY sick things. Nothing bad at all. These scenarios do seem sick but it entertains you at least. It gives you great drama. Worried about Kutcher? He's fine. He doesn't ruin the movie and doesn't act like a dork. He takes the work seriously and does a fine job in the movie. Now the movie itself as I said has one of the best plots. There's never a boring moment, something big is happening every moment and it's not that age old, ""Amy is cheating on Toby!"" drama.... Drama as in murder, past family issues being resolves, past kid memories that ended up wrong, etc. <br/><br/>But to even give you a better tip, do NOT see the sequel. Now, that was just horrible....."

Just because it is complex and difficult to understand at times does not mean that it is intelligent. In my opinion all its complexity is just cover up for how it does not really make any sense. Many will think when they watch it: ""Hmm, I'm not sure I get it.. Oh, that's probably because the movie is just too clever."" If you enjoyed the picture because you thought it was exciting or whatever, that's fine, but to those who think it's intelligent my advice is that you watch it again without assuming it's brilliant just because it's complex."

"lex-53","9","2","5","26 January 2005"," Great movie
","This is the first time I feel compelled to comment on a film because it is in my opinion underrated.<br/><br/>Like many others I also immediately noticed the similarity with Donnie Darko. I watched that movie some years ago and frankly it left me with a very unpleasant aftertaste. There was a certain darkness to its ending that I could not appreciate AT ALL. Nevertheless Donnie Darko has 8.3 points in the database.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect has the same theme and in my opinion the same quality, but did NOT leave me with that unpleasant aftertaste. I enjoyed every minute of it and even liked the ending, although sad and not very surprising. Btw, I watched the directors cut. There seem to be different versions with different endings. The Butterfly Effect gets 7.5 points in the database.<br/><br/>There are many negative comments to this film. Most of these people seem annoyed with the fact that young people will boast about having seen a 'deep' movie, when this film is actually quite fast paced and easy to watch. What's the problem with that? I liked the fact that it was easy to watch, and I also liked the self-sacrifice theme which I personally don't consider 'deep' but I can understand that younger people do. Perception of depth depends on age and experience. Furthermore, this is a universal theme. There are loads of good movies where the hero sacrifices him/herself for the benefit of others and, when properly executed like this film does, this moves the general audience.<br/><br/>Concluding, in my opinion this film is underrated. Donnie Darko on the other hand is overrated. If you haven't seen this movie yet, but are in doubt because of the bad comments, then go and watch it anyway. It's a good flick.<br/><br/>-- Lex Vogelaar"

The quick flashy kind that did little to connect you to the film but was instead used to give a quick reaction. The dog, the metal shard, the pins on the teachers desk, and the beating in the field all readily come to mind. I am not the type that is squeamish it just didn't seem to fit. I would also liked to of seen a more fulfilling ending. Where is the father? It looked like their relationship was important in the beginning but then it was forgotten about/ put aside.

","I'm no huge fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I feel sorry for the guy lately, what with the beating he constantly gets from the press. Far too many of the reviews that I've read for ""The Butterfly Effect"" make mention of his oh! so! shocking! relationship with Demi Moore, which is not only beside the point, it's petty. <br/><br/>Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that Ashton Kutcher is not one of my favorite actors, but I think there are far worse out there (with greater ""faults"" than dating a beautiful older woman), and I give him credit for trying something darker and different in ""The Butterfly Effect"", even if the movie has a lot of problems. <br/><br/>Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student who is haunted by a troubled adolescence. Many traumatic things happened to him and his friends in childhood, but he always blacked out and didn't remember anything. Now he's found that by reading his old journals he can travel back in time to the moment of those traumatic blackouts and change things, altering history. How? Don't ask me. <br/><br/>But the reason I more-or-less liked ""The Butterfly Effect"" is because I didn't look for logical answers to questions like that. I simply looked at it as what it was intended to be, which is a ""Twilight Zone""-style meditation on how one small event can sometimes alter an entire life, and how sometimes when you save one person, you're only damning another. Evan keeps going further and further back in time to fix things, only to discover that by playing God, all he's doing is digging a deeper hole for himself and his friends. <br/><br/>It's like a cross between a Stephen King novel (because of the childhood friends who share a dark secret...or two, or three) an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", and ""Groundhog's Day"". <br/><br/>I basically enjoyed the movie, but in the end there are just a few too many parts that are lame or annoying, as well as some bad dialogue, mediocre acting (Amy Smart and Elden Hensen are very good, but Kutcher is hit-and-miss), and a really dull, dreary middle section.<br/><br/>
I believe all of us can think of a moment in our lives when, had the events been even slightly different, our entire lives would be changed. ""The Butterfly Effect"" doesn't really delve into that fascinating concept too deeply, but it's a moderately entertaining and occasionally even touching film. Nothing to write home about, but not that bad either."

It also makes you think and philosophy a bit about life. The actors acting was all alright as well. Also, they found some very good matching child actors for the adults, they actually looked like them.<br/><br/>Then their was some stupid scenes, that didn't really make a lot of sense. For example when Evan was going to destroy the blockbuster with a knife? Why did it have to be with a knife? And why did that fail right away, just beacuse his mother found him with a knife in his hand, couldn't he just make an excuse and then find an other way to destroy it?<br/><br/>It was plenty of scenarios like this where Evan just acted very poorly in the situations and made bade judgment and decisions, even those times when he already knew what was going to happen. Also, it seemed this 'gift' was cursed, didn't matter what he did, it always got worse.<br/><br/>The scene when his father trys to to kill him. It was a bit over dramatic to me. Why wouldn't his father try to help him instead? Also, what did his father do that was so bad? I mean he managed to get a beautiful family, why wasn't he satisfied with that result? But sure, we don't know, might had been anything. Or he's just dramatized by the whole thing. But trying to strangle his son? Really? Wasn't he a good guy? But the idea behind the scene was pretty cool, so I guess I understand.<br/><br/>Yes, their were some cools scenes. And the whole concept of the movie and take on time traveling was cool too. It's new and you really didn't know what was going to happen the next time he jumped in time and changed things. All the different time jumps do blend and mix with each other well. Their is no real plot holes, just more that you just question the characters decisions and actions. I did anyway. Nothing got explained also, but personally I don't need an explenation, it's a movie, trying to make up some hum bug logic for this magic would probably only be just stupid and add unecissary time to the run time.

Obviously the main thing being just like any other film of the genre, to change the past, but here its about the characters personal life rather than things that are grand scale. The main character does his best to make a reality with no victims, something that unfortunately isn't plausible in a real world. I expected a bit more of a god complex, as he could theoretically change the world until he sees it to be fit, but the rules established don't allow that, and that proves to me that the writing is superb. There was a weird paradox where he did do this and change nothing, making me question the original blackouts, because originally he would have never lived, but that's paradox theory and i can delve into it forever, but this movie does its best at keeping to its rules about time travel."

","Don't listen to the negative critic reviews. This film leaves an unforgettable and lasting feeling that continues to resonate. I thought I wouldn't make it through the film, however I ended up loving it with seeing how grippingly powerful that it truly was. It gave me memories of the same kind of power that films like Darren Arronovskys Requiem for a Dream of even Pi possessed. A fantastic and heartbreaking film that I would definelty recommend to others."

","The Butterfly Effect is a brain teasing thriller, that slowly connects Evan Treborn's childhood blackouts to his father's special gift. As Evan grows up he experiences multiple mysterious blackouts. Evan and his friends are very devious and end up doing taking pranks too far. Because of Evans blackouts he can't remember what dangerous actions he had done. Years later Evan takes a look at his childhood journals and they end up taking him to places he doesn't remember. Evan has the ability to go back into his childhood and change the past in order to change the future.<br/><br/>Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber first introduce the film with a low-lighted, flat angle shot of the main character, Evan Treborn, running through the halls of a mental institution. The character is dressed in a hospital gown which suggests that he was a patient at that hospital. The lighting stays the same for a sequence, then moves to a downward facing camera angle as Evan Treborn crawls under a desk and scribbles in a journal. The film consists of multiple camera angles to entertain and thrill the audience.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is packed with several flashbacks. In the beginning, the use of flashbacks in this film make the storyline hard to follow, but these flashbacks are necessary at the end of the film. Along with flashbacks, the directors use a specific selection of music in the film. The music creates suspense and keeps the audience focused on the film and story. Music helps the audience relate back to the film and keep the audience intrigued.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn in this film and he is able to convince the audience through his acting and dialogue that his character had the ability to go back in time and change the past and drastically change the future. Kutcher showed the audience a variety of roles in this film. For example an intelligent college student, a selfish member of a fraternity, as well as a mentally unstable young adult. He was able to transform himself into each character, with different personalities and styles. His range of characters were impressive, and he was clearly the best one for this job. His role in this movie paved the way for a diverse acting career.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is an intriguing film, that explored the theory of the ""butterfly effect"". It's a good movie if you are patient and interested in a whirlwind of flashbacks and a rollercoaster of plot twists. The storyline allows for the story to change and surprise the viewers, and create a magical experience."

","Couldn't think of a title^ anyways, don't be a hater and try to point out the plot holes in this movie and take it as it is. This movie has a sick idea and creates a emotional and thrilling story inside of it. I don't really like the name Evan, and was kind of mad i found myself rooting for a guy named Evan, but that just shows how good Ashton Kutcher is in this movie. I'm a die hard Charlie Sheen fan and was not a fan of Ashton Kutch in Two and a Half Men, but he is really good in this. CONCLUSION- If you are looking for an good movie that you will be surprised and intrigued by, watch this.<br/><br/>PS The directors ending/cut is the way to go. And the only people who find this not helpful are named Evan, sorry your parents named you that"

","The Butterfly Effect is a home-run scored in accordance with how smart and compelling a movie can really be. Sometimes with a great script and great concept, lousy actors can really screw it all up. Having Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart in the leads really caught everybody off guard. It showed that they can do more than just comedies.<br/><br/>In the best performance of his career, Ashton Kutcher gives the very well-created character of Evan. As a boy and teenager, Evan suffered from blackouts that would erase his memory from certain events. Doctors advise him to keep a journal as a way to deal with his growing disability. Throughout his childhood, he's always had a thing for Kayleigh (played by Amy Smart). Kayleigh grew up in her abusive father and violent younger brother. She had the opportunity to live with her mother, but she chose to live with her father to be close with Evan. This first chunk of the movie explores Evan's childhood and his relationships with those around him. Although dark and sometimes depressing, the story and characters are so well done that your eyes are glued to the screen. Each blackout Evan gets keeps the viewer wondering what he missed.<br/><br/>Eventually, Evan moves away. From then on, he gets no more blackouts and he is a successful college student studying psychology. When he stumbles upon his old journals, old wounds upon up and blackouts start happening again. In a turn of events, Evan discovers that by reading his journals, his memory can skip back to that time where he was on autopilot and change things-- ultimately time-traveling. Now the plot really takes off and the characters we are growing to care about will be transformed in unimaginable ways. As Evan changes the past, good and bad arise. Evan is a very caring man, so he tries to change the past for everyone around him.<br/><br/>What really makes this so awesome is its unpredictability. The viewer has absolutely no idea how Evan will change the past and how different the present will be. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. Yes there is great acting and great filmmaking, but it is the character and plot development that really make this a huge treat.<br/><br/>4/4"

Something like welcoming the unexpected in course of correcting the things, this is the one line plot of 2004 psychological thriller ''Butterfly Effect''.<br/><br/>With such an exciting and interesting plot movie surely hold its audience on edge of the seat with its non linear presentation and unique theme, this time travel, time loop has always been the favorite sci-fi topic that drags the viewers and could easily makes them to get with its flow, Ashton Kutcher with his crucial role succeeds in taking the plot in very appealing manner that convinces the viewers, it might be the frame of action, romance or confusion, this guy rendered perfect performance, its Amy Smart who deserves the appreciation for being depicted in different shades, bringing up the modest, rage, distorted and also loving girl in all one single flick helped her to show off her acting abilities.<br/><br/>Technically movie wins with its screenplay, theme and especially for its sensible twisting plots and timely background tracks, overall this movie never disappoints those sci-fi fans who love the theme of time travel and time loop."
"gridoon2020","7","1","2","13 October 2015"," Director's cut version - what an ending!
","For most of its running length, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a well-made, gripping, but standard mind-bender. Anyone who has seen ""Back To The Future"" or ""Doctor Who"" or any other number of time-traveling movies and shows will be in more or less familiar territory. It's the ending that elevates this movie to the sphere of greatness. Oh, by the way, I'm talking about the director's cut ending. It's one of the most powerful endings I've seen, both emotionally (it gave me shivers), and intellectually (the way it ties in to the seemingly ""throwaway"" revelation of the previous stillbirths is so simple and yet so ingenious). Apparently there are multiple different endings out there, including the theatrical one. Which does make sense, as the director's cut ending is extremely bold and un-Hollywood-like, though the movie would be so much less without it. My *** out of 4 rating applies only to the director's cut version."

Ironically enough, Evan's dearest friend, Kayliegh (Amy Smart) begins to grow depressed and violent after all of these situations that Evan has no control over.

She can be good and she can be lousy.<br/><br/>All the other cast members are also good in their roles.<br/><br/>I should probably mention that I watched the director's cut. IMO it's MUCH better than the theatrical version.<br/><br/>I can't decide whether this movie deserves a 7/10 or a 7.5/10.

"vksjn18","8","1","2","18 August 2015"," A young man trying to change his troubled past by filling and changing up the gaps in his memory using his journals and inherited trait from his father.
","Unlike the name suggests, Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber's movie is not something related to the chaos theory which indulge intricate realm of physics. The complex movie title is just to infer the basic fact that future gets changed if your past changes. The movie starts in an asylum with Evan Treborn (played by Ashton Kutcher) breaks from his cell and gets into a room, from where the movie goes into flashback in Evan's childhood. <br/><br/>Deprived from his father's love as his father is a psychopath, Evan lives with her mother and has friends. Evan has a really troublesome childhood, not only due to his friends and family, but also because he is experiencing strange phenomenon of blackouts for which neither he nor medical sciences has the answers. Earlier in the movie, a lot of scenes of Evan's blackouts appear in which after the blackouts, he would not be able to remember what had happened to him. Due to his persistent conditions, his mother makes decision to move from the city leaving behind his friends and all his unanswered blackouts.<br/><br/>The story turns into a new mold after 7 years, during which, no blackouts occurred with Evan and him leading a normal life, until when he discovers something strange with his childhood journals one night. He get his answers of his blackouts by mistake, which changes his whole life. He experiments with his past and tries to jot out the things. It is, at the least to say, complicated. The more he intrigues in his past, more complicated the situation for him becomes. Using his missing pieces of memory, he changes lives of others: killed some, reborn some, completely changed some, even blown and regrown his own hands. Like I mentioned: complicated. <br/><br/>Even the whole movie consisted of several parts and backgrounds, it is amazing that still the whole story is woven perfectly. Considering the characters and the story background are bounced round like pinball, it is quite appreciating how Ashton keep up the same emotion traction during whole of the movie. Also it is quite a work of other characters (Amy Smart, Eldon Henson, Melora Walters) too when your role and character changed this much time as in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, to wrap up, the movie is very good if someone is looking for suspense and thriller. This movie is pretty unique and one of its kind. The movie keeps up the viewer expectation very strongly about what will happen next. Good acting, direction and editing are surely a plus point which could really make the viewer watch this movie again."

","I have to say when you stumble across a film by accident it's nice to be captivated by the concept and originality of the film. I tend to enjoy the more obscure, less obvious titles where there is less pressure on meeting certain criteria like profits and mass audience appeal which many big blockbuster films have suffered over the years. <br/><br/>I always love anything to do with sci-fi and time traveling is right up my street. The film didn't disappoint with Ashton Kutcher delivering his best performance yet, a surprise I have to say but credit where credits due. The film most of the time follows its rules fairly well with some inconsistency but that doesn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>I would of liked to see Evans changes have a wider reverberations but a minor issue but which isn't is the unnecessary violence through some scenes with Evan and Tommy. Overall a brilliant surprise which makes you think well after the films over."

You begin thinking that this movie is about science fiction meets sixth sense kinda stuff but towards the end you realize its all been about saving the girl the main character Evan loves who in the end makes the ultimate sacrifice by sacrificing his life to save the girl because there is nothing left for him to do in the end, he's tried everything else.

","I want to start off by saying that I created this account solely to praise this movie. In the beginning of the movie, I was quite upset by the events. I contemplated discontinuing this movie however I didn't and I'm glad I didn't. It had many great aspects to it. Not only was it informative, you learn what the ""butterfly effect"" really is, but it also finally made me tell my family members that I love them and that I care about them. All the males in my family have this code to show love but never say it. It made me realize that my confession can have an impact on their lives so I slowly but surely made my family know I love them. This movie was very emotional and very dramatic. Although there is a part in particular that I didn't agree with, it was the only movie I've watched out of hundreds that made me feel so empowered. There is no time to waste in life and you only have one chance. It is also the first movie of it's kind. It is the first high quality movie that touches upon the ""butterfly effect.""

"JolinKnight","8","1","2","29 June 2013"," Nearly perfect connection!
","It seems like a movie of narration from the beginning, but I get the real line very soon and I have to say it is a master piece.<br/><br/>Several scenes, from Evan was a little boy to he moved away with his mother, really makes me curious. The only thing I know is that Evan is a poor boy who always loses his pieces of memories now and then. I can spot that the moment he lost the memory is the time can be used by him to change his whole life. Obviously, it is not psychosis, it is kind of super power. When he get into the real things about his childhood memory, like diary or video, he can pass through the time space. And the reason why he can not remember anything sometimes before is that the future him comes back to make changes. In other words, those moments when he lost memories is the time he can come back to make changes affecting the future.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that not every time he comes back to childhood can change the future, it depends on what he has done. Is it amazing, incredible reasonable, and perfect connected. During the first hour, audiences will carry with many suspenses, and the last half hour, they will be shocked.<br/><br/>Furthmore, only the perfect plot can not make this film so popular, there are also something worth to think over in this movie. Evan has changed his life for no less than one or two times, every time the consequence is not satisfied, even the last time, he need make a great sacrifice to put a stop. This makes people to think if they were Evan what should they do and what Evan did is right. In the end, at least Evan found the best way to change his life, of course,it also includes others' lives. Love in this film is no doubt the main line, everything Evan did is for that words ""I'll come back for you"", and yes he did it.<br/><br/>However, the only thing seeming like not perfect enough is that the plot is so similar with ""Back to future"" (1985) that I have to suspect whether it is sort of plagiarism.<br/><br/>Anyway, we should show respect to this film regardless of the so called plagiarism, maybe it is just a inspiration from its predecessor."

The romance leads the story, but remains a side character. What really captivates the audience are the questions: ""What will happen next?"" and ""Why did it happen?""

"TheTominator","10","1","2","21 May 2010"," Sad, bleak, disturbing, a modern masterpiece.
","And surprisingly, well crafted.<br/><br/>When The Butterfly Effect came out, it seemed as though it would be a silly drama staring Ashton Kutcher, because, well, it starred Ashton Kutcher. But instead it is one of the most depressing movies to come out this decade.<br/><br/>The script is incredible, with very real dialog and a faithful portrayal of modern society on many different ages. Kutcher's character (and his other self). Are very well developed and likable, and Amy Smart's is one of the saddest (and real) characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Eric Bress's and J. Mackye Gruber's direction is so flawless it's hard to believe this is their debut movie. They can string tension and emotions so well, sometimes even in one scene.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from amazing to unbelievable by all members of the cast, regardless of age, But John Patrick Amedori and Amy Smart steal the scene with truly flawless acting, especially given such hard parts.<br/><br/>That together makes a truly moving movie. From beginning to end, things just keep falling apart, and every time you may hope everything will turn out okay, something happens and it all goes down the sewer again. Doesn't matter how much Evan tries, it never works out, partially because he wants to much, though. In one life, Kayleigh is a drugged up whore who kills herself, in the next, Evan has Kayleigh, but Thumper, his best friend, hates him. In other, everyone is happy, Tommy and Lenny are both mentally stable, but Evan has to f* it up again because he's handicapped. And that scene kind of ruins his character for me, because it turns him in a selfish guy. <br/><br/>The ending, while satisfying in the theatrical version, is out of sync with the rest of the movie, because it is somewhat positive, but is more realistic, which makes the movie more disturbing, and less heartbreaking. The ending of the Director's cut, on the other hand, is far, far bleaker, but the supernatural turn it takes makes the movie less believable.<br/><br/>All in all, a must see for everyone, but be warned: It will be a very depressing experience."
"Stampsfightclub","9","1","2","27 May 2009"," Wonderful dramatic depiction of time travel
","After suffering blackouts when he was a kid, Evan (Kutcher) finds by reading his journal he can alter the past by travelling back in time.<br/><br/>The art of time travel has been developed in cinema throughout its entirety. In the 1960's Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke showed man's development with a fantastic cut from apes to spaceships in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Richard Kelly thrived on his Donnie Darko creation by sending the character threw wormholes to alter time in 2001.<br/><br/>Both films astounded movie fanatics and hoping for more of the same we trundled along to see Punk'd presenter Ashton Kutcher star in another sci-fi time travelling twisting drama, and we were treated to yet another fantastic mystery.<br/><br/>This 2004 release still sparks debates with its complex dealing with time travel and the approach to it. When Evan reaches his mid-twenties he realises he can travel back in time to alter circumstances just by reading his own notes. The shaking camera alerts us to his powers and we are soon in the heart of a complex mystery as we follow Evan in a voyage of discovery to see what really happened when he suffered from blackouts as a kid.<br/><br/>There are shocking turns of events that unfold as we and Evan come to realise the truth. As well as conveying the concept of time travel, The Butterfly Effect aims to preach through its real life issues such as paedophilia, bullying, suicide and mental illness. It is a quite brutal piece of film making that does echo Kelly's sublime picture, but before the term carbon copy crosses your mind, there are some finer details to point out.<br/><br/>Donnie Darko after all, whilst dramatic and scientifically able to cope with illness and time travel, is much more light-hearted with in jokes and good nature. Bress and Gruber's picture is exceptionally dramatic and a lot more romantic. The whole pictures spurts out issues of love and lust and 'doing the right thing' and because of this goal, has shimmied itself away from Darko. Plus the nature of time travel is religiously connected here, a shocking and dramatic side issue connected with mental health.<br/><br/>The fantasy sequences for Evan when he first sees he can travel back in time are quite unnerving and surprising. The consequences of time alteration are very good. We are left guessing as to what has happened in the new world.<br/><br/>Kutcher we know is funny and a practical person but here we see his dark and dramatic side which fits in well with the narrative. Amy Smart fits the role of romantic interest well enough whilst Henson and Scott fit their respective parts independently and uniquely to give an energy of diverse opinions to proceedings.<br/><br/>There are 4 alternate endings and this is a review for the director's cut and after seeing this particular ending I find myself against seeing the other endings as it will take the shine off a fine debatable conclusion."
"splintercellninja","7","1","2","19 January 2009"," Depends on your perspective
","i'll begin this review by assuming that the person reading this review has not actually seen the movie yet, and that they are trying to make a decision as to whether or not.<br/><br/>First issue I'm sure is bugging a good portion of the potential audience in limbo is the fact this movie features Ashton Kutcher as lead role. Surprisingly, he doesn't ruin the movie, and even more surprisingly he plays his part good enough to make the viewer forget its actually Ashton Kutcher playing the role. Meaning, the actor doesn't overshadow the character. Something that's considered hard to do, and virtually impossible for a 'name' actor to do. Ashton pulls this off very effectively. Only one sentence at one point in the movie does he even sound like 'Ashton Kutcher' when he speaks, and he sinks himself into his role convincingly enough to not ever 'act' like Ashton Kutcher. If this is your biggest pet-peeve with this movie, I would suggest you go see it.<br/><br/>Next aspect is probably the premise of the movie, which in many cases is the main aspect actually making most consider seeing this movie. The premise, although not mind-blowingly original, still manages to be interesting and entertaining. I'm sure most are at least vaguely familiar with it, as it has allusions in many other works. To summarize as easily as possible without spoiling any part of the movie; the idea is the hypothetical 'what if' you could go back in time and change the past to affect the present, however be careful what you wish for as even the slightest change in the past can affect the present in drastic ways.<br/><br/>The execution is the other half to this. A constant dark tone, characterized early on from some startlingly unforeshadowed warped scenes and generally down-beat character moods set the stage for a movie about mystery and the unexpected. The mood-setting and tone are good, above what most movies manage to depict, and definitely manage to work emotion out of the viewer to match the actions going on on screen. The first 60% of the movie is virtually perfect in its execution, captures all it aims for with captivating intensity.<br/><br/>But later on movie inconsistencies and redundancies occur that are bad enough to make a movie that otherwise could very well keep you up thinking all night into something that's easy to discredit. Character actions later on in the movie (without spoiling anything) that are so unrealistic and virtually impossible to identify with that it almost completely undermines many key scenes and points of the movie.<br/><br/>Now this isn't an acting problem, the acting in the movie is great. Like I stated earlier as to Ashton's role in the movie, the supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. And in a movie all apart radical change, the cast fills their different shoes as well as anyone could.<br/><br/>The problem is (sadly) a script/writing issue. And its so sad because it could have been fixed so easily if just given a couple more months of work.<br/><br/>Now I rate this movie 7 out of 10 not out of impulse. Don't think I'm rating this movie out-of-scale to try and dictate a bad rating. I may have emphasized its flaws a lot, but it has more than enough positive points to work its way back up the scale. If its writing was given just a little more effort, this could have easily obtained a 9 or 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie may bug you, but mostly because it gets so close to perfection that its a sad thing it couldn't have been pushed those extra steps. This movie is certainly thought-provoking (I'm not talking about particular complexity, but the hypothetical is powerfully-executed enough to make you think), emotionally-moving, and all-in-all entertaining."

","Most psychology majors have a motivation for succeeding at academia-it's their own fundamental problems which they try to figure out. Maybe they find the answers, maybe they don't, but along the way, many become successful at their profession. This movie is an incredible thought experiment, as the main character, Evan, painfully plays out several alternate universe threads, ultimately making the sacrifice of distancing himself from the person he loves the most. The beautiful thing about choosing a psychologist as the protagonist is that the viewer is left in suspense at the end of the film, even though everything is neatly explained. Though the events may never have happened (if one is to believe the linear explanation of the plot) Evan has the memories of them, and therefore is either truly insane, or a complete master of his own mind with the ability to empathize with others and understand all possible outcomes of a mental decision. If you liked this one, you may try watching or reading ""Lathe of Heaven"" by Ursula K Leguin for an older take on the same concept, but the cinematography in ""Butterfly"" is excellent."

","This review recommends you watch the ""directors' cut"" before sampling the ""theatrical version"" of ""The Butterfly Effect"". Also, it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments, good and bad, until after viewing; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up. The writer/director team of Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments, or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis. Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate, thought out, well paced, and imaginative drama.<br/><br/>The protagonist is unstuck young ""Evan Treborn"" (played by Ashton Kutcher, John Patrick Amedori, and Logan Lerman). The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends: ""Kayleigh"" (Amy Smart, Irene Gorovaia, and Sarah Widdows), ""Tommy"" (William Lee Scott, Jesse James, and Cameron Bright), and ""Lenny"" (Elden Henson, Kevin Schmidt, and Jake Kaese). Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father (Eric Stoltz), and Evan's loving mother (Melora Walters) are the main parental figures. To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement. The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable, and rarely achieves at the level evident. This is also a technically beautiful film.<br/><br/>Be prepared. The character ""George Miller"" is a pedophile, who has obviously abused his children (off screen). ""Mr. Miller"" invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera; it is a non-erotic, tastefully filmed scene. But, the violence, especially between the young children, is disturbing to the extreme; certainly, it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse. In the case of ""The Butterfly Effect"", artistic license trumps irreparable damages. ""I'll come back for you"" indeed. <br/><br/>******** The Butterfly Effect (2004) Eric Bress, J.

Hey I know this film isn't a documentary, but, it frustrated me that the confused, ditzy 'story line' didn't offer any 'REAL' solutions to 'change events'...it always felt 'hopeless', and, the DVD ending, done my head in! What a miserable, sad, hopeless, negative ending... but maybe, even especially, for someone, suffering severe depression!<br/><br/>I'm not.<br/><br/>But anyone who knows 'even just a little bit about mental illness', should realize what this last idea implies...it suggests that, 'had he', (Kutchers character), not 'existed',(as the movie portrays in the, death of 'him', the baby), that everyone else's live's would have been... 'much nicer and all rosy without him'!

","I snagged this film via good IL Netflix, and I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised. The concept and the script for this work is extremely clever and well mapped out. I've watched both the theatrical release, and the director's cut...both of which offer a solid story, with a lot of intrigue, and very clear resolutions. I do find that my preference lies with the Director's Cut on this film (always good to see what the director really wants...not the test audiences).<br/><br/>The look and the direction and the writing are all top work in Butterfly, but as I said above, the acting could use a whetstone.<br/><br/>Ashton has definitely displayed some chops in his role here, but the heaviness of the Evan character would might been better handled by someone with a bit more flex. I found myself often taken out of the experience of this film when Ashton went into ""Scared Face"" mode or the generic ""Where Am I?"" rolly eyed panic. <br/><br/>His awakenings, and many realizations were very forced. These are pivotal and horrifying moments in this man's life, but the reality of these events seemed played as opposed to ""experienced"" (no fan of 'method acting' here, but there are things that happen when one is really connected to their material properly...they get Oscars). <br/><br/>This isn't to rule out Ashton...he wasn't horrible...and this is definitely a huge step in the right direction to avoid the potential career trap of being ""Forever Kelso"". Kudos for breaking barriers like that...look what it has done for Johnny Depp!<br/><br/>This is surely worth the time to scope out. It will spark discussion (though not remotely as much as somewhat similar film, Donnie Darko...oy!), and certainly entertain."

A science fiction fan in all aspects i liked the unique perspective that you don't need any technology to time travel but ""power of the mind"". I would have to say i thought considerably about the movie after watching, wondering exactly what about the movie I liked and didn't, and the twists. To be honest, 20 mins into the movie i at first wondered if i was actually watching the right movie because I at first thought it did not seem to meet with the blurb - you catch on eventually though. I decided after walking out though that i would HAVE to buy this movie and when it was released, had to go to several shops before i found one that wasn't sold out. <br/><br/>What a disappointment when i bought it on DVD though! What on earth were they thinking though to change the movies end? Not only was it NOT what i saw in the cinemas, they didn't even have the ending i saw in the deleted scenes!

"superscal23","Null","1","2","8 August 2004"," Close, but not quite there
","Like so many Hollywood thrillers of the last few years, The Butterfly Effect starts with a good plot and premise, but goes awry along the way and ends up being just another 2 1/2 star movie.<br/><br/>My review is based on the director's cut DVD, as I have not seen the theatrical release.  The plot of the movie is quite interesting.  Although it plays as a time travel sci-fi movie, the real point of the movie is about how the smallest of details can affect the lives of millions of people, hence the title.  From this aspect, I found the movie to be very interesting.  The time travel sequences are also interesting to see what is going to be different every time Evan returns to the present.<br/><br/>Where the movie goes wrong is in the characters and the execution of that plot.  The movie is full of characters who act like characters from other movies, and not like real people.  All frat boys are not rude, insensitive, cheating idiots.  I'd be willing to bet that sorority houses are not full of girls walking around in their underwear or less.  I doubt that a pedophile being called a ""f%$@bag"" by a child would really stop him.  And finally, you do not get sent to a maximum security prison while awaiting trial, especially in an obvious self defense situation.<br/><br/>In listening to the DVD commentary, the cause of these problems is obvious. The two writer/directors are so in love with themselves and their apparent struggle to get this movie made, that they have no concept of what works and what doesn't.  The make comparisons to Psycho, The Insider, Gladiator, and Saving Private Ryan while describing their glorified teen movie.<br/><br/>By the way, Ashton Kutcher's performance in this movie is just fine.  If you can't see past the dumb characters he's played in the past, that's your fault, not his."
"noizyme","8","1","2","27 July 2004"," Twilight Zone revisited gets emotional, disturbing
","This movie was damn good, especially after seeing the horribly thin range of Ashton Kutcher's acting choices in the past.  I'm glad that he changed my mind about his career because I was getting pretty fed-up with this possible pretty-boy/actor thing going on with him.  The movie had me annoyed at first, for the constant foreshadowing and the switch of the plot that occurs every 10 minutes or so.  (I hate that trait which is made so popular nowadays with Memento and films like that...I personally think that mysteries could be unravelled in a different way)<br/><br/>::PLOT RUINED:: So anyways, I was taken back by the trippy flashback/memory loss material and the fact that the journals jogged his memory to such an extent where they acted as a portal for the future to change.  This allows the movie to grow more on you because you want everything that continues to go wrong with Kutcher's character to change for the better but unfortunately...can't reveal the end now!<br/><br/>I found myself crying (a 23 year-old man) at a few scenes because of how Kutcher handles his delivery.  Amy Smart does a touching and brilliant job as the love-interest-since-teenagehood character, transforming herself into 3 different entities with unique personalities in the same movie.  Very Twilight Zone-esque...<br/><br/>It deserves the 8 that I gave it because of the aforementioned actors' portrayals, the brilliant tie-ins that directors Bress & Gruber wrap into this focussed ending, and the great existence of the alternate lifestyle changes for the character of Evan Treborn.  Great film and a new standard is set for Kutcher to continue..."

","**potential spoilers**<br/><br/>Every time Evan ""traveled back in time"", he ended up in the future in a substantially changed situation. Every time, that is, except (at least) once: in order to convince his god-fearing cellmate that he was ""special"", Evan traveled back in time and stabbed himself on each hand with vertical metal spires, thereby creating ""jesus like"" stigmata to appear on his hands.<br/><br/>Here's the question: Why is Evan still in prison? The prison scenario was the culmination of an idyllic life, albeit one in which Tommy became a maladjusted psychotic (more so than before). Wouldn't creating self-inflicted woulds lead Evan down another path, perhaps involving incarceration at Sunnyvale? It's hard to imagine why creating the self-inflicted wounds wouldn't have opened up another ""timeline"", as was true with every other future-altering juncture in Evan's past.<br/><br/>Another question is this: After young Evan gave Kayleigh's dad a verbal thrashing, Evan entered a timeline in which (1) Kayleigh grew up a happy woman, (2) Tommy became the embittered recipient of all abuse that he previously shared with Kayleigh, and (3) Evan became a frat guy. This is strange, because there was no indication that Evan's NOT being in a fraternity was the proximate result of the abuse he and Kayleigh endured at the hands of Kayleigh's dad."

Personally, I found that concept brilliant.<br/><br/>The bit where Kayleigh's brother beat up the customer in the cinema and then laughed as he was being dragged outside did have me slightly confused though, who was possessing him??  One minute he is with the others about to watch dynamite blow a post box to bits and although, mischievious to say the least, not ""evil"", the next he is about to set a dog on fire!  It was almost as if, he too, were going back in time but from a different perspective in the future.<br/><br/>In another scene I didn't find the brother, who was now a Christian, out of sorts - I know some other viewers had trouble with that one - as it is just showing how, after throwing the mother and baby to the ground and so helping to save their lives - it changed his own life and he went on to the side of light rather than darkness.<br/><br/>I thought the film was thought-provoking and I am pleased that I saw it, I will also be buying it on DVD when it comes out."

The plot appears to be the major feature of the movie, but the plot as it stands alone, fails. I was unsatisfied that other more subtle ethical and sociological themes weren't better drawn out.<br/><br/>From the trailers alone, science fiction buffs will easily recognize the plot as a variant of an oft-used time travel theme. To experience the definitive use of this theme, I suggest the reader obtain a copy of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" by Ursula K.

Amy Smart is able to make Kayleigh believable in all her alternate futures as well as Kutcher's Evan is able to love her no matter how bad he's made her.  Elden Henson and Tommy Lee Scott also offer very transitional roles as Lenny and Tommy, and manage to pull them off well.<br/><br/>One thing that I absolutely love about this movie is the stress on how something so small, what may seem like an insignificant sentence at the time, can ultimately alter who you are or will be in the future.<br/><br/>All in all, The Butterfly Effect is one of the best movies I've ever seen and definitely one of the most though provoking.

","I saw this movie the other night with my unsuspecting girlfriend. She is the type who dislikes violence very much. Well, within the first twenty minutes she was visibly upset and shaken. I asked her if she wanted to leave, but she could tell by the sparkle in my eyes and the skip in my walk (which is amazing, since I was obviously sitting) that I was thoroughly enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed every moment of this movie. It's the first movie in a long time that made me feel uneasy, which last happened during Event Horizon (although I didn't like that one too much). Not to say that's a bad thing, though. If a movie can evoke some sort of feeling of distress or fright in me, then it's doing a great job.<br/><br/>The acting was decent. I didn't expect an Oscar winning performance from Kutcher, but he did a nice job. The supporting cast was on par as well. After seeing this, I'd consider seeing Ashton's other movies.<br/><br/>As far as the story, it couldn't have been better. I enjoyed every little twist that happened, and the cut scenes made me jump a little in my seat.<br/><br/>
By the end I was incredibly happy by what had just happened. I sat through the credits and just stared in awe while Oasis played. Couldn't have asked for anything better.<br/><br/>Hell, even my girlfriend liked it (although she was rather disturbed).<br/><br/>My rating - 9.5/10.<br/><br/>I too will be purchasing this on DVD when it comes out.<br/><br/>So, yes, go see this movie. Do not listen to the critics, who are obviously blind in their ratings because it's Ashton Kutcher. They're too 'high and mighty' to give it an honest rating. They fear by giving it a good rating, they'd lose some sort of credibility, which in my mind, they never had in the first place.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-see movie."

","I saw the trailer for this film each time I went to see Return of the King, and each time I saw the trailer I knew I wanted to see this movie.  It is not at all what I expected.  I hate spoilers, so I'll try not to reveal anything except that this movie is VERY intense.  The trailer is put together in such a way that what I ""knew"" from the trailer wasn't how things turned out.  There were a lot of twists and unexpected turns, and there were many places where the audience gasped in unison.  The script is nothing short of brilliant, as is the acting and directing.  This isn't exactly a feel-good ""warm and fuzzy"" movie, but I can't wait to see it again.  DO NOT take young children -- it earns it's R rating.  Definitely thought-provoking and well worth seeing.

","What can I say, there are no words for what I want to express about this film.  The Butterfly Effect is the best film I have ever seen, and I have seen thousands of movies and published several movie reviews.  The Butterfly Effect is such a diverse film that it's hard to catagorize it, although it's primarily a psychological mind bender, it could also be labled as a ""tear jerker"" or drama.  The acting is also superb in this film, character interaction is flawless and Ashton Kutcher certainly delivers some surprising acting skills.  Although the film starts to lag halfway through it picks right back up immediately and does not take from the film's caliber.  Even though the film is amazing, I must give a lesser review on the ending, although the ending was good and suited the film's plot, I think viewers would've wanted something more satisfactory.  In conclusion I can only say, ""Go see the Butterfly Effect NOW!"""

It wasn't one of his stupid goofy characters like he normally plays.  I liked him in this movie.  I thought the movie played out very well.  The theater i was at had some difficulty with focus on the picture for about 10 minutes, I got the point.  I really liked it and I would recommend it to others, but I think you have to be into the whole time displacement type of thing, which i am but i am sure you don't have to at the same time."

It's not what I expected, but that's why I watch film, to see something new.  This one is definitely something new.

","Meet Evan(Ashton Kutcher) a young disturbed man suffering from blackouts and memory loss from his troubled past. The only thing that can help him is his journal, which can make him travel back in time and save the love of his life Kayleigh(Amy Smart) from becoming an unhappy suicidal crack whore. But of course, whenever Evan travels back in time, he manages to screw up the future even more so this Butterfly Effect has really not much effect at all. Now, maybe this movie wouldn't have been half as bad if the cast was different because the acting was just terrible. Starting from Logan Lerman who portrays the younger version of Evan and gives a painfully bad performance back to Ashton Kutcher who mumbles throughout the whole movie and his serious facial expressions were priceless. The only person who gave a great performance was Amy Smart. This movie had the whole audience roaring with laughter and half of them walking out. Note to Ashton: Stick to Comedy and don't mess with the future. I would give The Butterfly Effect 4/10."

","I was recommended this movie as a ""fun psychological thriller""...which it is. But after being on a bit of a psycho-thriller binge this week, this has to be the worst. To be brief, the writing is terrible and it feels like a hallmark movie from around the same time period. I promise you there is nothing pleasurable about this movie. It's one of those early 2000s movies that have a good idea behind it but ultimately its directing, writing, and execution ruin it. I gave it a 6/10 generously, as I was so shocked by its lackluster, I originally gave it a 4. Please do not waste your time watching this movie, as it is overly-corny, oddly morbid, and though I did watch the theatrical version on Netflix, I read the director's cut version, and even then it's only slightly better. I promise you, you will regret watching this movie. I'm a sucker for Hollywood releases like this but this is not one of the good ones."

","The Butterfly Effect was one of the greatest disappointments of film year 2004. The story is poorly developed and full of functional anomalies that make it pretty much unwatchable if you are like me and demand some reasonable explanations for the unreasonable leaps a story might ask you to swallow. Being a time travel film, I expected the Butterfly Effect to be an exercise is suspending my disbelief, but I was unable to enjoy this movie due to the pure bad acting and absurd plotting, the badly developed supernatural elements not withstanding. The dialog was little more than monotonic mumbling. The casting was awful, especially with regards to the main character (played most unconvincingly by Ashton Kutcher.) I understand that some people really liked this film and I can almost see why, but I would be dishonest if I didn't state openly that I felt like I was watching an over-budgeted student film made by the spoiled and over-privileged children of industry bigwigs."
"TxMike","Null","2","8","10 February 2005"," One of the more interesting movies I have seen lately.
","I have always loved ""science fiction"" movies, because I have no trouble suspending my disbelief and just going along with the premise, and see what turns out. To be able to imagine ""what if"" that really could happen? I really enjoyed ""Butterfly Effect."" As they say in the trailer, ""If you change one thing, you change everything."" Evan (several actors at different ages) is not your usual kid, he has periodic ""blackouts"" and the doctors have no explanation. So at 7 he is asked to begin daily journal writing, and these journal entries become springboards for most of the drama for the second half of the movie. By our current scientific knowledge, what happens in the movie is clearly NOT possible, but it makes for a very thrilling two-hour ride.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. The movie begins in present time, grown Evan (Ashton Kutcher) is in a blue institutional coat, barricades himself in a room, and he mutters something as he writes a note, ""If you find this note that means my plan didn't work out ... I need to go back and do something to save her."" The 'her' was Kayleigh (Amy Smart, grown up), the girl he grew up with and is the only one he ever loved. In one of his 'going back' episodes, trying to prevent the death of someone else, the dynamite he was trying to dispose of accidentally killed Kayleigh. But I am getting a bit ahead of myself...<br/><br/>When the kids were 13, smoking cigarettes and looking at 'Hustler', Kayleigh's mean brother Tommy suggests they blow something up. A stick of dynamite stored for years in his dad's thermos, the fuse is too short so Evan has them use his short cigarette as a fuse extension. Slow to blow up, a young woman and baby come home, go to get the mail, and they die in the explosion. This messes everyone up, I suppose if Evan had not suggested the fuse mod, everything would have turned out different. When Evan and his mom move away in a moving van, he holds a note to the window for Kayleigh, ""I'll come back for you."" But he doesn't.<br/><br/>Cut back to the present time, Evan is in college, excelling in Psychology, interested in ""memory association."" He celebrates seven years with no blackouts. But he and mom go to a Psychic as a joke, she looks at Evan's hand and horrified says, ""You have no time-line. You were never meant to be."" Which was prophetic. But he goes back to find Kayleigh, who was a waitress, she is angry the way her life turned out, ""Why did you leave me here to rot?"" Back at college he receives a phone message from Tommy, ""She killed herself tonight. She's dead ... and so are you."" <br/><br/>Evan by now had figured out that through mind control he could read a particular journal entry and go back to that point in his life and, perhaps, change things. He goes back to age 7 when Kayleigh's dad was trying to make a porno video in the basement with Evan and Kayleigh, and in his adult voice but as a 7 year old, told their dad to never touch Kayleigh again. When he awoke, everything was different. He was a frat boy, Kayleigh was in his bed with him. But Tommy had grown up a criminal because dad's perversion had become directed at him instead of at Kayleigh. Tommy showed up on campus, there was a fight, Evan beat and killed him in self defense, but was imprisoned awaiting trial.<br/><br/>Finally deciding to make everything right, he went back to prevent the explosion in the mailbox incident, they save the mother and child, but Evan gets both lower arms blown off, Kayleigh grows up as the girlfriend of another. Still another attempt, to destroy the dynamite years earlier, results in Kayleigh's death at 7. Setting up the final scene where in a final desperate act of love for Kayleigh, Evan views a home movie taken in the hospital when he was about to be born. He goes back to that point, as a baby about to be born, and strangles himself in his mother's womb, as a way to save Kayleigh.<br/><br/>I understand from reading elsewhere that this director's cut on the DVD ends differently from the one shown in theaters. The whole movie illustrates the point that ""if you change one thing, you change everything."" Near the end of the movie, grown Kayleigh tells Evan that she lived with her dad because she wanted to stay near Evan. So, if Evan had never been born, her life would have turned out different. In the brief glimpses we see at the end, indeed all of Evan's friends turned out to have better lives."

It gives you leads in all possible directions and instead of following them up just discards them, now he went mad and then he was just dreaming the whole thing.<br/><br/>To top this add the worst lead I can remember, Mr. Ashton Kutchner. He has no charisma, no acting skills or character whatsoever, at least in this movie.<br/><br/>'The Butterfly Effect' does have a certain drive to it however, which I can only curse as it made me waste my time with it.

"MikeC19","4","1","3","25 June 2018"," What an effect on me...
","I chose to watch this movie, because I missed it in theaters, like Ashton Kutcher in comedic films, and wanted to see his acting range in this. He's surprisingly good. This movie, overall though, is pretty unpleasant. There aren't moments of humor to give you a break, it just hits you over and over and over, metaphorically speaking. Amy Smart was good in it, too, playing multiple versions of her character. The acting is really the highlight of this. It's not that enjoyable of a film, because of all the nasty, horrible things people do in it. If you want to watch it for the acting, I'm sure you'll be impressed, but otherwise, it's pretty unpleasant. 4/10"
"xxxrobstarxxx","3","1","3","20 July 2016"," A really good idea made into a really bad film
","First off there are no good actors in the film,Ashton Kutcher does an okay job but everyone else (especially the child actors) are just bad actors. They can't deliver serious lines and act so strangely to build mystery,that isn't built due to a poor script making it that just feel like they're being needlessly cryptic.<br/><br/>Another thing is this movie has so many scenes that are out of place I found myself bursting out laughing at how bad they were,something I haven't seen in quite a while. The movie acts like it earns these scenes by building rules and characters that it just hasn't built,like a really bad Donnie Darko that desperately wants to be loved.<br/><br/>The flashbacks he gets after waking up in every reality are pointless because they reveal nothing and you could explain what happened by dialogue between characters,which they do (poorly) ANYWAY! Along with that, there are some interesting ideas in this but they aren't explained and if they are,they're explained poorly. How and Why does time travel run in families? Why can a mystic sense he was never meant to be? Why can he time travel at all? Why does he need his journal to travel? Why does he get a nose bleed every time he travels? Why does he black out at certain points? Is it because they're life changing? Then Why did he black out in school? It probably wouldn't change much if he still grabbed that knife.Why do people like this? Wish I knew.<br/><br/>Two things I have to point out is that the costume design is so tacky and awful it hurts my eyes,I don't know how they could get it that wrong.It also breaks its own rules multiple times,one being where he's in prison talking about his powers,the other prisoner doesn't believe him (of course),so to prove he has powers he goes back in time and stabs his hands,then in the future he has marks on them and the prisoner trusts him.<br/><br/>The movie explains that when you change something it has ALWAYS been that way,it's the main rule and the first one it states VERY clearly. So what would've really happened is the prisoner would say ""you've always had those scars on your hands why are you acting like they're something new?"" That's assuming that NOTHING changed due to it. He probably went to the hospital which would have changed that day and he would've had a cast so he couldn't write in his diary so how can etc,etc, you get the point,it's stupid.<br/><br/>This could have been incredible,but it contradicts itself,the actors are bad,the realities that occur are unrealistic,everything is explained except for the things that need to be explained and any mystery it builds is not interesting or mysterious. 3/10"
"dvts","Null","1","3","8 November 2015"," weirdly brilliant, weirdly weird, weirdly invigorating, and hard to quite categoize
","All time travel stories end in paradox so there's no use even thinking too much about it. After this film you may wonder what exactly happened the first time around. It would have to have been just as it was, except without the blackouts. Except no, that isn't true - because taking out the blackouts changes everything. And his just living the 'important' moments normally, without the weird blackout behavior, also alters everything, so that the later important events wouldn't necessarily have even happened. Also includes the usual paradox where events occur that were dependent on their having occurred in the first place. So. Time travel story. No use even thinking about it.<br/><br/>I'll get my one real criticism out out of the way upfront - the theatrical and director's cut endings are both god awful. The theatrical doesn't even make sense, either for the filmmakers or for the character. He has literally no reason not to go talk to her, and every reason to go talk to her. He knows better than to think he's inherently 'bad for her' or some kind of curse, or that they're doomed - he knows and understands the specific childhood moments that caused the problems. He has avoided them for her - she's fine and grown. So go talk to her. The other ending, with the death in the womb, makes sense, but is just too grim. <br/><br/>That's the thing with this movie - it's one of the most relentlessly depressing, pessimistic movies I've ever seen. A list of the things that occur in the film would read like a rap sheet of the 10 worst people in Hell. There's content in this that is entirely out of place in this kind of narrative. In one scene the characters are shown watching Se7en at a theater - well, to me, there are scenes and elements in this film creepier and scarier, by a lot, than anything in Se7en. To be honest, if you really think about it all, this is actually a weird kind of horror film. But it's like an existential horror film. Just a collection of horrifying experiences and nightmarish circumstances - and the horrific circumstances are always taken fresh, they're always new and acutely felt, so that their full horror is always there for both the viewer and the character. In real life we rarely realize the full horror of our situation, however horrible it may be. We're just so used to it, and we arrived at it so naturally and so gradually - we take it for granted. We don't see it as it really is. If at odd moments we do understand the full horror of our circumstances, we tend to panic. But these moments are fleeting. <br/><br/>Well, one way to describe this movie is to say that it's a succession of such moments of sudden realization of the full horror of one's circumstances. So, as I say - an existential horror film. Maybe the best ever.<br/><br/>For all that, it left me feeling invigorated and challenged. It left me thinking about my own life and my own decisions and my own paths not taken. ""Oh man,"" I thought, watching it, ""I'm one of the bad versions."" Most people, if they were honest, would say the same as they watched it. The film made me reassess and want to do better. <br/><br/>Not many movies leave us with these lingering feelings of mission and purpose and possibility. But certain narratives and types of narrative can do the trick. Source Code is another one. They just leave you thinking and feeling all shaken up. You sit there and reflect on your life and feel you could live it differently and better. <br/><br/>This is valuable. As to the rest - quality of the production is top notch, writing is brilliant, acting is solid across the board. As mentioned already, subject matter is just ludicrously brutal and depressing. And maybe all the worse for being depicted matter of factly. There's no sentimentalism about any of the stuff. There's not even that much sensationalism about it. It's all just boom boom boom, very casually and matter of factly presented to you. The film is super casual about horrors that in other movies would have an aura of unspeakable horror and all the solemnity that goes with that and so on. No real solemnity here. And it's unsettling. <br/><br/>So yea. It's a good one. I didn't expect much from it. But as far as the ending - a film this relentlessly depressing and brutal deserves its happy ending. Give them the serendipitous moment and let the sun shine on your characters for once."

","The film takes a little time to get going with a good half hour concentrating on the lead characters' early lives as children and teenagers, but it's all connected to the later scenes, so pay attention because it all comes together in the end. The kids playing the younger parts were also very good, as was Eric Stoltz in yet another scuzzy role (love the drink). What really hooked me about this film was its basic concept though, that being the idea of one being able to change one's past, in order to ""fix"" one's present or future. I think a lot of people are going to be able to connect to this premise because we would all love to have second chance at various crossroads from our lives, so the idea of legitimately altering a moment from our past, is an intriguing one. It's also presented in such a way that I was able to buy it (at least, for the film's purposes). I also appreciated the film's dark, grungy feel, which added to its consistently ominous atmosphere. It also needs to be said that this isn't a ""happy go lucky"" movie whatsoever and is actually quite depressing at times with stints in prison, prostitution, mental problems, child abuse, violence and various other negative societal elements permeating its fabric. This isn't MY BOSS' DAUGHTER 2, folks. The film's conclusion is also somewhat ambiguous, which I tend to appreciate, especially in cases like this one in which fate plays a big part.<br/><br/>Even if we were able to change our pasts, destiny would ultimately find its way back into our lives, one way or another. The first ""must see"" movie of the 2004."

","The Butterfly Effect is a science-fiction psychological thriller film features Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. Chaos theory teaches us that small events can have enormous consequences.It informs us that butterfly flapping its wings in Asia could result in a hurricane halfway around the world.Its title refers to the butterfly effect.Also,this hypothetical effect illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time.The film was written and directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.<br/><br/>Evan Treborn has been experiencing blackouts at moments of high emotional stress, such as when a friend of the family molested him, or when he and some friends became involved in a prank-gone-bad,since he age 7. Later,he learns that, by concentrating on the words in a journal he composed while growing up,he finds that he has the ability to travel back in time to inhabit his former self - that is, his adult mind inhabits his younger body and to change the present by changing his past behaviors.Sometimes, he can make changes; sometimes he can't. When a childhood friend, Kayleigh Miller, commits suicide because of something Evan does, he becomes obsessed with reworking her life. And, when he does, he learns that he might have been better off not meddling with the complex formula of cause-and-effect for there are unintended consequences for all. <br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher has this opportunity to prove his haters that he can act and probably shed ""Punk'd"" and ""That '70s Show"" as well as the ""go-to guy"" for romantic comedies.I think that he did a decent job in this film but it has yet to satisfy his harshest critics that he can really act. Many of his fans pointed out that this film is one evidence that he can deliver in the portrayal of Steve Jobs in his latest movie,Jobs.Too bad,that film only allowed the critics to held on to their beliefs about his lack of capability as a dramatic actor as he lacked the conviction of playing Evan that the viewer was barely absorbed in his character.<br/><br/>With regards to the film,I think that it is a serviceable thriller and science fiction.Although it has an interesting premise,the story fails considering that there were plot holes in it and it is basically flawed. Also,it was sort of sloppily conceived and unevenly paced.Added to that,it gets sidetracked to sex and violence as it resorts to gratuitous piece of sadism, sexuality or sleaze."

An original idea with some real twists and turns that anyone who loves psych thrillers with just a dash of sci-fi and romance for spice could appreciate. It just seemed like it was running out of steam during some of the scenes and experienced some continuity problems in others. Also appreciated Mr. Kutcher's attempt to be taken seriously in The Wood as an EP and an actor. It still did decent B.O. and provided a little depth for a Friday-night flick with a significant other, and no celluloid was harmed in the making of this movie, but I still think I would have preferred to go back in time, confronted Messrs.

Since the age of seven, he had been writing a diary, and it is by rereading the diary that he discovers that he can travel back in time to change the circumstances of his life.<br/><br/>This is where the title of the film comes it. The theory is that if a butterfly flaps its wings in China, it was cause a hurricane in the United States. So to with Evan's life. He travels back to that one moment, and does something differently, and when he returns he discovers that his entire life has changed. However, he is never really satisfied, and in the end he is seeking the perfect life, but discovers that no matter what happens, he can never make his life perfect. Further, it is only with the diary that he is able to alter his life, so when he loses his diary (or even discovers that it was never written) does he lose this power.<br/><br/>As mentioned, even a slight change has enormous consequences. He does get to a point where life seems really good. His friends have turned out well, and all seems good, with the exception that he is seriously crippled. Thus is revealed Evan's selfish side. He wants his life to be perfect, and when he attempts to create the perfect life, it backfires. In the end he decides that it is better to not even have been born."
"sumez","5","1","3","19 July 2011"," A great potential wasted through unbelievable characters and a lack of understanding of its own concept
","It might be unfair to The Butterfly Effect (TBE) that I came fresh from watching Juno, a movie which really stands out due to its cast of sincere and believable characters, but TBE's biggest flaw is indeed that it is based entirely around awkward and severely unsympathetic characters, including, but not limited to, its main character.<br/><br/>The major theme of the movie is extremely appealing to me. First, there's the ability to go back in time and change key events of your life in hope of seeing what could have become of you and those around you, basically time travel without any kind of fantasy bogus, which I think is very admirable. And then the entire concept of the butterfly effect, which the movie is named after - the idea that any change however small can cause a chain effect resulting in an entirely different future. I find this ""what if..."" concept extremely fascinating, and was really hoping for the movie to explore it.<br/><br/>However this is exactly where TBE falls flat on its face - What it deals with has nothing to do with the Butterfly Effect. I can think of a ton of minor actions and choices in my life that have ended up shaping the person I have become, and will continue to evolve into. Decided to go to a certain spontaneous party, meeting certain people, that would go on to introduce you to other circles, experiences, new hobbies, new music, etc., eventually influencing who you might end up spending the rest of your life with, what kids you will or will not have, and so on. But what Evan, our (completely not) likable main character does, is go back and change major traumatic events of his life causing an almost instant and drastic change in one or more of the movies deck of characters. Apparently -everyone- in the movie is extremely mentally unstable and able to suddenly have an incredible change of heart and even go as far as to killing someone for being jerks, despite the fact that they are normal good hearted people in the other realities. This might make sense if they have been pushed into a different social situation that has influenced their person over the years, but that isn't what happens. Instead we're treated to this idea that we should all be lucky we didn't end up as heroin addicts in jail with everyone you know being brutally murdered, because apparently there's a 50/50 chance between that and whatever other life you could be living. Sliding Doors is a romantic comedy, and it was able to demonstrate the butterfly effect much, much better than this movie ever comes close to.<br/><br/>I realize The Butterfly Effect is just a stupid teen drama and shouldn't be taken too seriously, or treated as a ""realistic"" movie, but I also feel the theme it deals with IS very serious, and has the potential of showing how incredible the concept of actual real life ""destiny"" is. A potential that is unfortunately dropped on the floor and never picked up.<br/><br/>One thing I deed feel strongly from this movie was that it was heavily influenced by Hollywood producers wanting something more simple and action packed than the original intention. Especially the ending is so awkward and out of tune with the theme of the movie that I just had to watch the director's cut ending immediately after seeing the theatrical cut. Unfortunately this ending is possibly even worse and only displays that the directors didn't have any idea where to go with the movie either. And well, looking them up on IMDb shows that their other major projects were Final Destination 2 and Final Destination 4, and I immediately feel stupid for even trying to take this movie seriously. What I don't get, however, is why everyone else have been bugging me to see this ""amazing"" movie for so long..."

","As a casual observer of US culture, I certainly was somewhat aware of ""The Butterfly Effect"" in 2004. I remember not having the time to see it or a dozen other pretty-good movies of that period, and putting it on the shelf in the back of my mind, to come around and get to later. And I of course absorbed the general critics' one-or-two line dismissals, which a sci fi fan like myself finds to be all too frequent in the reviewing of what we later find were very risky and rewarding films.<br/><br/>I just watched the movie today, and I SOOOOOOOOOOO regret not seeing it in the theater or in the year of its release. Far from being a confusing or uneven piece, this movie hits a home run in the fan's major area of concern: will the movie violate its supernatural premise, and fall apart in the middle? The answer was a resounding NO. Will the movie remain true to the scientific premise of its mechanisms and theories and build a great story on a foundation, and not build a bad foundation to support a tasty but illogical story? YES.<br/><br/>This is a film Ashton Kutcher and everyone else herein can and should be proud of, just as Jake Gyllenhaal and everyone involved can and should be proud of Donnie Darko, and for all the same reasons.<br/><br/>This is the trickiest kind of film to nail, and done right it can reach out to many beyond the genre fans who will seek, find and love it. This film is on par with the best out on this edge; Donnie Darko as mentioned, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Happy Accidents...<br/><br/>The nicest surprise for me, is that someone took the odd illogical time travel method of the goofy love story ""Somewhere In Time,"" and employed it in a quantum-leap style sensibility that made for a brilliant and constantly interesting and engaging movie. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br/><br/>I might check out the directors cut, even the alternate endings, but I don't know how they can add anything to the amazing movie I just watched."

The plot evolves nicely and while the ending could be better, it wasn't as bad as I expected.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a psycho-thriller, there are better ones (i.g.

","""The Butterfly Effect"" evokes a weird, lasting feeling of shock when the credits roll. It's a powerful and complete movie that will mess with your head in all the right ways.<br/><br/>The character development here is superb, having the viewer take a trip through the most important moments in the life of the main characters (even in their childhood) while maintaining these scenes crucial to the main plot. Which is the greatest aspect of this movie by far.<br/><br/>The licensed music fits perfectly in the movie (I also found out quite some bands / songs I enjoy through this movie!) and the original compositions are just amazing. The visual effects are top notch, without ever feeling like too much or too little, it's just right, just how it should be. Photography is a wonder to look at, showing amazingly well when a scene is in the present or the past, without distracting too much from the whole experience.<br/><br/>Acting is also superb in here, with every actor delivering their characters like they should - even the younger ones! Impressed!<br/><br/>This movie is for you if you enjoy a haunting and bone-chilling mystery thriller that will mess with your head and keep you glued to the screen until the very end. A classic, for me.<br/><br/>Flawless 10 out of 10."

And as for Aston, This movie puts him to the top. A must see movie for all of those who is fascinated with time travel and changing the past and the future. This would make a good movie rental and a movie you can sit back and watch straight through. None of it was boring, and all was very well filmed. Amy Smart played a good role as well. She had to play multiple characters, and she did alright. Everyone in the movie was pretty good. I like the prison part because Aston in the movie didn't make himself out to be some macho, but instead a sissy, which is true in the sense that he's a new guy on the block, and he's not very big or strong."

","I have just watched this film about 10 minutes ago. I thought it was a well thought out film. I couldn't believe how the writers / Directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, could have done a film that complex.<br/><br/>At first the film did feel a bit sick with the way that everything was happening, but as the film went on, I started to understand how everything was working. It was brilliant.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher's character was awesome. The way that he had black outs and could remember anything that had happened. Then when he got to the age of 20. He started to read the stuff that he had written since the age of seven. For some reason, as he was reading him memories before his black outs. He was remembering the things he could remember, but there was a catch to it. He could change the stuff he could remember, to things that he thought he did. As he started doing this more, he realised that he could change his life by make himself do things differently that they should of done.<br/><br/>But by doing this, his life changed every time to something that he didn't want to happen. At the end, he realised that he had to do one thing that he really didn't want to do but he had to. And that is what you will find out when you watch it."

","I can't believe I have never seen this movie, its JUST the type of movie for me and its actually a well done one at that, which a lot of these movies in my experience don't seem to be. This one was flawless, the acting, I was surprised at Aston Kutcher, he performed flawlessly and so did all of the other main characters! It simply makes me think..a lot about everything, I think that in order to understand this movie completely, it would need to be watched a few times, as there are so many hidden aspects and details that you would miss the first time unless your paying very serious attention to detail. The first part of the movie, was so strange in my eyes, I was really confused and shocked at the brutality of it all. Then I started to understand what the plot really was, and I grew to love this movie like I do now. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies with a twist and movies that will make you think. It shows that all actions, no matter how small, have consequences, The Butterfly Effect."
"Red-Barracuda","7","1","3","1 June 2009"," It's the little details that count in the end...
","This inventive thriller explores the chaos theory. In it, a man discovers that he has the power to travel back in time and re-act certain moments from his past, ultimately, changing the future. He finds out, however, that doing the right thing does not always ultimately end up improving the future. Where he may benefit, a friend may suffer or vice-versa. The message of the film is that you cannot play God. You cannot expect to create a Utopian future. Events unfold in life in a certain way and sometimes bad things need to happen for good events to unfold, or indeed very bad things can come of best intentions.<br/><br/>The main character in the film experiences black-outs as a child. Later in life he discovers that these black-outs serve as the portals for where he can re-enact pivotal moments and, hence, change history. His destiny and the destinies of those around him are inextricably affected by his actions in these brief moments. This is a fairly artificial framework for the story but it allows the film-makers to explore the idea of The Butterfly Effect (i.e. the concept that the smallest insignificant action could eventually result in a hugely significant outcome). The film successfully shows that it is not so simple to change history by changing small details of the past. Often, even greater horrors are unleashed unexpectedly. This film presents a whole host of outcomes. It incorporates many horrors that life can throw up â€“ child abuse, violence, mental illness, physical disability, prostitution, drug addiction, bullying, incurable illnesses, imprisonment and sexual assault. It also deals more generally with love and loss. These are all big issues but they are incorporated into the narrative well. The film successfully shows that cause and effect is not a simplistic thing.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this film. As well as having a few interesting things to say about fate, it also works very well as a compelling mystery-thriller. Well worth checking out."
"Quebec_Dragon","7","1","3","24 May 2009"," Weird and off-beat: definitely not the usual Ashton Kutcher film
","I'm a sucker for this kind of weird off-beat tale with an original fantastical concept, mysteries, repressed memories (or dreams), anti-heroes and a not-so-perfect romance (witness the superior and personal favorites Brazil and Eternal Sunshine). So, it was difficult for me not to like this and indeed I did like it but with some reserves. I loved the script and the alternate reality aspect (don't want to say too much). Ashton Kutcher was OK but a stronger actor would have made the film that much better. I preferred the secondary characters and how they changed. My suggestion is not to worry about the explanation of how things happen (because it bugged me) and take it as a super-hero movie (with no super-heroes) where powers are not logically explained. I preferred the ending of the director's cut although it was a bit far-fetched. <br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress for writing and directing such a film. I must say the strength of the movie is it's screenplay which helps in understanding the complex storyline of the movie. though the main plot of the movie is somewhat old the directors of the film did such a wonderful job in making it so interesting. First i was a bit disappointed as the ending is not what i expected but after sometime i was convinced that it was the best climax this film could offer.This film is sad,haunting,dark,happy,thrilling and entertaining in it's own way. I would recommend you this film if you are planning to watch anything different. For me this is one of those films which you can see with your heart rather than your eyes because this is mainly based on human emotions rather than some unexplainable sci-fi crap. this is a must watch films and don't neglect it because it has not too many big names.<br/><br/>the only problem with the film is that it's sudden transition into a different film when you are expecting something else. but it's the best."
"Red_Flag","2","1","3","8 June 2008"," If only I could change my past, I would have avoided this.
","How is it possible that a film of such disastrous proportion could make both critics and movie goers proclaim it a modern masterpiece? Me? I'd rather watch paint dry. I've never been a big Aston Kutcher fan, well when I say that I do in fact mean I am an avid hater of his so called acting. Charisma, talent and likability. Those are the three vital qualities he lacks as a human being. Let alone an actor. Amy Smart does a commendable job while Melora Walters sinks into the back ground.<br/><br/>Attempting to make a good film out of a novel premise only manages a few unintentional smirks. Ditching the far superior Donnie Darko routine and playing it unbearably camp. There's absolutely no way you could take this film seriously therefore much like the film, its premise rolls to the back of your mind. I was really interested in seeing this movie. Not because of the actors, but because of the intriguing message behind the story. Shame then that not only did it not live up to my expectation but it managed to be worse than I thought it could be.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber make their directorial debut with the sci-fi thriller The Butterfly Effect. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher with facial hair) wants to free himself from his disturbing childhood memories.<br/><br/>As a kid, he often blacked out for long periods of time and tried to detail his life in a journal. As a young adult, he revisits the journal entries to figure out the truth about his troubled childhood friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). When he discovers he can travel back in time in order to set things right, he tries to save his beloved friends.<br/><br/>However, he finds out that relatively minor changes can make major problems for the future. The Butterfly Effect also stars Eric Stoltz, Ethan Suplee, and Melora Walters. The title was inspired by the story A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury.<br/><br/>Naturally it plays like Final Destination on speed, rushing from one bad plot twist to the next. It never takes time to explore its emotions and in all feels not only generic and predictable but also extremely badly paced and therefore un-enjoyable.<br/><br/>Of course, Kutcher's wooden, wide-eyed, sub-Keanu attempts at 'serious' only encourage the splutters, and while criticising him for this is like slapping a baby for crapping in its nappy, it has to be done. He truly is a credibility vacuum, and even if writer/directors Bress and Gruber (Final Destination 2's scribes) had scrawled a quarter-decent script, he'd still have scuppered it. But they haven't, so the blame can be spread.<br/><br/>My Final Verdict? A Donnie Darko rip-off bewildered by its own metaphysical corkscrewing. And one of the most unwittingly funny movies of the year. Avoid at all cost unless you like car crash cinema at its very worst. If Kutcher's performance doesn't put you off the unbearably bad plotting and poor pacing making this the worst film of the year."

This film makes you think about the effect that could have on other people.<br/><br/>A terrific film, with some marvellous performances and one which kept me guessing to the end.

","""In the next 30 seconds you're gonna open 1 of 2 doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.""<br/><br/>This dark and brooding film is incredibly well presented with some superb performances. The theme can be summarized easily with the metaphor of throwing a stone in a pond. The ripples spread far and wide as a result of that small stone. The universal concept of time is a complex and difficult one to understand, it is however based entirely on cause and effect. Evan began to understand this after his first flashback. It is incredible to note that a tiny detail such as a whisper in someones ear can alter the present to such an incredible degree. The viewer is given a taste of the frustration of Evan as he is unable to produce the happy ending he craves so desperately. Addiction also plays a subtle role in the film as the powers of this butterfly effect are as seductive as the powers of God. Perhaps this makes it easier for the viewer to relate to Evan's emotions?<br/><br/>In the end however it becomes clear that a person's life is far too complex and variable to change successfully. This film reminds us that a small wrench thrown into a large machine can still be enough to damage it irreparably."

"zonination","9","1","3","9 July 2006"," Good, but unelaborated, philosophical points.
","Normally, I don't look at the philosophy behind movies, but this one in particular got me thinking: what if we had a chance to change our lives by altering the past? The Butterfly Effect almost perfectly answers this question through a hypothetical scenario. I didn't pay much attention to the acting, music, or lighting, since the storyline was so deep and captivating.<br/><br/>At first, the story is vague with the events in Evan's childhood. Then, as he gets older and looks back into (and alters) his past, it's fascinating to see how everything connects, clicks, and fits together. I also, on many occasions, watched in disbelief or astonishment as some decisions were made.<br/><br/>I was able to develop three philosophical points that this movie offered. One: the past shapes who you are, so make good decisions and they won't haunt you in the future. Two: when you try to change who you are, you usually only make things worse. And three: sometimes we have to let something (or someone) go if we want everything to work out in the end. If you want to see how this factors into the storyline, then watch the movie.<br/><br/>The only upsetting thing I encountered while watching this is that the director didn't elaborate on the philosophies that were offered. They were thrown out there, and they were expressed to a degree, but there was no elaboration. I would have expected a deeper line of thinking so that people's lives would be more enriched by this kind of philosophy. Unfortunately, my only disappointment was that it fell short of said expectations and landed in the sci-fi/thriller category. However, that does not mean that this is a bad movie.<br/><br/>This movie may or may not be philosophical to the average viewer, but it definitely got my mind racing, my heart beating, and my backside on the edge of my seat. Even if you don't notice any of the points mentioned above, this movie would still be greatly enjoyable."

"jerome_horwitz","4","1","3","31 December 2005"," A hodge podge film, sure to please
","(DVD Director's Cut reviewed here) The Butterfly Effect stars Ashton Kutcher as Evan Treborn, and Amy Smart as Kaleigh Miller. The movie begins with a background of Evan and his group of friends as children. We are privy to certain parts of Evan and the other children's' childhoods during certain traumatic and life changing events growing up. These include situations of abuse, acting out, and potentially Evan having a mental disorder which causes lapses or blackouts in his memory. We see a few different age time lines in the film, as children, young adults, and adults.<br/><br/>In current time Evan has developed an ability to modify his past, through the means of some sort of mental energy (genes and or ""reprogramming his brain""). This is where the better part of the movie happens, as he tries to journey back and make corrections. At this point, the typical paradox problems start occurring, perhaps solving one problem but creating other problems that didn't exist prior.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these events are actually supposed to be occurring. I like sci-fi, but I cannot fathom how one could use their mind as a time traveling device in reality. In my opinion, the movie would've been much better having these events occurring only in Evan's mind. <br/><br/>Although this is an age old story, basically of time travel, I didn't find the movie or story completely predictable. Ashton does plays his role very nicely, as well as his complementing cast. The child actors are OK, although maybe a bit flat but they do a good job too.<br/><br/>I'm ambivalent to recommending this movie. Perhaps there are better examples with similar story lines in Donnie Darko or Fight Club (or other movies involving dissociative and alternate realities).<br/><br/>4/10"

","Come on, now. All y'all out there giving this movie 9 or 10 stars need to lay off the glue. This thing is nearly as juvenile as some of the bland TV remakes of Outer Limits episodes. I will toss in a crumb for the pretty boy Ashton K. Considering what he's given to work with, he does the job well enough to stave off any knee-jerk compulsions to blow taters. I am willing to run with unconventional plots and non-linear time renditions. But at least get the details to a semi-credible level if the plot is going to do the Memento thing. The prison sequences were freakin' hilarious. The whole thing wreaked of low budgetness and really bad conceptualization. It gets something of a reprieve for the ""having fun with itself"" factor. Loved the terrier. It's maybe worth a discount rental price. Other than that, immanently forgettable. If you want to see a paradigm of a suspension-of-belief flick that works, check out ""Groundhog Day."" That thing is choice. Out."

","I have seen this film several times now, both the Director's Cut (DR) and the theatrical cut (TC). The fact of the matter is that this is a truly brilliant film.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, Kutcher proving he can be a serious actor (whether he is ever accepted as one is another matter!) and combined with interweaving plot lines, a sense of realisation is created. It is a haunting and tragic film (not feel good but not depressing in the way requiem for a dream is).<br/><br/>In my opinion the TC was a better movie than the DC (basically because the DC just copies Donnie Darko). I would suggest watching the TC first, then you will appreciate the DC.<br/><br/>Have heard that the Butterfly Effect 2 is in pre-production. It could be good (a prequel perhaps).

","Intro: I first seen the trailer for this movie a while back at some movie, and I knew that it was worth a watch. The plot seemed interesting, the feeling was the same way I felt with Donnie Darko when I first seen it. So I knew it was worth while.<br/><br/>Plot Summary: A young man is struggling to get over harmful memories from his childhood in which he suddenly blackouts, but while doing so discovers a technique that allows him to travel back in time and occupy his childhood body during the blackouts changing his history forever. However he also discovers that every change he makes some how alters his future.<br/><br/>Plot: 10/10 Sure the plot of traveling back in time to change the girl you loved has been used quite often, but add a bunch of plot twists and turns and a little bit of a scary element and you got your self a great overall plot.<br/><br/>You start from the beginning of his life and move forward to the present day Ashton Kutcher. He tries to look into his past by remembering but when he visits the woman of his life, something happens. So then he tries to go back to bring her back to life.<br/><br/>The whole feel of the movie is great. You are dragged along with Evan (Kutcher) during his time traveling and remembering.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 The acting in this movie is outstanding by my standards.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher, (""That 70's Show"" and Dude, Where's My Car?) showed that he doesn't have to be such a maniac with what he does and be constantly goofy. He brings out his seriousness and gives great life to Evan.<br/><br/>Other Actors/Actresses include: Amy Smart (Rat Race, Road Trip), Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction, Anaconda), and Ethan Suplee (American History X, Mallrats), as well as the rest of the cast, did so well throughout the movie because every single one of them had changed through the alternate universes. Whether it being a druggie, dying, or any other life changing experience that can change the appearance.<br/><br/>Elements: 10/10 The factor of horror is also quite high. I didn't expect it to be any bit scary but it was. It's suspense was also quite high. I was literally on the edge of my seat. And thats hard to say these days.<br/><br/>Cutting and Special Effects: 10/10 Just wow. The visual effect like explosions and stuff blew me away(no pun intended). Everything was clean and the transitions from his blackouts to go back in time to when he was reliving his past were also clean and cut.<br/><br/>Directing: 10/10 Directorial Debut of directors, J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, The Butterfly Effect is a good Drama/Sci-Fi movie for just about anyone willing to think. Although a highly unlikely event (time travel), the direction of this movie is good and keeps quite a constant flow.<br/><br/>Overall: 10/10 This is a great flick that everyone for a thrill, love story and twisting plot should see. So see it.."
"inferno0020","4","1","3","29 August 2005"," One of the most overrating film I have ever seen
","I don't know why a lot of people dare to call this movie ""good."" This movie is totally overrating.<br/><br/>Of course this story got a original idea, but many exaggerated elements screws up the whole story. Even though the story has a strong storyline for Kutcher to save his sweetheart, his childhood, which is based on a lot of clichés such as child pornography, explosion, animal abuse and a stupid ""Se7en"" performance, is too long and shallow. It is too violent, but does not show any in-depth analyze about little Evan and other characters <br/><br/>When Evan grows up, there are still too much trivia for me to focus on the story. It makes his tragedy, such as going to jail, meeting Kayleigh as a hooker, or committing suicide slow without too much surprise. Even the ending is too predictable. Finally, does Evan learn anything? No, he just gives up saving his sweetheart because craps like ultra-violence, prison rape, drug, happens when he tries to ""help"" someone with violence and cheesy conversation.<br/><br/>Most of all, characters are usually stereotyping ones. Kutcher's performance is too clumsy for me to sympathize his condition. He doesn't even looks sad in his scene of meeting Kayleigh as a hooker. Compared to ""12 Monkeys,"" which has a in-depth analyze about the mental problems and effect of time travel, ""Butterfly Effect"" is like a soap opera, which add too much Hollywood cliché. <br/><br/>It is a movie for someone who had never watched dramas. If you had watched many movies without Hollywood formulas. Sorry, this movie is not for you."
"Loki803","9","1","3","7 August 2005"," Intelligent people like thought-provoking movies
","I have no idea what movie the critics who panned it and the reviewers who rated it poorly were watching. I thought that the overall premise for Butterfly Effect was quite fascinating and very thought-provoking. We've all thought about how the decisions we've made have shaped our lives, and how if we could go back and change some of them, how they would change our lives. That said, I fail to understand how anyone watching this film failed to at least identify with the basis of it. And many have been quick to say that it was unbelievable because they had three different actors playing the parts of each of the characters, one for age 7, age 13, and the adult versions. The child actors they cast not only looked exactly like the adult versions, but they put in some excellent little acting jobs as well. That said, we'll move on to the biggest reason many people did not give this movie a fair chance. Ashton. How can we take a guy who said, ""Dude, sweet!"" numerous times in a movie seriously? Quite easily. He put in an impressive acting job here. Not only was he convincing, but he proved he can hang in dramatic roles. Every big actor started somewhere. Jim Carrey wasn't always a blockbuster actor. He did some horrible 80s movies like ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" and went on to do a few silly movies. But he also did some very serious, drama-based roles, some of which have been pretty ballsy and creative. ""The Truman Show"", still one of my favorite Peter Weir movies, was an incredible piece of social commentary. And then there's ""Man On The Moon."" Johnny Depp has taken some odd roles in his career, and continues to do so. His unique choices for roles are what has shaped him as an actor. Every single big time actor has paid his dues. ""Dude Where's My Car"" and ""Just Married"" were stepping stones. They served as vehicles in order to allow Ashton to move on to something meatier. Or maybe it was just that too many people don't feel like going to a movie and having to think in order to understand it. Look at ""Fight Club"" and ""Memento."" Two very serious movies that required some very serious thought and attention to fully understand and appreciate, but both of which are tremendous pieces of cinema art. That said, if you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and possibly a bit thought-provoking, give ""Butterfly Effect"" a chance. It hardly disappoints."

The Butterfly Effect answers one of the other great questions in life, ""What if I could go back in time and fix that ONE thing that went wrong...?"" That question is the main idea of the film. The story successfully transforms that question into a ""tangible fantasy"" of sorts - you know deep down that it could never happen, but the setup really draws you in.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a few loopholes, the biggest one being that Evan Treborn's diary entries stay the same even though he changes the past (another reviewer noticed this). But, the delivery and intensity of the performances in this movie make you completely forget that. You really become involved in the world made in the movie, and Ashton Kutcher's performance is emotional enough to really make you CARE about Evan, his family, and his love. The Director's Cut ending of the movie truly captures the sadness and depth of depression Evan feels for what he's done, in essence, for existing. It's a heavy flick.

","I agree with the other user who commented that the critics missed the boat on this one. I read some of the external reviews from the links on this site. Most of the critics seem to have wanted to give the film a bad review because they dislike Ashton Kutcher, who played the lead character, Evan. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone was particularly vicious in his review. I rented the movie with some reservations because I had read about some of the disturbing scenes at the beginning. I came into it, however, with no preconceived prejudice against Ashton Kutcher. The premise of the film was interesting to me, so I decided to see it and I'm glad I did. Although the incidents that took place in Evan's childhood were very disturbing, there was actually no on screen violence. The movie held my attention from beginning to end. With each change he made to past events, it was interesting to see what impact that had on future events. As for Ashton Kutcher, he did an outstanding job in this film. He had quite a range of emotions and behaved differently in each scenario. He was completely convincing in every scene. I found it interesting that one critic said he couldn't handle a dramatic role the way comedian Bill Murray could. I like Bill Murray, but this role was certainly more challenging than Bill Murray's one note deadbeat performance in ""Lost in Translation"". Amy Smart was also excellent in her various incarnations, from socialite sorority girl, to downtrodden waitress to down and out crack whore. I strongly recommend this movie. It will make you think about how ""The Butterfly Effect"" could have influenced events in your own life."

","I've seen many films about time traveling, but never one like this with a original view on it. Evan Treborn is a boy who has memory loss in his youth. When big tings happen, he snaps out of reality and when he comes back, he doesn't know what happened. Because of these losses he keeps up a journal to remind himself what happened before or after the memory losses. While Evan grows older, he begins to read his journals. He travels through time and relives his memories. But that isn't everything. He can change in the past whatever he wants. He tries to make the future better for his friends by changing the past. But whatever he does, he makes things worse. I saw this movie in the cinema, and bought it on DVD. In my opinion is the director's cut the best version. The way how this version goes is more catching. The cinema version is for the ones who want a happy ending, and not a good story."

The makers said it wouldn't make the money they needed with the real ending. But let me say, the real ending is worth it. It's like, the entire movie is a burning fuse of one extremely disturbing image after another, and then the original ending says, ""Bam! We saved the most disturbing for last.""

It makes for some interesting twists, which the movie takes advantage of time and time again.<br/><br/>But with a premise as complicated as time travel, there are steps the writer must take to keep the plot holes at a minimum. Unfortunately, the writers of Butterfly Effect are so busy exploring different possibilities for their new ""toy,"" that the plot holes are left there in abundance. Even a casual viewer can not help but notice them, and if you're one of those people who discusses things you noticed after watching a movie, you'll find that you like the film much less in retrospect.<br/><br/>Plot holes aside, the film has a good pacing and an unmatched blend of tragedy, drama, and horror. Ashton Kutcher delivers an astonishing performance considering his history with comedies. Development of other characters is very uniquely executed, especially since a few characters have very different personalities when the main character alters history.<br/><br/>All in all, the Butterfly Effect is an entertaining film, even though its integrity leaves something to be desired."
"gvf","9","1","3","26 June 2005"," Michael Kelso shows us he's better than that!
","Every once in a while I pick up a movie from our neighborhood video store on my way home from work. So one night I really had no idea what I wanted to get and the girl at the store suggested ""The Butterfly Effect"". I looked at the cover and saw Ashton Kutcher's name on it. I said ""...well I never heard of that one before - so is it a comedy?"" - ""umm...no, uh.. not really, it's more like the Twilight Zone!"" she replied.<br/><br/>I took it home and wondered what the heck Ashton Kutcher was doing in a movie like that. I had spent countless hours laughing about his air-headed ""Kelso"" character on the 70s show, but seeing him do well in a more serious role, in a mystery movie even, wasn't really something I would have had on my list of things to hope for. Simply put, he absolutely kicks butt! Given his resume as an actor so far, it looks like he is a lot more versatile than meets the eye! <br/><br/>The movie itself gives you quite a few brain teasers to chew on. What if you found a way to switch back and forth between parallel universes? What if you had the chance to make whatever you did wrong in your past unhappen? However, what if things still wouldn't work out, and every time you threw yourself into another parallel universe, things would just become even more complicated and new problems would arise? This is pretty much the storyline of the movie. Ashton Kutcher plays a young college kid who has found a way to warp himself into many different parallel universes and even into the past; initially, in doing so he just tries to prevent the suicide death of his junior high crush. He then wakes up in an alternate universe and everything seems to be going great - he is a frat boy, and he is with her, now a sorority girl as opposed to being a greasy spoon waitress in the ""original"" universe. But things take a turn for the worse, and he has to switch universes again and again - and so it goes on, like he says in that one scene: ""Everytime I try to help someone everything just goes to s**t"".<br/><br/>This movie is really one of the greatest mystery movies I have seen in a long time, and since I'm a real mystery nut, it might tell you a little something. An interesting premise, wrapped into solid storytelling that still just every now and then keeps viewers guessing - and at the edge of their seats throughout, like any good mystery movie should. A painfully underrated gem of modern mainstream cinema, maybe because the audience and critics had the same doubts about Ashton Kutcher as I did.<br/><br/>Just a few days ago I bought the DVD, and I strongly recommend you do the same. The 2-DVD version features the Director's Cut on the second disc. Do yourself a favor and go for the Director's Cut. Aside from being 25 minutes shorter, the theatrical version has an ending that probably earned the producers a few more dollars at the box office, but then again it's too much like your average ""hollywood ending"" and therefore the movie's only true disappointment.<br/><br/>Guess what I'm going to do tonight, now that I've finished writing this comment - I've already put the Director's Cut disc in my DVD player :-)"

","Buttefly Effect explores the much-abused theme of time-travel in a novel, disturbing way. Ashton Kutcher, playing the character of Evan Treborn, discovers that he is able to find his repressed memories when he reads through his daily journals. Suffering from frequent black-outs in his childhood, much of his past has been a mystery to him. With an intense desire to find out what has happened to him, he seeks out his childhood friends. Seeing the horrible way their beautiful, happy lives have turned out, he now wants to go back in time, travel his memories and somehow, make it all better. And what results is a twisted thriller that will have you gnawing at your what-have-you's, wishing you would have seen ""The Happy Little Elf"" instead (refer ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"")!.<br/><br/>The movie takes us through so many different emotions, so many different moods - terror, disgust, anger, fear, and then some more terror. The movie is unabashedly bold, with references to child abuse, suicide, prostitution, and prison sex (ah, this one delights every single time). The situations in this film suddenly turn from something perfectly normal to perfectly bizarre - naked children being filmed in a basement, asthma attacks in the jungle and many more scenes that pop out of nowhere. Of course, the film-makers are kind enough to the less imaginative among us, as every unexplained bit is come back to, in later parts of the film, with striking brilliance. The flow of the movie is well-controlled, so there's no overwhelming the viewer. This is really commendable for a movie with so many things to offer. The special effects too, are tastefully done. There hasn't been any overly slick show of visual fireworks that is usually seen in science fiction films.<br/><br/>Performances by all characters are more than agreeable, but Ashton Kutcher, truly, is the Atlas of this film. He displays a side of him that I believe has not been explored before. He smoothly swings from boyishly cocky to picture-perfect romantic to raving maniac with ease. There is no respite for him, however, as he tries to do the impossible in a wild ride that his life becomes. He is faced with so many choices, so many twisted ways in which his life screws him over. Every time he tries to make things better for the people he loves, he makes the whole situation so much worse than before.<br/><br/>As I said before, this concept is not wildly original. Fans of Star Trek Next Generation might remember an episode, where Picard travels unknown worlds, lives years there and develops memories. What is more commendable for the film-makers is how this beaten concept is dealt with.

","THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br/><br/>A young man (Ashton Kutcher) is 'cursed' with an ability to travel back in time to a series of traumatic childhood incidents and change the course of history, but his thoughtless actions have far-reaching - and often painful - consequences...<br/><br/>Astonishing, complex film, distinguished by Kutcher's heartfelt performance as the haunted character whose attempts to rectify past transgressions meet with disaster at every turn. The emotional pay-off is quite profound (especially in the director's cut, much better than the theatrical edition), though viewers are advised that the material is often VERY heavy indeed - you have been warned! An unexpected masterpiece."

","OK, let's cut to the chase here...PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! If you are anything like me then you'll love it.<br/><br/>I rented this movie not expecting much (as it appears most people did) and found it a hugely fulfilling surprise that really blew me away as I didn't expect anything of the sort. I can't believe how it's been completely looked over by so-called movie experts (my guess is they said ""Oh Ashton Kutcher doing serious, must crap"" without even watching).<br/><br/>It has it's slow moments but overall is a very imaginative story that makes you really think the possibilities of the theme 'The Butterfly Effect'. I found it actually quite hard to sleep the night I first watched the movie (I've bought the Directors Cut now on DVD and have watched it about 4 times) because it left me thinking deeply about how different life could be if one event had gone differently.<br/><br/>Ashton proves that he is a very versatile actor who delivers a powerful performance you would expect from the dude who lost his car in 'Dude,Wherew's My Car?'. I like him anyway in his usual silly roles but he's soared in my estimation after seeing this. <br/><br/>I've not seen the cinema version but I gather it had a softer happier ending than the Directors Cut 'baby' ending. I would recommend seeing the Directors Cut as after seeing the other endings on the DVD, they don't match up to what is an amazing ending and one of the saddest you'll see in a movie.<br/><br/>So unless you're just a narrow-minded Ashton-hater or easily offended, GO AND RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE TODAY!!!!"

","'Have you seen the butterfly effect?' 'Thats the one with that idiot that does MTV PUNKD, no I cant stand that guy!'. Well thats the response I got from a lot of people, but any one put off this film by Mr Kutcher really should see it! I have no shame in admitting that I did also feel the same when I saw the trailers for this movie. Don't let it put you off as it truly is a fantastic film that'll have you thinking long after its finished and in my opinion that makes it a great movie! Ashton Kutcher plays the lead role to perfection with a great supporting cast including Amy Smart, its a moving story of sacrificial love which asks many questions throughout. I'd advise any film or Kutcher fan who hasn't already seen this film to buy or rent the 'directors cut' DVD and you wont be sorry!"
"techman255","9","1","3","6 March 2005"," A great film...
","After seeing this movie for the first time, I believe it to be an excellent film and highly recommend it for those who have not seen it. Strangely, critics and IMDb users have not given this movie a fair review and ""turned a cold shoulder,"" as one user put it, toward this film.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" has a solid plot containing many themes about life and human emotions. In the movie, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) grows up with what the script suggests is some sort of psychological sickness where he has blackouts and cannot remember what has happened. We find early on that Evan's father may suffer from the same illness, and Evan is encouraged to keep a journal of all of his everyday activities in hopes that this may trigger his memory. These blackouts usually occur during some significant life altering events, in which Evan can not remember what has taken place. Through this journal, Evan is able to relive the past and change the outcome of his and his friends' lives.<br/><br/>One of the key themes in this film is about change and sacrifice. Evan realizes that to change the lives of the others around him he must change himself, even if it means not being with his childhood girlfriend Kayleigh (Amy Smart), whom Kayleigh's brother Tommy (William Lee Scott) refuses to accept as Evan's girlfriend. Evan goes into the past through his journal to try and alter Tommy's sadistic behavior, while making sure that Kayleigh and Lenny also grow up as normal people. In the end, Evan sacrifices the love he has for Kayleigh in order for her family and Lenny to have a better life.<br/><br/>This film is about more than just the love story between Kayleigh and Evan, as Evan's endeavors change not only the people around him, but his future and his lifestyle. Each time Evan goes back into the past his life changes based on what occurred each time he tried to correct the past. Each ""correction"" he makes has a profound impact on not only his future, but the future of those around him, thus the tagline ""Change one thing, change everything."" Overall I think this is an outstanding film and I enjoy how the writers worked in these ideas into the plot of the film."
"bunior","6","1","3","20 February 2005"," Dude, where's my memory?
","The trailer didn't look too exciting, most reviews I read were unfavourable, and I had no real desire to see Ashton Kutcher ""doing serious"", so it was only after a few friends recommended it that I decided to watch 'The Butterfly Effect'. And to be honest it wasn't as bad as I had expected.<br/><br/>Kutcher's character, Evan, has been prone to blackouts since he was young, an ailment apparently inherited from his institutionalised father. The blackouts occur without warning and he invariably wakes up in the middle of some sort of crisis, or at least considerably worse off than when he went under, with absolutely no memory of what happened. Kutcher plays Evan when he's 20 years old, and the blackouts have returned. After the death of an old friend, he manages to remember what happened all those times he blacked out, which opens a whole new world of possibilities.<br/><br/>The first hour or so of the film is well constructed, leading the viewer through Evan's fragmented mind, touching on some delicate subjects, and intermittently shocking us to make sure we're still paying attention. However, when Evan begins recovering his lost memories, the plot takes quite a turn and the quality of the film suffers. The second half of the film lacks the cohesion and narrative flow of the first half, and any tension created slips away with the continuity out the back door, seemingly replaced by violence and an unnecessary overuse of the word 'f**kbag'.<br/><br/>There are some good ideas on display here, some handled well, some manhandled, and the slightly bizarre ending left an odd taste in my mouth, like soap and ice-cream. It can be enjoyable but whether you'll think it was worth it after two hours is open to debate."

","I decided to watch this movie when I saw at least 30 copies of it in the DVD stores shelves. And I don't regret choosing it at all!! I guess I liked it so much because the scenario was quite an original piece. The same two guys who wrote this scenario, obviously have done quite good work with the 'The final destination 2'. So, if you've already seen and liked final destination 1 and 2, don't miss this one. One more thing I should add about the scenario and story is that it does not contain any flaws (inconsistencies), which you come across in movies of these kind. I saw the film twice, and cannot find a reason to throw some mud on it. (Damn it!) Whatever.. Enough said. Just watch and see for yourself!"

","I'm writing this to tell everybody not to watch the theatrical version of this movie, but the director's cut. It's the ending in which both versions differ and only the finale of the director's cut makes perfect sense in artistic way and also for the meaning of the film. The other ending was apparently made to please a bigger or younger audience or maybe just the financier. It seems to be simply wrong. If you watch the director's cut on DVD you can expect an outstanding mystery thriller that has been truly underrated by the critics. It does have some weaknesses but the overall suspense and the drama of the story left me no time to think about the flaws for too long."

","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was glued to the television the whole time. I think the whole story was original. I was a little skeptical about Ashton Kutcher, but I really enjoyed his acting. Its kind of hard to take Ashton Kutcher seriously when her stars in such movies like Dude where is my Car. But lets not forget the great KEANU REEVES who was in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. Look at him now!! I do agree that he does have a long way to go. I can also say that I was happy to see him out of that stupid character that he plays on That 70's Show. The Eric Soltz character was incredible. Hes a fantastic actor. Loved him in Pulp Fiction. I thought the movie was great. I'm glad I finally saw it and I will recommend it to my friends."

A lot of twists in the movie so it always stays interesting to watch. Every second is a joy to watch. A movie were you never can let your attention go down. A very well done script, with a very good acting from Ashton Kutcher. Ashton Kutcher proves he not always have to play in comedies. It would be nice if we could chance some mistakes in our life but in this movie shows in a good way what can happen. The Title of the movie was a good choice. A butterfly can also fly to every place he want just like Ashton did in his different worlds. One To Watch!!!"
"adamstanecki","6","1","3","16 January 2005"," Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.
","Every once in a while a story involving time travel comes along that seems almost plausible. This is one of those stories. We follow the life of a disturbed child who suffers blackouts during times of high stress. The imagery utilised to portray these moments is sometimes haunting. Thankfully, the director has employed suggestion over explicit vision in these instances. As one would expect, the tone of this piece is dark and subtle yet it still jolts you about as you watch. The sharp editing indicating shifts in time is done brilliantly. <br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is reminiscent of Donnie Darko (though not quite as good). Nonetheless, I recommend grabbing in on DVD and turning down the lights. Ashton Kutcher does a fine job too. 6/10."
"Jay-Kavanaugh","8","1","3","16 January 2005"," Original and entertaining
","This is certainly an excellent film. It's strengths are originality and an intelligent script that really makes you think. It's quite a relief to be free from all the formulaic nonsense that Hollywood usually pumps out. The plot centres around a young man (Evan) who finds he can go back in time and change history but gets more than he bargains for. This sort of plot is a minefield but the film pulls it off pretty well. There are a few minor holes in the plot (well if he knew that then why didn't he...) but it didn't really detract from the story at all. The plot is also less than subtle at times, never completely over the top but some of the events could have been a bit less extreme.<br/><br/>The acting is fine. Some people here have commented on the casting but I didn't have any problems with it, in fact I thought the characters were generally pretty good.<br/><br/>So I guess I'd give this an 8/10. It loses one point for lack of subtlety and one for (possibly impossible to fill) plot holes."
"Dominique_de_r","8","1","3","16 January 2005"," Mindblowing
","My parents told me not to watch this film. For it was ""impossible"" to grasp. But I insisted on seeing it, and it was no mistake of mine. It isn't a very difficult movie if you just try to understand what Evan is going through. He had black-outs where important stuff happens. He doesn't remember it, although all the people around him do. And those events change their lives, and with their lives changes the life of Evan. Evan wants that the people around him are problem free. He doesn't want Kayleigh to die and he doesn't want Tommy in jail. Evan finds out later in life what happened in those black outs. He even finds out that he can change the past and with that the future. <br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is never boring. You'll be thinking the whole time how an event he changed could change his future. A found myself thinking what he has to change. I really could understand what he wanted with his life and I tried to change it with him."

I actually own the DVD, I liked it that much. I had not commented on it, but after seeing for the tenth time, I decided I should. <br/><br/>OK, so Ashton Kutcher can really act. Anyone who says he can't must have had their eyes closed during this film. I could care less about his personal life or Punk'd or anything like that. The truth is this movie is quite original and he did a fantastic job. The rest of the cast is great too. Although the movie is unrealistic, it's only a movie. The truth is that the story is interesting and the movie ends quite nicely with a twist. <br/><br/>I won't comment on the particulars for those who have seen this. I just had to comment to say that this is one of my favorite movies.

I ran right out and bought it when I got home and watched it again. It's just one of those movies where you can just watch it as many times and you want and never, ever, ever get sick of it. Those are the best movies because if you have a favorite, of course you'll buy it but what's the point if you won't watch it a million times!? I really didn't like Ashton before this movie but after seeing this I definitely have respect for him now and respect for his acting. I'd even consider him one of the best now.

"MidnightWarrior","8","1","3","24 December 2004"," Something different, Something good.
","Warning, may contain spoilers...<br/><br/>This film is a story about a young boy (Kutcher's character) who suffers from brief periods of mysterious blackouts during traumatic moments. His psychiatric doctor sources these periods of blackouts as hemorrhages on the brain due to stress and advises the young boy to keep diaries of his daily activities. When Evan grows up, upon reading his diaries, he is able to somehow revisit his periods of blackouts and change pieces of the past. Each time goes back, seeking to make things better, the end result is disaster - at least until he is able to change and rechange it again.<br/><br/>Evan's blackouts make us quickly relate to him because the story makes us become just as vulnerable and confused as he is. What's more, we are able to relate to him because when he makes changes in his past, those are changes that we (or anyone with a decent set of values) would make.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, editing and cinematography in the this film is outstanding! After seeing countless movies that all follow similar patterns in the range of narration, this film is a really nice change of pace. It is mostly psychological and takes a certain kind of mind to find appreciation in this film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, it's somewhere along the lines of Kevin Beacon's ""Stir of Echos"" and Steven Spielburg's ""Back to the Future"". The internal logic of the film is consistent and all the rules of time travel are strictly followed.<br/><br/>I watched this film on the DVD which comes in two different cuts: one side is the theatrical release and the other side is the director's cut. Because of the alternate endings, after watching the film, both endings have an entirely different feel to them. I first watched the director's cut and hated the ending; then I flipped the disc over and watched the ending of the theatrical cut. Wow, two completely different endings that will leave you either hating the film (director's cut ending) or seeing it as bittersweet (theatrical cut ending).<br/><br/>In short, it's a very good film, great acting and excellent production values! 8 stars out of 10, go see it!"

","I can skip past all of the problems with multiple black outs and attempts to ""fix"" things in his past, but this movie makes one major flaw...it's ending. It is not a flaw that a director or special effects supervisor made so much as a critical error in conceptual set up for this type of movie. In effect you are expecting a strange twist of fate and some tense situations in this movie. It's not Gone with the Wind and it isn't a comedy so the standards should reflect the type of movie it is.<br/><br/>Here is the worst part...the ending is so terribly depressing you can't stand to imagine you'd ever watch it more than once. I understand that by dying all is well with the rest of his friends and family but you don't actually value the relief he must be experiencing by murdering himself.<br/><br/>That being said the twists and turns in the movie are pretty good. The acting was better than expected, but the worst part was the changes in Ashton's character. His quick switch to be so wantonly violent when he becomes the ""frat boy"" is a little odd. When Lenny murders Tommy, it is unnecessary. Why not just realize that you talked Tommy out of killing the dog and not give Lenny the murder weapon. Again, faults aside, I think it was better than I expected and would recommend it as a rental for a tense evening of movie watching."

He tries to commit suicide and end the story when everybody is happy except himself. But he changes his mind when he sees his mum is sick and dying in hospital. Finally, he takes the right decision. He decides to scare away the person he most loves, his girlfriend. Thus, through self-sacrifice, all of them will achieve happiness. He has become selfless and then the journey ends.

","I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Time travel stories are often disappointing. This one's pretty good. Evan, the protagonist, discovers that he can alter the past by possessing his younger self at certain, key times during his childhood. His attempts to improve the lives of his friends backfire in unpredictable ways. The rules of time travel in this movie are refreshingly consistent: 1) Only Evan remembers the unaltered timelines; everyone else thinks he's delusional. 2) He is unable to remember the events of new timelines. 3) He has no childhood memories of the times when his older self is in control of his body. <br/><br/>There are a few times where the events of the movie seem a bit contrived but they are at least consistent with the internal logic of the story. The writer created a world in which certain rules apply and stuck to it. The rules are never broken in order to advance the plot."

","OK, I liked the movie--it was a good piece of science fiction. But I have a slight problem with the premise. The movie only shows how the various changes effect the lives of a small group of people. But, if such changes were possible, wouldn't Chaos Theory dictate that there could be some drastic changes to everyone and everything. Isn't that the whole idea of Chaos theory? The theory that one very small change (a butterfly flapping its wings) could make a huge impact (the typhoon half way around the world) in things seemingly unrelated.<br/><br/>What do you think?

Gimme a break.<br/><br/>About a week ago, curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up renting it. The thing is, I'm almost ashamed to say it, I liked the movie. Now, I say that with a couple of caveats. First off, Ashton is nobody's idea of a dramatic actor and he performs about as well as you'd expect. The second thing that's wrong with the movie is that there seems to be a lot of ""movie science"" going on. Ashton studies caterpillars so that he can write a paper on memory loss. What? But, having said that, there is one thing that stands out about this movie. It takes some really bizarre turns for a studio film. There are a lot of topics in here that are usually reserved for independent movies. Sexually abused children, dogs being burned alive, prison rape.<br/><br/>The movie takes some chances, and for that I give it 7 out of 10."
"mobilavenue","8","1","3","4 November 2004"," Surprisingly Deep and Powerful
","From the opening scene to the brilliantly powerful conclusion, The Butterfly Effect grips your heart and mind and takes you through an enthralling journey that will keep you guessing throughout the movie, and leave you bewildered at the end. The writers boldly explore the effects that childhood experiences have on a person, and how small changes in these experiences can cause a ripple effect to change that person's life. They also simulate the emotions of a man so lost that he doesn't even know himself, or his own past. But most importantly, they reveal how important sacrifice is in love and in life.<br/><br/>The film is a journey through the psychologically disordered mind of Evan Treborn and the lives of people close to him when he was young. Early on, a few specific traumatic experiences are revealed that shape the lives of Evan, his mother, and his childhood friends- except each incident has holes in it where Evan himself cannot remember what happened. After the prologue of Evan's childhood, a college aged Evan begins to find ways to try to regain the memory of these holes. In some ways he is successful, but as he tries to alter the past it just creates more problems in the present. As Evan unfolds the mystery of his own life, some pieces come together and others fall apart, but all of it grips the audience to what unfolds.<br/><br/>Although the acting is not exceptional on the whole and the story has a few minor plot holes, the film is easy to enjoy for the concept behind it and the power of the story. In the midst of Evan finding himself, a love so strong is revealed, and his passion for Kayleigh remains constant throughout the alternate realities created. We can truly learn about life and love from watching Evan's choices and how they create a ripple effect in his life.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a typical teenage comedy starring Ashton Kutcher, then look somewhere else. This film is for mature adults and deals with child abuse, prostitution, rape, psychological disorders, suicide, murder, and brief but strong unbridled violence. It is not a happy film that will make you feel good about yourself, but rather an experience that should really touch you in a deep way. I've heard a lot of negative things said about this film, but I strongly suggest that if you are interested you should check it out for yourself, because you may be quite pleasantly surprised. I know I was.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.34"

"paulnewman2001","7","1","3","21 September 2004"," Not what you'd expect ... and all the better for it
","This thoughtful, downbeat tale of time travel and temporal meddling gives Ashton Kutcher the chance to show there's more in his bag of tricks than the underwhelming Dude, Where's My Car? He plays Evan, a young man whose youth has been punctuated by alarming blackouts and whose life and those of his closest friends have been blighted by several key incidents in childhood. Taking refuge in his diaries, he finds he can project his mind back into his younger self at the very point of each blackout and so alter the course of events. The Butterfly Effect is a parable of chaos physics which suggests, through the example of a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the world causing hurricanes on the other, that tiny and seemingly trivial events can have huge and unforeseeable consequences. Sadly, Evan's evidently not much of a reader and each of his well-intentioned interventions shifts the path of his life into disturbing and dark new territory, spurring him to go ever-further back in the hope of rectifying the new wrongs he's introduced. Directors/writers Eric Bress and J Mackye Gruber explore a lot of the interesting possibilities and conundrums of time travel and merit respect for keeping the tone of their film sombre and adult  this is most definitely not a world in which a little Back To The Future tinkering can result in everything coming up roses  while eliciting first-rate performances from a committed cast, including Amy Smart and Eric Stoltz."

I'm really stunned by what you wrote in the last sentence. About wishing to go back in time, so you wouldn't have to watch the movie! You really don't know what you are talking about! You didn't get it at all, did you?! What a story! The man who wrote this has to be a genius! Maybe you have to watch the movie all over and then DO pay attention! Because it's just so true: ""If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, the ripple effect could cause a tempest on the other."" Maybe you didn't even saw this when the movie started! If you did watch it properly, you just MUST think it's great, or someone's dealing with an IQ-problem over here!<br/><br/>Please listen to my advise and watch it again! And after that, just change your review!<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to your e-mail!<br/><br/>Greetings from Holland! Bram Wieser!"

","Excellent idea. Who ever wrote/came up with the story line should keep doing it because he must be pretty good. This movie is as good in entertainment as they come. When watching it you felt as if the movie was always moving it wasn't just floating around one area for ten minutes then changing scenes for another ten minutes. Ashton Kutcher was outstanding and surprisingly mature in the role of Evan. Apart from the obvious thing about time travel I couldn't find many plot holes either. It all seemed pretty clear cut even if you did have to think about it for an hour afterwards. Not necesserially for Ashton Kutcher fans because this is nothing like his other roles, but it does show he has great versatility."

","The Butterfly Effect (2004) D: Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber. Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Melora Waters, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz, Lorena Gale. A young man who blacks out traumatic events in his life discovers a way to supernaturally alter his past, but eventually discovers that changing one minor detail completely screws things up. When he tries to change it, things get screwed up even more. A more adult-themed BACK TO THE FUTURE has some disturbing scenes (i.e. Stoltz's pedophile father character is reprehensible) and a good performance by Kutcher (who also executive-produced). Thankfully avoids the clichéd Hollywood shootouts, twist endings, and obligatory teen movie rock music soundtrack and concentrates instead on the story and performances, both of which far exceeded expectations. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, nudity, adult themes."

"yinyang2003","Null","1","3","18 April 2004"," interesting and accurate insight into effects of childhood trauma
","Having seen some other peoples reviews I feel it necessary to put a ""deeper"" viewpoint across..... It is sad that alot of the point of this film is lost on those looking for a state of the art typical thriller. This film is actually a very good depiction of the effects of childhood sexual abuse by fathers. It starts with Evan as a 7yr old boy who experiences what the movie calls ""blackouts"" for the sake of the general public understanding it. What these actually are are ""spinning out"" episodes where the mind shuts off an event that is too traumatic for a child to cope with. It is a classic defense mechanism with childrens brains to protect them. Evan is a classic because he blocks completely. Kayleigh (the daughter of the father abusing) becomes withdrawn and unable to feel anything. Tommy (the son of the father abusing) is shown to be watching but later on it comes out he was also being abused, becomes angry and violent with sadistic tendencies. All these effects are the young brain dealing with high trauma caused by an individual they trusted. The film then goes on to show the three in their roles and the effect it has on their friend (unabused) by his witnessing the horror of the ""angry"" effect in Tommy. When Evan is alot older the memories start to return to him (again classic as blocked memories resurface when the brain is ""adult"" and can therefore cope with it better). Having remembered the sexual abuse he goes to see Kayleigh to ask her if it really happened. She has blocked out this memory and is still withdrawn. When reminded of this she gets angry as all the feelings of worthlessness come flooding back and kills herself. Evan is distraught and goes back to the memory and alters it by telling the father before the abuse starts that he will kill him if he touches Kayleigh. Then Evan is in a ""new life"" and suddenly he is with a happy and loving unscarred Kayleigh. This is a true reflection of the difference between those abused and those not. She has the ability to feel. This film scenario goes on to depict an even more sadistic Tommy and it is discovered that by him changing the past and stopping her sexual abuse, that therefore Tommy was abused even more as he was the fathers only target. I could go on and on about the merits of the rest of this film but there is no space. I will sum it up to say the reactions in each different ""life"" were real-life reactions of those abused as children. Evan - Blackouts, repressed memories coming out, wishing to change the past, wishing to have said no Kayleigh - Withdrawn, Suicide, Prostitution&drugs Tommy - angry, violent, sadistic Lenny (the friend of theirs) - shock, mentally scarred, mental breakdown and therefore institutionalised due to trauma of witnessing Tommys sadism<br/><br/>Anyone who says this film is rubbish obviously lacks both depth and ability to psychologically analyse. This film is FAR from dull, in fact is the the most disturbingly accurate film I have ever seen and would suggest that if you have suffered any kind of trauma like this or fear you may have (even if it is just a feeling) then see this film with someone you trust as you may very well ""spin out"" due to the reality of this film and memories and feelings may return. A MUST WATCH FOR THE INTELLIGENT AND/OR ""BEEN THERE"" PEOPLE!"

","Basically, me and a couple mates had seen ads for The Butterfly Effect on T.V. Seeing as it was the usual, boring Australian weekend we thought it'd be a good idea to go see it. Being underage and all, we couldn't just waltz up and ask for 4 tickets to The Butterfly Effect. I can't believe I had to sit through 20 minutes of Mona Lisa Smile, waiting for a good time to sneakety-sneak my way to The Butterfly Effect. Anyway.<br/><br/>When I got into the theatre, we were about 20 minutes into the movie, so I missed out on what exactly The Butterfly Effect was and how Ashton Kutcher got it. About 10 minutes after arriving, we were confronted by quite a disturbing scene (not mention in case for spoilers) which made me squirm. Apart from that, I was really enjoying the movie. The movie had it's fair share of twists and tear jerkers, which I felt were delivered perfectly. I severely doubted Ashton Kutcher's serious acting skills but this movie proved me wrong. Overall, even though I was still pretty confused, I thought The Butterfly Effect was a good movie, which I will probably buy on DVD.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I've definitely seen a lot worse. There WAS at least a story that was coherent, Ashton Kutcher did a decent acting job, and the rest of cast was fine -- really this was not THAT bad.  I thought ""Time Machine"" was a lot WORSE... so was the recent Heath Ledger movie where he played a priest? Those 2 movies were dreadful. ""Butterfly"" was definitely better.

","This movie would be the result.  *Warning: one or two spoilers ahead.* The theme of this movie is atonement.  And, in the role of Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher more than atones for mega-flops like ""Dude, Where's My Car?""! The time-travel effects are pretty impressive, as are the memory catch-up sequences.   There's one slight blooper, however.  When Evan ""remembers"" Tommy's headstone, there is a brief shot of the deathdate.  IT READS 1980! Yet, that portion of the film is supposed to take place a few days after the kids sneak in to a theater to watch ""Seven"" (starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt).  AND, THAT WAS RELEASED TO THEATERS IN 1995!   I may have been wrong about the date of the Meiji Rebellion (""Last Samurai"" did get it right; go figure!).  But, I am not wrong about this.   That is why I only give this movie three-and-a-half stars, as opposed to a perfect five."
"clydestuff","9","1","3","30 January 2004"," Kutcher answers his critics with the very good Butterfly Effect
","If one had read any of the recent publicity surrounding The Butterfly Effect or Ashton Kutcher, that person, myself included, could hardly be blamed for expecting the worse.  In case you missed it here's a quick rundown: 1. Cameron Crowe decided not to go with Kutcher in Elizabethtown supposedly because of his lack of acting ability 2. The Butterfly Effect was supposedly laughed out of The Sundance Film Festival 3. For some unexplained reason Kutcher was left uncredited in Cheaper By The Dozen 4. The January release date meant the film was being dumped.<br/><br/> On a lazy wet winter day in Northern California, my companion and I decided to brave all and take in a movie.  With January pickings being what they are, we had narrowed our choice down to Mona Lisa Smile or The Butterfly Effect.  As it turned out, Mona Lisa had already packed her bags and left town so The Butterfly Effect won out by default. Neither of us had much hope. <br/><br/>About thirty minutes into The Butterfly Effect I looked at my companion, she looked back at me and it was the good old ""Hey, this is a good movie"" kind of look.  It's hard to say which of us was more surprised or more pleased.<br/><br/>In any film about time travel, there is always going to be plot holes. It kind of goes with the territory.  In some films these holes are so big you could fly a 747 through them. In others they are small enough that you see them, but are willing to forgive them because the film is good enough that you don't really care to do the nit picking necessary to dig them out. Butterfly effect falls into the latter category, with a good script and a story that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go of you.  You can thank J. Mackeye Gruber and Eric Bress for directing and writing a story that pretty much covers the bases.<br/><br/>Butterfly Effect deals with the time honored story about what would happen if one could change the past.  This concept has been covered in good films before such as what happened in It's A Wonderful Life if George Bailey had never been born or Marty McFly's adventures in Back To The Future. In the 1980 film The Final Countdown the writers had a chance to become a defining film in this genre but copped out in the last moments of the film.  The Butterfly Effect does not cop out.<br/><br/>A good portion of the early moments of the film, explain the horrid childhood and catastrophic events that befall Evan Treborn and his friends. Yet, we do not witness the entirety of these events, as Evan suffers from blackouts, and when he does, the scenes jump to where he awakens and we awaken with him.  The idea works to perfection.  It is not until later, when Evan returns to the past to alter these events that the audience along with him has the gaps filled in.  As Evan tries to change the past, he finds that as awful as these events in his past may have been, the results of changing them can be worse.<br/><br/>I was about as far from being an Ashton Kutcher fan as one could be before seeing this film.  I had only seen snippets of That 70's show and wasn't impressed.  I had witnessed just enough of Punk'd to become annoyed with it. And although there were a very few good comedic moments in Just Married the film itself was less than run-of-the-mill.  In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher will have many taking another look at his acting ability.  In playing Evan Treborn, Kutcher had a difficult task that required great changes in his character when he returns from his journey to the past.  He hits all the right notes, never overplays the part, and seems to have lost his Punk'd persona completely.  It will cause many to give him another look.<br/><br/>Amy Smart as his girlfriend Kayleigh Miller is just as good if not better. Her role was the most difficult of all as it is Kayleigh who undergoes the most drastic changes as Evan wanders through time.  Kudos also to Eldon Henson and William Lee Scott.  I've never seen a film where so much change in character was required and the actors were able to make it all believable.  They deserve great praise.  Eric Stoltz as an alcoholic pedophile takes a difficult role also and gives it the kind of creepy smugness that will run shivers down your spine.  The child actors used to portray the young version of the characters are equally terrific. This is great praise indeed coming from myself, as I can be quite the curmudgeon when it comes to child actors.<br/><br/>After having viewed The Butterfly Effect, I went back and read some of the negative reviews, not only on IMDB but others as well.  What I found in many of these reviews, was that it seemed some critics did let preconceived notions influence them. Yet even in their negativity begrudgingly gave the film some respect.  In one review, a critic spent the first half of the review as if trying to find the bad, yet spent their last three paragraphs writing as if the film deserved praise.  In the other reviews, some critics spent several paragraphs trying to find pithy phrases to degrade the Ashton Kutcher persona giving little mention of the film itself.  Shame on them, but congratulations to those IMDB voters who saw through the nonsense and graded the film on it's rightful merits.<br/><br/>Driving home from the theater I thought about my own past. I wondered if I were to go back and change certain events how it would affect not only me but those around me and those I have known.  When a film can make you do that, it's a big success in my book. <br/><br/><br/><br/>My Grade B+"

It is about Evan Traiborne (Ashton Kutcher- That 70's Show, Dude Where's My Car, Just Married), a man with a troubled childhood full of 'blackouts', caused by genetics inherited by his insane father. He grew up with a girl named Kayleigh, her brother Tommy, and a kid named Lenny (Kevin Schmidt- Cheaper By The Dozen). Tommy was a terrible kid who tormented Evan and consantly beat him up. Evan was told by his doctor that he should write in journals, everything that happens to him daily, so he can remember things. <br/><br/>Later on in life, he finds he can go back in time and change things by reading his journals. Curious about a certain incident where he blacked out, he confronts  Kayleigh (Amy Smart- Road Trip, Varsity Blues), who was involved in it, with questions for her. But she ends up getting very upset and she kills herself later on that night. Then, Evan goes back to save her through his journals, changing his past, thus changing his present.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher does suprisingly good with a serious role, after seeing his in Dude, Where's My Car and Just Married, he seems to be good with comedy, but he is good. Amy Smart is also very good as Kayleigh.

Those guys know their jobs... but for sure, I will never want to see it again. What is the point of making a movie such like this one? Showing technical skills, excellent acting or perfect make-up? or what else ? I wonder...<br/><br/>In my deep believes, to show such unprovoked violence is socially destructive. And the plot of this film seem to me just a pretext to apologize violence and technical skills. I know I belong not to the actual majority of people who like horror, if not gore and others... I like thrillers... but for me, it's just a killer... Much to tough for me, who does not like horror pictures... I just can assimilate Butterfly Effect to one of those.<br/><br/>Not my taste!<br/><br/>Strong Violence happens in real life, but any visual support like movies, television and video games using such ambiance and images, commons the phenomena and conducts gradually to destroy the social consciousness of people who are already in a bad state of mind, and/or on the merge of society. Especially, the ones who have no one to love them, care them and cherish them. And it means, in our big cities with ghettos, loneliness, and a lot of poverty, a lot of people... And even the one who are not supposed to belong to those sad categories unconsciously may not be so far away! I'll tell you later why I think so...<br/><br/>To show it repeatedly, on a day after day bases, could possibly end the fact that we, former monkeys, had once to come out from the bush, with a growing sense of sharing for a better living, surviving, start to walk, and now on go back to animal wild nature... which in fact doesn't commonly appear in wildlife. Almost no animal make killings just for pleasure.<br/><br/>Two month ago I was in an open-air swimming-pool with my kids, in Geneva. Which is rather a small city : about 185'000 inhabitants (440'000 in G. state)... and it is not known to have any ghettos... nor gangs... Still... about violence... suddenly a real fight started in no time between 4 or 5 youngsters, about 18-20 years old, 30m far from where we were lying on the grass. Really tough... started with heavy punches, then with many kicks in the body as soon as one was on the ground, as long as another kid literally exploded a glass bottle of beer on one who was sitting and had his back turned, all that within 40-60 seconds! Until guards came... and then police... ""Blood and everything for pleasure"" ! Shocking ! Like on a screen... The ""only"" difference as I explained to my wide open eyes kids (7 and 8 1/2) was the injured ones were ready for a few months recovery, and not like in the movie, the actors will go after the shooting for coffees and sandwiches! And these young men all look like any others : clean ! Apparently not on the merge of society...<br/><br/>That is one of the reason I do not like such movie like this one, and won't keep it!! As I point it out, with my general comment on violence, I am not sure they realized what they were doing (the boys in the swimming-pole). Certainly there had no excuse, but they might play video games and see films like BE. <br/><br/>I write this ""hot"" comment, just after seeing the film, to heal myself of the bad thoughts it brought me in.

Do yourself a favour if you're considering spending time, money or energy on this one. READ THE ""HATED IT"" reviews. They're the best thing about the movie - I laughed out loud at several of them but they are accurate. I didn't hate it, there is a bit of entertainment in there but it's not great.<br/><br/>Ignore the gushing reviews - this is not a good movie. There are worse flicks around I admit - but this one has a lot of undeserved hype.<br/><br/>Also it's simply not a thriller in any way.

There are no thrills, no real mystery (apart from the obvious one of how he keeps doing that which never gets answered and the directors don't seem to care about anyway).<br/><br/>So if you want to watch a nicely produced & filmed but badly written and acted ""inspirational drama"" (think Touched By An Angel rather than 12 Monkeys) you might enjoy this. Anyone looking for a serious quality movie about the nature of time, time travel, philosophical issues around messing with the past, mystery, suspense, thrills etc don't bother.

","The Butterfly Effect is the sort of story I love - a romp through alternate realities, seeing the effect that minor changes have on the course of events. Evan uses an ability to revisit the past in order to try to make right all the things which go horribly wrong, and this story holds your attention throughout: the film tells the story well.<br/><br/>I have two reservations. One concerns colour saturations which, at times, seemed to lend a garish air to the movie. I don't know if this was a deliberate production design decision, but I found it distracting. My second reservation concerns Ashton Kutcher who, to be frank, I found quite poor in the lead role. He never convinced me, which is a shame because the other cast members were all very good, especially Jesse James (shame on you, Mr and Mrs James!) who played Tommy at age 13 with a feral intensity which was quite unnerving.<br/><br/>Kudos for going with an ending which is not what one might hope for.

","The similarly-themed The Lathe Of Heaven was made into a very effective PBS film 25 years earlier with minimal effects and a far better story. That tale succeeded by letting us know, in the end, that the tale was the last moment death dream of a nuclear war victim. This film suffers because we never quite know whether this is all in Evan's head- a more rich film would have tried it, or a sci fi/fantasy- which should have been more adventurous. Not letting us know could have only worked were the script, acting, and visuals more intriguing- merely shaking the camera and having the journal's letters jumble just bores. Not to mention that, for a genius, Evan is a dolt. In one of the time trips he returns to light the blockbuster that killed a mother and child in one reality, but now waves it at the pedophilic Mr. Miller, and winds up killing his true love. And he does this as the adult Evan in control of his child's body! That geniuses do stupid stuff like this is a far bigger flaw in the script than any time travel continuity issues.<br/><br/>Still, the ending and last time jump eschew a Hollywood ending as Evan returns to the first time he met Kayleigh and scares her in to never being his friend. Years later- at 28- the 2 are successful New York professionals, pass each other on the street, look, but keep on walking. This ability to sidestep convention augurs potential for the duo, for not caving in to the expected and ending the film ala It's a Wonderful Life. Amy Smart has all the makings of future stardom, but Ashton Kutcher is probably doomed to a future in reality TV as a former TV star. If that's the future he faces he can always avenge his legacy and screw the rest of us by stepping on another insect- just for spite."

","This film was good, and i did enjoy it a lot. However, it is quite confusing, and you need patience to sit through strange parts of the film that you really don't understand, until you get to the end and you get everything! =] The acting is good, Ashton Kutcher manages to keep the lead role going well and keeps us feeling for his character. There are some cruel and upsetting parts to the film that disturbed me, such as the pervert filming the kids, and the dog being burned - that made me look away! I thought the ending was good, but quite sad, because the basic message was - if Evan had never been born, everyone would have been happy! Quite mean on poor Evan!

"Polaris_DiB","7","1","4","28 June 2006"," Pretty good, a bit extreme
","After being recommended this movie on three different Internet recommendation engines, being told to see it by a good friend, and having half a dozen other people mention it, I figured I had to get around to seeing it. This is generally not a good way to go about seeing a movie because either one's hopes are too high or one wants to dislike it just so that everyone can stop talking about it.<br/><br/>But I liked it. It's a pretty tight psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to to turn out in ""unexpected ways""... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. ""I'll make everything perfect!"" he decrees.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is an interesting actor. I think he's a lot like Keira Knightley: both of them CAN act, it's just that if the director doesn't tell them to they won't. However, this movie shows Kutcher's one-up to Knightley in that he actually did act in this one, and Knightley has yet to fully embrace a role (but I haven't seen all of her movies, so who knows on that part).<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the biggest thing that prevented me from giving this movie a higher score is the way the children are presented. I know that children can be damaged, and can do extreme and horrific things, but oftentimes I have a hard time accepting a movie where they find each other and end up the whole group of them hurting each other. It's hard to explain, but it's the same reason why I don't really accept a lot of the contemporary cop dramas... there seems a need in those to get some mentally damaged woman with a completely differently mentally damaged man, and then work out this intricate plot involving how their mental problems cause this huge crime but also hide it in layers of mental instability. Same thing here, I find it pretty difficult to accept four kids from three different families all with their completely separate lives coming together to create specific incident which one just happens to be able to twist around. More than making the story unbelievable, it's a matter of making it seem as if everybody out there is some insane psychopath ready to explode in the right situation... when actually psychopaths are generally kind of rare.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Some people might wonder how we could link the theory of the butterfly effect to the story of this movie? To be honest - I have no clue ! It appears to be the case that Mr. Gruber did simply (ab)use the theory from Edward N. Lorenz to market his stale plot and boost the sales.

","Title: The Butterfly Effect (2004) Director: Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Melora Walters, Jhon Patrick Amedori, Irene Gorovia Tagline: Change one thing, Change everything Review: I'm not an Ashton Kutcher fan, lord knows the guys made an obnoxious character out of himself in his TV show punked. Most of the time he plays idiots and immature kids, so that preconceived image of Ashton Kutcher was in my head as I was going to the theater with some friends of mine to check out The Butterfly Effect. I gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.<br/><br/>The story is about a young boy named Evan Treborn. The kid suffers from black outs. Basically every once in a while he'll pass out and not remember what he did or why he did it. Not only that but the boy goes through some pretty traumatic experiences as a child. Fastforward a couple of years and now Evan is in college and has come to be a semi-normal young man trying to make the best of the present and forget his shadowy past. That is until he finds he has 'a gift'. He can travel back in time and basically correct whatever unpleasant experiences that messed up his life. Or so he thinks.<br/><br/>Thats the basic premise of this flick, which amazed me with its well written screenplay and good performances. Kutcher delivered pretty well for his first ""serious roll"" like I said before I am used to seeing him do the ignoramus/doofus act in the past, so I was a little skeptical at first but the guy did alright. Amy Smart was great as Kayleigh Miller, Evans love interest. Through the different alternate universes she does a great job of portraying different personalities, in fact Ill go as far as to say that acting wise, she was the best thing in the whole flick.<br/><br/>Also the young actors who play the child counterparts to Evan and Keyleigh were great, they were not annoying or stupid in anyway. They in fact felt pretty real, and came off as likable normal kids.<br/><br/>It was cool to see Eric Stoltz doing a small role in the film, but come on! Whats up with him doing this crappy roles? Stoltz is a fine actor who deserves doing something bigger then what his been doing lately. I wish he'd wake up and do something that will make him shine again someday.<br/><br/>But by far the best part of this flick is the story. You know a movie will be intriguing if in the first twenty minutes a lot of things happen. That was the case here, during the first few minutes your like whoa, if these are the first twenty minutes....I wonder what the rest of the film will be like! And I'm happy to say that the movie does not disappoint after if gets going, it remains interesting all through out. Though I do have to admit that at one time the whole ""lets go back in time to fix things"" felt a little redundant, in a point you will feel like ""ok, I get it! Lets not do that again!"". But they I let that slip because I was so into the story and characters.<br/><br/>The effects though not the big attraction here (this ain't back to the future folks!) were very well achieved. For example, the visual fx that occur when Evan travels back in time are cool as hell, the mix of the vibrating visuals and sound effects were very effective.<br/><br/>Great flick, Kutcher wasn't the distracting annoyance that I was expecting (he was actually good) and it has a great cast and story. Check it out if you want to wonder what would happen if you could find a way to change your past! Great ride! <br/><br/>Rating: 4 out of 5."
"hanselmerchor","5","1","4","16 May 2005"," sillly impausible flick
","I saw this movie last night, and I don't know who over 14 years old is a fan of Aston Kutcher but this guy is one of the worst actors out there, I mean he is good enough for sitcom work, but sustaining a film that takes itself as seriously and unintendedly hilariously as The Butterfly Effect; negative kudos for whoever did the casting, unless that is, Kutcher produced the film as his own vehicle to serious acting, but not all is to blame the guy, the plot itself is ludicrous and the shifting realities go way extreme to the other extreme, this probably would have worked better as a parody of some Night Shyamalan film, but I guess those that worked at it are not clever enough for that. The film is entertaining enough, it never bores you to death, or pummels you with preachiness, but do not come to it expecting The Sixth Sense, like some blind critic once said."
"Luigi Di Pilla","5","1","4","20 February 2005"," (Too) many effects
","First I saw TBE high in the US Box Charts and then when it came out on DVD I remarked it in a store. I read the critics on IMDb before I bought it and thought this could work as the both FINAL DESTINATION. There were nonstop lot of twists and turns but perhaps too many effects. So I think even the so recommended Director's cut story could have been shorter. Yes, there are some nice points but I think it contents too many violence and should not be shown to children. I don't know why this one hasn't been presented in our theaters in Switzerland but this could be a reason what I mentioned before. The actors did a great job especially Ashton Kutcher that I saw for the first time surprised me very much. If you want to take an unusual ride don't miss this edge-of-your-seat-super natural thriller. My wife is not hot for TBE so the end rating is a solid 5/10."
"miken-3","9","1","4","24 January 2005"," I really liked it!
","I love these types of films. A movie of alternate realities where each small shift in the past causes a completely different present. Each time you watch in anticipation of the twist for the new reality.<br/><br/>Kutcher is a troubled youth who was molested along with a young girl, by the girl's father and later is bullied by the girl's brother. The girl ends up committing suicide and Kutcher's life is haunted by his past. Kutcher is told by his analyst to keep a diary of everything that happens. In his college years, Kutcher finds that when he re-reads his diary, he is suddenly transported back to the actual events depicted in the diary. Each time Kutcher tries to make some adjustment to that event, to try to make things turn out better. But like the story of the butterfly that caused a tidal wave to occur, each little ""adjustment"" for the good has a ripple effect on the future that causes not necessarily pleasant results.<br/><br/>I was riveted by this movie until the end. The DVD comes with an alternate ending. I suggest you watch the regular ending first (it is the better of the two) before view the director's cut."
"WalterFrith","Null","1","4","20 January 2005"," Interesting except for the length.
","This movie was very original for me in most respects. The multiple time travel trips worked for the most part except that the pacing was mishandled. After an hour, it just seemed so long and by the time it was over it felt like three hours instead of its running time of 113 minutes. Ashton Kutcher really surprised me with the range of emotions he displayed here as his life and the lives of others around him changed. A friend of mine commented that the film failed because as the changes in time were occurring, we didn't see the effects on the whole world like we did in the 'Back to the Future' films in the plot involving Biff becoming rich and corrupt. Instead, the intimacies of the characters were the focus of change here. Not a valid criticism for me as we have learned from many films in the past that those who make them have the power to control their scope, large or small."

","This is an interesting movie to say the least. It's not exactly a good movie but you have to give it major points for the intriguing premise. I had to see how the movie would end. I saw the Director's Cut. I do understand that the theatrical version has a slightly different ending. If only they had tweaked this movie a little bit more then it would have been an exceptional movie. However, I do recommend it to others.<br/><br/>SPOILERS I think the movie needed to give a better understanding of Evan's blackouts. We know his father had them but why did he have them. Is Evan the reason why his mother had two previous stillborn births. Could that have been other siblings who also killed themselves like he does in the Director's cut? This is a passable effort but it still leaves questions."
"sol1218","7","1","4","11 August 2004"," The Scream of the Butterfly
","****SPOILERS**** The movie ""Butterfly Effect"" starts off like a deep psychological drama and then slowly turns into and finally in the last half of the film becomes a Sci-Fi adventure about time travel. <br/><br/>Young Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher, has been suffering severe black-outs all his life, a condition that put his father Jason, Callum Keith, in a mental institution. Being examined at the hospital for his black-outs the doctor suggests that Evan keep a journal, which is central to the story, about what happened every day to him in order to jog back his memory. <br/><br/>As Edan grows up and leaves for college the black-outs stop and for once in his life Edan becomes normal like everyone else. Involved in a college project about memory retention Evan dusts off his journals that he hasn't read for years and when he does read them the black-outs of his childhood begin to be filled in. Excited over this discovery Edan goes to see a childhood friend Larry,Elden Henson, who he hasn't seen for years to confirm if his new memories of the past are true or just imagined. To Edan's surprise from what he gets from Larry his visions are true but Larry unlike Edan wants to forgets about them. Edan's bringing them up depresses Larry so much that his mother tells Edan never to see or call Larry again. <br/><br/>Edan then goes back to the town where he lived as a little boy to see Kayley, Amy Smart,who is at first glad to see him but when Edan brings up the story about her and himself being forced to have sex and being taped by her sick and pedophile father George,Eric Stoltz, she becomes very upset. It may be new to Evan but Kayley had been trying to put that terrible event out of her mind for years and didn't want it brought up again. Still Edan is so obsessed about what Kayley's father did to her and himself that he doesn't notice or realize how it's hurting Kayley and later he finds out from her outraged brother Tommy, Willie Lee Scott, that Kayley killed herself. <br/><br/>After that movie turns from a drama about remembering past events to going back in time to change them. It's never fully explained, all Edan does is just look dates in his journal, just how but Edan somehow manages to go back in time and try to change events, that happened to him and his friends, for the better but instead they only become worse. <br/><br/>Edan goes back in time four times and in all those times that he changes the past the future is even bleaker that it was without the changes. Edan ends up killing Tommy and then put in jail where he's beaten and brutalized. He's responsible for having Larry kill Tommy which has Larry put away in a mental ward for the rest of his life and Keyley becomes a hooker and drug addict from the shock of seeing her brother Tommy killed as a young girl. <br/><br/>Edan loses both his arms in an explosion that leads his mother Andrea, Melona Waiters, who never touched tobacco, starts to chain-smoke and eventually dies of lung cancer at an early age. And on his last trip back in time Edan accidentally kills Kayley, by trying to stop her father from molesting her, when he's seven years-old and spends the rest of his life in a mental hospital.<br/><br/>Even though Edan's father has the same illness as Edan has we never see him go back in time. The end of the movie is a bit of a letdown with Edan putting Kayley out of his life forever when they both were seven years-old and thus not try to go back in time to correct the damage that her father, as well as himself by bringing it up, did to Kayley that led to her suicide. <br/><br/>As far as we know time travel may very well be possible in the future but the ability to change past events isn't. Changing the past for the better,if at all possible, is like a game of poker, you never know what hand you'll be dealt. If your able to change past events you can't know how those changes will effect the future and those effect can make the future far worse then it already is. Which is what Edan so sadly found out in the movie ""The Butterfly Effect""."
"Danny_G13","Null","1","4","28 June 2004"," Intriguing premise eventually let down
","It seems that the less we know, the better a movie sometimes is.<br/><br/>Butterfly Effect starts out *extremely* promisingly, with more than a hint of a psychological edge.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is Evan, a lad who's suffered mysterious blackouts for years, but into his late teens is impressed to have gone 7 years without a single one. They were always the same - he'd suddenly gain consciousness and find himself in a position he can't remember getting into. This made for a decidedly interesting plot, but unfortunately the more we see, the sillier it gets. When a date comes back to his college dorm and discovers the journals he used to write as a result of advice from his doctor (With respect to the blackouts), she asks him to read out loud what he wrote. However, amazingly while reading it he finds himself back in time during an incident which occurred in his youth. This sets up the rest of the movie as he realises his journals are a portal to his past, and to discovering what happened during his blackouts.<br/><br/>On paper this really does sound promising, but somehow it just doesn't work. Kutcher is hardly versatile as an actor, so he's not entirely convincing if tolerable enough, but the plot does him no favours. The concept of going back in time is unbelievable enough, but the idea that reading a notebook out loud achieves this journey is nothing short of ridiculous. Even now, I still can't fathom what on earth chaos theory (Which is what the title Butterfly Effect refers to) has to do with this. This is nothing more than a popcorn timetravel movie about changing destiny, yet the title refers to the concept of how one insignificant action on one side of the Atlantic (Like a butterfly flapping its wings) could cause a hurricane on the other side of the Atlantic. Totally unprovable of course, but also far removed from the 'chain reaction' plot of Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>Anyway, forgiving this discrepancy and back to criticising the story, because while there's no doubt it holds your attention throughout, it is just so silly. It loses its psychological grip once the main plot device kicks in and descends into implausible and convoluted sci-fi.<br/><br/>It is hard to sum up the film, such is its nature, but suffice to say it is let down by its own attempt at being original."
"Chris_Docker","7","1","4","14 April 2004"," Audacious blend and original storyline marred only slightly by clichéd trappings
","We see Evan Treborn  as he grows up, from an early age suffering short black-outs during key traumatic events. It is a strange (and potentially dangerous) psychological condition that his father (now in a mental asylum) also suffered from. Tension, and mystification, grows - as we are also kept in the dark as to what happened during these pivotal moments. Evan's father, on reaching adulthood, learnt how to go back in his mind and actually recall events that had been previously blocked off. But what if you could not only go back and remember them but change what you did in those few moments? Those changes might well affect all those around you <br/><br/>
This fairly original and difficult premise is one that threatens to cross the genres - from psychological thriller to sci-fi to supernatural. For most of the film, poor Evan doesn't know what is happening and neither does the audience, but the tension and plot ingenuity are enough to keep you on your seat and guessing until some pieces start fitting - or erupting - into place. One of the most original of any 'alternative timeline' stories to come to the screen, the film's vision of what it wants to achieve almost seems too much to expect it to fulfil - but the increasing shocks, not to mention the emotional investment the main character achieves (in spite of fairly humdrum acting and a so-so script), keep the audience willing to put up with most things as long as there is going to be some sort of denouement. Whether that conclusion will completely satisfy you is another matter.<br/><br/> Sci-fi fans will maybe accept it the way they accepted Donnie Darko. Psycho-Horror addicts that enjoyed Gothika may find this is a not dissimilar mix. Literary enthusiasts may even find it a lot more meaningful than, say, Sliding Doors, as it maybe has a lot to say about memories and how we deal with them. Changing one thing in our own reality has a ripple effect - a domino or 'butterfly' effect on everything else. We could take a moral from this and see how changing one thing inside us changes the rest of lives, especially how we perceive and shape the future and the lives of people we know and care about.<br/><br/>Whilst a provocative piece of filmmaking, The Butterfly Effect is no masterpiece: writer/directors Bress and Gruber have some way to go before they can turn in such an ambitious project and satisfy both mainstream audiences and the critics. There are many who will write this film off as a gimmicky, cliché-ridden example of supernatural nonsense that panders to the lowest denominator with violence, sudden shocks, animal and child abuse, mutilation, drugs and all the other fast-food ingredients so often demanded for a fun-filled evening at the cinema. Or you may, as I did, admire the sheer audacity of the story and give it some leeway. <br/><br/>***Spoilers*** The last two episodes of the film are the ones that, if any, give the film its more enduring relevance and meaning. They raise the question of what we do with memories, of how we 'close the door' on memories that haunt us - or face the ensuing psychological hell to which those memories can consign us. The film as a whole then also raises the question of responsibility for our actions."

He finds that he is shifting in time that coincides with these blackouts and also the past and future timeline for himself and the people around him changes.<br/><br/>This is actually a surprisingly clever time travel film and in my opinion deals with some hard time travel concepts where you enter a world of multiverses, split future events, chaos theory and whether you can successfully change traumatic events.<br/><br/>No wonder poor Evan is left confused.

But everyone just keeps telling me on and on about how great this movie is, so I figured why not give it a chance? I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how well this picture was made.<br/><br/>Ashton plays Evan, a guy who has had a pretty bad childhood, but always blacks out at key moments in his life, so a therapist suggests write down as much as he can remember about the incident in a journal. But when he grows up and over all has a decent life, he bumps into his old crush and she has turned out pretty bad, she ends up killing herself, but when Evan finds out that he can turn back time by reading his journal, he can change the past.

In that respect, writers-directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress succeed; as far as telling a compelling story goes, New Line Cinema has very definitely been punk'd, man!<br/><br/>The concept's a fascinating one, and in the right hands this could have been an intriguing movie, but instead it just becomes an endless parade of grimness, with our hero's lifelong blackouts leading to full-out misery for himself and all around him, which gets worse for close to two hours when he finds he can harness his repressed memories to go back in time and try and sort things out. The movie sacrifices the potential of the subject in lieu of lining up every possible downer from kiddie porn to out-and-out murder... when our hero finds himself in prison, guess who gets hit on by a pair of Aryan psychos?<br/><br/>In the midst of this tiresome spiral into Who Cares Land, there's a truly strong turn from a cast member more commonly found in silly comedies and usually considered as just a pretty face. And as well as Amy Smart proving she can do more than the likes of ""Road Trip"" and ""Rat Race,"" Ashton Kutcher's decent too. But their performances get lost in all the plot holes (through which he probably travels back in time, since there's no explanation offered in the movie) and in the endless misery... and ultimately there's really no point at all to it.

"huntersmithx","1","1","6","23 April 2019"," Retrospective Review- A disgusting, tasteless and pointless film.
","When watching Science-Fiction films about time travel, I can understand this can be a difficult topic to accomplish. Many have done this exceptionally well; such as the Back to the Future Trilogy, ""Source Code"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"", etc. Among the genre exists the divisive ""The Butterfly Effect""; the 2004 film which was panned by critics but has gained a fanbase since then. It's been hailed as ""mind-blowing"" or being an underrated gem. I respect the opinions of those who enjoy films I dislike, but with that being said- for my money this film fails miserably to be either ""mind-blowing"" or a masterpiece.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" is a disgusting, tasteless and pointless fim. This ""film"" (similar to other excremental movies like the 2007 remake of ""Halloween"") is an exercise in dehumanization pornography. It's not as interested in telling a compelling story as it is in degrading it's protagonist, Evan Treborn, and other innocent characters to being nothing more than punching bags for some monstrous caricatures among other horrible events. Even a smaller character like Evan's college roommate turns into an unsympathetic potty mouth in just one scene (for insulting Evan because he has gone through serious childhood trauma, I'll just leave it at that).<br/><br/>This childhood trauma and a central event motivate Evan to use his journals to time travel and repent the horrors of his past. He's a sympathetic character with a noble cause, right? Well, Evan himself can't resist joining in some contemptible acts. In one alternate reality, he and his star-crossed lover Kayleigh Miller are attacked by a deranged man from their past; but instead of subduing him and calling the police, Evan subdues then literally kills the man (*cue round of applause*). This sets up for more anguish he has to endure (some of which I can't bring myself to write about), and it goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>Even in his past, he encourages one of his friends to set dynamite in a mailbox, resulting in the death of a mother and her baby. I know he was supposed to be a troubled teenager, but I should believe that most rational teenagers and human beings would understand that said act could result in horrible consequences, injury and maybe death. The story circles back to this scene later to give a logical yet disgusting consequence. Otherwise, he's a good character who can be inconsistent (even then, he doesn't deserve any of the pain he's subjected to).<br/><br/>Yes, the world is a cruel place; but this is generally not a factor for why certain movies are considered great. Time travel causing world-altering consequences was not a new idea before this film either. Not that there's anything wrong with exploring these ideas, but they've been done better in other films.<br/><br/>The absurdity of the screenplay reigns supreme as it takes us on an eye gouging journey of style and oppression over substance. Other offenses include lazy writing, some aggressive editing, ugly cinematography, gratuitous nudity, among other things.<br/><br/>I can enjoy movies with dark and bleak themes, when done right, such as ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Minority Report"", etc; but ""The Butterfly Effect"" pales in comparison to those films due to everything it has to offer, in addition to being incredibly smug and heavy handed. Even decent performances from likable actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart aren't an excuse either.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are films that are more vulgar and contemptuous than this; but not many movies I've seen have appalled me as much as what I had to experience in the theatrical cut of this garbagefest, neither what I learned happens in the director's cut.<br/><br/>Closing note- One of the only moments of the movie that gives me mild amusement is Evan peacefully eating a cheeseburger in a bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grade- F"

","Ever see ""A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon""? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095736/ I'm glad you didn't see that movie. It used to be my ALL TIME worst movie until Butterfly Effect. Both movies have zero redeeming qualities, with constant disappointments. B.E. follows a time travel through psychosis plot line. What? When he's a kid he blacks-out during stressful events. When he's older and reading his journals about the events, he travels back, thus explaining the black- outs. He tries to make things better, and EVERY time he makes things worse. Attempting to save a friend from abuse, leads to him losing an arm. Another reading/psycho/time travel causes more damage until, ultimately, and this is the worst, leads to him never being born. He becomes a miscarriage. Could you come up with a worse story? Good stories overcome a problem. This movie just goes downhill, all the way to Hell. My version of Hell would be to watch this movie with my mother-in- law telling me how good it is, eternally. To end on a positive, Ashton Kutcher is a highly underrated actor and a wonderful human being."

","The Butterfly Effect, unfortunately marketed as most notable because of a turn from idiot comedy to strong dramatic performance by Ashton Kutcher, begins with a title explaining one of the tenets of Chaos Theory, specifically that a butterfly flapping its wings starts a chain reaction of events that can result in a hurricane on the other side of the planet.<br/><br/>
Interestingly, a theory which has almost nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>
This movie is not about a butterfly flapping its wings and causing a hurricane tens of thousands of miles away, it's about a butterfly that flaps its wings, deciding to fly intself toward a deadly spiderweb or toward a safe open field of sweet flowers, and the effects that that single decision has on that same butterfly's future life, not on the weather occurrences on the other side of the planet.<br/><br/>Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a kid who inherited a thinly described mental disorder from his father, who has lived most of Evan's life in a hospital for the criminally insane. The specifics of his disorder are not important, as the effects are explained by the movie. We meet Evan as a young boy, creating concerns among the school staff by drawing a picture of a knife-wielding person standing over a lot of bloody corpses when asked to draw a picture of what he wanted to be when he grew up. Grisly, yes, but the artistic ability in the drawing is stunning. It should have been more childishly drawn were it's artistic competence to garner not a single mention from the teachers so worried about it.<br/><br/>In order to work toward a solution to the problem, the school psychologist suggests having Evan begin to keep a journal, sort of as a way to map out his thoughts and see if they might be able to find out what happens in the periods when Evan `loses the time,' as Aaron Stampler from Primal Fear described his similar experiences. These journals later in Evan's life provide him the opportunity to sort of mentally travel through time and change occurrences that happened in order to change the disastrous future.<br/><br/>
When I think about the change brought about by the small things that Evan goes back and changes, I'm reminded of a film released last year called Thirteen (which, at the time of this writing, I haven't seen). Parents may find themselves disturbed at how Thirteen presents how easily a perfect daughter can be turned horribly wrong by hanging out with the wrong people. Incidentally, this is where a thin version of the above-mentioned Chaos Theory comes into play in The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>The difference between a butterfly causing a hurricane by flapping its wings and the chains of events in this movie is that the butterfly flapping its wings falls victim to a fallacy of logical thinking called `post hoc, ergo prompter hoc' (`After this, therefore because of this'). Certainly an interesting theory, but one that can never be proven because no hurricane could ever be traced back to a single event that, had it never taken place, might have resulted in the absence of the hurricane. The Butterfly Effect's version is much simpler. The path of life has many forks, and different choices in life lead to different futures. <br/><br/>A Simpson's episode that dealt with this exact idea comes to mind. In an amusing alteration of a famous science fiction story, Homer manages to build a time machine out of something that only he could build a time machine from  a toaster. Back in the time of the dinosaurs, he accidentally squishes a bug, then travels back to the present to find the world totally transformed. Ned Flanders as the all-powerful diddly-dictator, his family extremely classy but without the existence of donuts (too much for Homer to bear, so he tragically travels back again to fix it before realizing that donuts fall from the sky like rain), they're back to normal but eat with their tongues like lizards, etc. Each time he travels back in time, he changes something and returns to the present to find things completely different. The difference in The Butterfly Effect is that the things that Evan changes affect only him and his friends, and apparently no one else.<br/><br/>
Evan has grown up to be a productive college student, studying psychology in hopes of learning something about his troubled past. I won't go into how odd it is that he reveals deeply disturbing things about himself as well as having been forced to perform in a child pornography video and yet nothing ever came of it (maybe no one ever read his journals, just like they never noticed his obvious artistic brilliance because they were too concerned over his extensive use of the red crayon?), because the important thing is that he is later able to read through these old journal entries as a sort of portal to travel back to the time at which they were written so that he can change events that had tragic affects on the lives of him and his friends.<br/><br/>
There are scenes in The Butterfly Effect that are genuinely scary, and the film itself has a thoroughly creepy feel throughout (not the least reason for which is a gigantic amount of hugely disturbing scenes involving the characters as children - many of which went beyond the extent necessary in order to get their point across). These are, incidentally, the reason that the film at many points becomes campy and callous, surely inspiring a good portion of the many negative reviews of the film. Little kids acting in ways that little kids are not supposed to act can be pretty funny, that's why South Park was such a huge hit, but I could certainly have done with significantly less profanity and violence from them (maybe a few less vicious death threats and one or two fewer 2X4's to the face would have been beneficial).<br/><br/>The logic behind the traveling back in time and the mechanisms of the switches from one reality to the next is never very clearly explained, although given the scope of the swinging from present to past and back and forth again, had it been shown it would really have been a rather trivial issue. The jumps back in time are interesting in that Evan is literally able to jump into his younger self, speaking and acting as an adult though still a young boy, quickly and efficiently changing specific events and thus instantly altering the future (although not eradicating from his own memory the alternate future that he just fixed, even though he fixed things so that they never even happened  thus enters the paradoxes always involved with time travel). There are also things that don't make sense on a logical level in the movie. Here's a question, for example - if Evan knew about what was going to happen when the lady walks over to her mailbox with her baby, why did he run up and stand right in front of it when he went back to prevent their deaths? You would think that he would have anticipated the blast, since he knew exactly when it was going to happen.<br/><br/>I liked The Butterfly Effect a lot more than I thought I would, I had heard a lot of bad things about it. It's strange in that it starts off with a very interesting premise, then starts to get a little rough and border at times on being campy, but ultimately comes around full circle and I found myself more impressed than I anticipated when I saw the story come around and explain why it started the way it did and what the beginning scene meant. It's one of those films that starts right in the middle (maybe because even the film doesn't understand Evan's mind), and then ultimately comes back to that point, gradually revealing the meaning of the film as a whole. Leave the kids and most of your desire to apply logic to the movies at home and it's thoroughly enjoyable."

","I'm going to be honest here. From what i heard of the film and it's reception, i walked in kinda expecting a pretty dumb bad film. Really the only positive endorsment i found for the film (not counting the ones in here) were Roger Ebert's 2 and a half stars out of 4 review, which is basically a 5 or 6 out of 10 here, and my sister who adores the film. It really does seem like it's one of those ""critics vs audience"" situations, where critics hate it, but audiences love it or at least enjoy it overall.<br/><br/>I personally find myself to be somewhere in the middle. i enjoyed it and had fun while watching it, but i do have some issues with the film. Mainly i felt a lot of plot points and scenes felt very chessy and kind of ridiculous. Like a melodrama for teens. For instance: a lot of the characters can feel very cartoonish, mainly Tommy, who appears to only have 2 extreme personalities of a horrible sociopath or a nice and very caring friend. Not that these kinds of behaviour are unexplained or come at of nowhere, but i thought he was very one note. And a lot of the characters also feel the same way. They either are their worst version of themselves or the best ones, and i would have loved if there was more variety. And also i really thought the ending was kind of weak, since while i do like the idea of Evan and Kayleigh never meeting eachother being the ultimate solution, the idea just came out of nowhere and felt like a cheap way to end it. Maybe if Evan would have reflected more on it, it would have worked better.<br/><br/>But i also understand that that's not what the film is trying to explore. It is mostly about exploring the idea of (duh) the butterfly effect, how simple changes can drastically change how your life and others progress. And the film is certainly very ambitious in it's intent, which is why i considered to be a fun and entertaining watch. It's definitely not a forgettable film, even if you dislike it. Both the direction and editing makes the film fast paced and exciting, even if i personally would rather have a more tamed and in depth look at the story. But it sure gives off the anxiety and chaos it's trying to achieve. And the script at the very least tries to connect all the film's plot points, even if it sometimes confusing.<br/><br/>Anyway. i'd be willing to watch it a second time so that i have a more thought out opinion."

","Every so often a movie comes along that shows the limitations of ""critics"" who are at the end of the day simply regular folk who watch a LOT of movies. They clearly didn't understand this one!<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect explores something that we'd all love to do if we had chance and that is to go back in time, with our current knowledge, and change the past in the hope of improving the present. But more importantly it explores the connection between experience and personality. Events shape us. A different past means a different person.<br/><br/>Many reviewers focus on the paedophile but this isn't a movie about the impact of sexual abuse on kids - that's just one example of action/consequence.<br/><br/>Successful people often attribute their life to their personality - ""if you were like me, you'd be rich/happy too"". Few ever contemplate what is more likely :that their positive, can-do attitude stems from earlier (lucky) successes. Take anyone, put them in a no-win situation and sooner or later they'll become miserable, stressed and either violent or suicidal.<br/><br/>The weak point in this movie is the scene where Kayleigh is killed by dynamite. I mean what was Evan thinking? Was it an attempt to kill George - if so pretty unlikely only he would die as the children were all in the same small space. That moment was too unbelievable for me.<br/><br/>Some have called the ending weak, perhaps because it isn't your typical Hollywood, everyone lives happily ever after moment - but that's half the point - in each alternate reality some people are happier, some are sadder - Evan finished by selflessly choosing one in which he was the only one to ""suffer"". The point is its about more than just Evan. Each of us interact with the world as we live - no matter what our intentions, some of those interactions are good for others and some bad. The only way to ""correct"" our bad interactions may be not to interact at all, but since that isn't possible in the real world, the important thing is to recognise that these consequences exist and to be sensitive to them.
Lenny hates Frat boys because they've always been mean to him. Frat boys hate Lenny because he's always weirdly scary. If in the reality we're Evan was a frat boy but remembered Lenny could be nice, he had the power to change things - maybe? Perhaps not - but he had the power not to make things worse.
Behind every sad, angry, strange person there's a story - YOU could be in their shoes if you'd had their life. Think before you judge. I could go on, but you will either get this or you won't."

"jrarichards","9","0","1","17 May 2019"," Solid sci-fi premise, but certainly at times a hammer to crack a nut
","Films about ""putting right"" the time stream are not exactly a rarity, so many may ask whether resort to a 2004 movie makes any sense.<br/><br/>My answer would be yes, but there are a couple of powerful provisos. On the plus side, this film from Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber takes the genre as far as it can reasonably be taken, as we get to see a great many alternative scenarios for the life of our hero Evan (that's a pretty effective Ashton Kutcher in the adult version, but also two other pretty good child actors) plus his mother and the people around him. So if you want to follow through these kinds of thought experiments in detail (for reasons best known to yourself!), you'll probably never get a better and fuller chance than with this movie...<br/><br/>And a few of those versions of the lives lived even have moments of humour or at least black comedy about them. But this is not the typical case, as most are pretty serious; and indeed this film has to go into deeply awful and dark stuff in order to present its key idea. For Evan has a motivation to rework his life because at at least 3 moments along the track things happened that were so bad that the effort and risk of the reworking are made to seem worthwhile. There is logic to that, but it makes for grim and uncomfortable watching indeed.<br/><br/>Surprising then that we have room for quite a strong romantic story, in which the lovely Kayleigh (that's Amy Smart in the adult version at least) has fortunes going up and down like a yo-yo depending on which line Evan has managed to tweak.<br/><br/>And if the main moral here (of solely academic relevance, naturally) is that each reworked timeline has its winners and losers and trying to make things better very often makes them worse, the subsidiary emotion is one familiar to most of us about the what-ifs of love and relationships, which primarily resolves itself into Byron's famously bleak quote: ""of all the words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these - it might have been"". Tennyson springs equally to mind, with the question ""Tis better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all"". As noted, these are suprisingly deep and compelling emotions for a film that also dwells upon child molestation, psychopathy, murder, cancer, father-son murder, betrayal and a great many other heavy topics.<br/><br/>But all for the sake of suggesting to us that the dye is not cast on anybody's life, with things always having a range of alternative directions to follow, rather than just one (even if the same points may be reached along several parallel paths).<br/><br/>So there we are - it seems very much like a hammer to crack a nut, given the vicarious (and quite genuinely tangble) horror and disgust we may experience here at times, even as we have the occasional smile, and certainly feel pangs of romantic longing.<br/><br/>Is it just exploitation, in the end?<br/><br/>I say no, as somehow for me this still makes for good storytelling and film-making, but surely a fine line has been trodden here...<br/><br/>Any film that features an Oasis track must have its merits, and here we have the telling words of ""Stop crying your heart out"" to mull on as the final credits roll. And when they do, I for one feel I've had a powerful and meaningful experience. Hence any slight doubts are erased by 98% at least (though not 100%)."

Lesson is to improve our present and future as much as possible every day, because we won't be able to go back to fix or improve things.

","Ashton Kutcher did surprisingly well in this movie. I've always seen him as a comedy symbol and was worried he'd make this psychological thriller funnier than intended, but he held back with his goofy side and showed true skill in this film. The child actors were also pretty excellent, except for seven-year-old Kayleigh. She wasn't as convincing as the others, but she did try and the credit was rightfully deserved.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED the fact that the reasons why seven-year-old Evan was having blackouts was because of his future self going back to those memories. I thought that was a brilliant way of explaining it, although it does leave me wondering how the journals actually came to be. It leaves me questioning if he was living in a loop the whole time or if he truly was traveling back in time. Because without the journals, would he have blackouts? And if so, would it be because of his future self going back in time? If that's the case, then how would his future self go back in time without the journals? In the beginning of the movie, he had his first black out without writing a journal. Did that blackout occur because of his future self time traveling? How so? It leaves me curious and whether or not this film intended for these questions to be asked, I love to debate about it.<br/><br/>I also thought the interaction he had with his father while going back in time was awesome and slightly heartbreaking. It explained so much and it was extremely well portrayed.<br/><br/>There were a few plot holes and slightly exaggerated scenes. Seven (or eight) year old Tommy was a little too aggressive in my opinion. I understand the reason being because of his father and his hate towards him, but there wasn't much character development for him other than the fact that, because he lived with his mother in the end, he became successful and a college graduate.<br/><br/>My favorite character was Lenny. Both the child actors and the oldest version of him were acted quite well to me. His storyline was what stood out to me the most, despite the fact that our attention was primarily on Evan and Kayleigh the entire time. I loved the fact that he was so emotionally distraught because of Tommy's lunatic ways. It frustrated me how none of the kids went to their parents about the troubles they been through, but I think that's the exact point of the film. Not many kids or teenagers go to their parents when something serious happens because of embarrassment or shame, or because they fear of getting hurt by the person they are snitching on. I think the film did a good job of showing how oblivious parents can be to their child's behavior at times.<br/><br/>Overall I think anyone and everyone should watch this movie. It's pretty great and very entertaining."

It is not sure if it is a sci-fi or psychological movie. It tries to be both, but misses both of them. It tries to be psychological as Evan tries to remember his traumatic memories, and it tries to be sci-fi as he can change his life as he goes back in time. Trying to hook sci-fi and psychology at the same item (memory of Evan) of the story makes the movie ambigious, and plot is already complex. Trying to follow both pathways in that complexity makes the audience fall out from the movie. I spent the entire movie trying to figure out what the movie is about, could not enjoy watching it.

The movie plays kind of like a dumbed down version of other smarter more sophisticated thrillers. I really do feel conflicted about the film. It has it's intriguing moments and it features good performances by the actors, especially Amy Smart. But on the other hand, there are times in the movie where you just roll your eyes because it's the usual teen/college aged crap you see in stereotypical youth targeted films. The college/sorority section of the film was the main part of the movie where I felt that way, the way the characters acted was dumb and almost laughable, and it was hard to buy, but then in other sections the material was solid and I bought the whole thing. That's why this film as a whole is a mixed bag, there's some pretty good things in it, but it never really reaches greatness, and it doesn't rise above character stereotypes that dumb down the movie.

So far this fantasy concept of alternate universe has mostly been dealt in the comedy genre with some exceptions like the movie Time Machine. When you are going for something serious, it should be a hard hitting subtlety than amateurish sensationalism. <br/><br/>Evan (Ashton Kutcher) occasionally blacks out at times from his childhood and a doctor suggests him to maintain a journal to keep track of them. When he is older, he finds a way to travel back in time to those blackout periods and those were the moments that have changed his life. <br/><br/>As I have already appreciated it's premise that has a decent potential, every single instance Evan goes and changes the past, the future turns out in the worst possible way or he manages to make it worse with his inexplicable actions.

","Released in 2004 and directed/written by Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a sci-fi/thriller/horror starring Ashton Kutcher as a young man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. In college he finds a way to remember these lost memories and, more significantly, alter bad events by supernaturally traveling to the past via focusing on the words in his old journals. Unfortunately, changing the past has unforeseen repercussions. Amy Smart plays his girlfriend and William Lee Scott her psycho (or maybe not) brother. Melora Walters appears as his mother while Elden Henson plays his pal, Lenny.<br/><br/>This is an ambitious movie that cogently shows how changing one element of the past has a ripple effect, both positive and negative. The constant change in timeline makes the story seem jumbled at first, but the movie finds its footing and everything ultimately makes sense. Kutcher is surprisingly good in the lead role while Amy is solid in support, and fetching. <br/><br/>Where the movie sometimes goes off the rails is the exaggerated behavior of some of the characters throughout. The way they act just doesn't ring true and it comes across goofy, like characters in a comedic slasher flick. It's as if the writers don't understand how real people act in the situations in question; even wackos don't behave as portrayed. As such, these sequences come off surreal at best. But, if you can handle this glaring flaw, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a worthwhile quasi-horror flick, although be forewarned that icky topics are breached (but thankfully only breached). <br/><br/>The film runs 113 minutes while the Director's Cut with the originally-intended ending runs 120 minutes. The consensus is that the theatrical version is superior to the bleak, cold and grotesque climax of the Director's Cut.

","I really would have given this movie 10/10 but for it's terrible execution I gave it 5/10.The Concept of this movie is really great and how well the story moves around it is also intriguing to watch. There's always a but and here is the poor performances and execution. See I want to say simply if this movie was any better it could have been hailed as a Classic. I was really interested to see what happens next and when it happened I was even more anxious but all those very poor performances and average direction , below average script , really bad characters and by bad i mean they didn't even seem like humans and so much terrible execution makes this really bad.I have used execution so many times because it could have been much greater.To even make it more worse they made few even worse sequels to this crappy faulted movie. One thing to watch this movie for , for its amazing thrill of its concept and the way it controls the story. One Reason to avoid this movie, for its elements of the story , script , characters and performances which butchers its concept very badly. Even though it has four endings the Director's Cut is the best among them as it sticks to the story very well. Now Final Word if you can watch mix-up of brilliant concept being butchered the it's for you.If you can't then please don't watch it , as you will waste your time."

","As I watched the Butterfly Effect, I wondered if the writers were influenced by an episode of Star Trek Voyager titled, ""Year of Hell"". The story premise was exactly the same; a man (Ashton Kutcher) is driven by the love of a woman to travel back in time to rectify a mistake but whatever he does results in a new future that is no less nightmarish than before. Overall, I found it to be an semi-interesting yarn but eye-rolling ridiculous as Kutcher keeps going back in time and coming up with idiotic fixes that naturally result in a worse future. His final solution to avoid ever having befriended the love of his life is predictable and flat but it had to end somehow."

","Wow! What a lot of crap I just saw, incredible! I have too say that the only brain damaged during this film was mine. It really impressed me the thousands of clichÃ©s that this movie has; it was one after the other one, and it never stopped. Do not get me wrong though, the plot and the whole idea of the butterfly effect is pretty cool, you just need to know how to express it; since it is a very complex idea. Many people say that these movie is underrated because of Ashton Kutcher's performance, but in my opinion, everything else is so bad (and I mean really bad), that I probably didn't pay much of attention to him, but for example, if the direction is bad, and if the actor is not really good, he or she obviously needs that support of the director;and since the direction of this movie its awful, and probably one of the worst I have ever seen, there for everything else is wrong, and awful, and bad, and list goes on (in this movie). There was even a part were I almost cried of how terrible it is."

","This movie really surprise me I have to say. I can't say that ashton kutcher is the actor that i really admire but this is his best work for sure. Mostly this piece is a time travel movie. It seem like a piece about fate but really the idea is to explore about how everything we do everyday will forever make the changes in our lives. The young cast are fine performers also. They take us on a journey that cuts constantly behind and then in front of time and shows the many ways how time works. The idea was also used for the movie Sliding Doors but this piece is so much darker and thrilling. Please do not be deterred by Ashton Kuthcher or thinking this movie is too Hollywood. The structure, yes, is quite challenging and for the first part maybe you are thinking too many fragments to keep interest but slowly the intrigue is building and the ending is sad and beautiful more like a European art house film."

"jslipinski","10","0","1","1 October 2015"," Review of The Butterfly Effect
","The Butterfly Effect is psychological thriller starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart and directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. It is an engaging film with well-constructed characters that you actually care about. <br/><br/>The film revolves around Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), a twenty year old college student who came from a troubled past and his quest to fix his life and the lives of his friends when he discovers that he can travel back in time by reading his childhood journals. Evan's past is filled with traumatic events that shape not only his own future but the futures of his friends as well, however Evan can't remember most of those events due to his frequent blackouts. He primarily tries to fix the life of his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart). Despite his best efforts whenever he solves a major problem in one of his friends lives it causes a problem for someone else.<br/><br/>An excellent plot device used in The Butterfly Effect is Evan's blackouts. By keeping important parts of the story hidden it gets the audience involved by making you guess what happened until those events are later revealed when Evan goes back to change them. When he travels back in time and is able to piece together the events of his past it shows how dark his childhood really was.<br/><br/>One criticism of this film that I have is that Evan changing the past only seems to affect his friends and himself, the rest of the world is seemingly unchanged. That is really the only bad thing that I can say about this movie. I think that the fact that I can only think of one thing wrong with the film further proves how excellent this movie is.<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is a powerful film that is designed to hit you on an emotional level, it does this very well. It has well constructed characters that you actually care about what happens to them. Should you see this movie, the answer to that is most definitely yes."

","The Butterfly Effect (2004): Dir: Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, Melora Walters, Eric Stoltz: Thriller about regret and fate and the idea that circumstances would not necessarily be better if we could change the past. Ashton Kutcher suffers memory blackouts and must keep a journal. A traumatic prank involving dynamite and a mailbox has a fatal effect on him and three friends. He spends time in an institution then the film juts ahead to his college days where the journals resurface and a desire for change leads to heavier consequences. Interesting setup becomes repetitious leading to a conclusion that doesn't work. Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber are backed by fine production. Kutcher tries to correct mistakes only to discover worse facts. Amy Smart plays a childhood friend sexually abused by her father. Elden Henson plays another friend just released from an institution. Regardless which method Kutcher takes, it concludes with bad payoff leaving him only to let go of the one thing he loved. Melora Walters plays Kutcher's mother but perhaps more of her would have been better. Eric Stoltz has an interesting brief role as someone who is involved in child pornography and is part of the trauma. The special effects are superb but ultimately this is a depressing film that stresses that we cannot change the past. Score: 8 / 10"

","The Butterfly Effect is a mind blowing movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. This movie did not get as good of a rating as it should have. This is an amazing movie that really shows you how everything you do really does change your whole life. It's dramatic, with characters that you will feel for and connect with. This movie made $17,065,227 on opening weekend in the USA. I feel like this movie should have done way better than that. It doesn't even spot in the top 200. The rating doesn't make sense to me since there are so many good things about this movie. The acting: perfect. The plot: amazing. The story: great. The drama/suspense: mind numbing. I think people don't appreciate this movie as much as they should because they didn't connect with the characters. The actors give off such emotion in every scene that it would be impossible not to feel for the character. The Butterfly Effect definitely deserves a higher rating."
"alombardy","7","0","2","25 August 2014"," And it might just be silly enough to work...
","I didn't like the first fifteen minutes or so of this movie. On paper, it reads like an aborted X-Files episode, and it did feel that way in the opening stages. But I remained patient, and was rewarded - it's not an amazing movie, but it's enjoyable and entertaining enough. It's undeniable that it papers over certain cracks in the plot, but, nonetheless, you're in such a state of suspending your disbelief anyway that it all just sort of rolls up into one mad, fun, mess - like, in fact, most good sci-fi. The performances are satisfactory and Ashton Kutcher is not completely intolerable as the lead; the youngster they got to play child Kutcher is particularly good at channeling his older self. At times, this film attempts to be a bit too clever for its own good, and the plot cohesion suffers as a result, and its tone is arguably a tad confused; switching between light-hearted and dark themes with little space or time for a proper transition. Nonetheless, overall it's a solid thriller that should keep you hooked, and, despite a bit of a soft ending, satisfied."

","I had a much better memory of this movie than what I thought of it when watching it again 10 years later.<br/><br/>The idea is great, but they should not refer to the chaos theory since it isn't really the chaos theory. In that case there should have been more affected by the change than just Evan and his close friends. There are also many plot holes which I don't want to mention because I would like to keep the review free from spoilers.<br/><br/>But there are also good things about this movie. Great acting. I like Ashton Kutcher as a comedian, but I also liked him now in his one dramatic role. The casting for the characters as young children was also done well. They did resemble their adult characters and for them most they acted well. Irene Gorovaia was an exception, but luckily she didn't continue with acting. I must say though that she is beautiful now. This is a real ugly duckling transformation.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed seeing how the changes affect the characters. What happened to them in their childhood sure did have an influence on their lives and the plot captured it very well. This is what makes the movie still good in my eyes.

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","2","16 September 2013"," An entertaining Swiss-cheese of a plot, not without savor ...
","""A flap of wings from a butterfly can provoke a hurricane thousand miles further"", ""The Butterfly Effect"", aka the 'chaos theory' or 'domino effect' is a darling for movie buffs regardless of its scientific accuracy, probably because nobody can deny its real-life application. Maybe the smallest event have the most dramatic repercussions and maybe the greatest accomplishments we've ever done, or worst mistakes we ever committed, are just conclusions to chains of event that started with a benign fact. That's life's charm: its total and out-of-control unpredictability (except if you are blessed or cursed with Evan's power to change the past).<br/><br/>The character of Evan (finely played by Ashton Kutcher) personifies our fascination with time-travel stories through the eternal wish to be given second chances. And no need to question whether life is a disordered assemblage of little hazards or that the same assemblage pave the same way toward a predefined future, if the film believed in destiny, every attempt to change the future from the past would have failed. They don't always succeed though and the film offers several scenarios affecting the lives of five characters. The series start with what happens 'normally' to them: a series of incidents occurring in their childhood and teenage years, each one more dramatic than the other. They seem to be reminiscence from Evan's own memory, which explains some 'blanks' at the end of each, but don't worry; each one will be filled throughout the film.<br/><br/>Still, what a nightmarish journey for little Evan, a boy who endures too many traumas for one life! His father is in an institution, he takes a knife in the kitchen in front of his mother (Melora Walthers), he draws murdered prisoners in school. Each visit he makes features a disturbing episode: in his friends Tommy and Kelly's house, their father (Eric Stolz) uses them a pedophile video, and later, his own father tries to kill him, and is incidentally killed. 6 years later, the worst happens again when Tommy, who became a hooligan, lures Lenny, the fat insecure one of the group, to hide a stick of dynamite in a mailbox, which leads to a macabre (and unknown) aftermath. You think you've seen the worst, until another disaster involves the four kids, Evan's dog in a bag, and a flamed torch, forcing Evan and his mother to move out from that evil neighborhood. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, nothing seems to have affected Evan's life after that, but that's only because he doesn't remember what happened, hence the memory blanks trick; they put us on Evan's wavelength. And all we have, as clues, are the effects the impacts on his friends, each one turning bad. But while reading one of his old journals, he realizes he can come back in the past. We can only thank the doctor who recommended little Evan to have a journal so he can cure his memory problems, the journals highlight Evan's power to go back to every single event he wrote about, and not only he's capable to live them again, but he can change them, hence, creating a new other reality, not without damaging his brain by inserting in the memory area a new stock of archive footage, causing some intense hemorrhage. The film works both as a psychological thriller and a time travel film and I must admit it had the most exciting premise. <br/><br/>If you love non-linear plot lines, the film is tailor-made for you. By interfering in each event, Evan finds himself as a member of a fraternity or with a Gothic roommate, or in the best case, dating Kelly. Kelly is a waitress, a successful schoolgirl or a prostitute, Tommy is either a thug or a very religious person, and the one who takes the cake is poor Lenny, either in a mental institution, traumatized for life in his room or dating Kelly while Evan has lost his arms. That part is the most tragicomic one, as much as we feel sorry for Evan, it's irresistible to see that even that fat loser had chances to date Kelly. That's the triumph on philosophical aspect, this idea that our lives are conditioned by little hazards that could turn us either into on losers or winners. Maybe in another life, Eddie Murphy would have been the President of the United States.<br/><br/>So, we gotta hand it to ""The Butterfly Effect"", to tackle its subject with mathematical precision and provide us so many surprises. Still, there are as many holes in the plot, as in a Gruyere. The most benign one relies on the basic premise: how come all the changes only affected Evan and his friends? Why do his journals contain the same events? Now, if we assume that a simple warning to the pedophile Dad changed the future, how come stabbing his hands to make scars appear didn't prevent him to return back in jail? Wouldn't that event totally affect his future as a child? Even if we assume not, how come the scars appeared immediately? Shouldn't have then been there from the beginning instead of instantly appearing (like the cigarette burns)? ""Back to the Future"" was criticized as well, because of its intellectually challenging question, so this is fair game.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is so fast-paced we don't have much time to figure these subtleties out. I blame the writers and directors for having collected too many material and created the same confusion out of a promising story, at the end, they didn't know what to do with it, it's just as if the film was victim of the same wideness of choices that made Evan's journey so nightmarish. And I guess this is why the writers had many alternative endings to the same story. Still, one happy ending was the best thing the film could have, seriously what were they thinking with that womb-suicide thing? Wasn't the film morbid enough to owe us a happy and satisfying ending?"

","*Possible Spoilers!* <br/><br/>In the movies, whenever it comes to the likes of time travel, it always seems to me that heading forward into the future is about 10 times more successful than going back into the past.<br/><br/>This, of course, makes a lot of sense since the future really isn't set yet. (Unless you believe in fate) So, it can, sort of, be tampered with or altered to some degree. But mucking around with the past and events that have already taken place is a lot like skating on extremely thin ice.<br/><br/>For the most part I found the Butterfly Effect to be way too disjointed in its format to be seriously considered really good entertainment. (What an editing nightmare this film must've been) <br/><br/>I do give the director a lot of credit for making a darn good attempt at trying to convince me that traveling into the past is, indeed, plausible.<br/><br/>But since the main character came from such a dysfunctional life to begin with there was absolutely no way in hell that he was ever going to remedy things no matter how many times he tinkered around with things."

","Today, while searching for a movie, I found ""The Butterfly Effect"" on TV. Having been recommended by my brother time ago, I decided to watch it. Well, to put it kindly, I found it a mess, a bleak mess. I don't want to analyze the plot(or plot holes),I have some questions instead. 1)Why every event in the past is a traumatic one? 2) Why the future events have to be so pessimistic? 3) Why the prison scene? 4) Who thought Ashton Kutcher could put a good dramatic effort?<br/><br/>The idea for the movie is great: ""some minor things we do in the past can alter our whole future"", but the problem is that the idea is developed in a murky way, and the addition of bleakness and grittiness does not make the plot any favors. It's like they tried to add some grim reality as a way to give the plot a sense of seriousness (which turns to be a bit laughable)<br/><br/>Another problem is the cast selection. Ashton Kutchner is not a drama actor. Amy Smart as a heroin addicted prostitute is not realistic. Ashton Kutchner's mom looked younger than Kutchner's character. The others are fine.<br/><br/>To sum up, this movie suffers a lot from its plot holes and leaves you wondering if it was for real or it was a good joke. If you want to watch a movie where a small thing in the past can alter the future, watch Kieslowski's ""Blind Chance"". If you want to watch a movie where the main character has scary flashbacks from the past, watch ""Jacob's Ladder"". And if you want a movie when the main character travels through time, well watch ""Back To The Future""."

","This is just one of those movies, a diamond in the ruff sort to speak.. A cult classic that gains in popularity years after its release in theaters.

I believe they are too old, too stuck in the past, or if not too old, too experienced - they forget what type of movies can really move a fan base. This was one of those movies.<br/><br/>It was a nail-biter indeed. The viewer most definitely grows a fondness for Ashton Kutcher's character(in my opinion) thru all his trials and tribulations going back and forth through time, changing the outcomes each time. This movie somewhat reminds of me of Donnie Darko or The Big Lebowski. Both of these movies didn't do to well in Theatres but upon DVD release and years after, they are talked about as much as movies like Titanic, Terminator, Gone with the Wind, etc.(No, I'm not comparing it to these movies, but only in the sense that its standing the test of time in popularity). These cult classics have created their own niche sort to speak and The Butterfly Effect is no different.<br/><br/>A great movie all around. Well acted, and one of the better attributes very tight writing and no loose ends. Surprisingly so too because the type of movie that it is, transforming time and space can be a difficult plot to tackle, but I thought it was well written.. That spells death for too many films, where things just don't make sense or feel forced and open ended. This movie doesn't.

","When I saw the billing for ""The Butterfly Effect"" the first thought that crossed my mind was ""Oh great, Ashton Kutcher is doing a Sci Fi/Thriller this is going to be a joke"". My first impression was totally off base. This film is, in my humble opinion, Ashton Kutcher's best performance and was complemented by a very dynamic performance by Amy Smart as Kayleigh Miller. Elden Henson had some strong moments as a disturbed Lenny Treborn and Ethan Suplee was off the wall as Thumper. But the acting was just the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Eric Bress and J.Mackey Gruber have created their best work to date in this movie. It was a surprisingly good psychological, Sci Fi thriller with an added dramatic element. Their slant on the ""highly treaded on"" time travel theme was unique and refreshing. I liked that they used a psychological means to transport a person consciousness back in time instead of the physical means of a time machine. That allowed them to focus on an individual's history instead of a ""universal"" timeline, which fueled the dramatic paradoxical realities of tampering with ones history.<br/><br/>I am sure that everyone has thought about changing an event in their past to correct a mistake or to prevent a tragedy. This movie masterfully brings the realities of that to the screen. Throw in some psychological twists, some twisted characters, and the dramatic consequences of a love interest lost in the tampering of ones history; you have ""The Butterfly Effect"".

You see, this is what the movie is telling you. There is no perfect life.<br/><br/>'Lets's evolve and let the chips fall where they may' is what Tyler Durden(Fight Club) would say. The butterfly effect tells me that life is not about a big gamble. Also, it is not about making all the right choices. The truth is in the middle. <br/><br/>It is about enjoying it and giving it your best. But it just depends on your own perspective. That perspective makes all the choices for you.

","The Butterfly Effect is an unusually good movie; it's exciting, emotional, unpredictable and it is definitely the saddest movie I've ever seen (and I saw the English Patient and Closer....).<br/><br/>The first time I heard about the story I knew I would love it. A young college student, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) who used to have blackouts during his childhood starts reading one of his old diaries. What a coincidence; he opens his diary at a half-blank page where he had a blackout and a flashback starts and he immediately finds himself in that lost memory. A few dramatic scenes later he discovers that throughout these flashbacks he can change the past. What he doesn't realize at first is if you change the past, you change everything with it. So he is basically given the power to shape his past the way he wants to and the films is about how he lives with this chance.<br/><br/>I liked the story because I was never quite able to what would happen next. There were so many turning points it held my attention throughout the entire movie. Furthermore, the screenwriters seemed to be able to create a story that contains both dramatic and exciting scenes. The whole story also had an anxious atmosphere. You could feel during the whole movie that something bad was going to happen, you just couldn't tell what was it going to be.<br/><br/>Fortunately this good screenplay is accompanied by the great performances the actors/actresses do. Ashton Kutcher really played his part well, he could show us all those mood swings and emotions. John Patrick Amedori (teenage Evan) also showed us what he can do. Maybe it's just because of the screenplay, but I think his scenes were the most touching of all.<br/><br/>As for the special effects the flashbacks were quite well-made, but that explosion (when Evan was a teenager) was truly ridiculous... I'm not saying that it ruined the whole movie, but they really should have tried to make a it a bit more realistic...<br/><br/>All in all, I think that The Butterfly Effect is a terrific film. It's typically the kind of movie that keeps you from sleeping at night by making you think..."

At the end of the day you have to ask why, because there seems to be zero chemistry between the two. <br/><br/>You end up wondering why he bothers obsessing over her as she has no discernible personality and is average in attractiveness. It also seems highly unlikely that a childhood friend would still be in his adult life ... move on already. <br/><br/>The changes he makes to the past seem so clumsy and badly- executed, they are counter-intuitive. <br/><br/>As I said, the premise may have made a good episode of 'The Twilight Zone', but as a film it is a stretch and certainly tested my patience.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Time travel movies are notoriously difficult to get right, and they tend to work best when the time travel elements are kept simple (think of movies like THE TERMINATOR and TIMECOP, in which the sci-fi stuff is just an excuse to get to the action). THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT jumps right into the deep end by tackling the subject matter head on, and it turns out to make a surprisingly successful job of it.<br/><br/>The story is uncomplicated, presenting events in a chronological order that keeps the viewer's attention. With films like this, there are invariably going to be a ton of plot holes if you think too much about it, but that's part of the charm. The plot features a guy who can travel back in time to various times of his life, and the ensuing chaos that arises when he tries to change things. Yep, it's all about that old standby, you can't change the past, although the protagonist in this film has a damn good try.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is slightly bland in the leading role, but in all fairness he does possess a kind of likability that makes it easy to watch him on screen, so I won't be too critical. In truth, he raises his game in comparison to some of the other non-starters appearing here (Amy Smart for one). The best actor of 'em all is Logan Lerman, who plays the 7-year-old version of Kutcher's character, and it's easy to see why Lerman's gone on to appear in plenty of other stuff since.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not a film that's going to blow you away or change the world, but it does make you sit back and think. I value originality a lot these days – especially from Hollywood – and it's just nice to see something a bit different for once even if there are missteps along the way (the bit where it veers wildly into comedy, for example). What is unsurprising is that two straight-to-video sequels followed, which goes to show that Hollywood greed is alive and well."

","No, I don't have much respect for the normally ineffective Ashton Kutcherbut wow. He was literally spot-on in The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>If you liked Frailty, Stir of Echoes, Se7en or Mr. Brooks, chances are, you'll like this (sorta) Time-Traveling tale of love lost, gained, destroyed, rebuilt and retribution.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. And it held one of the best secrets I've ever seen in a movie: an (Special Features) alternative ending that equally matches the theatrical finale. Both endings actually make perfect sense and are both a great conclusion/solution to the problem at hand. My recommendation is getting the DVD or Blu-Ray that contains both and watch both.<br/><br/>Aside from the climax, the movie itself was a fantastic and original take on the age-old Grays Sports Almanac (SEE: Back to the Future Part II) catch-22. It also seems like an elaborate set-up of what we know what's coming: a man traveling back/forth in time to ""correct"" problems to set the future right. (Also SEE: ""Year of Hell,"" the best Star Trek: Voyager episode.)<br/><br/>It's not a ""boring"" and ""long intro"" after all. After multiple viewings, which you should, you'll pay closer attention to details to the younger kids as they grow and suffer until the story shifts to ""the present"" and Evan (Kutcher) attempts to wrong the gaps of his memory loss during traumatic times in his childhood.<br/><br/>Evan has had some bad experiences as a child, and lucky or not, he's blacked out for most of these. Fortunately, he had one doctor that encouraged him to write a very detailed journal. Evan uses these later in life to somehow magically transport him back into the kid he was during the life-altering bad times.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the movie's title indicates – for those who know the ""legend"" of the light-winged beast – every step he takes ""back-in-time"" causes further complications in the future.<br/><br/>That's a really basic summary of the plot hereand I'm glad to report that. There's so much more here. Deep performances, namely by both Amy Smart and Elden Henson – in multiple-yet-similar roles (SEE: Groundhog Day.) Great cinematography and complex storytelling round out the film.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this feature. Though it's a bit on the long side, it's a real thinker, albeit a Hollywoodized film. And despite its dark subject, it's fun and really gets going about half-way through when our ""hero"" Evan realizes his power of time-manipulation."

","Having always being a fan of Time Travel and Science Fiction, I was always keen on seeing this film upon its initial release, seven years ago, now. But for one reason or another, this just didn't happen, leaving me to watch this on TV a couple of years later.<br/><br/>I was left disappointed. This was mainly because the film was very gritty, at times dower and not what I or many would have expected from a film in this genre. But with repeat viewings and finally watching this version, the Director's Cut, with a more downbeat and tragic conclusion, I realised that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Yes, this film does not tick the correct boxes for a film of this time, but that is because it is not playing it safe. It is doing what any great groundbreaking films should do and that is to find the truth of the story and tell it, show it and help the audience engage and feel it, in an uncompromising way.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS *** The film deals with troubled childhoods of four kids, two of whom grow up to become Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. (Not literally, of course!) Kutcher's lead, has the ability to travel back to his own past for brief moments by reading his childhood journals or in some cases, watching home movies or looking at photos.<br/><br/>His intention upon discovering this gift, is to repair some of the damage that these events have cause to the group, who have sustained several traumas and left them in various states of dis-functionality as adults. But, as the metaphor relating to Chaos Theory states, ""Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"" Philip Merilees: We witness several distinct changes in then present as a result of his tampering and this often results in more pain, in one way or another.<br/><br/>This is a gripping film, with a true sense of itself, philosophy and needs of the narrative to justify its own dower conclusions, and ultimately, Kutcher's final decisions.<br/><br/>The sound design, cinematography general direction are outstanding here, with power use of all the key elements to give us a naturalistic feel, not dis-similar from something that Steven Spielberg might produce.<br/><br/>The Theatrical Cut was good, but this version is superior, with a new and more appropriate ending more in keeping the with the general tone of the film, this should be a true Sci-Fi classic, in the same league as the likes of ""Planet Of The Apes"", ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" and in to a lesser extent, this being a more widely accepted addition, ""Donnie Darko"".<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","5 out of 5 stars. The Butterfly Effect is a powerful psychological thriller, which is also my personal favorite movie of all time. This story focuses on Evan, a character played by Ashton Kutcher. While I am not a big Ashton Kutcher fan, he was brilliant in this dramatic role. The first half hour takes place during Evan's childhood, where he experiences a series of disturbing events. During these times, Evan usually blacks out and does not recall what happened. Later in life when he is in college, those disturbing memories gradually are coming back to Evan, while he goes through a phase of trying to find himself through journals he wrote when he was younger. Evan soon realizes he can go back in time and he wants to do this to undo bad events that happened to other people. During this process, Even begins to understand that changing one event develops a ripple effect that can influence many changes both positive and negative. This is a deep and complex film, especially if you watch the director's cut. This movie will force yourself to question how much you are willing to sacrifice for those people you truly love. Another key issue within this film is how one brief moment in time can significantly impact the rest of someone's life. Most DVDs of The Butterfly Effect have both the theatrical and director's cut versions on the same disc. It is most worthwhile to watch the entire director's version, and then view the ending of the theatrical version (chapter 20)."
"sandover","Null","0","2","15 November 2010"," The Impossible, the Real
","The film starts on a gruesome tone: we see a bunch of closely related kids acting out childhood's free violence, seething with repressed feelings; add to that a deleted in the protagonist's mind - who plays out the film - but obviously pedophile scene, and those sickening more than mysterious black-outs the protagonist, Evan, suffers. A big part of the film's first hour has a numbing effect, the numbing effect I associate with suspense when mismanaged as a sub-species of dread. (This happens in a lot of films, and I think is a serious flaw when let's say it does not come in the Hammer self-conscious tradition, or in b-movies, you know, dread with some tongue-in-cheek humor mixed in).<br/><br/>Intriguingly enough the tone changes after Evan has his first breakthrough - to call it that - in visiting his past and altering the events his black-outs shrouded: now, instead of being a shy, bit nerd college student, is wearing the clothes of an a-male student, all testosterone, Greek alphabet community AND he also has the girl of his childhood and dreams. But the bad brother of hers we witnessed early on, and the responsible for many of the kids' troubles, re-enters the frame. And here things start to get interesting.<br/><br/>No matter what Evan does, the roller-coaster of memories, facts and rehabilitation of traumas he embarks on is always out of complete control: no matter what he does, there is always a little left-over that troubles things and arguably makes matters worse, and that little piece always sneaking out, always being a left-over, is nothing else but the Real, courtesy of lacanian psychoanalysis. It actually fits one of the possible definitions of that hard to grasp thing: the Real is the Impossible. It is crucial here to differentiate reality, what we call everyday reality, from the Real: the Real is that hard kernel Evan is about and is always left out from our everyday, symbolic reality, governed by rules, laws, language. And the film is a good vehicle to illustrate that.<br/><br/>It is also a good vehicle against the kind of rehabilitation books like ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" try to establish; some time back, its author, invited by Oprah Winfrey on her show, proposed the theory that no matter how traumatic an event can be, we can really go back and visit it and alter it! A participant agreed to be put to the test via hypnosis, and was relieved afterwards because she could finally go back and visit a traumatic scene with her father, change it, and forgive her father, and live happily ever after. So, to repeat the ridicule of this phenomenon by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek: if the primordial scene (that is the scene none of us could have witnessed, and yet the one that is the playground, to put it that way, of our fantasies, the scene of parental intercourse for our conception) is too traumatic, why, you can always alter it: you can have mother knitting, and father reading his newspaper...<br/><br/>So, to go back to the film: after the first dramatic change of events, by revisiting the past and changing all that, I think it shrewdly ridicules the standardization of American healthiness: if you can have mom knitting and father reading his newspaper instead of some dramatic event, why, then you can have the girl of your dreams, power over new weaklings, AND be an a-male. Not even ""Heathers"" have accomplished it so ferociously. And subtly.<br/><br/>From then on, the film spins into ever more pessimistic loops, and Evan finally has to confront his madness, the madness of always trying to alter events - by acting them out, finally. No wonder this tactic, if Evan - or we, for that matter - wants to clean the slate clean, has to start by sweeping clean all preconceptions of the love-object, of any kind of 'intimate' knowledge we have of the other.<br/><br/>No wonder also, when that happens, when he actually tells Kayleigh about all those alternate ""universes"" he has knowledge of and of ""her"" past, she is a beat-down love-object who has to reject him: telling her that he saved her from molestation in that other universe, but not from evil-doings in this one, is a male fantasy that appropriately disgusts her. There is always a distance from fantasy and guilt to where the other stands, and makes finally desire operative.<br/><br/>This is I think where the film fails. Apparently there are four versions for ending this film, the three alternate coming with the DVD. The director's cut ending is gruesome and stupid: baby Evan ""revisits"" its birth and strangles itself, as if the loop of guilt has to strangle itself in the end. The open ending is a slight variant of the end appearing in the theatrical version, that is Evan hesitates but follows her. But if there was an instance where the happy ending would be totally legitimate is this happy ending: he goes over and asks her out! Why didn't they choose this? It makes perfect sense. When I mentioned before her run-down ""version"" as an amorous object, there is something crucial that also happens the first time Evan visits Kayleigh as a young man: she may be in difficult situations, yet she asserts herself and her desire, while he does not, as if he was always entrapped in the vicious circle of sacrifice and redemption, so he cannot face her, because this would arguably endanger her. This is all very fine, tuned to the Immaculate Lady theme of the Trobadours, but our semi-hero Evan has still to know what love is: as it is he remains frail as a butterfly, without fully assuming the chaotic power of love."

","I didn't like it all too much. Maybe I read way too much into it though. What I took into consideration; wouldn't he know what happened after the blackouts? Or someone react to it? So I assumed they were just openings for the time travel, but apparently the time travel CAUSED the blackouts. So, no one's going to react to anything? Or did he time travel unknowingly and just stand there like a retard? I have no idea. Great, now my brain hurts. Also, although some say the ending was great, the icing on the cake, I didn't really enjoy it. All but one ending I hated. I liked the ""Happy, Saddy"" ending where they talk to each other. The original theatrical ending no one would do normally, the stalker ending left it feeling empty, and the ending with him killing himself as an unborn baby? If he killed himself, wouldn't he be dead? So then he couldn't kill himself... more headache. If you really don't make the mistake of reading too far into this, you'll enjoy it. If you do what I did and think too hard, you'll most likely give it a low rating. The rest of the movie was great, good acting, strong plot, and it made me think. Just too hard."

You have to watch the deleted scenes (if you liked the movie that is). It opens quite a few new view on things.

","The first time I watched this movie, I loved it. I watched it over and over, gave it a 10/10 whenever I could. But last night, I watched it more closely and I gotta change my score. I'd give it an 8/10 now. The story, I believe, is incredible. I think it's very original, it fits together very well, it's interesting for almost the whole movie. <br/><br/>My only problems are that towards the end, maybe the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, it lost my attention. I was kinda just waiting for something exciting to happen again, waiting for it to perk up. The entire rest of the movie was very interesting for me though, and I loved it. My other biggest problem is the acting. I feel like the only ones who did pretty good were the adult actors. The kids and the teenagers, however, were horrible. I'm sorry, but they just lost me. They really messed it up I think. The directors should have pulled more out of them. <br/><br/>Other than that, the plot is great, the music is excellent. The dialogue is good. The camera movements and the effects were very interesting and cool looking. I had a good time watching this movie. <br/><br/>I bought it and I watch it from time to time. I dunno if I would recommend it for purchase though. It scratches a certain kinda movie itch you may get occasionally, a sort of slightly better than mediocre craving. It's not mind-blowing, it won't change your life. It could make you think differently for a little while after you see it, but not much else. I think it's a pretty good movie. I like it."

","This film is Masterpiece-plain and simple.<br/><br/>The pacing is perfect. The acting Superb. The writing Phenomenal. This film has great style and cinematography, as well as an exceptional plot. The only reason I give the film a 9 is for the scene involving the Dog which I skipped- Thank god for DVD!<br/><br/>This film is a supernatural thriller in one sense- but in another, it is about real people and real problems. <br/><br/>It starts out with Evan- a young boy suffering from blackouts. Many crucial parts of his life are lost due to these blackouts- so he begins to keep a journal, per request by his doctor. Traumatizing childhood events eventually lead to his mother and him moving away to escape the life that they are living in suburban hell. As an adult- he finds his first love, Kayleigh. She is a struggling waitress. A conversation about the past leads to her suicide. As his life crumbles, he relives his fathers mistakes and finds that he can go back in the past through the journals he wrote, and relive the moments in his life he missed. He soon finds that he can change the past. He hopes that by changing things in his childhood that led to Kayleigh's suicide- he can save her in the present. But every small change he makes, changes the lives of everyone around him. The quote at the beginning of the film explains it perfectly ""Can something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing cause a typhoon halfway around the world??"" This is a film with many hidden meanings that cause a lot to think about after the credits role.<br/><br/>This is a dark film and deals with many controversial issues that could be disturbing to some. I do not want to go too far into detail, but just warning that it has some very real, dark, controversial issues presented.<br/><br/>This film shows that every moment counts and that every single thing that happened, happened for a reason. This is not a simple piece of entertainment, but a very meaningful work of art that I recommend to anyone who I think has the mindset to appreciate a sophisticated work of art like The Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>See the Directors Cut First as the ending is phenomenal. Then watch the ending of the Theatrical Version after. Both endings are great- but the Theatrical Ending does not have as much meaning and power packed in- but was added to give the film a mainstream appeal."

","Starring Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart and Elden Henson, this movie explores the idea that one small decision or action can change the course of not only your own life, but the lives of others. Evan (Kutcher), is breaking down mentally – just as his father did – and comes to realize he has the power to go 'back in time' and change events, and thus the lives of his family and friends. Each change leads to a different scenario, a different life experience, but none of them satisfy Evan since they are never perfect. He seems determined to ensure that everyone ends up happy, well-adjusted and sane, but with each shift it seems there is always one person in his life who ends up suffering. It is certainly an interesting premise, and the acting is quite good. Recommended."

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","3","12 April 2010"," Should have paid attention to Homer J.
","Time travel films are nothing new – movies have featured them since before they could talk – and it is difficult for any movie-maker to inject something fresh into the genre. In fact, every kid who's seen that Simpsons' episode where Homer keeps travelling back in time with ever-increasingly catastrophic repercussions knows that messing with time can alter the world's time-line to a devastating degree. Anyway, co-writers/directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber obviously saw that episode too and, deciding to link it to the chaos theory that is so fashionable these days, have managed to fashion a story that is every bit as flawed as it is entertaining.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is Evan Treborn, a hotshot university student with a fat goth room-mate and some serious childhood traumas that he has blocked from his memory. These include paedophilia at the hands of his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh's drunken kiddie-porn film-making dad, beatings from her brother, the murder of his dog, the accidental murder of a mother and baby and the unintentional incarceration of one of his friends in a mental home. Fact is, you can't blame him for wanting to forget, but a darker cause of Evan's childhood blackouts lay at the root of his problems. After unexpectedly travelling back in time while reading one of the childhood journals a psychiatrist encouraged him to write in hopes of recovering his memories, Evan discovers he has inherited a curse from his institutionalised father. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that another traumatic episode from Evan's childhood was his father's attempted murder of him. Anyway, after the suicide of his childhood sweetheart, Evan chooses to use his newly-found time-travelling skills to change events in the past in order to improve things in the present. Trouble is Evan never saw that Simpson's episode me and Eric and J. saw...<br/><br/>The problem with movies involving time travel is that even the most cursory thought given to their plot-line will uncover enough holes to make a very big fishing net. For example, there's a point in Terminator 2 where the death of a character should result in the Terminator himself never being invented. This is presumably overlooked or ignored by the makers. Personally, I think they willfully disregard such flaws in order to tell the story they want to tell, and the time-travel genre is the only one in which they are allowed to get away with it. Anyway, the trouble with The Butterfly Effect is that its writers never seem to even pause to consider the gaping holes they are leaving in their wake, so caught up are they in the fun they're having creating all these funky alternative futures for their hapless hero. And, man, do they have some futures mapped out for the poor guy: murderer, prison bitch, paraplegic, mental patient. You'd think after a couple of dips Evan would remove his toe from the water, but not our boy – he just dives in even further, causing ripples that create ever-worsening scenarios for him and his small group of friends (curiously, none of Evan's tinkering seems to affect the world in general – apart from his first attempt, which seems to lend a kind of 50s musical feel to contemporary university life). Evan blunders back and forth through time like a pinball, learning nothing as he goes to increasingly desperate lengths to put things right.<br/><br/>It has to be said that The Butterfly Effect is undeniably entertaining, I was reasonably absorbed in Evan's fate even as I reflected on the pedestrian script and acting. Amy Smart probably has the best role as the wretched Kayleigh, who travels the entire spectrum from university princess to scar-faced hooker courtesy of Evan, and she gives a decent account for herself. But, considering that she is the emotional focus of Evan's escapades, we are left curiously unconcerned by her ever-changing plight, as we are by the fates of Evan's friends and mother.<br/><br/>The version I saw was the UK DVD director's cut which, apparently, has a completely different ending to the cinema version. I can only speculate on how bad the cinema ending was, because the director's preferred ending is so stupendously ill-conceived that it completely overshadows any good work that might have gone before. It was so bad it had me swearing at the screen in disbelief.<br/><br/>(And unless you are really, really interested in finding out how amazing every single person who worked on the film was, give the directors' commentary the widest of berth.)"

","I'm ashamed to admit that when this movie came out I rejected it big time because it looked like ""the MTV movie of the year"". You know, I saw Ashton Kutcher on the trailer so I didn't expect something really good.<br/><br/>Bad mistake. Last night I watched it for the first time and I'm glad to say that it moved me on a different manner than some other movies. I mean, the movie deals with the opportunity of changing the past but with rather disgusting consequences. I mean, every single change in the universe has a consequence.<br/><br/>The main plot deals with the main character's (Evan) painful childhood and how some events changed it negatively. First of all, his childhood sweetheart has a miserable life, she was sexually abused by her father, her brother was a major bully and now she's a dumb miserable waitress.<br/><br/>Evan has the ability to read his old diary notes in order to evoke and live again the past but now with the opportunity to change it in order to modify a difficult situation. The problem is that he doesn't knows what horrible consequences it will bring like killing people, sickness, a disturbing social life, autism, being seriously injured, etc.<br/><br/>Every change in Evan's parallel universes deserves a tremendous special effect at some points, but to be honest, what's more thrilling about this movie is the chance to way it touches some serious issues about life in general. This is a movie that will make you feel powerful, sad, happy, but most important REFLEXIVE.<br/><br/>You can't just play God and pretend it never happened.<br/><br/>The success of the movie is also because it works as a supernatural thriller with elements of Horror such as gore. The tension surrounding many scenes is always present and in heavy shape. The violence level is high but it's extremely justified and makes the movie reach a higher level.<br/><br/>The Direction is also perfect because it's dark and sophisticated at the same time. The f/x were only a decent addition but not very necessary when the plot is that complex and interesting.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch specially by Ashton Kutcher who demonstrates he's a solid actor. Amy Smart is just plain hot and delivers a great performance as a girl who confronts different and difficult fates. Tommy as a kid is extremely creepy and mean! I'm glad I never met a boy like him.<br/><br/>Watch ""The Butterfly Effect"" and understand the Theory of Chaos. It's displayed in such an excellent manner."

","Ashton Kutcher isn't really an actor who appeals to me, so I wasn't really expecting a lot from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie - bizarre all the way through and sometimes bewildering, but still very good. Kutcher played the adult Evan Treborn, a troubled young man with a troubled background who has inherited from his father and grandfather some strange ability to move backward in time by focusing on memories recorded in his journal. Unfortunately, both his father and grandfather were considered insane, and people are beginning to suspect the same about Evan. Evan's goal in his time travel seems to be to save his friend Kayleigh (Amy Smart), whose life is devastated by her father's sexual abuse. Unfortunately, every time Evan goes back in time and makes a change that he thinks will help Kayleigh, things get worse, and eventually everything spirals totally out of control. As Evan keeps moving from one reality to another, you begin to lose track of reality yourself while you watch this and there is a point at which you start to think that none of this is real; that Evan really is simply insane.<br/><br/>Performances in this movie were pretty good - not outstanding, but good quality. There are a number of troubling and unsettling scenes in this (particularly the dog being set on fire - which thankfully we don't see through to the end) and it certainly isn't an easy movie to watch from an emotional point of view, but it is a compelling movie that never loses its hold. One criticism has to do with the title. ""The Butterfly effect"" was defined at the start of the movie as the theory that something as simple as the flapping of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world can cause a typhoon in another part of the world. I'm not sure about that, but the point of the theory is that simple things can cause big changes. OK - but it seemed to me that Evan wasn't going back in time to make minor changes. A minor change might be ""before I walked home along Elm Street, now I'll walk along Maple Street."" That's a minor change that could possibly have a big impact. But Evan went back in time to prevent Kayleigh from being molested, or to prevent a mother and baby from being killed. Surely these are not minor changes; they're substantive. The movie's end - the chance encounter between Evan and Kayleigh (who now doesn't know him) on the street - also was too cliché for me. Aside from those points, though, I truly enjoyed this movie. 8/10"

","This gripping and complex exploration of the chaos theory and time travel kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, gasping with delight with every twist and turn of the excitingly original plot.

Make no mistake, this film is aimed squarely at the intellectually subnormal, and evidently they provide an impressively sized target audience. With Ashton K they have the idiot's idiot in the lead role -however- the quality of his acting is not the issue, it's the preposterously stupid plot, criminal lack of character development and jaw grindingly terrible dialogue that kills this film. It's a shame really because there is the kernel of a clever cult classic film in there somewhere. With the premise behind the films title, the tension of trying to rediscover blacked out traumatic memories and the device of flashback time travel, a half decent writer, fair director or journeyman producer could have made this a quite entertaining film. This is not a quite entertaining film. Unless of course you are a barely sentient imbecile, in which case you may find it quite entertaining.

"MairegChernet","6","0","2","18 October 2008"," The Butterfly Effect, an average film, whose cons almost outweigh its pros
","***MILD SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The butterfly effect is a film directed by two men whose names don't sound familiar to the average movie goer such as myself. But that's beside the point, because talent doesn't always come with fame. And I don't even need to give an example for that. The world is filled with those kinds of people. Anyways, my point is these two directors are putting tremendous effort into writing and directing this movie and I give them credit for that. And now let me get to the actual film and its pros and cons.<br/><br/>The butterfly effect is far from being a bad movie. It has its fair share of thrills with a somehow enjoyable plot. But it fails to be a stable and centered film. One thing I couldn't stand in the film was its redundancy. The scenes were a replica of each other. Kutcher's character would go back in his thoughts and fix something and he would do that a million times in the movie. What I am saying is show me something new. Also show me something orderly. It was hard for me to tell where the climax is and if it already happened or if it's yet to happen. In other words it was hard for me to keep up with the film.<br/><br/>Another thing was the casting; I mean come on Ashton Kutcher I mean after such a comedy as Dude where's my car I didn't expect to see him in a psychological thriller. Not that I'm saying he was bad in the movie but I could see somebody else playing the role a whole lot better, (Edward Norton would have been my first choice if I was the casting director, or maybe Jake Gyllenhaal), anyone with the capability of setting a dark tone, but Ashton Kutcher is best fit for a comedy role. But whatever.<br/><br/>Although I say all these negative things, I did like the movie to some extent. One thing I did like was the fact that the film is filled with high tension and constant chills. Not knowing how Evan's life is going to turn out is the best feeling I had in the movie. And till the very end that's what I wanted to know. Is Evan going to fix the mistakes he made in life? Is Evan ever going to live a stable life? Or is Evan going to share his father's destiny? Those were the questions I asked while watching the film. The questions were partially answered but the film remains to be a watchable but not a wonderful one."

","When this movie came out I thought it sounded like something I would really enjoy, but after reading all the negative reviews I decided not to go see it. I finally decided to watch it recently when it was shown on TV - no commitment if I didn't like it. I think the critics were very unfair - it had me hooked from the very beginning! Sure, the acting is only mediocre, and there are probably plot holes a mile wide, but overall I think the film really delivered on the theme. The story itself was so interesting it was easy to overlook issues I had with individual performers. The beginning reality is not a particularly happy one, and it is so satisfying to see a character be able to go back and change things and see how the new reality plays out. You can share Evan's frustration that no matter how hard he tries to make things better, there always seems to be an unintended consequence. The way things play out is not always believable (can one event really have such a drastic change on someone's personality?) but I think it was necessary to exaggerate the details for the sake of the plot and it makes for entertaining viewing. The frustration is not total or despairing - there is always hope that next time he will get it right. I found the ending supremely satisfying and philosophical. Does perfection exist? Is self-sacrifice rewarded? Are some people better for never having met? Are some people doomed to misery no matter what they do? This movie will definitely leave you thinking! If you grew up reading Choose Your Own Adventure novels using all 10 fingers as bookmarks (so you could follow stories back and see the different ways they could play out) I guarantee you will enjoy this film!"

","The Butterfly Effect is a sci-fi thriller that centers around four childhood friends: Evan, Kayleigh (the girl he secretly loves), Tommy (her jealous, violent brother) and Lenny (an overly shy, slightly mentally unstable kid). The four kids encounter a series of traumatic, life determent/changing events together. Evan, the son of a mental patient, has blackouts chronically and he has suppressed all those traumatic events, until one day (fourteen years later) he reads one of his old journals. He discovers he can go back in time and tries to right the wrongs of the past but every time he tries to do so he ends up making it worse. Nothing goes as planned and the actions he undertakes in the past (how slight they may seem) have grave consequences in the present <br/><br/>Whilst being obviously plot-driven, the acting wasn't too shabby either. I can appreciate Ashton Kutcher's comedy roles but assessing his career at the moment, I think he desperately needs to get back into more serious roles. He's good, probably never will be Oscar-good, but still. Knowing Melora Walter's phenomenal tour-de-force in 'Magnolia', she's a tad under performing in TBE. There really can't be any complaining about the any of the 'flashback' casts either, especially teenage Evan left an impression. When youngest Evan started talking trash I admit to having trouble taking him seriously and repressed a laugh out loud. <br/><br/>Paired with this is the more than solid and mention-worthy soundtrack, a good mix between sounds (like the flutter of a butterfly's wings theme) and songs (like Oasis' Stop Crying Your Heart Out at the end) to create the appropriate atmosphere for the kind of cool, fast-moving thriller TBE is. The visual look: blue tones dominating, modern, accentuates the cool vibe even further. <br/><br/>Timetravel films form a tricky business. This amazing ability provides the protagonist unavoidably with tremendous power, which in turn can take all of the tension out of the story. In order for us to be biting our nails during a film, we have to think that there's no way out of the box, and so the screenwriters need to think out of the box. The concept of the 'butterfly effect', where all changes in the past directly and substantially affect not only your own but everyone's future is very useful. Not only does Evan have to battle his present obstacles, but also his past ones. The fact that you can't see the events the first time (because he blacks them out) also keeps you eagerly awaiting and guessing.<br/><br/>In 'The Butterfly Effect' we get dragged into a whirlpool of plot lines and characters ever changing with each 'trip', which provides potential for confusion. However, in order to counteract this the writers often verbalize plot points or thoughts: we see Evan talking to himself after he discovers his mother's lung cancer ""You started chain smoking after I blew myself up."" followed by ""If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never would've started smoking in the first place."" That kind of dialog rubs me the wrong way, we hear the wheels of the plot turning more often than we should...but on the other hand I realize it's a movie developed for a broad audience.<br/><br/>Some segments captured my interest less than others, the whole 'prison' storyline clearly being the weakest although I do see the motivation for putting it in the script. It's the only time (except for the beginning/ending) where he's literally cornered himself. The greatest parts involved a dramatic explosives incident, the outcome of which reverberated well into the future and it clearly held the key to 'making everything perfect again' ( JASON: You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother. EVAN Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.) A real surprise here when all of a sudden - just when you think you figured out how far the scriptwriters were willing to go drama-wise - we see Evan without arms. The movie becomes darker and darker, the greater his actions in the past the graver the consequences in the present/future, and the happy end thus came as a surprise to me. They had to stretch believability (home movies have the same effect as journals?) and undermine their own philosophical/moral lessons that have been laid out throughout the movie for it. The movie is quite dark and cynical (you can't play God!) and the ending is totally the opposite. Reading about the director's cut, it sounded more logical to me. Nevertheless, I'm fond of the original ending...because I didn't see it coming. <br/><br/>A fun, cool thriller I recommend to lots of people. 8/10"

","Despite box-office dominance during its opening weekend, The Butterfly Effect is better suited to guilty-pleasure viewing at home. When writer-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who penned Final Destination 2) aren't breaking their own haphazard rules of logic, they're filling this sordid thriller with enough unpleasantness to make eternal damnation seem like an attractive alternative. In a role-reversal from his That '70s Show persona, Ashton Kutcher plays a college-age psychology student who discovers, by re-reading his childhood journals, that he can revisit his past and alter traumatic events, hoping to improve their previously unfortunate outcomes. Instead, this foolhardy experiment in chaos theory (the titular ""butterfly effect,"" popularized by Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park) results in a variety of nightmarish permutations, each having dire consequences for him and/or his friends. This intriguing premise is explored with a few interesting twists and turns, but with subplots involving child pornography, animal cruelty, and profanely violent children, it's a stretch to call it entertainment."

I think that he's funny too, but I hardly expected Kelso from that 70's show to be a dramatic genius. How wrong I was. Kutcher's depiction of a deeply troubled and serious character was compelling and overall, well done. The rest of the acting was brilliant as well. I thought Amy Smart was great, considering that she was practically playing several completely different characters. The plot was fascinating, and quite literally kept me on the edge of my seat. It was interesting, original, and deep. There were about 10 minutes in the middle where it began to get a teeny bit slow, but the film quickly threw me into another plot twist. My favourite part, of course, was the ending, as it is with almost any movie. One thing I cannot stand is a weak ending, and this movie has one of the strongest endings I have ever seen. It left me with lots to think about, and for days, even weeks after first watching this movie, I was still turning it over in my head, still marveling at the beauty and power of the movie.

","This is, if not a masterpiece, then very short of it. I don't use that word lightly; few cinematic efforts deserve to be credited as such. This is deeply psychological, not to mention rather accurate and credible in that, and complex. I can only imagine how long it must have taken to write it. Many people talk about the quality of Ashton Kutcher's acting. I think it was fine... if that's the one thing keeping you from a viewing, I'd say to go ahead and give it a chance. No one really handed in a pitiful performance... the kids were surprisingly good... and most were marvelously cast. I won't detail the concept of this here. Without being aware of it, I've only watched the Director's Cut of this. Having heard specifics on the changes... I'm happy I did. It adds a lot of vital scenes, and after careful consideration, I actually prefer the ending of it over the ending of the Theatrical(which I've thus far only read a description of), even though I was at first left emotionally numb with its nihilism and cruelty. The plot is quite interesting and well-thought out. Yes, the writers did mess it up a little by trying to have their cake and eat it too, but if you can overlook that, this can be amazing. The pacing is just about spot-on, this never goes too slow or faster than it should. So much is said with so few words and hints. This, to a degree, allows the audience to connect the dots, and doesn't presume that we need hand-holding. The cinematography is great, though there are some shots and camera tricks that reveal the makers to be new at the helm. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining and engaging dark sci-fi movie, and one to be seen by anyone even remotely interested in/fascinated by said genre, provided you are sufficiently thick-skinned for it. There are also elements of fantasy herein. The commentary track is probably the best I've heard... the two are funny, informational, and awesome on it, and I suggest anyone who likes the feature itself, and aren't turned off by language, though it isn't the worst ever, to listen to it. I recommend this film to any fan of science fiction, and/or pictures that qualify as deep and thought-provoking. Just remember to only get the version I did if you're prepared to be kicked in the stomach, feelings-wise. The faint of heart should stick with the original release... or stay away entirely. 8/10"

I will not contain spoilers because there are already spoilers, and you can just see for yourself what it has. If you already have seen it then I don't need to cite specifically what happens. One was the logic behind everything. Some will say that the logic is actually a con of the movie and how the concept does not hold any water at all. Look, it's a movie. It's not real. Thats like saying Star Wars was a bad movie because traveling through space using laser beams and light sabers to fight each other is not logical. If you need a movie to be logically possible, then don't bother. The concept behind this desperate attempt to fix himself and others in the main character was brilliantly portrayed by Ashton Kutcher. The ending was also fascinating because although you may have already figured it out, I can still think of about 3 or 4 theories that would have fit. It really makes you think and understand the depth of it. The theme of the story and the moral message of the movie is just great. The way it is conveyed in the movie is not outlandishly hard to believe or connect either. The effects and everything used to make the movie made you feel like you were a part of it which is always great in a movie. The shame is that this was overlooked and could have been seen as the great movie it was. Only word of advice is go into it expecting some confusing and somewhat outlandish concepts, ideas, and logic. Also do not go into the movie expecting great things. If you set a bar too high for a movie then it will most likely not be that good... the only exception being if you were watching something like The Shawshank Redemption or something along the lines of masterpieces like that."

","The Butterfly Effect centers around the use of time travel to undo the ravages of a truly disastrous childhood. The protagonist suffers one of the worst childhoods known to film, the child of a mentally ill father, the victim of neighborly pedophile and an utterly vicious playmate. When he realizes that his cowardice and passivity in the face of evil has resulted in the death of one of his friends and the mental illness of another, he uses his inexplicable powers of time travel in a desperate effort to make it all right. In doing so he establishes himself as a realistic Harry Potter, a genuine if tragically flawed wizard in an epic battle against the overwhelming forces of evil that lurk in contemporary America. And yes, evil is not pretty, as many commenting upon this film have noticed. Let me end with the advice to anyone who didn't like the film to see the director's cut on DVD.

","This script had a lot of ambition to make something different: a sci-fi thriller with a new idea, dark atmosphere, AND something to say. However, that same script nearly killed itself by its own hands!<br/><br/>Firstly, that ""something"" that it wanted to say. Is it about how we mustn't fall in love, so our life will be so happy? Or we must travel through time to change it till we actually make it as good as possible?! The main disaster here is that the movie, till its last minutes, was assuring that every try to modify the fate was a contribution to realize fate's high will. But, at the end, they put ridiculously such a fabricated finale to confirm concepts which were utterly contradictory compared to all what was said from the very start. Hence, the message of the whole thing became something like ""If you cancel love from your life, it'll be fine""!<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing that this end told us was that any try to repeat the past would never be in the interest of its doer, as your objection to your own fate would make you lose. Though, originally, the movie's premise was based on how God has complicated plans, therefore when (Kutcher) was traveling in time, he was just achieving that mysterious omnipotent plan. So why did that script continue the playing, to end up with stopping the drama at another failure round, in despite of (Kutcher)'s discovering for the truth about the upper hand of fate all along?!<br/><br/>I think the lost storyline here, from the beginning, is about how this lead will never bear his life as it is. Because he, like us, can't play God. He only can be a human; himself. But when he settled down peacefully in another time, yet lost his only love, the movie didn't say ""make peace with your life, to live it as better as you can"", No, it said: ""Don't try to mess with fate"", otherwise you may lose, as we already knew by watching the whole thing, as if this is a loop of a movie, with nothing but empty circles that say the same thing, many times, boringly!<br/><br/>Maybe they wanted to make a compromise of an end; not to end it tragically for the fear of low profits, or to end it happily with the lead finally living in harmony with his life. Or maybe they suspended it in a way, to have the opportunity of making a sequel; as they already did 2 years later! But whatever, THIS ENDING made the effect of (Butterfly Effect) weaker, or out of focus. And compared to all what was before it, it's irrelevant and dumb!<br/><br/>Aside from that annoying ending, and unquiet meaning, things weren't much better. The script manipulated its characters unwisely. For instance, when the lead finds himself in a collage with his girlfriend, he suddenly finds out that he has a spoiled attitude! Well, how can his personality change to treat his friends badly, then wonder about it?! Plus, the tragedy of (Ashton Kutcher) pale face and performance. It's so hard on him to handle such a role. To tell you the truth, (John Patrick Amedori), the child who played his character in some scenes, was more powerful than him. And, forever and ever, the nudity was unnecessary, degraded, and disgusting way to sell the movie, any movie for that matter!<br/><br/>To be fair, I liked the main idea, some efforts done by the 2 directors, (Eric Bress) and (J. Mackye Gruber), while dealing with the thrilling moments, (Amedori) acting, and that's it!<br/><br/>All in all, it was creative idea for a movie which turned out to be not that creative itself, and ended up as one of the dullest, and muddiest, movies ever dealt with time travel."

I think it has the most unique approach to time travel that I've ever seen in a movie. It was far better than I had ever expected from the reviews. But it is not a 'fun' movie or a movie for kids. It is very dark, and at times depressing. I know at some points I was dreading the ending because I just knew it wasn't going to be a happy ending... the movie just gets darker and darker as more of the past is changed.

To help him remember the events that lead up to and following his blackouts, he creates ""journals"" of every blackout episode. Fast forward to Evan's college days - the blackout episodes are now gone, and Evan is living a normal college boy life. A girl happens upon Evan's journals while she was in the room with him, and once Evan reads one of his journals he is inexplicably temporarily transported back to that particular time and place in his journal. This leads Evan to believe he can right the wrongs he did in the past and possibly change what the future holds for him.<br/><br/>I think I've spoiled enough already, so I'll stop there.<br/><br/>The film has a very gripping plot, with little twists here and there, and the actors played their parts well. The settings and locations were spot on, and the sequencing well paced.<br/><br/>It deserves the 9/10 rating I gave it in my opinion."

","A rather poor rip of ""Przypadek"" by Krzysztof Kieslowski (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084549/). This remake doesn't add anything interesting to the concept, just changes details of action to USA standards.<br/><br/>I have no idea what for make new versions of already tried ideas. One reason can be better actors' play, but it is definitely not the case here. The other reason can be a goal to simplify the action so more people would understand the plot. Unfortunately this reason will lead us to more and more shallow films each year.<br/><br/>If You are thinking about watching this film a much better choice will be mentioned ""Przypadek"" - not only a more interesting, but You would also will have a feeling of watching something ""fresh""."

","When I saw the advert for this I thought it was going to be clever and gripping, I was only slightly right. Basically, Evan at 7 (Logan Lerman) suffers from memory blackouts, and moments later he finds himself forward in time in a new place and confused, and his Mom believes he is making up the blackouts to get out of trouble. As Evan grows, to age Evan at 13 (John Patrick Amedori) he has less blackouts, until apparently recovering. He has written a diary about his blackout moments since age 7, so he can remember what happens. Now in college, Evan Treborn (Dude, Where's My Car?'s Ashton Kutcher) starts to read back through his diary, and discovers not only that he can relive the memories that were blacked out, but also that he can change them for the better. Also starring Road Trip's Amy Smart as Kayleigh Miller, Eric Stoltz as George Miller, William Lee Scott as Tommy Miller, Elden Henson as Lenny Kagan, Irene Gorovaia as Kayleigh at 13, Kevin G. Schmidt as Lenny at 13, Jesse James as Tommy at 13, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Thumper, Melora Walters as Andrea Treborn and Callum Keith Rennie as Jason Treborn. It is an inventive story in terms of looking back into someone's terrible past experiences that he missed, but it is a bit ridiculous in the places where it goes into another almost perfect world, like a dream or something. Worth watching!"

","Just watched this film ...whew! A film you simply can't peel your eyes away from. Excellent! Essentially, Evan Treborn realises that he can change harmful events in his past. However, with each change he makes the resulting effects bring even worse outcomes. And it's the what's going to happen next that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I'm one of those who has always thought Ashton Kutcher movies were always best avoided. However, I take it all back. Let's hope he concentrates on more films like this.<br/><br/>As others have commented, this is a hidden gem of a film that largely passed the movie world by, such a shame. Thankfully, good films can never remain hidden forever ...watch it, you won't be disappointed."

","One of my all time favourite truly underrated gems, that deserved much better reviews than it got. Nothing in 2004 came close to this effort.<br/><br/>It was the best movie I'd seen in along time. The only movie I've seen in a long time that I actually had wanted to see more than once at the cinemas. There was a real heart to this movie, I really identified with the main character, Evan Treborn's quite personality and his reactions to crazy situations he finds himself in (with the exception of the painful past...and the supernatural element of course ) You really bare witness to this character's coming of age journey through this movie. You see his mistakes and watch him have to grow as a person and learn more about responsibilities as he screws with his time-line again and again forcing himself to learn some serious lessons in the process. I loved how he made all the same sort of mistakes that I or anyone else would probably make in that sort of insane situation and that he couldn't just figure it all out by the end, that they're were no easy answers, no case of a puzzle to be solved...you simply can't play god. It merely comes down to making the first choice that wouldn't benefit himself, there by demonstrating personal sacrifice.<br/><br/>I found the somewhat implications of brain damage if the time travel gets too excessive or reckless in use a very believable side effect to having such a gift. It made more sense to see him having to take risks and it being a painful process and having more at stake to loose than if he were capable of time travelling too easily or having no limitations to it.<br/><br/>The trailers could easily fool someone into thinking it's just another teenybopper or slasher type rubbish, as it did with my big brother but once you've seen it, it's not at all what you might think. This actually had some of the balls yest moves I've ever seen. A Deeply creative and innovative effort, featuring a near entire gauntlet of the not so pleasant aspects of real life horrors. It's genuinely shocking in it's realistic feeling use of violence and it created a hell of an audience reaction in my cinema showing. Not often had I experienced an audience that was gripped in the palm of a movie's hands as this was. The collective gasps at big moments was so spot on, it must have been a filmmakers wet dream. We're not talking typical Hollywood glorified violence, but rather the kind thats so suggestive in it's impact, it makes the most hardened of viewers cringe despite it being fictional characters. Just an unbelievable experience. Ain't pretty, not for the faint of heart, put the teenyboppers to bed folks.<br/><br/>The acting across the board faced quite the challenge too boot, with all sorts of different alternate versions of their characters to sink their teeth into. And all in my humble opinion rises to it as best they could with strong results all round. The kids were probably faced with the biggest mountain to climb. It being such heavy material and there being a curse on working with children but incredibly the casting gods so fit to shine down on the team with performances that arguably gave the adults a run for their money. Hell I actually found the kids playing one of the most psychotic child's I've seen in film, the Tommy character more effective than their adult counter part. Both the said Tommy character and his sicko father, a perfectly slimy revamp of former 80's heartthrob Eric Stoltz made for two truly disturbing Villains. While at it's core, under all the grittiness does lie a love story, lending a greater sense of presence to Amy Smart whom makes an admirable effort at breaking your hearts. And I can't say enough about how much I loved that they had the guts to go with a meatier ending rather than the obvious one everyone has to be expecting.<br/><br/>Finally Ashton Kutcher blew me away in his first dramatic performance with one hell of an Ernest showing. He has his odd morbidly funny moments but overall comes off a lot better than his critics would expect. I actually hadn't been predisposed to him as much as his adoring public who would like his blood, before seeing the movie. So I went in only knowing the name a little. I didn't go in with the baggage of knowing him as ' Mr. Demi Moore' or 'That annoying lanky prick who keeps punking people.' I merely went in knowing him as 'that guy from the 70's show' and had mercifully forgotten 'Dude Where's my car?' He ain't the greatest actor I've ever seen but he got the job done on this one and pulled off a hell of an endearing performance and I really digged the big black beard as well which helped with the image change.<br/><br/>Whether you like or don't like aside, props gotta go out to such an effort at something new and genuinely challenging.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","*Distr.(US) by Newline Cinema (2004)* <br/><br/>I was intrigued by the brilliant examination of the consequences of time travel in TBE. Ladies' heart throb Ashton Kutcher takes the lead as the protagonist trying to save his girl friend from a dreary future. Much of the movie is in flashback mode, with Kutcher (Evan Treborn) having an angelic gift to travel back in time after reading passages from his old diary. The characters in this film are ordinary people and not the usual geeks who build time machines in most science fiction stories. I may warn the faint of heart to be prepared for the morbid consequences depicted that include, suicide, insanity and loss of limbs.<br/><br/>For similar whimsical films about time travel, see<br/><br/>the negative: A Sound of Thunder (2005)<br/><br/>the positive: Back to the Future (and Trilogy, a family movie), Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (a comedy/horror series), Lost in Space (horror/ science fiction)"

The ending is the only real difference between the two, but WHAT a DIFFERENCE! This seems to be yet another case of the creative team coming up with a fantastic ending for a good movie, only to have it snatched away by the ""studio"", whatever that term means. I had the added benefit of seeing the Director's Cut FIRST, and thus when I recently obtained the Infiniti release of Butterfly Effect (both versions on one disc) and watched the theatrical ending i was able to see it for the lame, ""tacked on"" piece of schmaltz that it was. It's like a producer was standing there with a clipboard going ""a sad ending in an Ashton Kutcher movie? Are you guys nuts? Make it happy!!"" So instead of the moving and incredibly effective ending the writer/director team intended, we have a ""all is well"" ending that leaves you thinking ""man, if you are that cut up over it, why didn't you just off yourself in the beginning and save everyone the heartache?"" It really is worth seeing for the ending...only two films in recent memory have left me feeling numb and this is one of them. Great movie."

I thought for sure I would have to watch it twice because it looked so incredibly confusing, but it wasn't. The plot was very easy to follow, and it was perfectly written. It's a very simple concept, how can each and every one of our actions change our future? This movie answers that question with stunning believability. It will leave you begging for more. You feel almost as though you are Evan ( Kutcher's character ), desperately trying to fix one thing, but in doing so destroying something else. If you haven't seen this movie, see it.

","This is one of the most intelligent and touching movie I've seen. The reason for it's intelligent is the well-edited and well-thought script and story lines. The reason for it being so moving is because the fine acting by its performers.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart both did outstanding jobs for this movie. The former, especially, deserve a lot of praise as it shows that he not only can act in comedies, but he also can act in more serious shows. People should give him a lot more credit, as not many actors can do so, even the best. Look at the pathetic performances by Nicholas Cage in National Treasure (an usually serious actor trying to be funny), and Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines (an usually funny actor trying to be serious), and then you'll see its not something everyone can do easily. Ashton may not deserve an Oscar for his performance here, but he should at least get those critics to shut their mouth about his acting skills as he clearly can act, and act very well."
"shannonigan","7","0","2","2 March 2007"," a decent film
","So, the movie starts out with the mid-end, which makes things interesting enough. It then starts with the main character, Evan (Ashton Kutcher), as a seven year old child in a small town, where the teacher shows the mother a disturbing drawing he drew in class when asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. What i don't understand is he said he never drew it, and it takes you a couple times to figure out why a seven year old is cursing to his best-friends father, but you'll get it. Other than that, pretty understandable and clear.<br/><br/>I have to admit, it was good, until the end. Now, I've only seen Director's Cut, which was okay, except the slight nudity & language, but good. The ending ruined it for me. But hey, there was really no other way to end it without it being cheesy and unrealistic. It makes sense with the plot, but I just didn't like the end. You should give it a chance, anyway. It's not as bad as you think."

"deepspace93","8","0","2","18 February 2007"," US Theatrical Cut Surprisingly Better than Director's
","As a rule, I end up liking Director's cuts of films better than Theatrical cuts, but this film makes my exception list to that rule.<br/><br/>First off, forget what the critics say about this film; especially if you enjoy films that deal with concepts of time. Sure you could pass it off as another hash of the old time-paradox syndrome, but this story takes it to a whole new level. It really delves into the repercussions that can happen when you play with time. Not only can it have your intended consequences, but the ripples can have many unintended consequences that can be disastrous.<br/><br/>Now, here're the key differences between the cuts and what makes the Theatrical cut better: <br/><br/>WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! <br/><br/>***************WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW THIS LINE***************** <br/><br/>WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! <br/><br/>In the Theatrical cut, which I watched first, Evan Treborn (played surprisingly well by Ashton Kutcher), finally saves face by making sure that his childhood girlfriend moves away and never gets to know him. This finally sets things right and enables Evan to have both purpose and peace in his life.<br/><br/>In the Director's cut however, a brand new storyline is introduced early on in the film. A scene is added where Evan and his mother visit a palm-reader and Evan is told that he has no life-line--that he was never meant to exist. This eventually leads him to kill himself while still in his mother's womb to set things right.<br/><br/>For me, I have a hard time accepting this theory that's introduced in the Director's cut. I can't accept that someone wasn't meant to exist. I am morally and ethically compelled to believe that we all have a purpose. This is why I can't support the Director's cut, but instead offer full credit to the Theatrical cut."

It also made me think so much about this concept.<br/><br/>It is definitely Ashton Kutcher's best role, and he performed very well in it.<br/><br/>The acting in general is all top-notch. The plot is amazing. The story is perfect. The movie is mind numbing.<br/><br/>This movie is about a complicated story of imagination, some real events & pure fantasy. It is not very hard to understand so if you are young, you can still give it a shot<br/><br/>Another movie that is similar to this one is Donnie Darko, but I liked this one more. Donnie Darko didn't have as much depth as this one.<br/><br/>Like Donnie Darko, this is psychedelic fantasy, science fiction,horror story. This type film is rare & very hard to succeed.<br/><br/>I also recommend Memento. If you liked The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko, you will like Memento<br/><br/>The concept of this movie is truly phenomenal and it's the best idea for a movie. This concept is called The Butterfly Effect. There is a theory, called the chaos theory, which suggests that a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a typhoon in another part of the world. This means that a small change can cause such large consequences, and thats what the movie is about.<br/><br/>Ithink it was underrated because the leading actor was 'punk' Ashton Kutcher, who never did any drama movies before, but he was brilliant. So ignore the misleading rating, it's underrated.<br/><br/>This is a must see! Make sure you see it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"

","Smart direction and great editing keeps this story going at a frantic pace. Ashton Kutcher in the role of Evan Treborn is on screen most of the time and must be given due credit for the success of this film. It has an intriguing opening and some scary exciting episodes along the way.<br/><br/>Shakespeare said ""What's done is done and cannot be undone"". I'm inclined to agree. The theme so often used in going back in time to change the present and the future has never appealed to me. It doesn't make sense despite the fact that deep down we would all like to make such changes.<br/><br/>However I have to say that the flashbacks are handled exceedingly well in this film. Evan seems to experience a painful seizure from time to time and the photographic portrayal of these moments is exceptional with quivering and floating images. The sound effects too add to the intense drama.<br/><br/>This is a very busy film and I will need to watch it again to enjoy the full impact of a complicated story about past imagined events and reality. The psychiatrist has a tough job in sorting out Evan's problems and I too find it difficult to follow the fast tempo of the action.<br/><br/>Some of the strong scenes not easy to forget are the Robin Hood movie in the basement cellar, the dog tied up in the bag, the dynamite in the postbox and the risquÃ© prison scene.<br/><br/>This is a good production.

The number of different stories was very well picked, as well as were the stories themselves. Actors in the movie did very good job, especially Ashton Kutcher who after all proved himself to be the best pick. I can't imagine anyone else acting it better than him. Movie was very intense, I was pulled in the story easy and got out about ten minutes after the credits. Choosing Oasis - Stop Crying Your Heart Out as song in the end of the movie was extraordinary and together with not many words said, it created the effect of me just staring at the screen thinking, what if...

This is a deep story that the director has spent some time with. Kutcher is astonishingly great in this movie where he plays Evan Treborn, a little kid who every now and then get blackouts (most often when something exciting happens). To remember as much as possible he writes diary. Evan grows up and one day when he's on his room at college, he finds his old diaries under his bed. When he starts reading them he realizes that he travels back in time to the place that he's reading about. To get to know more about these strange memories he look up his best childhood friend, kayleigh. Kayleigh's life is ruined since her daddy terrorized her in her childhood. When Evan comes and reminds her of all the things she has tried to forget she commits suicide. Evan realizes that he has to travel back in time so he can make Kayleigh live again, but what he doesn't know is that everything he does affects all the other people that he knows too. What should he do? According to me, this is absolutely a top-10 of the best movies ever made. It's extremely different from many other good movies and the great acting by Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart doesn't make the movie worse. It's of course 10 out of 10 for Kutcher's best movie ever."

","At the beginning the film seemed promising, so intrigued I continued to watch. I kept thinking to myself, when the hell is something interesting going to happen? The film felt like it was just plodding along, without any intention to giving it's viewers anything but silliness, bad acting, poor script and shoddy storyline. The young actors in this seemed very wooden and amateurish, I could not for a moment believe them. I advise you not to pay for the film, but...if it happens to be on television, and you have absolutely nothing better to be doing then watch it...Under no circumstances shell out good money to watch it!"

","Wow.. this was a truly great movie. Defianely and must see... Ashton Kutchner was great, we see him in a whole different light, you see a side of him you haven't before. Evan spends his whole life trying to make things right for everyone else around him. He loses and gains and hurts for those around him. He is so busy trying to make things right for everyone else and he never thinks soley on himself. He loves Callie and wants more than anything to be with her, but he wants her to be safe and never go through all she went through in her other lives. He gives up the love he holds so dear to protect her. He's absolutely precious in this movie. He seems very real in the movie and thats one thing that makes it so touching. He does an outstanding job and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. By the end you are wanting so much for him to find some kind of peace. Some kind of happiness. All the characters were greatly done, you could relate or dislike many and even sympathize with them as well. It was a great cast and a great movie!"

","This film is about a boy, Even Treborn, who has black outs. Since he was young, he has always has black outs so his psychiatrist told him to right in journals what he does everyday, like a diary. Now he's 20 and he finds a way to go back in time and see the black outs he once had when he was young. By reading his journals he has written when he was young, he can go back in time and change anything. Once he changes something to make it better, it alters his present.<br/><br/>The concept, which was taken by the Chaos Theory, is quite ingenious. This film is very smart, itself. The Chaos Theory states that a butterfly's wing can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. But in this movie, it only changes the character's lives revolved around the story, not outside the world.<br/><br/>Now Ashton Kutcher is in a thriller, rather than the comedy movies he's always been in. His acting was great, by the way, as well as Amy Smart and Melora Walters.<br/><br/>This is just a great film. Whenever Even changes one thing in his past, something is always flawed, to make it bad.

"addict123","10","0","2","30 July 2006"," Downright disturbing
","To be totally honest I did not expect something as disturbing as what I got. Paedophillia hasn't been handled in most movies and if it has it hasn't been handled well. I think the good thing about disturbing scenes such as these ones in the butterfly effect is that the director knew when to stop instead of going too far. I don't know why this was less popular because of disturbing scenes such as the death of Evan's dog, paedophillia and the prison blow job scene. This film isn't nearly as graphic as some others out there. Anyway, away from controversiality and onto the plot. Everyone knows the time old time travel, creates problems story thats been used hundreds of times before, and you'd think by now it would get old, but the way this is handled so differently, It doesn't seem to matter that this sort of plot has been used before. Again I have no idea why Ashton Kutcher has so many haters, this is the first film I've seen him in and didn't find him in any way annoying. If anything I found the casting absolutely spot on. And to the people who say this isn't about the butterfly effect itself, well let me explain. Chaos theory states that the flapping of a butterfly's wing on one side of the world causes a typhoon on the other side. Basically saying how the smallest of events can have the biggest consequences, which is basically what this film is trying to show us."

","Evan, a boy growing up with his single, struggling mother, suffers from traumatizing ""blackouts"" in his life. They're moments when he swears he was in one place, then finds himself in another - disoriented and confused. His mother is deeply concerned, namely because her husband (Evan's father) used to suffer from the same predicament which ultimately led to his incarceration in a mental facility. The movie shows Evan at 7 where he is in trouble at school for things he can't remember. And at 13 where he is suspected for a huge crime committed in his neighborhood that he blacked out for. But all through his life, his friends, brother and sister Tommy and Kayleigh, and Lenny have been with him. Kayleigh always held a place in his heart. Seven years after his last blackout, at the age of 20, college student Evan finds journals that he has written throughout his life detailing moments of when he blacked out. He also finds that reading them can make him travel back through time to the place of the memory. He first goes to visit Kayleigh back in their hometown. The past has had it's toll on her, like Tommy (a demented psycho for living with his father) and Lenny (who after being pushed around by Tommy has deep emotional scars). Evan then decides to use the journals to time travel and rewrite the past - hoping to make his own life, and that of Kayleigh, Tommy, and Lenny's, better. But every decision he makes, turns out worse and worse later on in life. Making Kayleigh, his one true love, suffer from each choice he made in his alternate reality. <br/><br/>""Change one thing, change everything.""<br/><br/>I thought the movie was superb, excellent. While not yet a tearjerker, it certainly makes you cry and while not completely a sci-fi, it has the incredible power to make you think and feel strongly about the film. Some parts were truly disturbing, but all tastefully done. The movie was all around genuine and wonderful. Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart played well-depth and believable characters that make you hope beyond belief for the best. John Patrick Amedori was brilliant; he and Logan Lerman are young and fresh yet talented. Other great characters were Irene Gorovaia, Melora Walters, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Kevin Schmidt, Jesse James, and Ethan Suplee. The end will have you tearing up and feeling and cherishing every memory and choice that Evan and you have made in life."

","who ever wrote this was a smart person!!! Just wonderful. Makes you think. There needs to be more intelligent writers. It is a big responsibility to entertain our public. A butterfly effects us by his slight movements in the physical world. This affects us by the outcome. A great movie that makes us think about "" what if"" affects us emotionally, yet changes our physical world. Thus putting great responsibility on the writer. This writer did very well and I thank him. We could use more thought feed movies in our world today. Imagine no war and always peace. Would our Bush agree to war, and What would happen if we all could go back to September the 11th. Too many people focus on personal gain. Would it not benefit us all in a personal way to have peace? One act of kindness can be felt around the world. One violent thought not acted upon can cause a positive movement, just like that of a butterfly. So cheers to the writer, and may God bless your hands to write more. This is a great movie."

","This is one of the few movies I could watch over and over. I have seen it several times, and each time, I realized something new about the movie.<br/><br/>The question of the movie is simple. What if you could go back in time and try to fix something? There is an added twist to the main character's time travel, and I will leave it up to you to find out if you haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>What makes the movie intense is that the main character's desire to save the one he loves, and also the problems he runs into as he tries to fix the problems in his past. The director's choice of a method of time travel is unique: The main character has an affliction that allows him to go back to a time in his past by reading things he wrote as a youth or by viewing pictures. And each time he tries to fix something in his past, something else goes wrong, and other things are changed unexpectedly. Not everything is quite right. There seems to be no good solution.<br/><br/>This movie is very well done and well structured. There are no low points in this movie - each scene has a point and ties directly into the main idea of the movie. This is one of those movies that will keep your full attention for the entire length. Ashton Kutcher, in his first serious role, plays surprisingly well in this movie. This is one of the truly great movies that has come out in recent years."

","well, Butterfly Effect is more dense (as the dansk comment says: like a poem no word without a bunch of meaning), but the blackouts, the change of the presence by time traveling into ones own past ... I think butterfly effect and Donnie Darko somehow are two of a kind. While following the downward spiral Donnie takes the opportunity to learn about the metaphysics of time travel and finally loops only one time to the one and only possible thing with fatal results for himself but lots of benefits for his mates). Evan takes a different way of learning about it: every loop he takes with its fatal consequences in the presence adds up to the one clue how to solve it (looks a little bit like Phil Connors in Groundhog Day - what do you think?"

","*~~~* indicates spoiler <br/><br/>When i was watching this movie earlier today, all i could think was ""wow this is so great!"" The nice chunk of plot twists that are, now that i think of it, delightfully predictable, and the massive amount of parallelism and allusions *(how he's like his father and how he communicates with his dad, and learns so much about his 'illness' in a 2 minute talk with his dad, the spikes in the hands next to the religious cell mate, 'playing god')*. I personally love movies that make ya think - this one does a good amount of it. it is also very good at being incredibly dark (i haven't seen ""Donnie Darko"", but I'm renting it tomorrow) and does a fabulous job of illustrating how much stuff can get really seriously forked up, though a lot of it is somewhat unlikely (but then i watched the south park movie just before, so it seemed to me a healthy dose of realism). I'm also a really emotional guy, and i was straight up bawling at the end (theatrical version), cuz i knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as the video started playing. Stylisticly, its very successful (kudos to the visual effects guys for the minor amount of well-applied originality). <br/><br/>* Another thing to think about here for those of you that read this - i never thought for an instant that he was really changing the past, present and future. i had it in my head that everything except for the life he had at the very ending was a construct of his mind (think ""Identity"" with john cusack) in which he ""remembers the future"" (dimensional theory). The character changing evan undergoes is reminiscent of ""Groundhog Day"", though i personally would have made a few different decisions than evan did (like taking out the stick of boomy stuff - what does that accomplish? or how about standing in front of that stick of dynamite when he knows its about to blow) My comments on the ending - i personally think that it suited the movie well (TR, not DC), and is a little 'happy'. for a happy ending, try the camera looking at evan for a moment more upon which he clutches his head and essentially expresses ""she is my soulmate - i know that for sure"", and he turns around after her.<br/><br/>The movie is even a love story! (to me its the best one i've seen yet), cuz evan is willingly going to not risk his true love's life or happiness anymore, even though in reality she didn't experience any of what was in the movie (mind construct or time travel, either way). *<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic movie. I HIGHLY recommend it if you like things that make you think, or if you enjoy non-flamboyant time travel flicks (""12 Monkeys"", etc.), or if you like any kind of dark sci-fi or fantasy."

I never would have thought that Ashton Kutcher (that 70's show)or Amy Smart (just friends) would take on such a serious movie. I was really surprised at Amy Smart's acting abilities, I never knew that she was actually a good actress. She really impressed me. Ashton Kutcher also impressed me, but not in the same way. I already knew he could act, but i enjoyed the way he used some comic relief in the scene when his mom is found out about his brain defects. This movie definitely exceeded my expectations.

","This was an OK movie overall. Basically elaborating on the idea that the flutter of the wings of a butterfly can cause a tsunami halfway across the world, it's in interesting study of how certain events encountered as early on as childhood can affect everything that happens to us afterward. Evan, the main character, discovers he has the strange power to look back at his old journals and go back in time to alter things that happened. Bent on preventing the suicide of one of his friends and the decline of another, he goes back to certain horrific and formative childhood events to change them, but every time different people get hurt in different ways. It goes on and on until the bittersweet ending...and I thought the concept and execution of the plot was marvelous. I've often thought, like if I hadn't done this thing years ago, how would things be different? It gives you chance to see how this might work out. It was also very well-made...not amazing direction, but what might otherwise be a long, mechanical latter part didn't drag at all. Now for the cons: I refuse to acknowledge Ashton Kutcher as an actor, first off. This isn't so bad...Winona Ryder isn't an actor either, she plays herself as Ashton does, but at least she gets the right emotion half of the time and pulls off lines naturally. Ashton is Abominable. He deserves death by firing squad. The rest of the acting was OK, nothing particularly stood out...but overall, it seemed in retrospect very calculated to have a particular effect on the audience. This is probably not a definite bad thing for most, but for me, I hate having my emotions manipulated. Movies that I tend to hail as great - The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now - cannot be contracted into one emotion or one interpretation, or a thousand. And some others, such as Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon, simply defy intellectual judgement altogether. I felt the The Butterfly Effect was plotted, calculated in much the same way as The Devil's Advocate, or 187 - good movies in and of themselves, but ones that leave no room to breathe."

I will admit, that watching the movie was very confusing early on and for the longest time it just seemed to have no real point. Okay, so once having discovered his unique gift, this kid can go back in time and change his life's events--BIG DEAL. However, the POINT of the movie is exactly that even IF YOU HAVE THIS POWER, you CANNOT change things, no matter what. Things are supposed to be a certain way--this is determined only by the Fates--and that is something you simply MUST accept. There is no way around this fact.<br/><br/>You may not understand WHY things happen the way they do, but everything happens for the BEST, and that is determined by the Fates, and only the Fates. Don't dwell on how awful your life is, or what terribly tragic, unfortunate thing just happened to you--everything truly does happen for a reason.

The story continues to show Evan in college. Later we find out that Evan can go back in time to change certain key events in his life (which if i told would spoil the movie)but doing so has consequences. The violence in this movie is pretty strong and there is much blood in this movie (but not buckets and buckets) and some of it is towards children. This movie is not for children, there are many scenes of sex,but very little nudity(some is shown by accident i think) and there is a scene with a reference to child porn. The language is constant with many, many occurrences of the F-word, and many of the S-word. Overall this movie is highly enjoyable and entertaining, but it should not be shown to children under the age of 17."

","Some people didn't like this film, and I can't understand why. It was panned by the critics when it was released, but it's such an original film I can't understand why. It's violent - and it covers some very difficult and uncomfortable subjects such as paedophilia and incest, child porn and homosexual rape - but the way it looks at the indeterminate nature of reality is exceptional. The actual sci fi element of the story was, to me, secondary to the idea that each event that happens to us is so often defined by pure chance; and that any one of us is as much a product of chance events as anything.<br/><br/>For example in the movie all the characters' lives hinge on one event that - had one person not made one brief, momentary decision - been completely different. As an allegory for the effects of our own belief systems affecting our entire lives, it's a far more powerful vehicle than even ""It's a wonderful Life"" ever was.<br/><br/>Watch this film, and watch the alternate ending versions. You have to be pretty dim to not see what an excellent film this is."

It is something worth seeing on its own.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and complex, and it seems to get more complicated the more you think about it!!

On the director's cut, there is, and it teaches us something about life.<br/><br/>Both Aston Kutcher, who plays Evan, and Amy Smart, who plays Kaylie are thoroughly believable as they play the same character in lives that are sometimes deliriously happy and other times disastrous and full of pain.<br/><br/>As a child, Evan makes a promise to Kaylie, ""I'll come back to you.""

","i have not read any of the bad reviews, but i thought it was really good. i missed the first 20 minutes of it. i came up on the part when they first got to the junk yard, when doggy was fixing to get set aflame. i immediately wanted to get on the net and find people's explanation of what was actually occurring, but soon after i understood. i do agree with the other commenter, about it not needing to be in the ""horror"" category. i honestly did not even think ashton kutcher could act, since i had only seen him on ""that 70's show"", but i really think he did a good job. it also seemed as if the other actors did well in their flexible roles, like kayleigh's brother."
"ric_gill","10","0","1","13 February 2006"," The most powerful film ever produced!
","This 2004 script of genius is no doubt the best film released with a plot as unique as itself. Influenced by the 'Chaos Theory' it has several film genres rolled up into one, it consists of drama, psychosis and thriller. The film is about a young boy who is suffering with a brief amount of random memory loss which was inherited from his father who at this point lives in a mental home because of his similar behaviour. Each time Evan (the boy) blacks out, he will come to with a terrible scenario that has occurred during the black-out.<br/><br/>Evan is now seven years older and has move away with seven years of no black-outs so he and his room mate celebrate at a bar. Evan and a girl go back to his university room to have a good time. The girl asks Evan to read some of his journals from when he was a kid, he starts reading and blacks-out but whilst he is sleeping, he wakes up in the past just as his childhood enemy is about to kill Evans pet dog, burning it alive. Evan wakes up in a cold sweat and scared of what just happened and immediately returns to his home town to find out what he used to miss when he blacked-out. He meets his old girlfriend Hailey (Amy Smart) and asks about her paedophile father on what he did to them when they were younger. Hailey kills herself because of what Evan asked and receives a threat from his childhood enemy Tommy (Haileys younger brother). Evan returns to university upset and reads his old journals again to this time see what happens. During the film, Evan attempts to fix his life in an attempt to help everyone and live happy ever after; but with a positive must come a negative and there is someone in his life who is suffering as a result. Evan goes back in time to a time when he blacked-out talking to his 'crazy' father and woke up being strangled. Evan asks his father for help and how to fix his future but ends badly, his father is killed. Eventually Evans brain is badly damaged from time travel which is now irreversible. Evan's final stop is the beginning on the film in a mental home, just like his father. He has at this point never written a journal and he has been in the home most of his life, to be exact he has been in there ever since he took part in killing a neighbour and her baby. There is now no way back and Evans last hope is to go back to a time before he was even born and kill himself before he is even born. Once Evan has committed suicide, the future is a happy ending for everyone without him.<br/><br/>I am currently 18 years old and I had a tear drawing from my eye at the end of this film. I strongly advice anyone who has an interest in psychotic dramas to watch this film the next time they have the opportunity."
"tombaker-3","9","0","1","9 February 2006"," Great psychological thriller
","I have seen both ""endings"" of this movie. The first time I simply walked in on it with no preconceptions. I was mystified by the importance of Evan's childhood ""blackouts"" until the film later demonstrated that they were instances of a ""future"" Evan returning to his own past to ""re-possess"" his own childhood consciousness for a short time.<br/><br/>I take issue with the critics of this film. The writers & directors had to visually ""imply"" the gimmick of the movie: Evan could return to his childhood body at will and change his own past actions. No one in the film gave a monologue to inform the audience of the gimmick. A good deal of my pleasure in this film (very like ""Memento"") was figuring out how all the scenes fit together in the film's convoluted topology, and thus gaining access to the film's spiritual message: we can never entirely predict the outcomes of our actions - the human mind can conceive of God, but is far too predictively limited to play at ""being God"". Evan kept trying to produce good effects, but only succeeded in creating worse futures around him.<br/><br/>I was unsatisfied with both endings: The Director's Cut was too Dark; and the Theatrical Release was to ""Hollywood Trite"". For me, the old saw of undoing all changes and returning to an unmodified moment of the past and to the God/Tao/Destiny that naturally evolved from that pure moment would have been most satisfying, especially if Evan had retained the wisdom inspired by his memory of his failed ""alternate reality"" meddling.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie for open minded thinkers and beginning philosophers - I have enjoyed it tremendously three times so far."

","The Butterfly Effect was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's so exciting, the storyline is so freaking brilliant. And it has also a deeper philosophical meaning to it, about your actions in life and the consequences that flow from those actions. Ashton Kutcher's best role in a movie, it's so much better than his comedy roles. Amy Smart is also very convincing and the guys that play the other two main characters as well. He plays the lead character so naturally you believe the story from the beginning. The ending is also very touching. I suggest every person in the world intelligent enough should go see this movie because it made a big positive impact on my view of life, namely to think before you act because you cannot change your actions and they will always have consequences."

","The Butterfly Effect is somewhat of a sleeper hit that, as far as critics go, didn't get the credit it deserves. This isn't a movie that the family should see, it'll definitely disturb some on a few levels, my mother was. With that in mind, this movie is not for the faint of heart, but it does have a take on life that people often overlook; that you can't change someone without changed who they were before. There are references to chaos theory in this movie that show that the human mind is still a puzzle waiting to be solved. At first the movie can be a bit hard to follow so you might want to watch it more than once, but every time you watch this movie you begin to further understand and comprehend this movie's point. Also, Butterfly Effect shows us a side of Kutcher that I don't think we'll ever see again. But for the kind of person he is, Kutcher does an excellent job portraying his character. Another thing I liked about this movie is that although it's got a bit of a love story in it the movie doesn't end like pretty much every movie involving love. If you're looking for a movie that delivers at a level that could rival that of the Sixth Sense then Butterfly Effect will satisfy you, it's a real punch in the gut."
"eskdale56","7","0","1","5 February 2006"," Wow!
","I was home on Sunday afternoon with nothing to do...happened upon this movie by chance, decided to watch. Aston Kutcher has never been on my A list for TV or Movies, but this movie showed me he can act! The topic of time travel always interests me and this was a unique approach to the topic. As time travel movies always seem to prove the basic rule is that you can't change the past without significantly influencing the future. It's refreshing to see that this movie doesn't give it a ""Back to The Future"" or a ""Dr. Who"" treatment ('in the end it all turns out good' and that you can change the future without ill consequences).<br/><br/>This movie also has a jarring dimension in that you're never quite sure Kutcher is time traveling or if he's just mentally ill--in fact toward the end of the movie, I thought that was going to be the result, that he was simply crazy all the time. For some reason the book ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden"" kept coming to mind as I watched this movie.<br/><br/>This is a good movie to watch if you want some emotions stirred in you and if you like a plot that twists and turns all the way through..."
"raxxel","9","0","1","5 February 2006"," Watched it and can't stop thinking about it
","Being used to Kutcher's more comedic roles, this movie was sort of a 'will watch but won't expect too much' sort of thing. I was very wrong! Kutcher gives an amazing performance.I never knew how well he could pull off such a mature,deep role. The scenes were well-thought out, and I loved the way the camera moved for different shots.It was very smooth and its flow meant you could follow the story easily. The movie itself makes you ask yourself how your life could've changed if you went back to alter just one little thing. It also makes you wonder what you'd sacrifice for those you love. An amazing movie, and one I wouldn't regret watching again"
"tiassa","8","0","1","2 February 2006"," Very Robert Silverberg
","I was actually surprised that I didn't see Robert Silverberg's name in the credits. He wrote several short stories about time travel and alternate time-lines, and one, ""Needle in a Timestack"" could almost have been ""The Butterfly Effect"" -- if Lenny was writing the story! Enough other comments have described the plot, so I'll just add that while there are probably holes in the plot (other than the first ""Terminator"" there are plot holes in every time-travel movie), the movie still works as an exploration of the time paradoxes.<br/><br/>I've never seen Punk'd or ""Dude Where is my car"", so I had no opinion of Ashton Kutcher and I thought he was good, you could see the changes to him after every ""life reset"" (it is implied that he ""remembers"" all of the alternative realities even after he changes them), to a certain extant he is a cypher, because the rest of his friends lives revolve around him and he is almost the victim of their actions. A really good movie, bordering on great."
"RNMorton","8","0","2","1 February 2006"," Hit and Miss
","I LOVE the concept of this movie as over-complicated as it is. Kutcher has ability to go back, as it were, and rewrite history. His focus is on beautiful neighbor Smart, with whom he was as a child a co-participant in her sick dad's kiddie porn scheme. There's a few other wackos around (more than the ordinary quota for one middle class neighborhood) that make life interesting for young Kutcher. Twist is that each time Kutcher goes back and tries to fix things, other effects from his playing with the past make things worse than they were before. I like Kutcher in the role, Smart is pretty in an intriguing way and otherwise up to the task, but there are some downsides. The movie has some extremely unpleasant scenes that I passed on, it runs too fast through certain segments, it is often (to say it mildly) very difficult to follow, and some times Kutcher's attempts to fix the past are like killing an ant with a flamethrower. But the eventual resolution of the problem, however flawed it may actually be, is satisfying and meaningful in the context of the movie and in its own way. If I could take out the really grim parts I'd give it a qualified thumbs up."

","Now, before you begin reading my comments about the movie, please forgive me if you see any wrong sentences or words, I'm not very good at speaking (or writing) English.<br/><br/>This is the best movie I've ever seen. Ashton Kutcher puts on a decent performance, which I'd except much less from the guy we know at ""Punk'd"". And Amy Smart is excellent. But I think the actor who plays Evan's childhood (at 13) deserves some credit for the movie's success. It's script is amazing, the message that wanted to be given is incredible, and best scene is the one which the doctor tells Evan that there are no journals, and his father was asking the pretty much same things when he was at the hospital. And of course the last scene is incredibly good. The happy Evan is a psychiatrist and his mom's healthy, he has a decent life, but then he sees the only thing missing, his love. And the musics are great in the movie, directing is excellent, almost every actor that played puts on a great performance.<br/><br/>My note to this excellent movie 10/10"
"MRskate999","7","0","1","30 January 2006"," Interesting...
","There is no denying that ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a good movie. The plot is captivating, the story line delicately and intricately made. The thought of being able to change the past through the journal entries was very clever. The cinematography was fairly good, particularly the transitions between the flashbacks and real time. The soundtrack was nice, and the young talent was not bad at all. However, where this movies downfall occurs is in it's casting. Ashton Kutcher's desperate attempt to be taken seriously, in my opinion, belly flopped. Throughout this entire movie, the possibility of Ashton Kutcher (Evan) popping out and saying to Amy Smart (Kaleigh) ""Guess what, you've been punk'd!"" was a reoccurring thought. Although Mr. Kutcher's performance was above what I was expecting, it still took away from the movie, which is a shame as this movie truly could have been phenomenal. It's still a must see however which I enjoyed very much."

","Too bad this died at the box office! If it had done well, maybe Ashton Kucher would have avoided the crappy romantic comedies he's made of late. He shows real range and emotion here, proving himself to be an excellent actor, and good enough to carry a film through his emotional journey. The actors around him carry off the different sides of their characters very well - you can recognize each of them through the makeup and hair alterations.<br/><br/>The story is a familiar one to sci-fi fans, but done extremely well. Formula works when it's done right, darnit. The consequences of each time he changes his past, while in the previews seemed overblown, were realistic and believable in the film. I totally enjoyed this film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a thoughtful scifi film - this is not for fans of junk like ""the day after tomorrow""."

","This movie had an interesting premise that was fairly well executed. It starts off with a guy named Evan, during his childhood and adolescence. During this time frame, he has blackouts at key moments, such as when a neighbor is filming a porn film with Evan and his friend Kayleigh as its stars and when a bomb he and some friends made blows up and kills a lady. Years later, when he is in college, he reads his journals and finds he can go back in time and alter the circumstances. Unfortunately, the outcome leaves a lot to be desired, especially where Kayleigh is concerned. In one altered outcome, she winds up committing suicide, and in another one she grows up to be a prostitute. Evan keeps trying though.

A lot of traumatic experiences occur between him and his friends that vanish from his mind each time he jotted down the things he had forgotten.

Once again being pushed into darkness, even, not until his wake up from the former nightmare, Evan's trembling hands just like his letters' quivering on the journal. It's not just as dated as such common science fictions talking about how people traveling through time to save the world. Despite its suspense issued initially, who is the most important person in your life? We could not say it's horrible itself that he begin to change his past for a more perfect life, whereas, like what his father had told him in the hospital, life itself is not intact, and that is the most fearful thing. At the finale, Evan went back to the time when his mother was with pregnancy, via watching a video tape, to save his Kayleigh. 'Maybe it is better that I've never come', the baby in amniotic fluid thought, and then, a sacrificing suicide occurred.

"shanfloyd","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," An intriguing presentation of an interesting plot.
","Perhaps the theory of multiple universes or whatever one calls them has been in movie makers' eyes from the day it had been published. Indeed it makes a really entertaining storyline if used properly and intelligently... a good example is Tom Tykwer's classic ""Run Lola Run"" where he uses a perfect blend of multiverse and chaos theories. ""The Butterfly Effect"" may lack Tykwer's superb cinematic style but still it has a very unique plot, good screenplay and most of all, decent actors whose performances make this film a really serious experience in the end.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot, I'm quite fascinated by the fact that the film did not hesitate to show anything that might be necessary to make it tight enough, however shocking and offensive they may be. It deals with quite a number of childhood and teenage misadventures, the presentation of which are indeed smart. Hats off to directors Gruber and Bress for that. Regarding acting, I have to say Ashton Kutcher really did a nice job in this different kind of role.<br/><br/>To summarize, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a very intelligent and yet, entertaining film. Every scenario has their own unique and unpredictable dramatic moments... and that fun is rightly treated with a best possible ending."

","It's interesting to note that there are so many different views towards this film. Some found it really good while others find it sucked. Just giving my 2cents worth of comments, if it matters to anyone.<br/><br/>I think The Butterfly Effect runs more on the thread of ""what ifs"" which is the basis of most Hollywood scripts than it being a horror flick. However, this movie moved out of the norms by presenting so many other alternatives within the storyline.<br/><br/>This concept is really not new. Considering films like Run Lola Run & Sliding Doors that deal with the same issue.<br/><br/>But it's refreshing to see how childhood events can really affect a person's life. And i dun think the writers exaggerate because it happens to many people around us. Our past and upbringing plays a big role in shaping how we will be like when we grow up, like it or not.<br/><br/>With regards to the editing,I was pretty bored during the first half hour of the film. I thought it was moving a little slow and almost wanted to press the forward button.<br/><br/>But as i continued watching, i got drawn into the character & psychic of Evan. I felt for the character cos he feels he's responsible for the ""bad stuff"" that happened to others' lives. It shows the love he has for his friends & people around him that in the end, the solution is to not have his life started(DVD version). In that way, his friends & family will never have to go thru all the pain they were going thru.<br/><br/>It's a little mystical & fairy-tale like kind of ending (be it the directors' cut or theatrical cut). Like what many people say, it's not like if you were not born or went back to change the past, all these mishaps will not happen in their lives. But it's just a film after all.<br/><br/>I think in comparison to many other crappy Hollywood movies that have been made, The Butterfly Effect certainly scores much more. It's not excellent but certainly worth a watch."

When he grows up, Evan finds a way to remember these key events and even how to alter his life, as well as the life of the people connected to him. The movie shows flashbacks when Evan goes back in the past, and they are extremely well done. The results shown after the flashbacks are one to marvel at. The movie is beautiful as it comes. It may dazzle you in the beginning, if you do not grasp the main concept, but once you understand it, u'd want to watch it over and over again. Kutcher does his part very well, and his acting talents are enhanced in the character of Evan Treborn. Kayleigh Miller could've been chosen as someone else apart from Amy Smart, but that can be forgiven seeing the splendid way the movie has come out. Definitely a must see! Even if you're not the Sci-Fi/Thriller type, you need to give this a try - trust me, it's worth it!"

","A tragic and dramatic story as well as a tension-filled adventure through time and space in this extraordinary feature.<br/><br/>It all begins in Evan's (Ashton Kutcher) childhood, with him having constant blackouts for periods of time that he has absolutely no memory of. Since there seems to be no way to remember these events, Evan makes an effort in writing everything he does into his journals. But the blackouts isn't the only thing Evan and his mother (Melora Walters) is worried about. His father is contained in a mental-institution after having similar symptoms as Evan. There is also the girl, Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) - the love of his life, who he's since long lost contact with after growing up. While now living at a fraternity with his room-mate Thumper (Ethan Suplee), he decides to go see her again. But when things turn out as bad as they can, Evan can only wish there was a way to change it all. Finding his old journals from when he was a child, he starts reading them, experiencing the long forgotten skeletons in the closet. As he is reading, something happens, something impossible...<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher displays another side of his acting. Here displaying excellent skill in the more dramatic role as Evan Treborn, a most unusual individual who discovers there's something odd about him.<br/><br/>My expectations of this movie was very high after hearing a bit about it. Somewhere deep down I was worried that when watching it, I would be disappointed. How wrong I was. It not only made my expectations but exceeded them enormously. I would recommend this movie strongly to anyone who likes adventures into the supernatural, excitement and science-fiction as well as anyone who likes a fantastically dramatic experience that can make you drop a tear, filled with love, sorrow and emotion."
"gobbles_the_penguin","8","0","1","4 November 2005"," Kutcher.....can he ACTUALLY act?
","The answer is yes, apparently he can, and it's a shame that he doesn't show it more often. I also think that the writers and directors did a fantastic job despite not being used to directing. They used some interesting codes in the film, (look for the colour red!) and the way they jumped around from time to time at the start of the film is a fantastic way of drawing attention, (almost slapping the viewer over the head every time they aren't concentrating!) Kutcher does a marvellous job as Evan, and he is supported brilliantly by a cast which isn't too well known, but very gifted. Oh, and another thing i must say, if you saw the version in the cinema's (particularly in Australia), and you feel cheated by such a crowd pleasing end, make sure you catch the director's cut DVD version, because the ending is far better and there are new events throughout the movie that support this new and improved ending. The cinema version i give 5/10, the director's cut i give 9/10, so it makes a big difference! All and all, it's a very compelling film and certainly worth a viewing!"
"dromasca","7","0","2","28 October 2005"," a future cult movie?
","I deeply feel that when it comes to real value and time resistance the audiences are better judges than critics. In this case, 'The Butterfly Effect' directed by two almost unknown newcomers got a good reception from viewers, including a rather high IMDb mark, while critics trashed it almost completely. I wonder what is the reason, and I ask myself if the instinct of the audiences did not see in this traumatized childhood to manhood story combined with alternate lives transitions something that critics missed.<br/><br/>Much of the discussions were around Ashton Kutcher performance, and I dare say that in the absence of his off screen media exposure his performance would have been much highly rated. He holds this complex story on his shoulders, he does it with some doses of exaggeration at some points, but overall he is credible in the role of a traumatized young man, who is damned to change life lines more often than shaving.<br/><br/>The theme is not easy, and the movie is not easy viewing. It can never be easy when childhood traumas caused by child abuse and their repercussions for the rest of the life are brought to scren. Due to the changes in the story line, each of the four main character goes through his own moments of ecstasy and agony. Yet, there is consistency in the story telling, there is both dramatism and magic in the search of the right path to take, there is credibility in acting and all these make of 'Butterfly Effect' a film to watch, that may last longer and better than expected."

When they go back to the dog burning and tommy gets stabbed his sister - i forget her name - has obviously been hit in the face this time not the side of the head as before. This leads to the massive scar she has when she grows up to be a prostitute in the new reality. Does anyone know what happens differently that leads to this. I know from looking at the message boards that there is an alternate ending but is there a deleted scene which explains this. Also if anyone's willing to go through and outline the deleted scenes that'd be cool.

","Firstly I have to say that I think a lot of previous reviews have been heavily influenced by a dislike for Ashton Kutcher. To tell the truth I was half expecting an absolutely terrible performance from him too. His acting wasn't bad at all. I think he played it just a the right level. I think people see what they want to see and if you look hard enough bad acting, plot holes etc. you'll find them. I guess some people think being really pretentious makes them really smart. Frankly if they were really smart instead just trying to be they would have been spending the time enjoying the movie instead of picking on it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was really expecting something light and fluffy and I got dark and gritty. This is not a film for those who can't stand dark themes.<br/><br/>The director cut doesn't have a clichéd Hollywood ending either (though the theatrical version does).<br/><br/>The film does have some plot holes and places where you have to suspend disbelief (it's a freaking time travel movie for crying out loud!) aside from that it the pieces fit together really cleverly. My advice is just to except the internal 'logic' of the film at not think about it too much."

","Meh, this movie was only okay. It wasn't bad in any way, but it just failed to impress me. The concepts were a little darker and more sophisticated than the ones Hollywood usually features, but it wound up being just a superficial version of actually dark, interesting tales. It's also briefly and shockingly violent, but that comes in small doses and is mostly only shocking because it's surprising. The ending was also changed to be less shocking than it originally was, which makes a few previous comments and plot points not fit into the story as well. All in all, this movie is okay for mainstream audiences, but if you're looking for an intellectual, thought-provoking movie, this movie isn't really it."

","I was really apprehensive about Kutcher making a ""serious"" movie (if you can call it that). But he, and including most others, really did a good job emoting the characters.<br/><br/>I really love stories based on time travel, so I'm very picky when it comes to reviewing movies about them. I must admit, this movie wasn't as stupid or cheesy as it could have been. I thought the premise was very good, and the ending shows a side of true love that isn't always preferred in typical ""Hollywood"" romance type movies.<br/><br/>The ultimate sacrifice by both the son and the father has to be commended even though it's not really the most enjoyable part of the movie (or, with the father, not that obvious either).<br/><br/>All in all, a very tight little film, you'll definitely like it if you like the genre."

","This movie is about 3000 times better than it ought to be.

The plot, a form of the time travel/altering the future scenario, seems recycled but somehow fresh.<br/><br/>I was also quite surprised at how Ashton Kutcher handled his role. While most of the actors are quite solid, this is his movie (can't believe I wrote that sentence). Finally, the ending packs an emotional impact that is both valid and thought-provoking. Give it a shot if you missed it the first time around."

","My theory about this movie (the directors cut) is that while its clear the writers were experimenting with the chaos theory and time travel, etc. The movie is really about God, or some kind of force that watchs over us all and binds us all. At the end of the movie Evan ends up never existing in the first place, he was never born, so he was never able to influence all these peoples lives. But that is not nessacarily true, Evan saves all these people from all the worst events they could have happened to them and all the worst paths they could have taken. Even though Evan never existed he was watching over all of these people and sacrificing for them. So in a general sense, Evan represents a guardian angel, he represents everything that could have been."

That story was recently made into a time travel movie which is, unfortunately, not as good as the this movie. The short story, though, blows them both away. I checked the m=film's official website, and there is not one mention of the Title's origin. That's just not right.

Unfortunately i can only give away the basic plot, everything else would just ruin the movie: a young 7-year old boy is suffering from a disease, which causes him to black out from time to time, and he can't remember what happened, and the story is being told from his perspective, so we can only imagine what really happened. So the doctor recommends him to write a journal so later he could remember what happened, when he was out cold.<br/><br/>That's all i am gonna say, everything else would just spoil the movie, which is very intelligently guiding us to the inevitable truth...<br/><br/>To sum it up, the movie is very touching indeed, it starts fast and it just doesn't let up, i gave it 9/10."

","The 'butterfly effect' is a concept from meteorology, physics and chaos theory, similar to the term 'holistic': Basically, it's the idea that everything is interconnected, that you cannot change one part without affecting every other part as well, and that the effects of any particular change are impossible to predict. This is often praphrased as ""a butterfly flapping its wings may cause a storm on the other side of the world two weeks later"", hence the name 'the butterfly effect'.<br/><br/>In this movie, the main character discovers that he has the power to go back in time and make changes. He uses his newfound power to return to his childhood and fix some obvious wrongs, but soon discovers that the effect of such fixes can be very different from what one might imagine. It's a movie along the general theme of 'what would have happened if somebody had killed Hitler before WWII', but at a strictly personal level: Where would I and my friends be now if I had done this or that differently at some point in the past?<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much, because it explores a theme I have never seen before, neither on screen nor paper, because I think the movie's implicit message is true, and because it's a good story even if you ignore the 'buttefly effect' frame.<br/><br/>For the record: I definitely prefer the theatrical version to the director's cut. The differences are minor except for the ending, but the theatrical ending is vastly preferable. IMHO. <br/><br/>If you see the movie, enjoy. If not, it's your loss."

","This movie caught my eye because of the alternate paths, time travel types of themes I've enjoyed over the years. However this is not sci-fi tech time loop - the how/why is not central to the plot or critical to the film's impact. The film really reaches down the emotional level, examing how our decisions affect our lives, and tapping into the desire to go back and ""fix"" things. Here that desire is driven by the need to correct serious life events, which are presented with a level of intensity (I viewed the directors cut) that gives quite a dark and visceral ride. The consequences of these adjustments, and the ultimate resolution, really gets you thinking and goes beyond the typical Hollywood treatment. Note: Some scenes depict elements that, while sadly common enough growing up and ring true in the film, are rendered with such power that the R rating should be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, but not light entertainment."
"cbarrale","9","0","2","22 May 2005"," time travel and the human brain
","I think this movie was a great success, although there are many questions concerning the remembering of past blackouts, this movie left me thinking and agreeing with many of the consequent actions.<br/><br/>Even, the lead role, is a rare individual that has the power to recall on past actions and decisions ( time travel ) that he has made. His ability to use and control the full range of his brain, a feat in which no one on earth is capable of doing, or at least a feat that no one outside the walls of an insane asylum, can do. his ability allows him to change and alter what has happened, ultimately changing the life of himself as well as those around him that he loves. As for what this is supposed to share with the viewers is up for grabs, i believe that The Butterfly Effect offers the viewers the thought that even though we may be able to change the way in which we would act in certain situations, the effects will ultimately be ""good"" for some and consequently ""bad"" for others. I believe that for every action we ea faced with, the other consequent is the most extremely opposite of the original. THis movie offers a visual account of this thought as we had seen in Even going to jail, amy smarts character becoming a prostitute, and meth head. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, i believe in the ladder."

Sometimes we all say we wanna go back and change an event that happened, thinking our present or future will be better, and it just isn't the case sometimes. It's in the past for a reason! What's done is done! I'd recommend it if you haven't already seen it, it's got an appeal everyone can relate to, in the end we learn that changing one thing in your life, changes everything.

"Mr_PCM","9","0","2","10 April 2005"," Very surprising - Kutcher can make decent films?!
","And now, as a great man once said, for something completely different. Having seen the cast for The Butterfly Effect, I was rather reluctant to go and see it (Dude where's my car, Just Married, and the like i never saw as great cinema somehow!) but I was persuaded to watch it and am I glad I did! I was not expecting such an original and innovative film.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that Evan Treborn has had blackouts since he was young, and so has kept a diary to try and help him keep track. Years later when he's older he discovers that by re-reading the diary entries where he had blackouts he can return and fill in the gaps and attempt to change things - usually with unforeseen and some unfortunate consequences. As he shifts through alternative possible lives his situation radically changes, and he eventually he discovers that no matter what changes he makes to the timeline, it will cause devastating consequences for someone. The film is based on the philosophical premise that when a butterfly flaps its wings in New York, there's a thunderstorm in Tokyo, or some such thing, and it turns out to be a fascinating concept. This plot line leads to some superb unexpected and intriguing alternate realities, all very diverse, and make you wonder how things might have been different for you had you made some different choices.<br/><br/>Kutcher belies his previous work and proves he is an actor of some talent, and the supporting cast, including the beautiful Amy Smart (again with not very promising filmography - Road Trip anyone?) all prove their talent, as they in effect have to play a number of different characters - or at least the same basic characters but with radically different personalities.<br/><br/>The film keeps you guessing throughout and has some very surprising twists. It is a film I highly recommend watching, and even if you hate the usual Ashton Kutcher American Pie-type comedy, take heart for this is something completely different. It is worthy of buying but if possible try to get the Director's Cut. However, be warned - this Director's ending is rather grim and shocking, but somehow feels right in a weird sort of way, as it avoids the tired cliché Hollywood ending where it all turns out alright in the end. Overall an excellent and surprising film."

The other version, where Evan kills himself in the womb, is also a very good ending, as it ties in with his mothers previous stillborn children. But the mixture of Kayleighs marriage and Evans mother weeping is too much. Despite slight confusion, in both versions, i find it a very enjoyable film.

"FilmFlaneur","9","0","2","30 March 2005"," The Power of Narrative
","Amazingly, from the people who brought the world Final Destination 2 and the obscure Blunt comes The Butterfly Effect, a Donnie Darko-esque tale of time travel and rearranged reality, ending with a characteristic sense of loss. Common to the two films as well is the theme of child abuse, a dark undercurrent playing a more central role in Butterfly certainly, but which in both cases serves to anchor fantastic goings on elsewhere in a more brutal reality. Along with the more systematic arrangement of linear time by Memento, such films show a concern with the mechanics of storytelling rare in modern American cinema, and which reintroduce some avant garde techniques back into the mainstream.<br/><br/>Darko has his malevolent rabbit as the principal instigator of events, Kutcher has his journals. Both provide a way into different perspectives as time frames and points of view shift, at length providing the audience with an ambiguity that's intoxicating as much as it is exciting. But whereas Darko was more concerned with the personalised mechanics of a form of 'time travel', and impending disaster, what lies at the centre of Butterfly is slightly different. Bress and Gruber's film carries its heart a metaphor for the power of written and viewed narrative itself, in which ultimately the importance of the reading the 'text' is as significant as it was in the aforementioned Memento. <br/><br/>Kutcher's journals (or the old home movies he views) is the text here, which dictates the movement of the plot, readily changing perceptions and expectations. By accessing these documents, by revisiting stored events, the hero can alter and hopefully enrich his experiences - a vain hope, as it emerges. 'Just think of your mind as a movie, you can pause, rewind or slow down any details you want' he is told at one point. Projected on the screen of his unconscious, such reclaimed memories can overcome blackouts and even effect history. By focusing on such an implication, narrative in general - and cinema's primacy in particular - is affirmed."

The way the directors use the color ""miller red"" to show that something bad is going to happen is so creative and genius. The way they also use the color green to show that something about the institution is coming up is another brilliant thing. Another interesting thing i found out from the commentary is that when Evan is in his fraternity life, when he walks out with Kayleigh, the tree where Tommy dies, the directors had extras dressed in black. I also enjoyed the way the directors were so exact on how they wanted their cameras to show. Like in the beginning they use a still camera, but in the middle they started moving the cameras until the end where they were hand holding the cameras.

Then the rest of the movie is a series of time periods with Evan trying to undo the damage he's done in the previous time travel. Every time, he's going back for Kayleigh. There may be other reasons for traveling back, but the trips are mainly for Kayleigh. Evan loved Kayleigh so much, he would do anything to have her, and anything to keep her alive and safe, even if it meant taking his own life or never seeing her again. The end kept me hanging wondering what would happen to Evan and Kayleigh.

","Great time travel movie. That is the director's cut, not the theatrical version. After a youthful tragedy with friends, Ashton Kutcher's character discovers his lifelong blackouts do have a purpose in his life. When he finds he can go back in time, like his Dad did and is initially hospitalized for the insane, he tries to make things right concerning the tragedy. But everything goes wrong. When I saw it in the theater I thought, ""What's wrong with this movie? Somethings missing. It looks like they put on a happy end."" And, that's just what they did, therefore the theatrical version was not to hot. It didn't make much sense. But now that it's on DVD it's as the director meant. It has a darker ending, which is appropriate. It probably wouldn't have made as much money given the Ashton Kutcher crowd for which they were looking. When you get the DVD, watch the director's cut first, then watch the theatrical version and you'll see what I mean. The lesson I got from the movie was there can be great good in sacrifice. Although a darker ending, it was more inspiring and heartfelt."
"Bob M-3","9","0","2","13 March 2005"," Very fine film, with a few flaws
","Saw the film on disk last night, and must say I was pleasantly surprised. Clearly this story was given the green light after studio heads noticed how well Donnie Darko performed (eventualy). But in comparison, TBE is the lesser one. (spoilers start) For starters: the traumas and events portrayed are very simplistic. The reactions to the events being changed by Kutcher in the past are ludicrous. Hence: a young Kutcher telling his pedophile neighbor off in harsh words. Result: a stumbling pedophile and instantly cured and recovered!!! Also: the sadistic, almost Nazi-like little brother saves the woman and the baby. Result: he's seen the light and becomes a religious do-good-er!!!! These story-blibs make it a far less intelligent film as say Donnie Darko or Memento. But as for shear entertainment-value: it's great. The story unfolds nicely and if you don't think too hard about it it sort of makes sense. I saw the original ending, read about the DC ending. I must say both are pretty weak... It should have ended right after Kutcher is in the institute talking to his shrink who says: There are no journals, you've created a disease that isn't there! Brilliant ending and far more logical. (spoilers end)<br/><br/>But check it out anyway!<br/><br/>Bob"

","WOW! Great movie I didn't realize until now that Ashton Kutcher is such an great actor. The movie is absolutely fabulous...parallel universes and the power of the mind are the main guidelines in this movie...If you enjoyed ""memento"" or ""reservoir dogs"", ""the butterfly effect"" is a MUST. The only difference form the two above is that the history is being re-written through the entire movie. When watching this you should really try to establish what is true and what is pure fiction (from Evans's point of view)... The truth is that it is all about love. The main character Evan tempers with the past changing it an creating different future worlds...he final version of the ""present"" is the one in witch he never lived his one true love,but it is the only ""now"" that is closest to perfection... I only saw this one recently but I will definitely watch it again...."

","I've seen both versions of this film. The theatrical one with the happy ending just feels like ""it was only a bad dream and everything is OK"".That was good enough for simple entertainment at the movies. But the director's edition left me breathless, it's surprising the way that finale changed the film adding meaning and value to the story. In the directors finale, the main character makes the supreme sacrifice in order to get things fixed, especially the girl's chaotic life, and that gives him instantly the standard of a HERO as well as elevates the story quality. Like Eugene O'Neill said once "" there is more happiness in one tragic ending than in 1000 happy endings"""

"lambiepie-2","7","0","5","9 January 2005"," Coulda Been a Blockbuster
","The idea of this film was a great one...of altering ones past and seeing the repercussions of such actions if one could...and this film has a few parts in it that will make you believe that this could of been a ""great"" film, but it turns out to be just a so-so film. And to be honest, I keep wondering why.<br/><br/>First I thought it might be the star, Ashton Kutcher. I could see glimpses of good acting, and many chances missed for great acting. It might not be Ashton alone -- maybe it could be that he didn't posses the maturity to play the role, or he was directed to portray maturity in parts that needed it. Ashton is one of those actors that in about 10 years, will have a few roles where everyone will be shaking their heads and saying, ""Gee, I didn't know he was that great of an actor"". I can see that he will be, and maybe this is one of those films that could have waited until then.<br/><br/>But you cannot overlook Amy Smart. She is what absolutely makes this film watchable. Her performances are outstanding. But if I take my ""10 year"" rule for Ashton and away from Amy -- she would have never gotten this role and we would have missed out on seeing a good actress work. So in lies the dilemma.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" has likable performances in which many actors had a chance to 'shine' -- but at one point or another don't quite go all the way with it. Why? Is it the script? The direction? The Editing? The film financing? The ratings board? A combination? WHAT!?!?!<br/><br/>Honestly, I see this film ripe for a remake in the year 2025 and everyone will love it beyond belief while many of us will remark how THIS version had its moments."
"mwbubelah","8","0","2","9 January 2005"," Quite a movie to wrap one's brain around!
","Producing yet another time-travel alternative-reality film is always a sketchy proposition because so many movie-goers have seen so many of them over the years. But this is NOT a schlocky 1950's take on the genre, nor is it as sweet as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Instead, it is smartly written and engaging, most notably because it visually plays out the premise set forth in a Ray Bradbury short story some years ago: small changes in the past create big consequences in the future. In other words, going back in time and ""fixing"" things is not all that simple because of the myriad of chain reactions that those changes will produce.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Butterfly Effect,"" those reactions center around a boy suffering from blackouts who grows up to realize that he may be able to change the past in order to better the present. This involves altering the lead character's past with a little neighbor girl (who he has always loved), her sadistic brother and a neighbor boy who was unwittingly caught in the fallout caused by being their friends.<br/><br/>And with any good sci-fi, certain suspension-of-disbelief is required in order to appreciate what the writer/director is attempting. Sure, this film may have a plothole or two when it comes to fooling with timelines, but mostly, it deals with ramifications, interesting and thought-provoking ramifications of altering the past. And, yes, it has a complicated plot--most time-shift movies do--but that's part of the challenge and the enjoyment.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the dialogue is natural, the cinematography appealing, and the score unobtrusive but additive. Although I'm sure that many of us had doubts about Ashton Kutcher's ability to pull off a dramatic role, this film proved to be certainly within his grasp, and the other young actors also gave convincing performances throughout.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" may take two or three viewings to get its full effect, but it will be time well spent."

Believable as a child and as the adult Evan speaking through the child. Jesse James is chilling as Tommy at 13. Wouldn't want to meet this kid in a dark alley.

","I would like to comment on the Butterfly Effect. I have to say, I cried from the beginning to the end. I did not have a dry eye at anytime. I find the movie to be intense and therapeutic for victims of molestation. Victims have a way of putting trauma (of any kind) tucked away in a dark room and throw away the key....their lives are cursed and full of pain, unhappiness and struggles with relationships, career, family..etc. I have been struggling to write a book about my son, who was violently and brutally raped then left for dead at age 11with his best friend. He has struggled for 12 yrs now just to get up and live....he has attempted suicide...battled major depression which is related to the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is overlooked so often. My son was on a road to self destruction and could not figure out why...he had mentally forgotten the rape....after 12 yrs. and problems with the law he was put in the same cell with the guy who had taken his innocent soul..my son felt as if he was dreaming and felt as if he was having an out of body experience.....he attacked the predator..broke his jaw, knocked him unconscious....well..now he is able to face his demons and admit finally what has scarred him all these yrs.then even stranger..my son was locked up with the boy who was also raped by the predator and now have become friends again.this is only a small part of the healing process....I feel that this movie is fantastic and all victims should go see it, BUT must have therapy prearranged......Butterfly Effect is a 10 plus....Kevin Kinder is the sexual predator and is in prison for 60 yrs.... If you haven't seen the movie...go...go to the video store and rent it..you will not regret it, if you know a victim please tell them about the movie.....God Bless all and Oh my gosh....the writers....you are my hero....

I mean... a movie like this cannot be made perfectly self-consistent. There will always be holes in the plot, and they must be forgiven as long as the main plot line is locally-sound.

Don't be put off by the snobs, cinema is art (i like my fair share of art house and world cinema) but it is also mass entertainment and as such is intended for the layman, not an initiated few who can flex their vocabulary over something they were never prepared to like in the first place.

","The Butterfly Effect should grab and hold the interest of anyone who likes sci-fi, especially time travel and related themes. The viewer is introduced to the main characters through a series of seemingly disjointed action segments, mostly featuring seven year old Evan and his companions Kayleigh, Tommy, and eventually Lennie. The dark side theme is most evident in Tommy, a demonically vicious kid who rules the other three as the film segues into their 13-years-old phase. Some of the acting is a little weak, but the overall quality of the production makes for a fascinating and tortuous ride. This flick contains some themes that aren't really appropriate for viewers in the seven-to-thirteen year old range...which imputes a conflict.

The idea of destroying the memories to recreate them showed how prepared the screenplayer was, how disposed to involve us he was. And the story really involves; it makes us not to take the eyes out from the screen, or we may lose something important. The basis of the screenplay is scary; it made me to think I have no control about some moments on my life. I ask myself what could have happened if I avoid something, but things could have got worse. I'll never know, and that's the most exciting thing on that. The mystery element. The end was specially sad, but it was real enough to makes to believe things could have worked that way.

","After viewing a few comments, I decided that I should add in my own opinion.<br/><br/>First of all, those who considered it to be a headache are probably correct in that sense, but that is only because it is thought provoking. One who does not immediately blow off one fact they don't quite understand will typically not enjoy the movie because they did not stick around thought-wise long enough to find out what really happened or what caused it.<br/><br/>As for the movie having seemingly 'nothing to do' with the Butterfly Effect theory, think of it as this. A butterfly is pure and doesn't do anything with crude intentions, and only lives it's life as it's supposed to. Evan, played by Ashton, as a normal boy trying to live his life and 'flap his wings' in his own accordance was enveloped by the 'wind', or hardships in his life, that caused an all out hurricane or chaotic future for him as well as others. Many think that the Chaos Theory should have more to do with all-around hardships that his actions would cause, like if he hadn't done this a war or huge conflict should've broken out world wide. Yet, every time he changed something, several lives were destroyed in the process. Call this a meager thing, but isn't the death or destruction of human life enough to be classified as a 'hurricane' in Evan's life? The actual Butterfly Effect theory in general is purely symbolism that takes at least a moments thought to conjure up.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I thought it was one of the best ones of the year. I'm not saying I'm much of an intellectual, but I enjoy thought provoking films that may take moments after the movie to come together completely. Many enjoyed the Sixth Sense, and it provoked thought towards the end about it's climax, and anyone who enjoyed loose ends being tied in such a manner would feel that emotion throughout Butterfly Effect. I'd have to say it is quite original in this sense and it makes you think about just what little act can cause a cataclysmic chain of events.<br/><br/>I would also like to comment that the acting by Ashton Kutcher was extremely impressive as he went from being a hit comedy actor to a purely dramatic actor. It may feel like a long shot from fans of his usual comedic work, but his performance was purely breathtaking.<br/><br/>It never hurts to take a chance and see what you can truly enjoy."
"adam-532","10","0","2","5 November 2004"," A number of good ideas that have never been seen before, let alone together in one good film
","A film I would place as the best of the year if you enjoy thought provoking films; especially those that don't stray too far into the 'background reading required' areas of Donnie Darko and the like. The film is best watched with no prior knowledge of the plot, so don't read the posts about it on this site before you watch it, if you haven't already. So, without spoiling the film for anyone who's not yet seen it, The Butterfly Effect is one of those truly engaging films that convincingly takes you a long way from your seat as it runs its course, further away from where you join it than any other I can think of, in fact. It is also an innovative and intelligent -if not quite technically (read: nit-picking-ly) flawless- use of a now-hackneyed plot device (don't cringe): time travel.<br/><br/>So as to leave the discovery of the film open to anyone planning to watch it, I won't go into how time travel is rescued from the stainless steel crass-ness of TimeCop, Back to the Future, Austin Powers (albeit satirically), et al; suffice to say, that it is, and as a physicist, and ex psychology and philosophy student, I loved how it was done enough to register here just to post this.<br/><br/>enjoy"

","The Butterfly Effect is awesome! I personally believe that Ashton did a wonderful job as a serious actor. I don't see why there are any negative comments at all! Some people try too hard to see that the movie truly complements its title. True...the title may lead some to believe that the movie is more in depth on the chaos theory than it actually is. But the movie should not be criticized for that because in reality the movie wasn't made to give a ""report"" on the theory, but rather to show visually what effects can come from such seemingly insignificant decisions, while at the same time be entertaining and touching. The point of the movie isn't to make you fully understand the chaos theory....it is meant to highlight the very basis of what it is. The movie is to make people stop and think...and wonder...and become more interested in the whole ""chaos theory"". I mean come on...people don't rent movies so that they can understand how things work, they rent them to enjoy....I bought the movie the first day it came out because when i saw it in theaters....I loved it!

Amy Smart looks good especially during the frat scenes, she even has the chance to show off her acting skills in a later scene when she plays a crack whore but isn't very convincing. It seems as though some studio head watched Donnie Darko, and thought, ""WOW, we haven't made a teen angst time travel movie"", but it doesn't have the replayability that Donnie Darko has, doesn't have the soundtrack, and has no interesting characters.

The ending left a deep impression on me and the movie as a whole made me think about the decisions in life I make all the time. What would I change If I could go back to the past, I have some deep regrets, some that cut quite deep. If I changed them, would my life be better? Could I repair the harm I did to others? I think that most of us want to be heroes and the greatest heroism is self-sacrifice, clearly illustrated in the director's cut.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that I watched this movie expecting not to like it, I was biased toward it based on all the negative reviews I had seen.

","I have always seen something more from Ashton Kutcher beyond his role on ""That 70's Show"" and his enumerable appearances in absolutely awful films. I knew he had something more in him, and ""The Butterfly Effect"" has got to be the proof. It's a psychological thriller, it's a sci-fi/horror film, but more than anything it's a gritty drama. It deals with a lot of subject matter that would make many audiences squirm, due to its realistic nature. Considering the following of Kutcher based on his two TV shows, his films, and his highly publicized romance, it's really exciting to think of that group of people watching this film. Surprise!!<br/><br/>I have seen both the original theatrical version and the directors' cut of the film. I have to say that it's really a toss-up as to which is better. One is ultimately a more personal story than the other, but not to the discredit of the other version. I was a skeptic going in (not based on Kutcher, but on the material I saw in the trailers), but I really thoroughly enjoyed this film. Well worth your time."

","OK, I watched this movie in the cinema earlier this year and I quite liked it.<br/><br/>I had heard from the critics, etc, that they didn't think it was a good movie, so I wasn't expecting much.<br/><br/>It's the story of a young man who has been having black outs all his life and discovers in college that he can go back to these parts of his life and change things by reading over the events in his journal. And let me tell you, this kid has had a very eventful life all in all.<br/><br/>Now, here we have your basic time-travel / time changing story - it was well played as a theatrical release, about the right length and the actors were good, especially the usually comical Ashton Kutcher.<br/><br/>Then I made the DIRE and DREADFUL mistake of watching the director's cut - which may as well be a different movie altogether as it TOTALLY SUCKS. I don't know what the director was thinking when he added the extra parts he felt needed to be in the movie - including a ludicrous visit to a crystal ball toting clairvoyant who proclaims ""you have no life line"" in a scene that is completely ridiculous, pointless and adds nothing to the original movie.<br/><br/>Then there is the ending, which is completely different to the theatrical release - in the cinema version the main character finally ""gets"" that he can't play God, he puts things to rights and then he gets on with his life, and lets the woman he will always love have her life. It's not the best ending, but it's tidy and it works for the audience, it doesn't leave the audience disappointed.<br/><br/>The director's cut made me realize that some movie directors are obviously meglomaniacal idiots, completely full of their own importance, because the revised ending is stupid beyond belief. I mean, in the movie we are expected to suspend disbelief and believe that the character can re-read his journals and go back in time to change things at those points when he had blackouts etc - we manage to do that. But to expect a person with an ACTUAL BRAIN to believe the revised ending is dumb, dumb, DUMB.<br/><br/>COMPLETE SPOILER for the director's cut ending - does he go back in time to stop himself from becoming friends with the girl, and therefore save them all a lot of heartache - NO - he goes back to the WOMB (yes, the fricking womb!), and makes sure he was never born in the first place. Oh yeah, that's believable, that makes sense - no it doesn't, it makes a mockery of the entire plot and expects the audience to just accept something that is so totally beyond comprehension that it cannot be accepted.<br/><br/>Shame on the director for having an ego the size of a small country - did he even go to film school at all, because this ending is so bad, you'd think it was a first year film student writing his first screenplay and one who didn't really know how to end it, so made a terrible rookie mistake.<br/><br/>Don't watch the director's cut - watch the theatrical version, it is more cohesive and you will be less irritated in the long run.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 - for the cinema version only.<br/><br/>(If I were rating the director's cut it would only get a 3 out of 10.)"

","When I went into to The Butterfly Effect, I wasn't sure what to expect. I actually had never heard of the movie until my sister said something about Aston Kutcher being in a Time Traveling movie. Perplexed at the thought, I decided to risk it and see for myself what this was about.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that The Butterfly Effect is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It was well acted, written, directed, and it actually made you think about what the characters were doing and how they reacted. It's one of the few movies where I actually didn't want it to end, that's how involved I was becoming in the alternate lives Kutcher was creating for his friends..... And for himself. I actually cared what happened to him and the rest of the characters, always wondering what would happen after Kutcher changed one aspect of the plot's history after another.<br/><br/>The aspect of the story that captured me the most was how well the co-stars were able to act in their alternate lives. If Amy Smart, Elden Hensen, and William Scott Lee failed to show how their characters were effected by actions of Kutcher then the whole movie would have failed. Like Cold Mountain, it was the supporting cast that helped make this movie. <br/><br/>Another aspect that made the movie succeed was the fact that it stayed true to the idea of ""change one thing, change everything"". Even the most minor detail, or should I say Kutcher's lack of thought of what his next plan to save his friends would be, only caused more problems for the very people he cared the most about. <br/><br/>Honestly, this is one of the best movies I have seen in the theaters, and the only one I was waiting to buy once it came out on DVD."

At first I thought it was going to be some ordinary thriller with Ashton Kutcher (even tho he usually does comedy), but boy, was I proved wrong.<br/><br/>The story is about Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) who throughout his childhood experiences a number of memory blackouts. We get to follow him and his friends throughout various incidents. His mother encourages him to keep a diary, in order to help him remember what he's done. When Evan finally grows up he is studying the human psyche at College, but still hasn't figured out what gave him blackouts as a kid, or what happened during them. But when he one night picks up his old diary and starts to read through them, he finds that he can almost remember what happened.. Or can he?<br/><br/>He contacts his old friends from his childhood, in order to sort things out and help him remember, but it appears that they all lead poor lives, and are unwilling to help him. Evan tries to find a way to help his friends and goes back to his diary. During one of these readings, he finds that he can actually go back to the time of his blackouts, and change the course of history. Every time he wakes up, his life is different, and also better than it was before. Or is it?<br/><br/>The film is so absolutely stunning and thrilling. As I sat through it I was constantly surprised and eager to know what would happen next. It turns out Ashton Kutcher can actually play in a drama, and he made me really like his character, Evan. All of the other actors in this film (Amy Smart, among others) do their job well. Which is good, because the center of this film is the characters. How they develop, how they change, how they act etc. etc. Very good stuff.<br/><br/>The way the story is built up is almost the best about this film, however. Different spins on things etc. etc. It really makes the flick. Along with that, the directors really outdid themselves, and they are aided with an excellent score.

The best popular illustration of the principle came from a sci fi tale by, I believe, Ray Bradbury, in which a future time traveler goes back to the dinosaur age, breaches protocol by stepping out of a restricted area, accidentally kills an insect, and is stuck in the past as human civilization (& his time machine) never happens.<br/><br/>In the film of the same name TV pretty boy Ashton Kutcher portrays wannabe genius (or psychotic?) Evan Treborn, who has supposedly inherited time-tripping powers from his insane father. His life, at 20, is bad. The love of his life- Kayleigh Miller (played by Amy Smart)- kills herself one night after he returns to his hometown to find out about their past- which includes starring in a child porno film, murdering a mother and her baby, roasting a dog alive, etc. She cannot take it. Grief-stricken, Evan reads his journals & changes time. He goes back to a moment in childhood and when he wakens Kayleigh is his college lover, a member of a sorority, but they are stalked by her psycho brother- Tommy Miller (William Leigh Scott)- who was a psycho originally, but now is worse. He attacks Evan, who fights back and kills him. Kayleigh turns on him and Evan is imprisoned for murder- despite evidence of stalking and vandalism that would have easily cleared Evan as using self defense. After convincing a con that he is Jesus (for his time changing) he wills himself out of that timeline and in to another. But no matter the permutation someone he cares about is in really bad shape. In one version Kayleigh is a drug-addled hooker, in another Lenny Kagan (Elden Henson)- a childhood pal- ends up insane for he murders Tommy to protect Evan and his dog from Tommy's madness, in another Evan loses his arms and is paralyzed, rushing to protect a mother and child from a blockbuster the 4 young pals have planted in a mailbox. This results in Lenny and Kayleigh becoming lovers, psycho Tommy becoming a Born Again Christian, and Evan's mom Andrea (Melora Walters) becoming an emphysemic due to chain-smoking her miseries away over Evan's paraplegia. On and on Evan tries.<br/><br/>After a series of early scenes in which we unexpectedly see Evan blacking out, we later find out these are the times when his later self has re-entered his form to 'change' things. One time it's to rebuke Kayleigh's and Tommy's father, George, as he's trying to get the kids to star in a porno film. The film has logical inconsistencies mostly due to time travel (but more frustratingly those dealing with the assumption that Evan is nuts as a boy merely because he draws a murderous picture- any comic book loving boy draws that and far worse!), but more importantly just too much hammy acting. Kutcher is way out of his league- as the boneheaded hunk Kelso on That 70s Show he's OK, but his lack of serious acting chops shows. At times the script seems to be dead earnest and at others comic- mostly due to Kutcher's inability to react with emotional awareness. Still, the situations are so relentlessly downbeat that when the comic elements arise (mostly unintendedly) I was laughing at the characters, not with them. The best performance comes from Amy Smart who brings an ethereal presence to her roles as Kayleigh- whether hooker or sorority queen she's fascinating to watch for she's one of the few stunningly beautiful actresses I've seen in a film who do not rely on merely being beautiful to enthrall the audience. Her face and eyes can act- not just look lovely. The rest of the cast is good to solid.<br/><br/>Some people will carp over the 'science'- wondering why does a single thing only effect the same few people in Evan's life. Why, as example, is he not a doctor- happily married with 3 kids in any of them? The reason is probably contingency- that nothing happens in a vacuum. Not all changes will have profound effects. A little change may bring grave consequences while a seemingly huge one alters little. Contingency is more aptly shown in larger ways. For example, without Edison a Tesla or some other inventor would have invented incandescent lighting within a few years after he did. The difference would be an entry in a textbook. Precious few things are without trends or precedents. Perhaps Evan had a desire to stay connected with his youth that almost always led him to have the same pals in many lives? I doubt the makers of this film know or understand that concept since they apply a comic book like approach to the script without either graphic novel seriousness, nor comic book whimsy.<br/><br/>Another objection is why can Evan recall things from lifetimes he's wiped out? Or why does, in one timeline, Mr. Miller recall an instance of Evan's timetripping in another timeline that has been erased? For me it's obvious that the titular idea is used as mere contrivance to tell a tale. A bolder film would not necessarily have been one that was more logical, but one whose implications were far more grand. What if Evan had been that Bradburian time traveler? Or willed himself back to the classic 'Hitler as a baby' predicament? What if he killed the young Hitler? What if he assassinated George Washington? Then, again, it's not fair to review a film that was not.<br/><br/>Kudos to this film for at least trying, though. It's not nearly as bad as most critics make out, but it could have been much more. My wife originally wanted to see the Ben Stiller-Jennifer Aniston film Along Came Polly, but I said I'd rather see a film that fails by breaking formulae than succeeds by following it. A Pyrrhic victory, perhaps. Writers and directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber cannot be faulted for trying, but their visual style is too melodramatic, as is their story.<br/><br/>The similarly-themed The Lathe Of Heaven was made into a very effective PBS film 25 years earlier with minimal effects and a far better story. That tale succeeded by letting us know, in the end, that the tale was the last moment death dream of a nuclear war victim. This film suffers because we never quite know whether this is all in Evan's head- a more rich film would have tried it, or a sci fi/fantasy- which should have been more adventurous. Not letting us know could have only worked were the script, acting, and visuals more intriguing- merely shaking the camera and having the journal's letters jumble just bores. Not to mention that, for a genius, Evan is a dolt. In one of the time trips he returns to light the blockbuster that killed a mother and child in one reality, nbut now waves it at the pedophilic Mr. Miller, and winds up killing his true love. And he does this as the adult Evan in control of his child's body! That geniuses do stupid s**t like this is a far bigger flaw in the script than any time travel continuity issues.<br/><br/>Still, the ending and last time jump eschew a Hollywood ending as Evan returns to the first time he met Kayleigh and scares her in to never being his friend. Years later- at 28- the 2 are successful New York professionals, pass each other on the street, look, but keep on walking. This ability to sidestep convention augurs potential for the duo, for not caving in to the expected and ending the film ala It's a Wonderful Life. Amy Smart has all the makings of future stardom, but Ashton Kutcher is probably doomed to a future in reality TV as a former TV star. If that's the future he faces he can always avenge his legacy and screw the rest of us by stepping on another insect- just for spite."

","The DIRECTOR'S CUT has the worst message I've ever seen offered up in a movie whose lead actor is a VERY popular teen idol. READER BEWARE -- THIS WHOLE THING IS A SPOILER: Essentially, the director's cut is the story of the family classic starring Jimmy Stewart ""It's A Wonderful Life"" but with the opposite message: What if I were never born? -- The world would be MUCH better off without me! Now I don't want to quash anybody's artistic vision, but come on, exercise a little responsibility: particularly the star/executive producer: Ashton Kutcher. While the idea that in his final jump through time (in an effort to set things right) he commits suicide in the womb of his mother before he is even born is indeed intriguing, it has very little merit presented in this format. Kutcher's character is not a monster. This isn't as if Hitler developed a conscience and tried to go back in time to write his wrongs only ultimately to commit suicide as a final solution to prevent his unfathomable crimes. Kutcher and his friends are very much like average everyday kids, facing the tragedies that many kids do today, in fact some of the things that happen in Kutcher's alternate universes are milder than the problems faced by many kids today. For Kutcher to ultimately take himself out of the equation to solve the problems he thinks he created shows how poorly thought out the decision was to release the director's cut version BECAUSE even though this movie carries an R rating, once the DVD hits the shelves, Ashton's many teen fans are going to have access to it ""R"" rating or otherwise. Some of these kids are asking themselves the very question about how important they are to the world every day, some even by the hour and here is a movie made by their celebrity peer Ashton Kutcher that says: the world would be better off without me. It's bad enough that the movie chooses this option, but where the MOST EGREGIOUS ERROR IN Judgment happens is showing just how rosy the world actually is without Kutcher. Everyone is shown to be enormously happy without Kutcher in their lives. THIS IS JUST WRONG. Life just isn't like that. To present it in this manner says, if your life isn't perfect, then the world would be better off without you. It denigrates Kutcher's self worth and anyone who finds themselves in the same boat. I have no problem with the overall message of the film: don't spend your life regretting the decisions you made in the past because you can't change them and even if you did make a different decision, things might not be any different. It even supports the positive message that we must all find peace and happiness in what ""is"" and forget what might have been. BUT AS A DEPRESSED TEENAGER (or adult for that matter), That message is quickly forgotten in the last 10 minutes of the director's cut where we are told point blank: if you don't like your life it's probably because of you and everyone else would be better off without you -- so DO THE RIGHT THING AND KILL YOURSELF. It's a message that is hard to overcome after such a dark journey. So next time Hollywood, let's exercise a little social responsibility and put a lid on the ""artistic freedom"" argument and don't make a movie with a major celebrity who assures a substantial teen audience with a message that doesn't do anyone any favors."

","I am not trying to offend anyone who really enjoyed this film, but I just kept wanting to turn it off. It was great acting and it was very well done, but it was one of the most disturbing things I have seen in a long time. For those of you who are thinking about seeing this film, think about what you really want to see. It has an extreme amount of language, which didn't quite bother me as much considering i thought the people had a reason to use it, but also it had a lot of really disturbing scenes and topics. Right from the get go the movie introduces you to the problems of the main character, he lives in a single parent home, due to the fact that his father is crazy (or is he?) and locked up in a psych ward. We also learn that, as a young 7 year old, the main character has been showing some signs of inheriting his father's problems, which, ultimately, he is. I just wanted to warn you, because I would have appreciated a warning before I was disturbed by this movie."

It's got enough to keep most people going, a few small laughs and things people of the university age can relate too, and something everyone can relate too about events in ones childhood and love and loss.<br/><br/>its a very good teen movie, and the best film i can recommend renting at the moment."

","I saw the theatrical version of this film and I thought it was amazing. I love movies that are unique and thought provoking and this was one of the best to fit that description.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I think one of the most wonderful things about the film was seeing how much Evan fell more in love with Kayleigh with every new sequence of memories. The part of the movie where he met the strung-out Kayleigh and explained that she was happy with him once was really great. I wondered if he would still feel the same, but it was very touching.<br/><br/>The violence in the movie was perfectly used to illustrate situations without being gratuitous. The issue of child abuse was portrayed tactfully as well.<br/><br/>Amy Smart and Ashton Kutcher gave wonderful performances, as did the rest of the cast. I think Kutcher did a great job... I was never a regular viewer of his sitcom, so I was pretty open minded to his performance. He was stellar and I can't wait to see more serious work from him."

But if you really look carefully you'll get the picture at the end. It gets confusing sometimes, with all the different stories and all, but at the end the satisfaction is complete. <br/><br/>the interesting thing it it really makes you wonder if you had the chance, what would you change in your life and what will also change without your knowledge.... and is it really worth the effort.<br/><br/>to say the truth, I thought a lot after seeing the movie...I wanted to know where each one of his reactions and the signs he makes comes from...

","What if....<br/><br/>You know, most movies coming out of Hollywood these days are regurgitated stories, based upon older ideas, given barely a new twist. No one seems to ask ""What If..?"" anymore.<br/><br/>Not so this.<br/><br/>What if...A man finds he can change the fabric of his universe within the shell of the multiverse, merely by affecting the memories of his childhood? Fantastic stuff. <br/><br/>Without giving ANYTHING at all away...others have already done that to death... I will say that the performances were top notch, especially the 7 year old Eric (Logan Lerman) and the 13 year old Tommy (Jesse James). The make up effects were spot on, and the direction for the most part was white knuckle stuff. Oh...and the music was BRILLIANT...the final song, by Oasis, sent shivers up my spine.<br/><br/>I kind of get the feeling though, that there was more to the story than actually appeared on the screen. As is true in any movie endeavour, so much ends up on the cutting room floor, that sometimes the entire picture isn't always clear. And, I also feel that the directors, Gruber and Bress, may very well have allowed the higher ups in the Hollywood Film Factory to dictate the ending. A little bit...well...of a cop out really...<br/><br/>Very few movies recently have made me actually WANT to write about them, let alone actually do it.<br/><br/>I think that Gruber and Blunt may very well have as interesting a career as M. Night Shyamalan should they keep up this standard of work."

","Directors/writers Eric Bress and J Mackye Gruber present a thoughtful well written film that deals with an extremely complicated topic of the chaos theory. Exploring the question of actions and its effects over the years by playing with the notion of changing these actions from the future, this film provides a shocking at times and ultimately interesting look into the human psyche. Providing vivid an interesting glimpse into psychosis as well as deviant behavior, exploring sex, violent and abuse, this film leaves a lasting impression. The only problem with the film is the original theatrical ending. The ""Director's Cut"" now available on DVD has the original ending, which makes a lot more sense than the artificial close that was decided on by the studio. Ultimately the original ending is very fitting* and closes the story much better. It's best to watch this version first."

","I watched this movie the other night and I thought it was very good, but not perfect as one reviewer said... <br/><br/>Some explanation first...<br/><br/>What I noticed is that this movie is set about 6 years in the future, probably from about 2002 or 2003, so that makes it about 2010 when you round up in the scenes where Evan is in college. What I am using for a reference is when Evan and his friends are about 13 years old there are several clues that this is set in the present... Evan wearing a Chopper's shirt... Music clues... When I first saw that Evan was wearing a Chopper's shirt I thought that it was a mistake, until I realized that it was the present and not sometime in the 80's.<br/><br/>Okay, now jump to ""the college years."" At some point Evan calls someone and they have to ask ""who is it?"" Well, since this is set several years in the future, don't you think that just about everyone would have some sort of caller-id? It is hard now to buy a new phone that doesn't have the caller-id feature, and while some homes will continue to use old phones (my grandmother still uses a rotary phone that she has had since the 1970's), most phones should have some kind of caller id functionality."

"mikesagan","10","0","2","12 September 2004"," An enormously difficult concept made accessible
","I was moved by this movie in ways that few films have moved me in the past. I was disgusted, sickened, horrified, saddened, and then just when I thought that my pulse could quicken no further, shocked by an ending I did not see coming. This movie is something that anybody with an interest in what would happen if we could return to significant points in our past and change them, whether it be legitimate or simply morbid curiosity, will think twice in the future as they mumble to themselves, ""I wish I would have...""<br/><br/>I think the most effective aspect of this film is that it tackles an enormously difficult concept, that being the desire to affect the continuum of time, something everyone has wished he could do at some point in his life, and makes it accessible to even the most lay individual. I am that lay individual. I know nothing of quantum mechanics, and I understand little of that which binds space and time. However, I have always been fascinated by the concept of the Butterfly Effect without ever knowing that there was a term for it. This movie, though I wish I could have read it in novel form, has provided perhaps the most vivid, and tragically most accurate portrayal of not only what I believe to be the outcome of tinkering with the timeline, but what happens to children when they are forced to live in a horrible environment.<br/><br/>As a high school Teacher, I know more than my fair share of Tommies and Kayleighs, and watching the tragedy unfold before my eyes in ways I had only imagined before was nearly more than I could bear. So much so that I felt compelled to research the movie to see if there was a novel, and what I found sickened me more than the movie itself.<br/><br/>I am not a disagreeable person, and I neither look for nor participate in bickering, but I must respond to what George Parker said about this movie in the hopes of helping him see beyond the jaded veil through which he seems to watch movies. Counting the number upon which he has commented, I am obviously nothing more than a rank ameteur compared to him, but I believe I have something positive to offer him, and anybody else inclined to see this movie.<br/><br/>The ""'Unadulterated'"" crap, and ""huge helpings of gratuitous garbage"" this movie shows is far from that. Yes, it would seem gratuitous as this appears to be the formulaic way in which Hollywood attempts to capture audiences. But this is far from the typical ""oh my God, did you see that,"" followed by the inevitable, ""gads, that movie sucked!"" The ""gratuitous garbage,"" ""pedophelia, animal cruelty, sex, nudity, frat hazing, car trashing, prison fights, insane ravings, (and) countless excuses to use the 'F' word"" are all, tragically, exactly what many children and adults experience, every single day. I know! I deal with these kids! I have seen it! It is sick, and it makes you want to scream until your trachea splits, but it is reality nonetheless. And though you found it to be ""sensationalistic crap,"" that crap was there to clearly prove a point, that being the concept of the Butterfly Effect, which, after all, is what this movie was about. <br/><br/>So, try not to judge movies such as this simply upon the epithelial layer many ""tag-line"" critics analyze in order to judge films, but instead view it as an exploration into a deep concept. Try to understand that if Evan had grown in a typical, safe suburban neighborhood, where nothing bad ever happens, and Steven Spielberg could not have scripted more perfection, then the movie would have had nothing to work with, and you would have been criticizing the fact that the writing was childish, and lacking imagination.<br/><br/>Analyze it based upon its thesis, and whether or not it was thoroughly analyzed and explored. I believe this film did just that."

","[Possible Spoiler] The Butterfly Effect is built on an entirely false premise: the assumption that the outcome of a person's life is determined more by what events befall him was opposed to his character. If you adhere to the opinion that the decisions you make in your life are not as important as the reasons WHY you make those decisions (i.e. character), the foundation on which the obvious fiction that drives this film is built falls apart. Though I can suspend judgment to believe in ""The Butterfly Effect,"" the theory that an extremely small changes to the past can have major impact over time (re-read H.G. Wells's Time Machine for the sci-fi origin of this idea), I can't accept that people who are inherently non-violent will commit acts of violence simply because they have a weapon in their hands, or that basically well-adjusted people can be said to automatically become mentally unstable because of events in their past. I give the human spirit more credit than this film writers do.

This movie is about life, about people, about each and everyone of us who has ever loved someone or something and lost that love and as is so natural that we wished and wanted to get it back, to make it right. Forget the graphic details, Tarantino-esque plot contributions, the basis of the whole film comes down to a person doing whatever they can in their power (albeit embodied with imaginary powers) to do good and make things better for all ( a universal sentiment) **almost** without regards to their own well being. I say almost because if that surmise was true then the film would have stopped ***SPOILER** don't read this if you still haven't seen the movie ** when Kutcher came back as the cripple. You have to give the film credit for showing a true side of human nature, because Kutcher was not satisfied at seeing his love with someone else and little future for himself (although the film offered his mothers condition as the reason for his last move). I say it was more because he wanted to see his true love take another direction besides that what happened when he was crippled, because it was too painful to be so close to him. The ending sums it up, it gives the impression that hope still persists, as well as a plot for a part two.<br/><br/>May have benefited from a little better acting but overall wasn't bad, the average is 7.4 I think I can go along with that. This isn't a movie for you to second guess the forensics of, the message is deeper and more bonded to the human condition. Looking for perfect answers and rationalizations will not satisfy you, look more to your emotions."

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br/><br/>The Butterfly Effect is a really good thriller. It has a fantasy/sci-fi/time travel theme that works well with the premise of the film.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Ashton Kutcher did a commendable job of playing the confused twenty something trying to set things right. Normally, most cannot stand his childish prank behaviour, but the guy may have a career in the movies if he picks the right scripts. As he did so in the Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>Don't expect a teen movie...the material in this flick is dark yet engaging. The R rating is well deserved....The directors cut on the DVD is very bold and stays true to the theme of the flick...I would definitely recommend the directors cut. <br/><br/>Plot holes aside, the movie does grip you after the first 30 minutes of back story which involves the atrocities perpetrated by and against the stars of the film as youngsters....AFter Ashton begins his blackouts the film does not let up (save for the college scenes)....A great play on time travel, psycho-analysis and chaos theory....and again the end on the directors cut is one of the best endings to a thriller in years.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend a DVD rental."
"captain42","Null","0","2","4 September 2004"," Taxing but Worthwhile
","I saw this movie with little expectation. Judging Ashton Kutcher's past roles I did not really think he could 'act' as such, but rather just look goofy and make funny sounds. This movie has changed my view on Kutcher, as he does a fantastic job in portraying his character Evan. The Butterfly Effect is not a movie to watch merely to forget about one's week for 2 hours as it deals with many confronting things- incest, pedophilia, violence, drugs... the list goes on. The movie will leave you emotionally exhausted as you ponder what it means. The idea behind the chaos theory is illustrated very well throughout the movie, as we are shown Evan's transition from each life he lives. Whatever he changes in his past will change his future dramatically. Ashton's change from character to character is almost heart-rending, as he finds that what at first is sweet always turns sour somehow. He must choose who will pay for anothers happiness. With a very deep message played throughout the movie, viewers must question the themes brought up. What is so impacting about this movie is the fact that everyone would have wished at some stage or other to change their pasts, be it in a big or small way. I gave Ashton Kutcher a chance to show he can act- his abilities blew me away. I was skeptical when I walked into the theatre, but Kutcher did not disappoint, moving from his 'Dude Where's my Car' shallowness, into a deep, tortured and moving role. This movie is emotionally taxing, leaving a mark on the viewer for several days afterwards. A heartbreaking story is The Butterfly Effect, and because it questions the meaning of life, the importance of tiny events- it is very taxing, emotionally especially because you will walk out of the theatre with numbed consciousness and tears in your eyes, conscious of how your every action has concequences, along with considering your course of action were you in Evan's position See this movie- even if you are skeptical about Kutcher, give him a chance, it is very much worth it."

The type of person you ended up becoming... would you have gone a different way, chosen a different path or career and what about the people you would or wouldn't meet because of this change?<br/><br/>This movie gets me thinking how one completely unrelated thing could affect others and how anyone could go good or bad depending on circumstances.<br/><br/>And Ashton did a good job - pick him apart all you want, I have seen big name actors do worse than he did.

","I went to see ""The Butterfly Effect"" with few expectations and, to be honest, the one expectation I had was rather low. Could Ashton act ? The answer is a surprising YES, and the movie is far superior than one might expect.<br/><br/>Not only is this movie well written (with a screenplay far more original than I thought it would be), but the directing is clever and delivers some pretty good thrills. I was often scared and actually did care about the characters, which is not really something you might expect from a teen thriller movie. And it's not just that : ""The Butterfly Effect"" is at times moving and also has its funny moments. The supporting cast is good too : Amy Smart does an excellent job portraying different versions of the same girl, according to the way events happen.<br/><br/>I guess ""The Butterfly Effect"" will become one of those overlooked movies that gain cult status as years go by..."

Hearing about The Butterfly Effect brought the question to my mind that was brought to everyone elses...<br/><br/>Is Ashton Kutcher capable of a serious role?<br/><br/>I was skeptical like many others, and I am here to say that I think he pulled it off quite well.

"nyourhead","10","0","2","24 August 2004"," Mediocre minds may not fully appreciate this film.
","The Butterfly Effect is written in such a way that to fully understand the ideology behind the film you must have a working concept of quantum theory. If you think that Evan is having these blackouts as a child because of anxiety, or a way to cope with the stresses of the situations, you are mistaken. In the future Evan takes control of those situations and because of that future timeline event, it changes his perception of the past so he does not remember what happened in the past because his future alterations take place. This concept very poorly implemented in the Back to the Future series, constructs the basis of the film. I thought it was a well thought out film delving into this concept, and smoothly executed with twists and turns to keep the viewer thinking during the entire film."

","I rented this movie in the directors cut edition with very low expectations. After all the the main part was for Ashton Kutcher of infamous just married and punk'ed fame.. both outings are pretty high on my crap list.<br/><br/>However after seeing this movie I stand corrected. I still don't like Ashton but the story in this movie is so compelling that you swiftly forget that what he has made in the past. Within 10 minutes you will be absorbed into the story, the excessive amount of violence and some real shockers. I have seen a lot of time traveling movies, most of them aren't very good but this one takes a different and intelligent turn.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie for people looking for a light hearted story though; throughout the whole movie you are battered with disturbing images where the excessive violence by and to children is note worthy. Combine this with the fact that every change the main character makes in the past turns out well...not all to positive.<br/><br/>The directors cut ending gives the viewer the final blow and leads basically to a very sad conclusion which gives the word doomed a whole new meaning.<br/><br/>Somehow the movie reminded me of Imposter, not many people saw that movie which is a shame but it had the same last blow ending.<br/><br/>I can recommend this movie for anyone who isn't looking for a popcorn flick but really wants a good story and isn't fainthearted.. and get the directors cut if you can."

","OK, it's impossible to discuss this film without spoiling it so be warned that this review will contain spoilers to the ""big twist"" at the end.  You are hereby warned.  (note that I have only seen the director's cut which has a different ending.  i don't know what the theatrical ending is)<br/><br/>I hated this film.  Not in the sense that it was bad like Battlefield Earth or something.  I hated what the film had to say.  Sure films are entertainment, maybe even art, and the ride is to be enjoyed as much as the resolution, but a writer is also saying something.  S/he is making a statement about life.  and the writer of Butterfly Effect is making a sick, nihilistic statement that I can't at all find entertaining.<br/><br/>This is a film about unfortunate, messed up kids.  They are both victims o bad lives as well as victims of their own poor choices.  After an interminable first hour in which nothing resembling ""plot"" happens (instead, all the miserable childhood events that are to be changed must fist be laid out) min character Evan learns he can go back to certain moments of his youth and change things, thus creating a whole new reality for him and his friends (although the world at large is safely unaffected).<br/><br/>The exact mechanism of his temporal journeys is unclear.  He returns to moments when originally he had ""blacked out.""  Whether he blacked out because at some point in the future he went back to those moments or that he simply could only travel to his blackout moments is never stated.  Nor is it stated, although it seems to be implied, that he can only visit each black out once.  Mess it up the second time and oh well, time to move on.<br/><br/>Of course, each time back he attempts to improve things (preventing his would-be girlfriend's dad from making them star in kiddie porn; warning a mother with a baby about a firecracker he & his friends just put in her mailbox) he fixes the original problem but creates all new ones. Eventually, he decides the problem is *him*, his own existence, so he goes back to (presumably) a black out he had in utero and kills himself before he is born thus providing his friends with a happy life.<br/><br/>What is the writer saying here?  First and foremost the message is ""the world is a better place without you""  While this might apply to a Hitler or Ted Bundy it seems rather harsh for basically nice-guy Evan who hardly brought about the harsh problems of his childhood.  If anyone in the film deserved to not exist it was the girl's sick father.  Take him out of the equation and none of this happens either.  To me, this is nihilism at its worst.  It doesn't value human life.  it values its lack. as a final message for what was already a downer film it left a sick taste in my mouth as the credits were rolling.<br/><br/>Now, if one looks at the idea that the writer's original name for Evan Treborn was Chris (Christ reborn, get it?) then the message becomes one of self sacrifice - that a good man must die for the betterment of others.  The problem here is that his 'sacrifice' goes completely unknown.  No one will ever learn of his 'noble sacrifice' (a sacrifice made for the primary reason of negating a stupidly bad decision made by the girlfriend, not to undo any action of his own).  Still, the point seems to be not existing makes other's lives better.<br/><br/>There can be some debate on this issue though as early in the film, Evan's mom informs him of her two previous stillbirths, but after he kills himself (become stillbirth #3) during the visual sequence showing the 'improved' reality' we hear his mother's voice repeat those lines but this time saying she had 3 previous still births, not 2.  who is she speaking to?  is the cycle repeating?  This point is unclear.<br/><br/>Over all, this is a movie worth skipping.  It's not entertaining nor does it offer any kind of worthy message for your 120 minute investment."

","I'll have to be honest... I elected not to see this movie in the theatre because of my historical dislike of Ashton Kutcher, based on his previous work.  Upon reading through several reviews of the film, my initial concerns appeared to have been validated.  However, I came across The Butterfly Effect at the video store recently and decided to give it a shot.  Needless to say, I am quite glad I did.  Some of the major criticisms relate to the perceived plot holes surrounding the issue of theoretical time travel.  I agree that there are imperfections here; however, I also recognize that sacrifices must at times be made in order to tell a story that the viewer will find appealing and interesting.  Call it poetic license...after all, it is intended to be a piece of art, NOT a research paper on temporal theory. One of the characteristics I look for in a good film is the extent to which it elicits intellectual debate (brain candy), because I believe good intellectual debate is a positive contribution to society.  This one, for better or worse, certainly has done that.  There has been ample critique of the acting in this film as well.  I won't go as far as to say there are any Oscar-worthy performances here, but the performances were more than adequate.  Mr. Kutcher delved very well into uncharted territory in this movie, which was refreshing.  I actually found myself liking him, which I never thought would happen.  I was also very impressed with the performances of the kids in this movie -- particularly Logan Lerman (Evan at age 7) and Jesse James (Tommy at age 13).  All in all, 8 out of 10--"

","WARNING...POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>A previous reviewer felt Ashton Kutcher was not ready for drama.  I disagree.  He's no Gregory Peck, but I thought he did a great job playing a 20-something college student, and playing him straight.  His reactions in all the situations he was in were believable.  <br/><br/>As for the movie, maybe one needs to have an open mind for alternate realities; the road not taken.  How many times in somebody's life could they make a decision that takes them down a totally different path?  Nobody can predict the events that would occur from those decisions, either.  Ashton Kutcher's character Evan is somehow able to project his adult mind into himself at various points in his life in vain attempts to make things better in his present day.  Every time he ""fixes"" something, another facet of his life is broken.  <br/><br/>Countless time travel novels have been written about people who attempt to change the past, only to have the future become unrecognizable.  This movie is original in that it poses time travel without the benefit of a machine. Evan's only mechanism is to read journal entries at critical points in his life.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it is a highly watchable movie."

","The previous review said that they enjoyed the theatrical sappy happy ending. I have only seen the VHS version where they just miss each other in the street and keep walking. That ending just killed me because I needed them to be happy together in the end. But I don't think that was the point of the movie. I think that the point was that they were a couple doomed from the start-regardless of what Evan tried to do to change it. In the end he realized that and let her go so that she could lead a happy life-though he would be forced to live without her-which obviously killed him to do because of attempts to keep her and have it all. You can never have it all.. The so called happy ending I've read about said that one ending had him chase her down the street. If the point of the movie is that they were doomed from the start...who is to say he wouldn't chase her down the street and their life together after the fact wouldn't still be terrible. i.e.: she gives birth to the next Hitler etc. Granted the books were burned-but the home movies never were.... think about it!"

","I really had no intention of seeing this film until 2 of my friends said they had rented it and really liked it.  I'm not a big Kutcher fan, but I decided to rent it one night and wasn't disappointed.  Although this movie was no ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was still a pretty good movie.  I thought Amy Smart was gave a really good performance and the guy who played ""Thumper,"" but Kutcher is more of a comedic actor than a dramatic one. <br/><br/>
I thought it was kind of hard to follow for the first 30 minutes or so because of the blackouts and you don't really no what happened.  After that, the movie really picks up and it kept my interest the whole time.  The movie is a little dark and very intense at times.<br/><br/>A lot of people are talking about plot holes, but I didn't really read into it much.  If you don't over-analyze the movie, I think you'll like it. There was only one thing that I really didn't understand (the stigmata scene in the prison because his life didn't change when he did what he did-you'll know what I mean when you see it).

","The one complaint I have relating to this movie is the way it was marketed. In watching the trailer it comes across like a love story. Which in a way it is. But it was very likely to draw the wrong audience being presented this way, and perhaps this is why the film has drawn a fair amount of criticism.<br/><br/>
It is not an easy movie to watch, especially the first half an hour of the movie where you witness the events of Evan's childhood that he has blocked out. They are shocking and disturbing to watch. However this is necessary for the movie to have its' desired affect, and for you to understand why Evan is so desperate and willing to go to any lengths to change the past.<br/><br/>I watched this movie 2 months ago and am still thinking about it to this day. Despite the occasional plot flaw it is essentially a fascinating movie that delivers a profound message that what you do in life, even the small things can have a huge impact on not just your life, but the lives of the people you love."

","I liked this movie for various reasons, but mostly because it was engaging. I wanted to know what was going happen - I was interested in seeing how the main conflict would be resolved. It wasn't too hard to suspend disbelief long enough to get through the story, possible plot holes or not. There's even enough twists, riddles, and the like to make you think about the issues and themes presented in the movie.<br/><br/>I admit that this movie could have been done better by a different director and perhaps a different cast (though I liked the cast). For example, starting the movie where they did added little to enhance film. It even takes away from the suspense because now you now the character will at least make it to the scene in question. Also, the possessed versions of young Treborn could be more convincing. While I appreciated that their wasn't TOO MUCH explanation of what was going on (There's no scene where Evan spells out everything to ""the viewers""), some might find it confusing. <br/><br/>I think the Directors Cut and the Theatrical version, while presenting almost the same picture, have two different themes. The theatrical version seems to be about the power of regret (not love). The director's cut dealt more with punishment (for messing with the timeline). I can see why it didn't make the theaters....WAY too controversial (especially the ending). Of the two, I preferred the Theatrical Version. It was not as harsh (I don't consider it being ""realistic"") but was not ridiculously lighthearted either.<br/><br/>I saw Scream 2 in the theaters and, when Sarah Michelle Gellar's character was attacked, I could not help but think ""C'mon Buffy, you can beat this guy!"" More to the point, several other people I heard other people after the movie saying the same thing. Actors/Actresses get typecast as character types and sometimes we - the viewers - have difficulty getting around this fact. This is what I think happened to Ashton Kutcher in many of the reviews of ""The Butterfly Effect.""<br/><br/>I think he did a good job portraying the character, Evan Treborn, and managed not to go ""over the top"" any time he had to emote. I believed that he was Evan Treborn, and forget his other lighter roles. If you don't think you can get past his previous portrayals of silly character, this may not be the movie for you.<br/><br/>It is tempting to go about the various plot twists, said plot holes, and so on...but this is not the place for it. The movie is a good ""R"" rated picture with not too much gore - though various types of violence and cruelty is performed off screen. The movie goes from being a chiller to a sci-fi mystery (with much less ""chill"").<br/><br/><spoiler alert...sort of><br/><br/>I do want to point out to the people on this board that suggested that this movie was like a Simpson's Halloween episode that both the episode and this movie can trace their origins to a short story by Ray Bradbury (of which I forget the name, sorry). I think they are making a movie based on it though called ""A Sound of Thunder,"" staring Ben Kingsley, Ed Burns and Catherine McCormack. <br/><br/>That Simpson's episode - where Homer accidentally turns his Toaster into a Time machine - is one of the funniest Halloween eps I've seen.<br/><br/>Also, someone said it didn't make sense that Evan remembered all the other realities he went through. It's an old sci-fi ""rule"" that the people who change the past remember the original timeline (even in lighter films, like ""Back to the Future). In this movie, this is explained by his continual worsening brain hemorrhaging - he is having trouble instantly absorbing a lifetime of memories. It's also a neat plot device to show us what important things changed."
"mrcaffeinex","9","0","2","20 August 2004"," An interesting look at what could have been...
","After seeing both the theatrical version and director's cut of The Butterfly Effect I highly recommend both. Both versions present the question 'What would it have been like if...?' Although I feel that the theatrical version is somewhat more watered-down, which was most likely to leave the audience feeling good at the end of the film, it is still worth watching.<br/><br/>The drama and action of the film revolves around Evan during his college years. As a young child he suffered from a rare medical condition which left him prone to blackouts during periods of high anxiety. When he is older he learns that he has the ability to travel back in time to the points at which he blacked out as a child. The film then presents several alternate realities based on changing one of the events of his childhood. <br/><br/>Aptly named The Butterfly Effect after the Chaos Theory, the outcomes of Evan altering the past are often chaotic and/or morbidly depressing. The purpose of the film being to demonstrate how changing one event in a person's life could have a significant effect on that person's future, it does exactly what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>If you have the opportunity to view the director's cut version of the film, it offers several deleted/altered scenes and a completely different ending. In my opinion the establishment of the plot, the message of the film and the overall outcome are much more pronounced in the director's cut version. It also adds to the drama of the film greatly.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of movies like 12 Monkeys, which also in my opinion is one of the best movies dealing with the concepts of time travel and the effects of specific events on a person's life, then you should enjoy this movie. Ashton Kutcher does an outstanding job and is supported well by Amy Smart and Melora Walters. Overall I give the theatrical version a 7/10 and the Director's Cut version a 9/10."

Everything correlates, it all makes sense, stays consistent through the film, we just don't get a reason why he can do it. Kutcher's performance is fine throughout most of the movie, I don't know why people keep saying he needs to stick with his ""Kelso"" character.

I had never seen him in anything else but Cheaper By The Dozen. Just watched My Boss's Daughter and thought that he was very good in that. Maybe by hanging with Demi Moore he will learn a few tricks of the trade. The plot was just captivating.

"gleichzeitig","7","0","2","13 August 2004"," A wannabe Donnie Darko?
","I watched this film on DVD a couple of weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by both plot, special effects and theme as well as Ashton Kutcher's performance as Evan Treborn - who would have guessed he could actually act? I think the film might have been marketed wrong, because it appears to be much more of a scary movie in the trailers than it really is. It has got much more depth than I was brought to believe when watching those trailers, which may be why I was surprised in such a positive way. Had it been marketed as a 'deep' or 'thought provoking' film, I think it might have led me to expect more and thereby disappointed me. <br/><br/>The most striking thing about it was however the film's obvious resemblance to Richard Kelly's fascinating Donnie Darko (2001). First of all, there is the time-travel theme, which I think The Butterfly Effect juggled surprisingly well but not in as thought-provoking or entertaining a way as Donnie. Secondly, the graphic presentation of TBE is absurdly identical to that of DD. Try and compare the two film's black&blue, creepy-themed layouts. You'll find them almost identical. Coincidence? I don't know, but I know I thought ""Wow, someone's been watching Donnie Darko!"" when I first saw TBE.<br/><br/>Overall, I must say that much prefer DD's cast over TBE's, although Ashton delivers his first real performance as an actor, he just has not got the same inscrutable way about him than DD's main character Donnie (Gyllenhaal) has and that special feel, a sort of air of mystique that surrounds Donnie is only half-heartedly portrayed by Kutcher. It is as if he (and the entire film) cannot really decide whether to be dramatic, thrilling or provocative and the sci-fi/fantasy element becomes secondary. For example: those theories behind time-traveling in the film ... not so believable. They don't seem to have been thought through or given deeper consideration, resulting in the time-travel to be less believable and easier to brush aside. Donnie on the other hand, keeps you wondering for hours and is a great movie to watch with like-minded and discuss afterwards.<br/><br/>I rewarded The Butterfly Effect 7 points here on IMDb for its entertainment value and overall interesting plot, but no lingering effect.<br/><br/>I gave Donnie Darko a 9 for its excellent actors, composition and feel. The musical score is also a bonus, it's simply amazing. All in all I would suggest you go rent Donnie Darko instead of The Butterfly effect if you're in the mood for a mind-boggling and beautiful sci-fi flick."

","Very surprised by how much I liked this movie after the critical drubbing it took.  While the idea of time travel and its effects on the traveler's current world is not new, it is well presented here.  The results of Evan's attempts to change his present have unintended consequences and each is presented with enough detail to make you care what happens to the characters.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is solid but unspectacular in the lead.  More interesting are his friends, with Amy Smart getting the best parts playing (alternately) his long-forgotten friend, sorority girlfriend, druggie prostitute, and his best friend's girlfriend.  The weakest part of the film are the cheesy special effects shown during Evan's time journeys, but they are instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>I really liked his ""ultimate solution"" to the time-travel problem.  Note that all these comments refer to the theatrical version, as I plan to watch the special edition located on the same DVD very soon."
"be-22","Null","0","2","18 August 2004"," This is the anti ""It's a Wonderful Life"" **SPOILERS**
","I had the luxury of not knowing who Ashton Kutcher was before seeing this film, so I could enjoy the film without the preconceptions I saw from others. I saw the theatrical version first, then the director's cut.<br/><br/>I found this to be a very effective movie that didn't deserve the panning (on plot and acting) from the critics. Some of the plot ""holes"" that were pointed out, aren't. And I'm no acting expert, but the performance by the 13-year old Tommy sociopath was chilling.<br/><br/>One critic said this movie borrowed from Asimov's ""The End of Eternity"", Clarke's ""The Sound of Thunder"", and ""Back to the Future"". I think the philosophical roots owe more to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Frankenstein, Quantum Leap, and ""12 Monkeys"". So here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>It's (not) a Wonderful Life: The Frank Capra philosophy is that people make mistakes but the good you do has lasting impact. BE's approach is that the good you do doesn't matter. (Yes, Evan did do good, even if only off-screen. He was a nice kid) You never get another chance to correct your mistakes. Now that's a depressing philosophy, which doesn't seem to work in my world. It may be a noble sacrifice to help everyone you love by not being born, but it's not a victory and no parent would find it a comfort. Babies are about unlimited potential.<br/><br/>Playing God- Frankenstein and (Don't) Quantum Leap: QL's hero played God, and was rewarded with making lives better. Here, Evan tries the same approach, to no avail. The writers pretty much stacked the deck against Evan in BE. He becomes his own Frankenstein and kills himself. The butterfly effect isn't biased toward disaster, except in this movie. Now, in the real world, when something doesn't work, you try something else. We all ""play God"" every day, in that we make choices that affect other people. This is taken to it's limit when you become the parent of a young child. You accept the responsibility. ""You can't play God"" doesn't make sense as a plot idea.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys: ""It doesn't matter how hard you try, you can't avert disaster."" Both Bruce Willis' character and Evan try to do the right thing, but the fates (really, the writers) foil their attempts and they die in futility. They are finite and flawed and they shouldn't have bothered in the first place.<br/><br/>One thing that bugs me - the supernatural tie-in. I hate the concept of the ""Bad Seed"", which is essentially condemning the baby before he's born. Evan is tragic because he can't accomplish anything by being alive. If God is involved (""You have no soul""), why let him be born? What's the point of the ""miracle"" that Evan's mother mentions?<br/><br/>So, I liked the movie for it's hard-nosed look at the paradoxes of time-travel , but hate the ""rules"" that make it up. Most of this comment is me expending energy to complain about BE's implied world-view. That's what a good movie should do."

","Hmmm, Ashton Kurcher in a serious role? This is what I was thinking when I heard about this movie. Having seen Ashton in `That 70's Show' and `Dude, where's my car?'

After seeing him in `Dude, where's my car' I didn't have high hopes for him to say the least. This is a thriller type of movie and deals with subjects like love, hate, destiny and sacrifice.

","I have always enjoyed movies that center around time-travel.  While this isn't a time travel movie per se, it is similar in that the Evan Treborn character (Ashton Kutcher) learns that he can alter the past.  These changes create a ripple effect throughout the intervening years.  Some of the results are positive and anticipated.  Others are unexpected and unfortunate.  The plot is intelligent and gives the audience a chance to reflect on the notion that many defining moments in life are a result of happenstance.<br/><br/>The direction and editing are done in such a way that we can keep track of the changes that result from the alteration in the past.  That is difficult to do in a movie of this nature, but I had no problem following the time transitions.<br/><br/>The actors did a fine job. Aston Kutcher, an actor for whom I didn't have a lot of regard, showed me that he really could act with some depth. I also enjoyed Amy Smart's performance.<br/><br/>I had moderate expectations for this movie and those expectations were exceeded by a significant amount.  I recommend this film."

Lastly I'll say this it's really rare for me when a movie honestly makes me sad at the end.

I think that Ashton Kutcher could have a wonderful career as a serious actor because he had me from the start to the finish of this film. I think that those who panned the film went in with preconceived notions and prejudices and just did not give it a chance. I also agree with the poster who said that the d.c. might have gone over better with the critics. The differences in the endings are night and day.

","I'm not a film critic, although obvious performances and overall production values of a ""bad"" movie can be discerned to even the untrained eye, I was very impressed with this movie. Rarely am I interested enough in a movie's DVD version to spend time with those wonderful bonus bits yet this one had me eagerly watching the commentary from the directors. Their insights were intriguing as was the symbolism (albeit used sparingly).<br/><br/>My desire to add to this commentary came out of my retrospective thoughts about how Evan's decisions to go back in time were mostly grounded in his wish to make things better. Every instance of intervention on his part was marked by an equal intervention from a person or persons. Nowhere in the story does the influence of ""uncontrollable"" events change things for the better or in most cases for the worse. Acts of God do not have relevance in this story. Everything that occurs is the result of decisions made by human beings. As the realization of this came to me I became even more impressed with the writer's intentions (be they willing or otherwise) to illustrate (to me at least) how we are ultimately responsible for what happens in this world and more precisely in our own lives. Though one could argue that the very tool of being able to choose is in fact a construct of the Almighty and therefore the relevance of God is in fact prominent in the movie I personally believe that is not the case. Al Pacino, as Milton in 'The Devil's Advocate' said it with such aplomb: ""Free Will Baby!!"""

I actually sat down and watched it. In the beginning I was thinking to myself ""What kind of demented freak put this movie together?"" <br/><br/>I just but my hands over my face every time something violent happened (to later realize they never really showed anything TOO gross.)<br/><br/>Then towards the middle the movie was making me a little angry, I thought they were going to end it the easy way out. But they kept going and making it more exciting as it goes along. Then I realized it was getting to the ending and the ending was awesome. It really puts everything all together. I recommend the Directors Cut more though, because it was really intense.<br/><br/>The kid actors in the movie were GREAT. They really blended well together. And Amy Smart's ability to change personalities so many times in that movie was awesome.<br/><br/>The movie is about Evan Treborn (Event Reborn *get it?*) And his disorder where he blacks out every time something goes majorly wrong in his life. Then when he wakes up he is unable to recall what just happened. He was told by a psychologist that his memories were like a movie, and no harm could be done by going back to them. But the kid just freaked out each time he tried to remember so he started keeping journals and then for about 7 years he just forgot about them. Then on the 7th anniversary of not having any black outs he decided to remember the past, and go back to where he was raised and figure things out. He talked to his past friend Lenny (who had loads of issues after being apart of a prank that went to far)... and his old lover/friend... Kaliegh to ask questions.<br/><br/>Lenny went nuts on him, because of his problems. So did Kaliegh probably even more so then Lenny, she didn't want to be reminded of all the bad things including her pedophile father. Evan realized he could change the past because when he was thinking about the past he had a cigarette in his mouth , and since he was older he didn't like smoking anymore, so he spit it out and it left a scar on his stomach he never had until then. So he said ""If I can create scars, maybe I can heal them..."" <br/><br/> From then on hes been toying with the past trying to make things better but no matter what he does someone gets the bad end of the stick.<br/><br/>Then in the end he realizes something... but if I told you, then Id be ruining it, so WATCH IT!

One of them, Ashton Kutcher's character Evan, discovers that he has the ability to mentally travel to the past. Seriously large plot device, but it touches on something almost everyone has wondered about: ""What if I could go back and change something? How could I make things better?"". The consequences of Evan's attempts are played out, showing that sometimes changing things for the better really changes them for the worst.

","(this refers to the director's cut DVD, which has a different ending)<br/><br/>I am amazed by the group-think often displayed by major film critics. Mediocre, boring films get universally praised, and some tight little gems get universally panned.  ""The Butterfly Effect"" is an example of the latter. Here are some common complaints of the film according to the critics.<br/><br/><ul><li>Ashton Kutcher was horrible.  ***I think he did a fine job.  His style is very natural and believable.  And it fit the role pretty well.  He is genuinely likable too, which is a plus in a grim film as this.  Sure he's no Olivier, but it works.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The film is too downbeat. ***That's the idea.  The critics seem to forget however, that it was not gratuitous, even though its 'R' rating would have allowed for much more graphic imagery.  It's a grim film by design, and its tone is consistent.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The plot is outrageous.  ***Sure, it's not the least bit believable.  But is ""The Return of the King"" believable?  ""Butterfly"" is a Supernatural Thriller.  It's fantasy world with its own unique rules: 1) Evan could return to a previously blacked-out event if he read the corresponding journal entry and concentrated really hard.  2) Upon entry to the past, he maintained his adult persona, and had full control of his previous self.  3) Whatever changes he made only seemed to effect himself, three childhood friends, and his mom.</li></ul><br/><br/>Within those rules, the film is amazingly consistent.  If you piece together Evan's ""Quantum Leaps"" with its alternate present, you will notice startling fidelity to the rules.  Certainly more than other ""changing the past affects present"" films like the Back to the Future series.<br/><br/>This could have been a nice little money-maker that encouraged courageous story-telling.  But the critical panning killed its chances."

","At our house, a great movie is one that you think and talk about for days afterwards, and that contributes something meaningful to your life - either by providing a wonderful, fun, refreshing entertainment experience, or by giving you meaningful things to think about in regard to living life. By that standard, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is not just a good movie, but a great one.<br/><br/>That said, most of the content is very, very, dark, violent, graphic, and disturbing. Seeds were planted into the lives of four children that, in this case at least, will lead inevitably to destruction, despair, and death.<br/><br/>
Still, this is a movie well, well worth viewing. Yes, there are a few plot holes (although in reality they're generally different from the supposed plot holes some others have mentioned). The scene with the knife doesn't fit, somehow. The fact that the psychologist tells Evan he has previously asked for the journals doesn't fit, either. But such holes don't come across as terribly gaping (unlike the mind-numbingly idiotic scene in the otherwise authentic ""Titanic"" where Kate Winslet hands Leonardo diCaprio a Roosevelt dime), and in movies today such small holes are, alas, all too common.<br/><br/>
There are several alternate endings, but for me there is only one real ending - the theatrical release version one. I've read all about the ""Director's Cut"" version of the film, and that ending to me doesn't really make sense, is basically unnecessary, and is totally predictable based on the inclusion of the earlier ""life line"" scene that's present only in that version. No, the theatrical ending is perfect, and the place that ending brings you to emotionally is THE perfect conclusion of this film.<br/><br/>

Luckily Kutcher is not bad enough to ruin the film, but there are moments when he comes close.  I believe that the underwhelming critical reviews are in large part due to his abysmal acting.  The rest of the cast does a fine job and contrary to others, I don't believe that the directors did that bad of a job.  Although, there were a couple of scenes where the interpretation seemed way off base.

","*SPOILERS* (Read at own risk.)<br/><br/>I rented this and only watched the Director's Cut, then had to flip the disk over because the ""alternate"" ending in the deleted/alternate scenes section didn't fit anything I had seen in that version of the movie. <br/><br/>Confused, I watched the theater version ending. I can't believe someone butchered it! I know, I know, the first one came out and the Director's Cut for all purposes is the ""new"" version, but the ending of the Director's Cut was so good...why would anyone mess with it? <br/><br/>I wanted to know what the main reason was for changing the original ending that was in the script. Is it because it was too dark with the main character killing himself? Did it not test well? I went back and watched the original ending and that didn't make sense with all the hoopla about his mom saying, ""He was a miracle child"" and the fortune teller saying he had no soul in the Director's Cut. I can guess that these scenes either were totally cut or modified to not put that into the film. Those parts made the film all the more supernatural and psychologically scary for me, that Evan could pass this to his sons and the cycle could start anew and this made Evan a freak of nature. A mistake. A mistake that costs him the lives of those near to him, no matter what he does. Just like his dad who also dies, trying to kill his son, which brings up the point that maybe Jason tried to kill himself too and it didn't work. <br/><br/>It makes sense that Evan dies at the end. If he keeps doing what his dad did, then his friend he lives with won't be safe, his mom still won't be safe and everyone he touches won't be safe. He may, in the future, actually see Kayley and talk to her, even if he didn't this time. Chaos might fight, yet Destiny could win. Then what happens to them? Maybe they are both married and their affair kills someone?  They have a son and he kills someone or changes things? It is back to square one. Yes, he does burn his journals and films, but he could change time by memory at this point, since he has done it so much. <br/><br/>Why is that a good ending...better than the one where the child kills himself in the womb, which is much darker and completely original, as opposed to the ""two ships in the night"" ending, which has been done before in time travel type movies. Why? Why? Why? Did they get more money for filming with a more conventional ending that doesn't that a risk?<br/><br/>I would have been upset seeing this in the theater in its original release and probably wouldn't have rented it to see the director's cut, so I am glad I waited. It is always better to wait! <br/><br/>Oh, my question about the DVD is...why didn't they have the ""alternate"" ending footage, known in the commentary as Evan's ""stalker"" scene, where he chats up Kayley for coffee, on the side with the theater release ending? It would save us renters the problem of scratching our heads, wondering what happened to get him on the street with a cell phone and away from the womb? Plus, why does only the Director's Cut side have commentary? I was hoping to rewatch it, but only the theater release version with commentary. I can't really do that now. My only options are to watch the director's cut right after I already saw it with commentary or watch the theater release without commentary or do both. And frankly this video is due tomorrow at noon, so I won't have time to do both!  Annoying! <br/><br/>Anyone else find Infinifilm DVDs more bothersome than fun? I remember renting Goldmember and watching all the extras, thinking that the Infinifilm stuff would be fun if I watched it a second time, but it was all the same stuff. They really should put in the DVD that the footage is the same. Plus, you can't run the ""Fun Facts"" and the commentary or subtitles at the same time, which is a nuisance to me.<br/><br/>
Overall, I was surprised that Ashton Kutcher could pull this off for the most part, instead of it becoming, ""Dude, Where's My Brain?"" There were two rough parts...when he woke up one time, he acted very silly, which made me and the person I was viewing it with laugh a lot. It was so over the top and not very good acting. The second time was when he ran down the halls at the end...it was like girly running and I had to start laughing again...both times, my view of the film changed because of these bad actor moments. Amy Smart was good. <br/><br/>I did think the mother character seemed a bit young to have a 20+ year old son, but that is Hollywood for you. Or Vancouver for you...<br/><br/>I thought the script was better than average, of course the original script and ending are much better.  The effects were nice and didn't detract from the story. The idea of self sacrifice for the greater good was a dark but powerful message, one that wasn't explored in the movie release as seriously...there is a big difference between death and not being able to see someone...and people could argue which is worse, but I think death is worse for myself. Plus, the womb shots were just very cool. I have never seen a child kill itself in the womb before in a movie. Delightfully original. I hope the directors do some good work in the future. Recommended as a rental if you watch the Director's Cut first."

Both are available on DVD.<br/><br/>Both TLoH and TBE deal with main characters with the ability to change history, each time with unintended consequences. The scale on which they attempt to ""perfect"" their world is different. While TBE focuses on individuals, TLoH's George Orr is forced by his psychiatrist to attempt to solve the world's problems (e.g in curing hunger he creates a plague that kills 5 billion people). <br/><br/>If you liked the ideas explored in TBE, try the Lathe of Heaven (try to get a hold of the earlier version)"

","This movie was surprisingly good and its one of those movies that makes you think. <br/><br/>Nothing in life comes without a price or certain sacrifice and with good bad also happens. <br/><br/>This is but two themes that occurred to me after the movie and that is so true. <br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher is not his usual self in this piece but an ordinary man with a wasted up childhood. It is however his quest for true love that forces him to begin his journey.

","I honestly will have to say that I wasn't into seeing Ashton Kutcher in anything since his face is plastered everywhere else. But I do like thrillers and interesting plots. However, when I first saw the previews of this film, I doubted it was going to be good. But it was number one at the box office which means little today. But I admit, I loved it. A complete ten in my book. However, things did  start out kind of slow but got very interesting and did manage to keep my short attention peaked.<br/><br/>   I am extremely impressed with Ashton and how he performed this role. I'm still not a great fan of his but the movie was better than I'd ever expected. I liked the suspense and writing along with the concept, especially the way it made you think.  The characters were also impressive along with the entire picture. I really recommend this movie whether you're a fan of the star or a movie that beckons you to think or if you just want to sit down and relax while watching a suspense driven plot. Good job."

","""Butterfly effect"" has thrills in form of horror, fantasy, psychology and is in many ways filled with both sadness and hope! A very human movie and that's probably why I liked it so much! The main character Evan tries his very best to remember happenings in his past, that has been blocked out of his mind.  He has since childhood been writing a diary, and he discoveres that by reading his diary again, he can change events that occured in his past and by this change both past and future. He uses his skills in order to help his friends and correct gruesome happenings in the past, but with unknown consequences! <br/><br/>All of you who liked Donnie Darko should check out Butterfly effect! Easily the best movie made this year, with an exciting script from the beginning to the end! This is a movie who challenges the viewers imagination, without giving to many clues! Starring Ashton Kutcher, who have done several comedies and the talented Amy Smart who really does an excellent preformance worthy an Oscar! The first time directors and writers of ""Final Destination 2""; Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber have outdone themselves with ""Butterfly effect""!!  10 out of 10!!"

","The ideas in this film are not new. In fact you can find elements of Groundhog Day, Its a Wonderful Life, even a Simpson's episode about a time travel machine in the form of a toaster. I suppose it all stems from Ray Bradbury's short story A Sound of Thunder. Go back in time step on a butterfly and vastly change the future. The problem with this film is that the ""butterfly"" effect seems to apply only to the main character's inner circle. Not anyone else. <br/><br/>Anyhow, the acting is pretty decent considering the characters have to go through all these different lives/timelines. But I found the movie over-long and incredibly morbid. I'm sure it appeals to Gen-X/Y'ers who may relate fully to the angst, depression and massive regret the story's characters embody."

","Every once in a while a movie comes along that just takes you by surprise. Sometimes it's easy to walk into a movie and expect it to be awful. The new B-movie classic The Butterfly Effect (also the absolute Best Worst movie of the year!) breaks the barrier of being awful and just shoots you off into another dimension of absolute disbelief. If I ever see Ashton Kutcher attempt ""dark drama"" again, I hope he grows out another beard. He was one of the executive producers of this phenomenon which could have been titled The Chaos Theory For Dummies, it almost feels like your forced to watch a physics project presented by a fraternity after a weekend of beer chugs and bong hits. There comes a point where many questions are raised. Why are Kutcher, Amy Smart, and Ethan Suplee being forced to act all dramatic? Is there a Wheel of Fortune in Hollywood? Is that why Eric Stoltz is stuck here playing the lamest pedophile stereotype put on film? You can play a drinking game tallying up the ridiculous asides in this movie, but you could kill yourself after the first hour. Have the filmmakers seen Donnie Darko? Bedazzled? Quantum Leap? That Simpsons Halloween episode where Homer travels back in time with a toaster? Maybe this is one big Hollywood joke. Now THAT would make this the most clever movie of our time!"

I say that the idea of time travel as a science fiction plot has never been done well. One must go deeper, this is a timeless story. A theme that has been explored hundreds of times in film. Simply, ""What if I could do it over?"" This theme is timeless, because it is a question we all ask ourselves until the day we die. This particular movie did a very good job.<br/><br/>Young Kutcher did a great job. He is young yet, but he will be around a very long time.

The butterfly effect starts well and lets the viewer know what is happening pretty early on into the movie and why, which also makes the film more watchable as your not trying to figure out whats going on. the viewer isn't forever trying to guess whats gonna happen as its predictable but that makes it more enjoyable. One knows what will happen roughly and the events that happen during the film all inter-mingle until the final trip back in time to undo all that he has done. well worth watching and exceeds others like donnie darko."
"Sweet_Ophelia","Null","0","1","26 July 2004"," Promising film, until Ashton entered
","I was genuinely surprised when I started watching the butterfly effect. The first 20 minutes are intriguing, and a little bit edgy... but after that, it's pretty much down-hill when Ashton Kutcher steps into the film. Evan Treborn had a twisted childhood. He grew up with an absent father who, upon his first ever meeting with him at a mental asylum, tried to kill him. His two best friends, brother and sister Kayleigh & Tommy Miller were sexually abused by their father, which results in Tommy turning into a brutal, vindictive teenager; and his other friend, Lenny Kagan, is traumatized for life when a practical joke goes wrong. Evan is a strange child, who suffers from a similar mysterious disease as his father; he has black-outs, and he loses his memory of critical moments in his childhood. To try and cure him, his mother gets Evan into the habit of writing down details about his day in journals, to try and jog his memory. When Evan is 13, he moves away from his neighbourhood, leaving his troubled friends behind, and the love of his life, Kayleigh with a promise that he will one day come back for her. (This is where Ashton steps in, and the film goes out the window). Seven years later, Evan is a hard-working Psych major who hasn't had a black-out in 7 years. All seems to be going right for him, until Evan reads over his old journals...and discovers that he can go back in time and change the events of the past to effect the future (hence: butterfly effect, change one thing and everything else changes). The rest is predictable and badly written....<br/><br/>Amy Smart (who plays grown-up Kayleigh) is shocking. There is a scene in which she turns out to be a tough-talking hooker from the school of hard-knocks.... the attempted acting in this scene is just laughable.<br/><br/>Ashton is... well, Ashton. No matter how serious and sometimes dark the film may be, you can't help but shake off that image of him as MTV's punker and Demi's toy boy. I couldn't take him or his acting seriously, i was just waiting for him to pop up during the credits, with his trucker-hat and say something along the lines of ""ya'll were punk'd big time... you think this film was for real? Pfft...suckers!"". Sorry, maybe it's just me, but Ashton should stick to what he does best; films like dude where's my car and...well....that's pretty much all he can do. <br/><br/>I'll admit that the general ideas behind The Butterfly Effect are worthwhile, but bad acting just ruin a perfectly good film... and occasionally, a bad script too. It's worth a watch, but don't get your hopes too high."
"fozzie2099","7","0","1","19 July 2004"," A refreshing take on time travel
","Time travel.....overdone to the point its almost clichÃ© in science fiction movies, television and novels. It was for that reason I approached The Butterfly Effect with skepticism, avoiding it at the theaters and only seeing the DVD edition when a friend brought it over. I must confess pleasant surprise at the quality of this movie. Instead of taking the usual sci-fi approach of trying to explain how the time travel works, trying to sound smart with talks about quantum this and that, wormholes, etc etc, we follow along the life of Evan and simply experience the time travel as he does, left with the same lack of understanding of how he exactly he can do this as he is. Rather than struggle to understand the 'why' of it, he accepts his power and struggles to use it to set straight tragic experiences from his past. <br/><br/>This is where the movie reaches its strong point. The scenes of Evans childhood are very dramatic, with the younger actors portraying Evan and his friends as important to the story and characters as the adult mainstream actors are. These are no mere flashbacks, they set the story for us and have us rooting for Evan to be successful in his quest to change his reality. *SPOILER* I mean, who didn't feel a tug of emotion when young Evan was helpless to save his pet dog from being burned alive? *SPOILER* And as he changes things, we see the worst of them redeemed, and the best torn apart. He can never get it right, though he comes close once changing all of his friends lives for the better, but at the price of his own. A lesser movie would have ended there, with the hero accepting his fate out of joy for his friends. But Evan cannot live with what he becomes, and shows a selfish and very human side of himself when he sacrifices what he gained for his friends for a chance to fix his own life, and out of the notion of 'getting it right'. In the end, Evan realizes he can't truly get it right, and he makes a choice that forces him to accept that fact. <br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher surprises me here, initially he seemed to me inappropriate for the role, but he throws himself into it and I enjoyed his performance. The movie wasn't about Ashton Kutcher, as so many movies with big name stars are only about them. The story drives the movie, and while no doubt timetravel enthusiasts will enjoy dissecting every aspect and pointing out holes, I hope they can see this movie was not about the timetravel as it was the stories that drove our hero into having to us it in the first place. A real breathe of fresh air for the genre."

","'The Butterfly Effect' is a pretty good alternate timeline movie.  Not as good as 'Lola Rennt' (a.k.a 'Run, Lola Run!'), but a bit better than 'Sliding Doors.'  It's rather intelligent, has good continuity, and has enough surprises to keep you interested.<br/><br/>First, let me qualify that I rented the DVD and enjoyed the movie very much (which surprised me considering the reviews).  The reason for this was that I chose the director's cut, and found a story that was tight and ended properly with all holes closed.  <br/><br/>Then I checked 'Alternate Versions' on this site, and found out they had a totally different ending for the theatrical release.  I'm not sure what the studios forced on the directors, but based on the summary and the scenes that were cut, I wouldn't watch it.  <br/><br/>Who would have thought that Ashton Kutcher wouldn't be bad...oh hell, I guess I'll say it, would be good in a movie?  Melora Walters is impressive, as usual, especially given her limited screen time.  Amy Smart is turning into a real actress, she hit the notes just perfect in her different roles. Hopefully she'll get a few good roles before Hollywood thinks she's too old. <br/><br/>I was expecting a weak movie with bad acting, but instead, I found about two hours of solid entertainment.  Definitely worth the rental."

","I thought this movie was really well done, First of all it is one of the only movies i have seen that deal's directly with Chaos Theory and i think the directors did a very good job of explaining one factor of this very complex theory. Jurrasic park bearly skims the surface when it comes to Chaos Theory, this movie on the other hand dives right into it from start to finish. Evans father had the ability to go back to key points in time where certain decisions were made by him which alternately can have a alternate reality. Evan has these ""black outs"" at life changes sectors in time I.E when he and his mates blow up a letter box which effectively kills a mother and Baby. While evan is in college he find one of his old journals that he kept to try and jog his memory of the times when he has black outs, He begins to read it and finds him self in a memory. He drops a ciggy that he had in his mouth and it drops on him and burns his stomach, He wakes up from this ""Dream"" and finds that he has a scare where the ciggy had fallen which was not there at the begging of the ""Dream"" ""Alternate Reality"" with this he discover s that he is able to change his future at these special point. As the movie goes on Evan finds him self getting in deeper and deeper and finds him self having to make a decision the ones he loves, or the ""one"" he loves. The movie does not pay attention to one fact of chaos theory being that "" if you take one step to the right the world will take two steps to the left"" Meaning that in this movie it is only him and the ones in the memory that are effected which i think that their would have to be some sort of change in the future of others.<br/><br/>I found the movie very good and put aside the fact that there are a few errors in the dialoge you have your self a action pact thriller. 8/10"

Everyone at sometime in their life has probably wanted to change something about their past, and this movie shows that sometimes things are better left the way they are.

"Mykewood","8","0","1","22 July 2004"," A very under-rated movie
","I don't understand why more people don't appreciate this movie.  It is very well directed.  & While the acting is not top notch, Ashton, as well as the rest of the cast, does an adequate job.  This movie is driven by the story. Evan grows up with a very strange problem!  He has gaps in his memory.  Not over time like most of us do, he has gaps about events that just happened. He doesn't understand what is going on or why.  But because of his problem, his mother, who understood the problem because is father had a similar problem, takes him to a shrink.  The shrink's idea is to have Evan keep a journal of everything he does.  The problem is, he doesn't remember these events, and so he can't log them.  Fast-forward to Evan grown...  He has witnessed several life-altering events in his life, most of which he can't remember any details of.  He finds one of his journals when he is in college, & reading some of the pages, he realizes that he actually DID log the events.  While reading about one of them, he suddenly finds himself back in time, watching the event thru his own eyes as he must have watched them as a kid.  Apparently, these gaps are like time portals in his mind.  Where he can go back & view the events, or more importantly, change his role in them.  His efforts & the effects of them are what follow.  What I believe this story is built on is that EVERY person in the world as had events in their past that they would LOVE to be able to go back & change.  But, would life turn out similar to your current one if you had.  Going back & getting an A on the math test in 3rd grade might have kept you from being grounded all summer, but then, because you were outside, your friends were too, so now, one of you friends you grew up with dies in a car crash, which destroys his family.  Mother ends up in the nut house; sister ends up a crack-head... Our lives touch so many people in so many ways that to go back & change anything changes the entire world around us.  Changing one little thing causes a ripple effect with everyone we know or come in contact with, & everyone they know & come in contact with, & so on...  This movie shows this so well.  I enjoyed watching it & recommend this to everyone!  10 out of 10"

The movie itself was very solid and it makes some valid points, however, I do not think that every event gets that intertwined with one another. Then again, who knows because we could probably have the same thing if we had the Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>Saw the directors cut and the alternate ending.......I'll just say they were better leaving the theatrical ending. The alternate was decent, but it would have made no sense for the movie to end like that.<br/><br/>Kutcher should drop the stupid comedies and slowly start to go with serious drama roles/dark comedy roles because he is earning a rep of being a dumb, stupid idiot for his comedic resume."

Kutcher surprised me with how well he does in a dramatic roll.

It's hard to explain what exactly I enjoyed about it - maybe it was the message of faith, or the message of love, or even the message of ""whatever happens, happens"" since even if we were able to turn back time it wouldn't always save us, our relationship, or even our lives. <br/><br/>Many people are comparing The Butterfly Effect to Donnie Darko.

"bbbl67","8","0","1","18 July 2004"," Intriguing concept, surprising Ashton Kutcher
","I know a lot of critics didn't like this movie, but I wonder how much of that had simply to do with not believing that Ashton Kutcher could act? Mind you the stuff he was doing here is not exactly Shakespeare, but it was passable. What is best about this movie was the storyline.<br/><br/>It's about a boy, Evan, who experiences frequent unexplained blackouts at landmark points of his life. Those early blackout go unexplained until he gets to university when he realizes that he is able to project himself into his own mind into the past and influence events from his own past. Kutcher just plays the oldest version of himself, the one going to university. Two other actors play this character as an elementary school boy, and as a high school teenager. <br/><br/>Everytime he goes back into the past, he tries to change something in order to fix a problem in his life, or his friends' lives, or his mother's life, etc. But it just ends up causing a catastrophe somewhere else.<br/><br/>
Another great idea that they had was that Evan retains his memories from his past lives. Normally in other time travel movies, they wouldn't pay too much attention to this detail, it is just a given. However, in this one, the past comes rushing into his head in a brain-tearing frenzy, which causes his nose to bleed; stroke victims often have nosebleeds because their brains are bleeding. Everytime he changes the past, twenty years of memories from a previous life gets added to his brain. So there is this idea that if he goes into the past too much, his brain could almost literally explode.<br/><br/>
If you watch this on DVD, then the DVD has two versions of this film, the theatrical version and the director's cut. The director's cut is much darker, and has a different ending. If you're a type that only wants happy endings and is disturbed by too much violence, then watch the theatrical version: this version has a neutral ending, and the prison scenes are toned down heavily. Otherwise, watch the director's cut: this ending is the more spiritual ending, about what fate awaits you if you're given the ability to play god."

I don't love the film, but I do really like it a lot, and I urge you to give it a chance.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's the whole skewed time travel angle of the story in which the protagonist attempts to correct some very dark crap that happened in his past (and, more importantly, the past of a couple of his friends), but what really grabbed me was the utter horror of the childhood experiences that scarred the hero and his friends; growing up in the suburbs is a frightening experience for some kids, and for a locale that parents bring children to for potential family safety they really have no clue as to what kinds of adventures their kids can have, either at home, at friend's houses or through mischief of their own device. The events that shape the pre-altered realities of the main characters are balls-out awful and I don't recommend the film to all audiences, but at least the worst bits are mostly strongly implied rather than explicitly shown; trust me, when kids are involved that's a good thing, because the crap really is that bad.<br/><br/>So the bottom line is that you should check it out, and after you see it flip the DVD and watch the director's cut with commentary from the writer and director. If you come away from the theatrical release a little cold, the director's cut/commentary version will majorly sway you like it did me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

","The Butterfly Effect is a great movie. It reminds one to count your blessings and things could always be worse. Sometimes, it is best to leave ""well-enough"" alone. I found this movie to be a great psychological thriller. It makes one hope that time travel is never possible. This movie shows that everything we have done has a cumulative effect on the future, so no single event is responsible for our future. We are who we are today because of our past, so what if there is an event that you think you could do without. This movie makes one question if the omission of a certain event will be worth it once all of its following events are also changed. Ashton gave a great performance, who would have thought ""Kelso"" could pull this off. Yeah, bad things happen, leave well enough alone."

","Butterfly Effect was the better than expected. I was definitely worried that Ashton Kutcher could not portray a serious roll without seeming somewhat ""B"" movie like. The movie pulls you in and has you second guessing every natural instinct you would have. I actually did not get to see that movie in theaters, but instead on DVD. I would have to say for those who have not seen it yet, you must watch the Directors Cut first, that ending is the best. It takes other events in the movie and pulls them all together very nicely. The Theatrical Cut has an alternate ending that does not give the movie that dramatic presence you would be looking for. Although, it seems like a more pleasant ending, I am glad that the Directors cut was the one most people see and love. All and all a great film and a must buy."
"dcobbimdb","10","0","1","14 July 2004"," See the directors cut, absolutely worth the watch!!!
","10 out of 10 for me!!!  I am very glad I read the reviews posted by reviewers (thanks a bunch people!).  I didn't see this movie in the theater, though I was intrigued too.  After reading many reviews saying to watch the directors cut, I rented it and watched that version first.  Wow was I blown away  I'm glad that I never saw it in the theater and instead saw the directors cut first.  I actually was very teary eyed at the end as it made such an impact (and that never happens to me).  Every now and then a movie comes along that makes such a profound impact that it takes a part of you with it, or changes you in some way.  This was one of those movies for me. And I can count on one hand the movies that have done that to me  I can't give an unbiased opinion on this, but had I seen the theatrical version first, I probably would have given it an 8 out of 10 instead.<br/><br/>As with many movies, once they hit DVD, there is often additional scenes or a directors edition, and many times they are subtle additions or changes, not with this movie, mark my words.  That is why it's important to watch the directors cut first.  All this being said, I can see why they released the theatrical version instead as the directors cuts wasn't very Hollywood like. It would have been a risk to release the directors cut as the original theatrical version, but I think it would have done better (again my opinion).  So just know the directors edition is more or less a different ending with one or two additional scenes in the middle to support it.  But wow how 5-10 minutes of change can make a difference.<br/><br/>I certainly don't want to give much away in this review and for your sake don't read too many reviews or your bound to find one that will spoil it for you, and this is one of those movies that you don't want spoiled if you haven't seen it.  So that being said I won't give any spoilers away.  I thought the acting was well done by all the actors.  The story line is intriguing and kind of Sci-Fi, but is one that you kind of have to accept the time travel thing up front, otherwise you simply can't get into the story.  The effects were good, though they weren't a big aspect in my opinion, meaning I don't think the movie depended on them like so many others to succeed.  Often times with time travel movies, you always have guys going ape over things and pointing out loopholes.  Admittedly they bug me too when they are obvious.  With this movie, it was either so carefully thought out or too much for my brain to handle, but in essence I didn't see any major plot holes.  I thought the flow of the movie was excellent as it reels you in the more you go along, so much so that you don't even want to pause it to hit the bathroom.  <br/><br/>If you like suspense, Sci-Fi's, drama's, `What if' kind of movies then see this movie (Directors cut first) and make up your own opinion.  Then watch the theatrical version after.  As said in another review, this movie is very involved and interwoven in that if you miss anything, get up to do something or tune out for a bit, you will loose your place and will get confused.  So no getting up for pop corn, no bathroom breaks and no other outside interruptions without pausing it first, very important.  In fact I would wait until you know you will have 2 hours to yourself before watching.  Good nighttime movie.  It also has good replay value too as you will understand things from a different perspective the next time around.  I wouldn't recommended this movie to those who have been abused in there early childhood, or at least if you have, be ware.  It can be a bit much at points as there are some sensitive scenes and I don't recommend to children at all. But the best movies IMO are the ones that chew you up and spit you out, and this one certainly does that."

"rappin_ris6666","Null","0","1","11 July 2004"," Great movie...if they took a lot of it out.
","What an amazing idea: guy goes back in time to save girlfriend, only to mess up everything else. It could make a very great movie, right? Sure, things could get a little bit disturbing after you altered the past, but that's normal in a psychological thriller like this, right?<br/><br/>Not this disturbing. The writers did NOT have to add such disturbing scenes as the burning of the animal and the naked kids scene.<br/><br/>On another note, violence has been in movies for years. My favorite movies have quite a lot of violence in it. Sure, it can be disturbing to some viewers, but in a movie like Kill Bill the violence is over-the-top, fun, and a get-away from normal life, which is quite violent these days, considering the war in Iraq and other war-related happenings. Tarantino, the director of Kill Bill, is an absolute genius. He makes going to the movies fun. Movies should be fun, even horror movies. This movie, though, is way too violent to be enjoyable at all.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that every two seconds someone's head is chopped off. I mean that the violence that is shown in the movie (and by violence, I not only talk about killing or gore, but rape) is so sick that it ruined my experience of watching this film.<br/><br/>We did NOT need a pedophile father in a movie like this. We did NOT need an animal's life being taken from a violent little twerp just because the animal's owner kissed his sister. What kind of kid does that? Who in their right mind would go crazy over THAT? Sure, I'd have hard feelings, but taking the life of an animal for that reason is not only stupid, but extremely unnecessary. What were the writers thinking?<br/><br/>By the way, Ashton Kutcher was great. I never thought of him as a good actor, but after this I think that he could really go far with this.<br/><br/>People are complaining about how if he went back in time and made a scar on himself, the other person knowing him would've known him with those scars all along. He altered the past, did he not? Kudos to the IMDb member who noticed that. There are a lot of plot holes, and I bet if you spent all night dissecting this movie, you would never figure out if it all worked out like it seemed to. The scene in the ending where the doctor tells the bad news to Ashton Kutcher's character just screwed everything up. I am still trying to figure this out...but I really don't want to dissect the movie into tiny little pieces because I don't think it is worth it.<br/><br/>What's with the Se7en scenes too? So they went to the theatre to watch Se7en, but did you have to sneak whole scenes into the movie that we're watching? Because after watching this, I don't think I really want to watch THAT too. Sorry if your little advertising scheme didn't work with me. Maybe it'll work with the other millions of viewers that are stupid enough to fall for your trick.<br/><br/>What's with that evil kid, Tommy? I wanted him to DIE. That's how much I hated him. He is so evil. ""Good acting"", you say? No, more like ""acting like a little piece of @#$% spoiled brat"". I have never seen such evil in a kid like that.<br/><br/>What has come to the world today when you can't even go to a movie without coming out either slightly disturbed or sick to your stomach? Sure, Titanic did that to people, but in a good way, unlike this. Saving Private Ryan? Again, it actually happened, so of course you can feel like that after. But with a movie like this, which is fictional, which people come to the theatre to enjoy, I don't know how many people can enjoy it...yes, the cinematography was incredible. I love the scenes, and the story is not bad either, but did we have to add such disturbing scenes such as the animal and naked kids scene? That was Definitely unneeded material. If these scenes were taken out and replaced with something else that didn't involve poor innocent children and animals, I would probably give this movie 5 stars. But sorry, I lost my appetite after these scenes...not to mention my liking of the movie itself."

","There is probably a lot of people that like to listen to their voice. One of them is the unemployed critic that wrote a critic on this film. I personally find it's idea imaginative. The fact is that a science fiction fan... or a person who had the pleasure of reading one of Jack London's books would not be surprised about the whole point of this movie. The book in which a prisoner who expects his death penalty in prison learns how to travel in time to avoid punishments in the prison using some interesting technics . Finally the death penalty leaves us in the book wondering if the hero escaped in the other world for real or did he die just like his body did. This movie seems to have borrowed the idea from Jack London, and I am really glad it did. Not so many movies have such interesting stories as this one. And the fact that the story goes across 13 years and goes back and forward only makes it more interesting and it kept me excited until the end. Not like other movies where you can predict what will happen in the next 10 minutes (if not a half an hour)."

","Just saw the movie for the first time on DVD, and chose the 'Director's Cut' option. I was blown away! Ashton Kutcher was very impressive. Who knew he could act? And well! Great story. Painful as hell, and very thought provoking. I am still recovering. <br/><br/>I read the reviews in mainstream media - and it got slammed. I can only imagine the version that was released in the theaters was very different from the Director's Cut. This is a very, very good film.<br/><br/>It is too tempting to discuss points of the movie here that would spoil it for others, and I will refrain.

","Do we have free will, or are we the toy soldiers of a deterministic universe? What is the concept of the self and how isolated from life-shaping events is it. The powerful drama and psychological thriller, The Butterfly Effect, asks these questions and in two hours delivers some pretty hefty possible answers. Despite film critics pans, this is Aston Kutcher as you've never seen him before: a wide range, subtle delivery and engrossing watchability. There are also steady contributions from the supporting cast, especially Amy Smart as the love interest and Melora Walters as the mother.<br/><br/>Bress and Gruber tell the story in nested, multiple-flashback/forward sequences, with clues and events of future significance scattered across the story line in an mostly cohesive package. The most gaping hole is that the hero ignores his love interest for about seven years before becoming completely devoted to her again, and this is not explored or explained as a result of some life-shaping event. There are some other round corners too, but the scope of the movie is so large and the issues it takes on so philosophically fundamental, that we can easily overlook these necessary shortcuts.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend obtaining the DVD version which contains the director's cut. This version delivers the unadulterated message with full impact, as opposed to the theatrical version and therein may lie the disagreement I have with the critics. The reviews were probably aimed at this watered down version.<br/><br/>Some fiction is so defining it redeems the role of fiction as way to explore beyond the mundane, and reminds us of the limitations of the documentary. This movie is one for your collection."

","I just rented this film and I thought it was pretty good. I was hesitant at first to see this movie as I never thought that Ashton Kutcher could play a character that wasn't dumb or wasn't at least doing something stupid. Aside from all of that, he is a better actor than people give him credit for, and he does have some acting skill. The child actors in this film are good, and they do a wonderful job. I was confused at times because I wasn't sure what Evan (Kutcher) was trying to accomplish when he goes back into his memories and also it is never explained how he could do that. I watched both versions of the film and I preferred the Director's Cut as opposed to the Theatrical Version. The Director's Cut ends on a different tone, but I prefer it as it accompanies the characteristics of Evan and what he would do just to save others. 7/10"

Reading the story on the back cover I thought ""nothing new here, it's been done before"". But, I'm glad to say, i was pleasantly surprised. Sure, the time travel theme has been used before but not in quite that way. This film managed to entertain me, make me think (god knows how many times I've asked myself ""what if....."") and stayed in my mind for a while, which is much more than I can say for most of the films I've watched the last couple of years. <br/><br/>The film deals with many subjects, from child abuse to murder and drugs but presents them as facts of life, which adds a very dark tone to the movie. I found myself caring for the characters and i was eager to see if Evan (the main character) can set things right with each attempt he made. Of course, there were some plot holes and minor things that didn't add up, but then again what sci fi or fantasy film doesn't have those. The acting was above average, with the kid actors stealing the show.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this is a great movie, one of the best released this year. I recommend it to everyone and give it 8 out of 10."

","This is a very under-appreciated film that perhaps suffers from a public bias against Ashton Kutcher - i.e. pretty boy on 70's Show, dating Demi, just eye candy, etc. And I admit I let this bias prevent me from seeing the movie in the theaters. However after renting it I am pleasantly surprised. Technically a fine movie, good direction, cinematography, sound, costumes, etc. Kutcher is capable as the lead of a cast of young but recognizable faces. Amy Smart does well as the lead female and love interest and, without giving too much of the story away, plays her various characters well. The time travel premise is given a fresh and somewhat original twist, some of the plot points come close to being unbelievable but only do so to make the point of the severity of the ""butterfly effect"". Certainly not the best movie of the year, but a nice little movie that may have been missed due to poor marketing (the TV trailers hinted at a ""Gothika"" type thriller), a slow movie month (January), and the already stated bias against Kutcher."

I originally saw this film in theatres when it was first released. I enjoyed the film but saw several holes in the theatre version. One hole is why would the filmmakers open doors and never return to them, such as the door the psychic opens when she tells Evan he has no soul and was never meant to be.<br/><br/>
If you saw the theatrical version and was not satisfied, rent the Directors cut on DVD and the film will leave you pleased. The original ending planned(the one in the Directors Cut) makes the film so much better. It all makes sense at the end and except for minor flaws, most of the questions asked get answered at the end. <br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" is a good sci-fi film that deals with Time Travel in the right way. Showing the consequences of actions. Sometimes we are asked to believe that these actions only effect the lives of the involved but after watching the end of the directors cut, Evan's final Trip makes the largest difference. More lives are touched than ever before.<br/><br/>
Ashton Kutcher gives us one of his finest performances, out doing his role in Dude,Where's My Car. I found myself getting wrapped up in the film and his performance that I forgot I dislike most of Kutcher's work. The supporting cast also puts on good performances. I really enjoyed Amy Smart in this film. <br/><br/>All in all, I think if you sit back and watch the Directors Cut of ""The Butterfly Effect"" you will enjoy the film for what it is, a good sci-fi classic. Best part about the Directors cut, it erases any thought of a sequel to ruin this film."

I'd be very surprised if someone saw this film and didn't think of a situation where they wish they had a witty comeback that they thought of years later, or what they'd like to do to a person 'knowing now what they did not know back then'.<br/><br/>A little tiring was the ability to leap through time, and reminded me of the two episodes of Quantum Leap that I saw years and years ago, which probably isn't a good thing."

","I for one was very surprised by this film.  Lots of things could've gone wrong with this film in my opinion.  For one, I don't care for Ashton Kutcher, I think he's a smartass and his show is not very funny (better than Jackass though).  The only other think the writer/directors have worked on is Final Destination 2, while that was a very entertaining picture, its very different than what this was set up to be.  I was also worried that the film might be so heavily chopped by the studio and the MPAA that we wouldn't get to see it in all its glory.  I was wrong on all accounts.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch from everyone involved, the child actors were amazing and I've never seen acting that good from kids their age.  Kutcher was a big surpise, I was pleased to see that he wasn't just the smartass guy on Punk'd but he actually could pull off a deep performance.  I had never heard of Amy Smart but she was good in the film as well.<br/><br/>I can safely say now that New Line is perhaps the most ballsy studio out there.  They take big risks with the majority of the movies they produce, and this one was yet another winner.  This movie has alot of touchy and mature subject matter and its great to see a big mainstream studio take on this kind of project.  <br/><br/>And nothing matches the greatness of the Directors Cut on the DVD.  Go out and see this version of the film cause it is fantastic; although not much is added to the first and middle sections, the ending is worth it because it basically changes the entire tone of the movie you just saw.  I've heard alot of people complain about lack of character development, I completely disagree with that, especially after viewing the Directors Cut.<br/><br/>Overall I gave this picture a 9/10, its entertaining, moving at times, well directed, written, and acted.

I found this a harsh and raw film especially for those who may have endured abuse as children, but not an inflammatory film. Issues dealt with in this were done so in a true and cold light but I never felt that they were raised to gain publicity. There is certain aspect of needing to hand over artistic license and a bit of credibility with the story, but as someone who's suffered molestation as a child, I do recommend this film. It's hard, cold, harsh and deals with the 'what if's"" I dreamed of at the time I was in the situation. I saw the R rating for this film, and almost let my 9-year-old watch it because of other films with this rating but I'm glad I did not. I really do want to own this film and watch parts of it WITH my 9-year-old son. It may be flawed as a film, but it is too well done in too many ways to dismiss it.

","When I heard the title, ""The Butterfly Effect"" it sounded like it was a different movie. And it was. This is one of the best videoeffects and perfect cutting i have ever seen since ""Requiem for a Dream"". The retrospective technique they have used, works great with this movie. It is quite hard to understand the movie at the first hour. But when it is finished, you will probably understand it all. (ex. 6th sense).<br/><br/>I think this is the first time Ashton Kutcher plays in a drama movie. He is not ready for this yet, but he does quite good. So don't let this stop you.<br/><br/>This are some extreme scenes in this movie that maybe someone with a weak soul shouldn't see.

","After seeing 'The Butterfly Effect', I wondered if it could have been any better than it already was. Yes, it had Ashton Kutcher's deplorable self and Amy Smart's always naive/confused character, but it was an interesting movie nevertheless. 'The Butterfly Effect' may not have been the best title for the film, considering Evan (Kutcher) changed events in his own life, not events of the world, but it showed us each disturbing event in his life and how one thing, even the tiniest, can change something, from going to jail to getting his arms blown off. But after analyzing this movie to its full extent, I have to go back and remember why he did all this in the first place. The movie does 'run away' with any and every event that happens in Evan's life, but it is pleasing to see that a movie as poor as this actually wraps itself up in a very pleasing ending, I might add. All in all, 'The Butterfly Effect' may not be a movie you're wanting to see, but the Cautious Critic says to give it a shot."

","In some respect, this film reminded me of Memento, so if you liked or hated Memento, you might feel similarly about The Butterfly Effect as well. The story kept me interested the whole time as I kept trying to piece together ""what happened"" before the answers were given. In some cases, it was easy and in others, the pieces only fell in place at the very last moment.<br/><br/>I saw the film with a friend who was almost ready to walk out in the middle because the type of violence made her sick. There's far less graphic violence than in ""Kill Bill"", but unlike the ""blood ballet"" effect in Kill Bill, the violent scenes in this film feel more real and are much easier to empathize with."

","I was just glad to pick this one. Thriller combining two causal theories like chaos theory and theory of 'possible worlds' (I do not know exact English term, but this might as well be it), I do not recall to have ever see in my life. So there go the points for originality from me.<br/><br/>Acting was pretty good too, especially when almost whole cast acted each in several different roles as the timelines switched... The pace was steady and I was intrigued till the (little cheesy) end. My impression from the movie was good.<br/><br/>___________possible spoilers follow.<br/><br/>It was only then, when I thought about it, what was missing and how it all fitted together. My conclusion is the whole storyline is rather naive, since it only deals with a dozen of people in more or less the same environment. As I understand the chaos theory, even the smallest change can lead to unpredictable, incomparably more substantial consequences. Yet what we see are only mild changes in lifestyles of the protagonists (though they are viewed subjectively as radical, of course), nothing else.<br/><br/>Moreover, the main character doesn't really know what's happening, and he thinks linearly, such as one decision made otherwise could fix the timeline, only with his personal narrow goals in mind, which is obviously untrue. Such ignorance is quite understandable, but the audience gets equally narrow results from the interventions to the timeline and that is the flaw I have in mind - constant effort to keep it simple.<br/><br/>The next thing I find little bit over the edge is how easily he can jump from one possible world into another with exact memories from the current and all previous ones. That's in my opinion directly forged trick. The ability of mind to switch the timeline is wild enough so more subtlety would be in order.<br/><br/>But it is all just nitpicking I guess. For the sake of the plot things had to be trivialized a lot, or maybe didn't have to but were...<br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed the flick but I probably wouldn't want to see it again.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ShinKyo81","7","0","1","16 June 2004"," Brilliant, outstanding and surprisingly effective movie
","(Spoilers throughout the whole review, be warned :P)<br/><br/>I heard about ""The Butterfly Effect"" (TBE) from a friend of mine and even he told me it was really impressive, I couldn't find the time to go and watch it... till last weekend, when I went to the cinema, expecting something worth the watch. And sure it was :). TBE is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while; I knew some bits and pieces of what the movie was about, but I couldn't make it up in my mind: ""childhood trauma? time traveling using dairies? what the hell are they thinking!"". It's obvious that when handling such a theme like time travels, you gotta be open-minded and try not the spend the whole movie yelling ""oh look, there's a time travel paradox"" or ""how could this happen if he's not in that timeline..."" and this kind of rubbish, because if you do, you'll ruin the movie.<br/><br/>You just have to get comfortable in your seat, grab your popcorn bucket and enjoy. Because that's why movies are made for: to entertain the audience. So, expecting a 2 hour enjoyable, well-spent time, I went to see TBE. After a prologue scene which at first glance seems to be forwarding future events, we get introduced to Evan as a child. The first couple of situations embraces Evan's blackout problem and shows how many tragic events he had suffered during his childhood. As a doctor's advice to help him with his blackouts, he starts writing a diary, in order to keep his day-by-day experiences. After several unfortunate events and a fast-paced intro to Evan's life, we meet Ashton Kutcher as Evan in his 20's, going at the university, having a normal life, with no blackouts at all. <br/><br/>But then, and with no reason, he finds out that when reading his diaries he wrote years ago, he gets back in time and is able to change the events, which means changing the future. So he starts finding out what happened when he had the blackouts, realizing several traumas he did not remember. And while at it, he tries to change the course of the tragic events that involved the girl he fancied, her brother and a friend. The more times he try to mend the futures of his friends, the worst they get. And that's quite an interesting way to keep you at the edge of your seat through the whole movie, because you can't see a good ending. It's getting worse and worse, and sometimes stupidly worse, but effective. <br/><br/>IMO, Ashton Kutcher delivers an splendid performance, having different personalities during the whole movie. We'll see whether he evolves as an actor or he remains in the teenage-movie star cliché. I believe he's got the talent to evolve towards something more serious than his previous performances.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" has got an incredibly fast-paced action, so fast that I was overwhelmed after 45 minutes! There's no movie out there that creeps you with child abuse, murder and traumatic events in a short period of time and gets a good result. The story embraced me, some moments scared the crap out of me, some others made me laugh, but I was kept entertained from the title to the ending credits. And when the last scene faded out, I realized I had been entertained during 2 hour-ish in front of a theater screen, which unfortunately it's not a common thing between nowadays movies. At least, that's what I think it's the main purpose of film-making: to entertain. And believe me, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a perfect example of entertainment.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look! 10/10"
"spide-1","10","0","1","14 June 2004"," *Directors cut* *SPOILERS*
","I really liked this movie and I got my hands on this directors cut edition. It has couple more scenes and a different ending. The extra scenes deepen the plot a bit. But I think the ending in the theatrical cut is much better than the one in the directors cut.<br/><br/>In the theatrical cut Evan goes back to the day he meets Kayleigh and tell her to stay away from him and they both live their lives apart.<br/><br/>In the directors Evan goes back to the day he was to be born and ""hangs"" himself around the umbilical cord while still in the womb.<br/><br/>This isn't as sad as the original and I think the movie would be the best with the extra scenes and the original ending. I'm not saying the movie is bad with this ending but if someone is seeing the movie the first time I think the best movie experience is gained with the original ending.<br/><br/>Still the best movie I've seen in 2004."
"TheMovieMark","Null","0","2","14 June 2004"," It takes you out of your comfort zone
","Intense. Shocking. Disturbing. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' reviews. But, these words equally refer to ""The Butterfly Effect."" I don't care what the critics say; I like this movie. It's original, it's totally unpredictable, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Formulaic, it most definitely is not.<br/><br/>One of the big questions people have about this movie is, ""Can Ashton Kutcher pull off a serious role?"" I'm here to say that Ashton and his ""look at how serious I am"" beard managed to impress me. You've gotta understand that Ashton is being asked to portray a character that not only had some very traumatic childhood moments, but it's also a character who has been stuck with the same hair cut for the past 10 years. I'd like to see Tom Hanks pull that off!<br/><br/>After the screening I heard an older woman say, ""Wow, I didn't know Ashton Kutcher could act like that."" I think a lot of people are going to have the same reaction. I had my reservations going in, but I felt he stepped up to the task and held his own.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does a good job as well. Most notably, Amy Smart (best known as Noel's girlfriend on ""Felicity"") turns in an admirable performance. Thanks to the time travel aspect of the movie, her character was required to reflect several different personality types. She handled this very well and showed good range. And Eric Stoltz climbed out of whatever rock he's been under to effectively play the sleaze ball pedophile dad of Amy's character.<br/><br/> Is this movie for the faint of heart? No way. It has possibly some of the most disturbing images I've seen in a movie since ""Seven."" It's not overly gory though. This movie disturbs you the most with what is implied rather than what is shown. You see what's *about* to happen and then it's up to you to form the image in your own mind.<br/><br/>Is this movie totally plausible? Of course not. I've actually heard some critics complain that you have to ""suspend disbelief"" too much. Come on, it's about a guy who can hop scotch through time and fill in the blanks of his childhood! It's called a CONCEPT! Ever heard of judging a movie based on whether or not it works within the concept?? If you're the type of person who complains about the scientific accuracy of EVERY single movie you see, then consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>""So Johnny, what exactly is the 'Butterfly Effect'?"" Ah, good question. It's an illustration of the chaos theory, which states that, ""the beating of butterfly wings in China can affect the course of an Atlantic hurricane"" (Douglas Adams). Once Evan realizes he can fill in the blanks of his past, he tries to do so in such a way that the future will be changed for the better. But as his dad tries to warn him, ""You can't change who people are without destroying who they were."""

As soon as the result come out, we understand the choice we made is foolish or not! Most of time, the result even a devasting mistake.

The first time they met, he told her threatening words then push Kelly and her brother back to their mother, then got good education and lived a good life.

","I watched this the other day, and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. There's so much utter tosh coming out of Hollywood's ar@e these days that it's nice to see a film where I don't feel like suing for the lost hours of my life back. (That Gladiat- sorry - lord of th- sorry- star wa- sorry TROY! looks a good one to miss with it's diabolically clichéd script, wooden acting, cheesy lines, over the top special effects and tediously triumphant sound track to mention a few - Anyone seen the trailer yet? had me in hysterics.)<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the film! Generally good, reasonable story, fairly original (in the terms of what's been out over the last few years). A bit scary - not in a horror way though -, I watched this in the dark on my own before bed, kinda freaked me out a bit when getting to sleep. Kept thinking the time police were gonna come and get me (not that that's got anything to do with the film). Hmm, really must see someone about those dreams.<br/><br/>Anyway, for a change it's a time travelly type film that doesn't leave too many paradoxes. Leaves some interesting questions to think about. It also focuses on the selfishness of helping others when deep down you want something in return. To be a true 'gentleman' you can only truly help someone when you give up something yourself.<br/><br/>Shame about the predictable end. I worked it out a good half hour before it finished, although the little pre-ending twist did make me think I'd got it wrong. But no, Hollywood film mentality won through, and we got the happy ending - exactly as I'd predicted it.<br/><br/>Er anyway, lets say 7/10? Although to be honest, I think I really wanted to have a rant rather than review this film, oh well. Feel better now."

The major factor that clinched it for me was the acting or John Amedori (Evan:13) - he looks just like ashton kutcher as a kid and acts out the vital scenes with skill. The film is a blend of introducing evans childhood and then explaining segments that you are not shown and that evan hasn't seen either as he blacked out! Its a great tale of self discovery that we all would be so fortunate to follow in this way. The plot is basic but not predictable and the sub plot architecture sucks you in, letting you go to return to the main plot for very short periods of time while you catch your breath. For me, its a more contemporary Shawshank Redemption - but i don't wanna start a rukuss with Shawshank fans :)"

","I really enjoyed this. I was having a bit of a time travel day, having watched ""The Final Countdown"" (yeah, I know), on DVD in the morning and then this at the flicks in the afternoon. I came to it with no expectations and walked away happily surprised.<br/><br/>The film's premise is intelligent and well executed. It's been said before that time travel is only possible in the mind, due to the physical stresses it would put on the human body if attempted any other way. The film takes this idea and runs with it. We are never given compete answers as to why Evan possesses this ability. It is hinted that he has inherited it from his father, perhaps as some kind of brain anomaly. But as a child, at times of great stress he blacks out and in later life discovers the significance of this. <br/><br/>The story is very brave at confronting many of the horrific issues in society; paedophilia, prostitution, childhood sadism, male sexual abuse, physical disability, and their effects on the individual. It doesn't sensationalise them but shows the long term results that such actions will have. In this respect it's thought provoking and hopefully illuminating.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent, especially Amy Smart who undergoes the most radical transformations during the course of the movie.<br/><br/>The one scene which didn't ring true to me was Evan's over the top reaction when the brother of his girlfriend confronts him on the college campus. I understand that this course of events was needed to further the story, but it just seems suddenly out of character for Evan. <br/><br/>There is a very nice touch though, which shows the degree to which the story has otherwise been thought through. After returning from every time trip, Evan's brain grows new synapse pathways, creating new memories to fill in the gaps as his actions have changed history. A painful process which portrays how he is going against the natural order of things.<br/><br/>So a very enjoyable and interesting film about being careful what you wish for and the importance of thinking through your actions. I recommend it."

But the sequences that played in reverse indicating all the painful events were being undone was expertly done and was accompanied by great visuals and sound. I think more<br/><br/>powerful than just stepping into a hokey old time machine for a while.<br/><br/>All the terrible things that happen to the four main characters in the many<br/><br/>different reincarnations of reality are not far-fetched at all to those of us that have lived life for a while. The most powerful image to me was the deep laceration cut into the face of Kayleigh as a child and then the subsequent deep scar in her face as she appeared on screen as a very unhappy but resigned prostitute.<br/><br/>I didn't expect the happy ending. All Evan's efforts to do something positive in his past end up with negative results. So when he finally achieves a positive end by doing something negative, it's a bit ironic and perhaps not all that credible. But I admit I was relieved that the film ended on a positive note after so much darkness and despair. Hope still springs eternal and I drove home with a good feeling. ***1/2!"

A film that you follow with great ease, grips you tightly by attempting to answer some of the 'what if?' questions that we all wonder about in life.  What if I could change that one time I said this or done that, things would be better?

I have never thought of Kutcher as a talented actor, more of a ""always play the pretty guy"" - not that I find him that pretty - kind of an actor. In actually having to do some serious acting, he immediately earned my respect. I am not saying he is Oscar material, but in this movie, he shows that at least he has the potential to become a really great actor. By starring in this feature, he also kind of broke away from always starring in comedy. Smart move. Now considering the actual movie; this is a smart and mystic well-acted film. I urge anyone to go watch it. The cast are more then convincing in their roles, I especially like the actors playing the early years. As for the script, there is not much to say. It's great.

The film bascially tells us that the choices we make in life are critical and can effect even the slightest of future events, unlike Evan, we can not transport ourselves back in time to alter our past to change the future which is why we must not live cautiously but live and make choices that we can see the consequences of."

","I only have one thing to say.  If you like movies that are good, then watch this movie.  When I first saw the preview, I thought this movie would be dumb.  A friend an I have a rule.  If there are more than 3 plot twists in a preview, then the movie is going to be bad.  It's worked for so long, but now it's failed me. I can't begin to tell you how good this movie is.  If your expecting Kelso or Punk'd then you're going to be dissapointed.  Ashton Kutcher does an amazing acting job, and the movie's plot is simply amazing.  I believe it's good for just about all ages (other than children) and you can check the demographic rating if you don't believe me.  If you have a chance, see this movie!"

","This movie really got me. The plot is both interesting and surprising and it is one of those movies that makes you think once you have left the room. Even though it does somehow deal with time travelling, it does not get into the silliness of actual time travelling but it is a study of both the mind and the subscocient.<br/><br/>In a more technical way, even though the script might not be as good as the direction, camerawork and special effects, it doesn't get out of line and get lost in silly explanations (that you would usually get in movies of this sort). The acting by Ashton Kutcher is actually surprisingly good and all the cast in the movie does a good job playing different characters while still being the same person (you will understand more when you see it, :-D)<br/><br/>It deals with the question that haunts us from time to time: ""If you could change anything in the past, would you?"" and it delivers a not so surprising ending but that satisfies the big majority.<br/><br/>I really liked it and I think it is worth seeing it."

","I have already heard too many people commenting about the flaws of this film and I have to admit, I saw them too. But, every movie has its flaws, and I know that this movie has a good amount but lets try to look past them. This movie is about a man who tries to go back in time and change everything bad in his life that has happened, only making it worse. Not until the point where he is handicapped does he realize that he may never get it right and that this is the best he could possibly do for the people he cares about. But after finding out his mother has lung cancer, he once again goes back in time to change it, but this time not for self gain. I think this is a key part in the movie. It is the theme and it displays his realization that his aim is to make everyone else he loves happy. However if you are like some of the critics who rate this film poorly then obviously you don't think this is a good idea of the writer. But, what you don't understand is that writing a movie alone is a difficult task, but writing a movie like this is even harder. So, if you look past minor flaws in the script, then you may see that this is a good film put together. Ashton Kutcher is very beleivable and displayed his acting abilities better than as a stoner in ""Dude, where's my car?"""

","Considering that there is an awful lot of bad films out there currently plaguerising past successful film plots; this one, although has clearly done the same, has a tendency to encourage you to forgive it's bandwagon jump. For the first hour of viewing, the story line leaves you confused and bewildred as to what the hell is going on with the main characters.  And then as soon as everything starts to click into place the plot becomes slightly intriguing if not fascinating - but, be warned - not exactly original.  Apart from Kutchener and Eric Stoltz's performance the rest of the acting crew appear to have skipped drama lessons.  Some parts of the plot sadly let's itself down; like for example how is Kutchener managing to time travel back to a defining moment in his troubled chilhood.  My own imagination was rather stretched to fill in these sort of gaps and in order to enjoy the film as much as I really wanted to - delusion aided this pleasure, if you know what I mean?  On the whole though, I would say this is a good film and well worth a watch.  However it indeed could have easily been directed and written much better.  I regulary compared the film to a computer adventure type game - Like the 'Shadow of Memories' available on the PS2 and now the XBOX.  My summary is that I would rate the film along side the '13th Floor'.  I would  score it 6 out of 10 and am glad that I watched it."

I am defiantly glad I ignored those bad reviews and went to see it anyway.<br/><br/>This film is not a Donnie Darko, this is a very good film, I thought if anyone deserved to be slagged off for poor acting, then it would be Amy Smart, Ashton Kutcher is really impressive in this film, the only other film I previously saw him in was Dude Wheres My Car and this is a very different film. This is a film made for someone who likes a challenging film, a film that makes your mind think.<br/><br/>The film is about a kind of time travel, the best thing about the film is that when he does time travel he changes small tiny things which alter the whole way things go, the film actually left me wanting more at the end, I think the film was very clever but was not too complicated, very good acting from all the Evan characters, Young, Teen & Adult!

","That classic Hollywood synthesis of a miscast pretty boy trying desperately to impress and a useless premise masquerading as drama, The Butterfly Effect irks me most because it could have been brilliant. Okay, so the script flails and sinks like a paraplegic in a vat of treacle. Yes, the performances are a uniform Dulux White Emulsion of bland featurelessness. Admittedly, the politics are about as offensively misjudged as you could expect from the great morality vacuum of Hollywood. Underneath it all, however, there is a great film struggling to get out.<br/><br/>No, not really.<br/><br/>In a desperate bid to appeal to everybody, this film ends up appealing only to the niche market of 13 year old girls, and even then they'd have to be masochists to cope with it. By the time the movie has fudged on from its desperately unsatisfying opening you'd need an eye-opener of Clockwork Orange proportions to keep your vision fixed on the screen. If you're waiting for that, you'll be waiting forever. The film unfolds (or should that be dribbles on?) with a tedious inevitability, made worse by the muddled politics. Do we hate Jocks for bullying Sonic the Goth-hog (apologies!) or do we consider their lifestyle to be the Mecca for which the only alternative is crack-whore or amputee? While Amy Smart manages to drag a series of fair performances from the Dressing-up box of useless female roles, Kutcher is a cardboard cut-out. He is cast as a modern Goldilocks, spurning realities for being too normal, too gay or too cripple-y, all the while coming across as the only character he is capable of playing : a self-important frat-tw*t with the performance nuances of a Real Doll and the emotional depth of a particularly perky dinner plate.<br/><br/>Oh, and while I'm on a flow, if anybody truly thinks that Paedophilia is cured by young boys shouting at you then you have a Daily Mail grasp of mental illness and perhaps this film is for you, with its racist, misogynist and worthlessly contrived construction simply adding a layer of dog eggs to the faecal mix. Is the audience really supposed to cheer Kutcher as he commits genocide because the victims are all very bad men who do naughty things? Maybe he should take a blade to the directors and save the world from this steaming mess? (Please nobody do this, it is better that they live in shame)<br/><br/>Dear God, don't see this film. The risible ending, the laughable characters and the jaw-dropping insensitivity of the central subject matter are more than enough to make me beg for health warnings on posters."

","I will start with my praises of this film- Firstly, it is a good idea and carried out in a logical way that is not presented as confusinly as it could be. Secondly, Ashton Kutcher is actually not that bad a lead.. i wasnt one of his biggest fans but he has convinced me that i should at least give him a chance and will not be writing off any of his future films by his association!  However, he did pretty well in the butterfly effect and equipped himself more than averagely.<br/><br/>NOw for the negatives and a few SPOILERS: Although the idea of being able to change the present by changing the past is a good one, i find it difficult to sit through these kinda horrific flashback images of paedophilia, child killers and victims, cancer victims, limbless people, mental health problems,gay prison bullies, drug addicted prostitutes... You can't half help feeling that it is for effect..I mean - its gonna be more interesting than just having boring nice scenarios to keep replaying but when these did come, i just thanked god that it had lightened up. The guy who wrote this script apparently came up with Final Destination and it is a shame that the twisted humour from that film did not make the transfer. The only time i laughed was when Kayleigh's brother was a twisted demeted dog killing psycho kid and the next he was a religious prep boy - that was just sheer disbelief. Some of the plot lines dont match up and i would tell you which ones if i could really remember - thats the main problem. Its got a good cast and a good premise but it loses itself in its desperation to stand out and thus becomes a muddled vehicle for Kutcher and Amy Smart to carry on climbing from."

The less you know about the plot the better, as it takes a while to wind into the main theme of the film, but when it does start to pick up speed you can't help but get sucked into what's going on.<br/><br/>Superb."

It is well acted, and completely preposterous, and I found myself entertained. The ending was not what I expected and the film is all the better for not being totally predictable. Ashton Kutcher proves that he can hold a storyline convincingly but I felt that Amy Smart, as the doomed/happy/doomed/happy love interest stole the honours for impact. She had a way of looking totally downbeat in one scene and stunning in the next. I really cared what happened to her character. The film pulls no punches, and some of the scenes are very dark, but I was glad they were not watered down, as this really added to the human interest of the storyline. Recommended as a good way of killing a couple of hours, but don't expect to be adding it to your top 100."

","Spoiler Alert This film for me was an anticlimax, it was very good don't get me wrong, but I had heard that it was a thinking film, a film that you just had to watch over and over again. However I walked out and didn't feel the need to see it again and didn't even want to see it again.  I suppose to a certain extent it's a thinking film as it is a film that you talk about and therefore thought is involved. Yet, it does not stretch your thoughts to understand it, like I was led to believe.<br/><br/>In my opinion it is based on the concept that ignorance is bliss and you always want what you can't have. It's about a young mans struggle to come to term with his disease by dwelling on his mistakes in his childhood, and discovering he can switch between his parallel universes.  However for me it is about him wanting certain things and not realising that is the exact reason he cannot get them, greed.<br/><br/>He wasn't in love with her from the start, only when he knew he couldn't have her, he only went back to begin with because he wanted something from her.<br/><br/>Some say it has an unhappy ending, however I feel that it is a good ending, it's not traditional or fairytale it is the realistic one, the one he chose, surely that makes it happy?<br/><br/>This film is trying not to be Hollywood but is, it's aimed at teenagers who think they are thinking but everything is laid out plain and simple for them. You cannot take this film to seriously or think about it too much as you would spend hours picking it to pieces, noticing the flaws and forgetting that you did actually enjoy it when you watched it for what it was. One thing to remember, this film is not time travel exactly it is more about parallel universes.<br/><br/>The star for me was Elden Hanson (Lenny), who acted amazingly in all of his parallel selves. Also Logan Lerman (Evan at 7) did a fantastic job. Not really Ashton Kutcher (his first notable ""serious"" acting job) the supposed ""star"" of the film.<br/><br/>The issues the film dealt with: paedophile, disabilities, mental illness and love were not done in a tactful manner, it could be very upsetting to watch, and neither did it seem that it was written by anyone who knew anything about those issues."

","I've become increasingly frustrated in reading reviews for this movie, and now that I have seen the film, have become even more angry at the vicious and seemingly completely unjustified attack that has been directed at Ashton Kutcher, the star of this film. It seems that the ever-fickle and hypocritical media have decided to hop on the band-wagon that someone cruel started and make all their reviews centred around how terrible and unbelievable Ashton Kutcher is as Evan Treborn. Well, after seeing the film, I wonder why it is that some actors and actresses can't get a break. Ashton is UTTERLY believable in this film, whether serious, upset, confused or comical. Sure, it is occasionally hard to watch him and not think of Kelso, but I certainly don't think his performance in this film was at all bad. Overall, the film was engaging and enthralling and exciting to watch, helped I'm sure by the strong leading man. All I can say is I hope that the film-going public will break through the b-shit out there and see Ashton for what he is -  a very talented actor and a charming and honest lead man. I highly recommend this film, but not as a comedy horror, as it has been tagged. It's part sci-fi, part thriller, part drama, part violence and part romance. It has something for everyone, but I would say if you're not the type to let the logic slip a bit, it would probably be all a little unbelievable. One thing I would fault the film on is its chemistry between Ashton and Amy Smart...in that there is none. I believed that the characters, especially Evan, truly cared about one another. But as for any kind of spark - it all felt very mis-cast. Still, it was the first film since Donnie Darko that made me go 'Hmmm...so this meant that meant...huh?!'. And leave Ashton alone! The Butterfly Effect, for me and I'm sure a lot of other people, proves that Ashton is ready for the big-time."

This is a very well written thought provoking movie and comments on our own lives and they are what we make them and what happens in them is ultimately defined by what actions we take. The ending provides some sort of resolution for the love between Evan and Kayley and proves that the only way he could make both their lives better is if they were never in each others at all. Some might say that an ending with it actually being all in Evan's head would have been better but that would sour the whole message of the film and instead of teaching us that what ever we do it ultimately changes our life, it would have just made it a pointless movie which we could have just as easily thought about at home.

(Dont give me john nash as an example :), this is different; a completely new world these characters are living in) Questioning reality, the directors are doing...<br/><br/>The answer: we cant know but we can guess Evans father could have found a way to go back in time and (we dont know his way, maybe he cant do it in the institution but) he could have used protection (:P) rather than just trying to strangle his unwanted son-the last who can travel in time I found this as a big gap and i am sure there are many more gaps (I only watched the movie once) and the director leaves the decision to us<br/><br/>On the other hand this is only a subtheme :)<br/><br/>In other posts I saw question marks about the blackouts<br/><br/>In my opinion the life he lives until he discovers his ability is just another trial where he tries to make it better... showing that gives us backround information and the plot is very cleverly set as we only see the endings of the blackouts (the picture, Evan holding the knife in the middle of the kitchen) this gives us the clue that at some time earlier he had found out his ability and maybe he tried to work things out a million times but couldnt do it. he doesn't remember these trials when we first see him going back because his brain forgets stuff due to the damages this thing causes.<br/><br/>Well thats what i think... :)"

He always went back to change the times, but when he reached the present, his black outs were still part of his past, except for the one he had changed, so he always had the journals to other times, because he never went to the same black out twice.<br/><br/>

Glad I didn't! Hence this comment to make up for some of the slaughter going on.<br/><br/>I did find it a bit too theatrical at times, grotesque maybe even, but not nearly as much as, say a Matrix trilogy or pretty much any Hollywood blockbuster that requires you to suspend your disbelief for over 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I'll praise this movie some more but I don't know how to do it without spoiling it. So...<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>The plot seemed sound to me, pretty cohesive for a temporal mindbender. Ashton Kutcher might have looked a little closer at the character his younger versions were portraying. Still, not bad at all. It wasn't the easiest part to play, I suppose.<br/><br/>The kids in the movie did an excellent job. That li'l psycho Tommy character really freaked me out, bone-chilling! Both young Evans were brilliantly cast, and I'm confident we haven't seen the last of them on the big screen.<br/><br/>Yes, it was a tad lengthy but it offered enough different perspectives along the way to stay interesting. As for the ending, I had a feeling they'd show us you just can't win 'em all when traveling through time. So, unsatisfying or not, I guess it's a believable ending.<br/><br/>As for the ultra-violence, yes the movie shocked, so it didn't let me down. Since I chose to watch a thriller I got what I wanted out of it, and then some. Luckily, it wasn't graphic to the max - even though the plot allowed for an unwatchable snuff type depiction - but it was more than enough to get my synapses firing.<br/><br/>No regrets here, these were 2 hours well-spent!"

There were fewer diary entries each time he changed the past.  The reason some of them can remain is because he wrote in the time BEFORE they happened and could then return to the beginning of the memory.

In fact, my favourite movies are Donnie Darko, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club and (now) The Butterfly Effect among many, but if you liked the movies I just mentioned than you'll like Butterfly Effect. It has a genuine indy feel to it and it just felt so...unique! I'd like to address the very unwarranted opinion that The Butterfly Effect is a ""cheap rip-off"" of Donnie Darko. In my opinion this criticism misses the whole point of the film. The film is hardly intended to be a technical time-travel thriller. Instead it is a psychological thriller with a tad of romance (that doesn't end ""happily ever after"" mind you). To liken Donnie Darko to The Butterfly Effect is to make a very superficial link. However, in summary it's a movie that I will DEFINATELY buy on DVD as I loved it and it's going to join the ranks of all the other good films I've ever watched."

What a joy this movie is to shred! It is flawed, flawed, flawed! It has horrible errors in continuity and cohesiveness in general. Yet, somehow, it is still a good movie.<br/><br/>The writer's logic is often grossly stupid at points. One example is the note that starts the movie; to whom would it have been written, why would failure have meant death, and if the change occured, would that location have still existed to house the note, failure or no failure?<br/><br/>
There are lots of items out of place in their time periods.<br/><br/>
The main character was called by three different first names (Kevin, Evan, and Brian) in the beginning of the movie before any changes, and at one point a vehicle is a red Chevy SUV, then it is a burgandy Ford SUV even though nothing was changed at that point. It is like working a puzzle. This thing is worse than the Star Trek Nitpickers Guild! I will definitely buy it on DVD and shake my finger and go, ""Ah ha!"" with great delight!

"haniff","Null","0","1","28 March 2004"," Fantastic Film!
","Well, there are films, and there are films.  Many films are made for entertainment purposes, and many because the writer/director has something to say, and really doesn't care what people think of it - the journey and the experience of making the film is enough to reward the writer and director.  I would say 100% of films in Hollywood are just made to make money, hence the sequels, and great ideas come from determined people elsewhere with a vision - Hollywood leaps on these and foreign films, for ideas to make money.<br/><br/>This film is something personal, but fits in the ""middle-ground"" it wouldn't have been made without the potential to make money for it's investors.<br/><br/>So films come and go, you don't really care, it's a bit of fun and that's it.  Then, films do come along that have something special, or just come at the right time.  The Butterfly Effect is one of those films, you will either be really affected by it in some way or another, or you will think it's nonsense.<br/><br/>I luckily, watched the film without any preconceptions, to me they were all unknown actors, I didn't really recogonise or re-call any films they were in. To me it wasn't about the acting and that type of thing - perhaps I'm one of the lucky people to see it in it's ""Pure"" form, not having any baggage with the actors from previous films, which may have spoilt it.<br/><br/>It truly is a wonderful film that works on many levels, it will be entertainment fodder for most people, but I don't think it was made purely on that level - fantastic films rarely are.<br/><br/>There just aren't many films that can truly affect you, and make you think if you ""get it"".  The Butterfly Effect is one of those rare gems, that can really move you.<br/><br/>For someone who's always known the term ""The Butterfly Effect"" from chaos and Fractal theory, and generally subscribe to the theory of parallel worlds. I've always loved the idea of ""The Butterfly Effect"" generally applied to the weather. In reality it applies to everyone and everything. This films pushes that point pretty well. It also is about time, we all have photos and think about the past.<br/><br/>Is there something you did you wished you didn't do? Is there times when you've had a ""deja vu""? Have there been times when you knew the future to some extent, or had<br/><br/>feelings, about things, which perhaps you mind had in a dream?<br/><br/>Is this The Butterfly Effect? I think it is. It's something we have all experienced, but generally brush off and ignore.<br/><br/>That's what it's about.  There is no ""score"", it simply doesn't fit into a film you can box a number out of ten - it truly transcends that.<br/><br/>The way you behave, what you say, and what you do, has a profound effect in your life.  You have one life here, think a little, and try to make the best of it, and treat people with respect.  A reminder of that important lesson, to me makes it quite simply as one of the best films I have ever seen. It's probably the most hardest lesson to learn, and if anything that reminds people to be less like robots, and take control, the better.<br/><br/>This film is like meditation - it can have a profound affect, depending what you believe, can actaully change your life. It's certainly made me think and behave and have a slightly different view on life."

"zardoz-13","Null","0","1","13 March 2004"," Truly, a flight to remember!!!
","Nothing can prepare you for the shocks and surprises in the imaginative movie ""The Butterfly Effect"" (*** out of ****) starring Ashton Kutcher, with Amy Smart, Elden Henson, Eric Stoltz, and Melora Walters. Not only have first-time directors J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, who wrote ""Final Destination 2,"" fashioned an original, mind-warping psychological chiller about the consequences of time travel, but also these ambitious helmers have woven skillfully into their preposterous but inventive plot a cross-section of everything good and bad about 21st century American society. Incidentally, the film derives its odd title from an idea in chaos theory that the least consequential event, such as a butterfly flying can have sweeping consequences. According to the movie's opening title card, a butterfly flapping its wings in Asia could trigger a typhoon on the other side of the globe.<br/><br/>Appropriating a classic science fiction premise from the twice-filmed H.W. Wells novel ""The Time Machine,"" Gruber & Bress have managed to simplify a surefire formula without sabotaging it. First, instead of a scientific genius as the protagonist, they have given us a contemporary, black-out prone, twentysomething college student who travels back in time through his mind and learns the same lessons the Wells' hero discovered. In other words, ""The Butterfly Effect"" shuns glossy, sophisticated, high-tech gadgetry, so it resembles a ""Twilight Zone"" horror fantasy more than a gimmick riddled sci-fi saga. Second, they have omitted the usual mumbo-jumbo, pseudo-scientific explanations about the logistics of time travel that would slow down the action and relied entirely on special effects. Although the story operates on a superficial level, Gruber & Bress have endowed ""Butterfly"" with greater gravity than most mainstream Hollywood films dare. The action in this serious mind-bender of a melodrama features several unsavory themes, such as child molestation, animal abuse, prison rape, vandalism, and prostitution. Most people attend movies to escape from these real-life concerns, but Gruber & Bress integrate these issues into the plot.<br/><br/>Cast as undergraduate psychology major Evan Treborn, Kutcher discovers accidentally he can travel back in time to his childhood to right wrongs. No, he doesn't get there in a chrome-plated chariot with blinking and flashing lights. He does it in his head. You see, Evan grew up without a father. Society institutionized his dad because he was mentally unstable, and Evan apparently inherited the Treborn curse. Evan suffers recurring black outs and cannot remember what happened after those black outs. As a form of therapy, a psychologist recommends young Evan start a journal, so he can jog his memory. Thirteen years later, Evan has filled up a stack of notebooks. All he has to do relive a page from his past and change it for better or worse is to read it and he finds himself sucked back in the past.<br/><br/>Evan's childhood memories are horrid enough to stigmatize anybody, and his mom no longer wants him associating with his small circle of friends: Kayleigh (Amy Smart of ""Rat Race""), Lenny (Elden Henson of ""Idle Hands"") and Kayleigh's younger brother Tommy (William Lee Scott of ""Identity""). Earlier, this quartet of ne'er-do-wells found themselves in over their collective heads after they stashed a small stick of T.N.T. with a burning cigarette as its fuse in the mail box at a suburban home just so they can witness the demolition. Incidentally, ""The Butterfly Effect"" contains a high quotient of the most politically incorrect violence since ""Final Destination 2."" One sadistic lad traps a dog in a burlap bag, saturates it with kerosene, and burns the canine alive. Eventually, tough little Tommy turns against Evan when our hero gets romantic with Kayleigh. Meantime, Lenny suffers a seizure as a result of their mailbox vandalism. It doesn't help matters either that Kayleigh's pedophilic father (Eric Stoltz of ""Killing Zoe"" in a real acting stretch) has been making home movies and molesting his daughter. Later, Evan 's conscientious but naïve mom, Andrea (Arabian-born Melora Walters of ""Cold Mountain""), decides to pull Evan out of school, and they move away to another town.<br/><br/>When Evan returns many years later to question Kayleigh about the home movie incident, she flies into a rage and chew him out for dredging up bad memories. The next day an angry Tommy calls Evan and reveals Kayleigh has committed suicide. As Evan pores over his journals, he finds he can go back in the past and change things for the better. The only problem is every time Evan goes back and changes things, he changes not one thing but everything, and everything winds up going from bad to worse.<br/><br/>Obviously, ""The Butterfly Effect"" isn't just another Ashton Kutcher escapade like ""Dude, Where's My Car,"" ""Just Married,"" or ""My Boss's Daughter."" This grim, heavyweight yarn about second chances & beyond furnishes Kutcher with his first straight-faced, dramatic role. Yes, Kutcher crosses over with a performance convincing and charismatic enough to give Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Dwayne Johnson, and Guy Pearce some long overdue competition. Your ability to accept Kutcher as this offbeat, tortured hero with powers to change the past will determine how willing you are to suspend your disbelief and enjoy this riveting nail biter. Mind you, ""Butterfly"" isn't without its flaws. Some are more obvious than others. Nevertheless, Gruber & Bress maintain enough hair-raising momentum and forge characters who earn our sympathy, so the holes in the plot fade into the background. The cast is uniformly excellent, with the younger actors excelling, especially Jesse James as an incredibly savage young Tommy Miller at age 13. Altogether, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a flight to remember."

Also, there were many parts of the movie that kind of freak you out, but those were not the memorable parts like in other movies. The plot held me in and the strange occurrances made it that much more appealing. Also at the end, all of the questions were answered, but they didn't just come right out and give it to you; the film makes you think. Overall it was unbelievably well-written. You would think that dealing with a topic like time travel it would be kind of corny, not so.

I found him convincing and not unmoving as Evan, a man who finds that by revisiting the memories recorded in his journals, he can change the events they recall (and even ones they don't). It probably helps that Kutcher is surrounded by a competent group of actors who flesh out their own characters, and the story, admirably.<br/><br/>The script is a bit, er, frank at times and some scenes are rather gory. I didn't find these overdone, however. The special effects are adequate rather than inspired, and the music is negligible.<br/><br/>But you watch films like this for the story, and that works. The result is a satisfying, but not great, movie experience.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10."

","Ok, at first when I saw the previews for this movie I found it very hard to believe that Ashton Kutcher could play a serious role. After all, look at his role in That 70s Show and in the movie Dude, Where's My Car. Regardless, the overall story of the movie looked very intriguing so I went to see it. Needless to say I was amazed. Ashton is a genius. Not many comedic actors can pull off a role that he did in this movie. It's almost like watching a completely different person. A young actor in the prime of his career, the film industry should feel blessed to have such a brilliant and versatile actor. A brilliant performance that should receive plenty of awards. I see Oscars written all over this one. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. It's well worth the money and time."

This is a smart movie and with all of the comments I read I can say that they were answered in the movie but I don't have enough time to explain them all. Ashton and the kids that played him were EXCELLENT. I think we are going to see more from Ashton and I hope that he just doesn't do comedy because he drama is as good as many others out there if not better. This movie had all the bases covered and I can't think of anything I would have changed about it. By the way one comment I do have is that someone was complaining about murder, pedophelia, animal abuse, insanity, ect. What did you expect from this...a bunch of butterflies flying around Ashton and Amy Smart with them skipping through a field?

","Evan (Ashton Kutcher) suffers from losses in his memory. Obviously, something went wrong in his childhood. He finally discovers what it is, but ends up in jail for killing the kid brother of his girlfriend, who was after him after the childhood disaster. Evan finds out how to go back in time through his journals so he can erase everything that went bad, but it only gets worse... So he goes back *again*, and... well, you get it. Let's say, some sort of Lola Rennt, but not quite.<br/><br/>Interesting premise is carried well by Kutcher (a comedy actor), but once you know what's going on loses some of it's impact. The biggest fault Gruber and Bress made is to give it a somewhat happy ending, with everybody being OK and Kutcher burning his memoirs. The 'meeting' on the sidewalks is just a bit too much I'm afraid...<br/><br/>Overall: pretty good, 6/10."

Although, without trying to give to much of the story's plot away, the character of Evan, played by Kutcher, tries to changed his own fate, as well as the lives of his friend, but basically discovers in the end that sometimes you just can change what was meant to be, and ultimately gives up the one thing most important to him. (That was the best I could some it up with out some serious spoilers going on!)<br/><br/>Overall the movie was certainly different to what was expected, but it was rather touching, and proved that Kutcher can play the part of a serious actor, as well as a comedian. Amy Smart, Elden Henson and William Lee Scott also proved themselves to be great in this movie, being able to portray different roles for their characters throughout the movie.<br/><br/>To sum it up this was a movie that contains elements of drama, with a huge splash of Sci-fi.

","I enjoyed this movie. I mean, come on, it is a movie after all, not some thesis on chaos theory. The story, action, and cinematography were intriguing enough to hold my interest through the entire length. I keep hearing about the negative revues of the lead actor, Ashton Kutcher. I am not sure what is driving these opinions but I suspect it stems from the usual chain reaction to stay in the popular conversation circles and what better topic then someone else's dirty laundry, personal tragedy, or shocking lifestyle. I see a negative bias toward the past film roles and the personal life of Mr. Kutcher that, where this film is concerned, I simply do not understand. I do not know much about Mr. Kutcher's career or personal life but I do know that he did a fine job in this film. Amy Smart impressively portrayed the widely varied `effectual' traits of her character. The rest of the cast also did a fine job as well. The special effects are no big deal but they do not need to be. The gruesome implications of some of the scenes are carried off without any real gore but are just as psychologically effective. The sound track is effective as well with all the right shock-bytes in all the right places. No Oscars here but camp followings can be much better than an industry award anyway and I foresee a following with this effort. Does Butterfly Effect inspire profound wisdom or answer some elusive universal mystery of life? No, but it does entertain. The idea behind the story did get me thinking about the events and milestones throughout my life and how they coursed via a potentially infinite array of choices, circumstance, happenstance and dumb luck. I did not walk away from the show so much thinking about the past or how I would change things if I could, no. I walked away thinking more about how the choices and possibilities of the future should maybe get a little more attention. I thought about these things, both in and out of our control, how far their `Effect' might possibly be felt. Is this a movie about time travel? No, it is a movie about how much our lives intertwine with each other, with nature, and with our environment. The message? Always consider the effects that all of the actions of all of us have on all that is within and around us. use the effects of the choices in our past as examples to help in our future decisions."

","I usually don't take the time to make comments on IMDB, especially on big ticket movies, but after reading some of the negative reviews, I just couldn't help myself.<br/><br/>Firstly, people need to stop talking about the chaos theory and time travel in the same context.  One small facet of the chaos theory is concerned with predicting the effects a tiny change in the initial conditions of a system will have in the future.  This movie seizes on that fact and bases its plot around the phenomenon.  <br/><br/>This is a very, very good movie.  People need to understand that it was not meant to be an accurate movie about time travel.  The main character has the unique ability to travel back in time to different points in his life and alter their outcomes.  This is not so much time travel as it is a paranormal psychic experience.  I don't understand why people are bothering to argue whether or not the movie portrayed the alternative universe theory correctly.  It was a great movie about a character with a PARANORMAL gift. The acting was as good as anything Hollywood has put out in the last few years.  Ashton was great.  I was able to take him seriously throughout the entire movie.  <br/><br/>People need to give their damn heads a shake.  Go see the film. <br/><br/>
I suppose I really enjoyed the rather black atmosphere the most.  It reminded me a bit of Donny Darko; another fine picture.  I watch quite a few horror movies, and this one still had me jumping from time to time.  Some of the action is predictable, some is surprising.

","Chaos theory states that something seemingly inconsequential - such as a butterfly flapping its wings - can cause a hurricane on the other side of the globe. In other words: something very small can have enormous consequences.<br/><br/>""The Butterfly Effect"" explores this concept to present vastly different scenarios, caused by changed ""parameters"" earlier on in a chain of events, and does so over and over again. Maybe you could call it a nightmarish version of ""Groundhog Day"" ...<br/><br/>The movie kept my interest until the very end, and when it was over, I did not feel cheated. In my experience, a lot of movies these days start out promising, build up towards a climax and keep the audience's interest for a long time ... only to ultimately disappoint in the end. Not this one, at least not for me.<br/><br/>What caught me completely off guard in this movie was the intense violence, and I am not talking about the usual ""blow people up and scatter bloody body parts all over the place"" kind of violence. Here, the  scariest scenes go to really young kids doing really cruel and mean things. I have to give some serious credit to the child actors who played those scences utterly convincingly, and to the folks who picked those child actors, as well.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie doesn't exploit the display of ""mean kids"" doing ""cruel things"" for cheap shock effects, but rather presents those actions as consequences of child abuse in a very graphic fashion.<br/><br/>And if you're curious about how well Ashton Kutcher did in his first dramatic role: I think, he did great, and the same goes for the rest of the ""adult"" cast, as well."

I was so caught up in the tall tale that this film tells, that I was afraid I'd miss something. It's a film where you have to concentrate. You're a bit exhausted at the end.<br/><br/>The story could have been written by Edgar Allen Poe it is so twisted. Sure you can find plot holes in it, but frankly you can find and create plot holes in every movie ever made. If you're hooked by the story, than who cares! This story will hook you in 15 minutes!<br/><br/>Some have said Mr. Kutcher is miscast; that he's just a teen comedian trying to do something more serious; more artful. All I can say is that his performance is quite good, doesn't resort to easy histrionics, is believable and runs the gamut between a lot of different emotions. He's the genuine article and he exudes star quality. Other male stars of Kutcher's age would probably have done justice to the part, but Kutcher does everything required of the script and does it well. If you can't see that, than you must be jealous that he's dating Demi Moore!<br/><br/>The film is directed at a break neck pace and my interest became more intense as the Kutcher character undergoes all his ""time reversals"". The supporting cast is excellent, particular Amy Smart who is smart enough to go from sorority Girl to a hooker with complete conviction.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a bit like Memento, but a bit easier to follow and it has a definite conclusion that ties up all the ends.<br/><br/>Don't trust the national critics on this one.

I thought the acting was superb as well as the dialog.  The tension builds up quickly and you're never quite given a chance to relax before the end.  I like that in a movie...it keeps you on your toes.  Also, if you are like me, and you actually like a little love story, there's one to be had.

","Butterfly Effect, The (2004) Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, William Lee Scott, Elden Henson, Eric Stoltz, Melora Walters, D: Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber. Mourning over his girlfriend's death, Kutcher recollects his grisly childhood tragedies (child molestation, murder, animal abuse, etc.) of his blackouts, but in the process discovers the ability to go back in time and alter the past-unfortunately it sets off an even more horrific future. Intriguing idea ringing of FREQUENCY and THE TWILIGHT ZONE has a skillful use of visual and aural devices, plus two career-best performances from Kutcher and Smart. But what bogs it down is some confusion in the story, which pulls us around in between the character's memories, and many unsettling scenes, undermining an otherwise effective time-traveling nightmare. Written by the directors (who also wrote FINAL DESTINATION 2). Running Time: 113 minutes and rated R for violence, sexual content, language, and brief drug use. ** Â½"

","I'll admit right now that the only reason I decided to see this movie was because I wanted to make fun of Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. His acting wasn't actually that bad. As for the rest of the movie, it was good. There were a couple of plot holes, like in almost any time-travel movie, but Melora Walters really stole the show as Evan Treborn's mother. Wow, that woman can act! All in all, not a bad movie. The plot is slightly lacking though, so 7/10."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","3","12 February 2004"," A riot of plot-morphing
","[s p o i l e r s]<br/><br/>
As I walked out a man asked his wife if she'd go home now and destroy her diaries.  I confess the same idea crossed my mind.  That's what Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher's character, has to do in The Butterfly Effect to free himself from endless shiftings into mind bendingly awful new plotlines for his life.  By turns he's a glossy frat boy who has great sex with his girlfriend Kayleigh (Amy Smart); in prison for murder and savagely beaten; severely injured in an explosion so he's without hands and in a wheelchair and his best friend - in other places a weirdo creep, here a nice guy with long blond hair - has got his girl -- whose evil brother has become a Christian do-gooder. . .and on and on.  In fact it's much more fun to talk about the ridiculously complicated plotlines of this movie than to watch them actually being played out, because a lot of the time they're nasty or at the very least confusing.<br/><br/>Basically The Butterfly Effect is about two things.  Like all tales full of alternative versions, it's about storytelling itself, and, like the 1001 Nights, about the fickleness of fate.  But in the context of the characters involved - who share alternative childhood, adolescent, and college experiences, it's about teenage angst.  The movie plays with young people's basic questions as they ponder lurid, magnified versions of their formative experiences and form equally lurid, magnified answers to queries like: `Who am I?' `Where am I going?' or `What am I going to become?'<br/><br/>In this and in its prevailing sense of hyperkinetic doom The Butterfly Effect resembles the new youth cult movie Donnie Darko (2001).  Darko has no journals inducing blackouts that signal moments their eponymous young man can't bear to recall.  Instead it's got a countdown to doom, a scary giant rabbit, a school cult, and a brilliant young man who's slightly deranged - and it's got the talented Jake Gyllenhaal in his juiciest role to date as Donnie, the brilliant young man.<br/><br/>Whereas Butterfly Effect, which at moments when the story twists stop being fun may just seem like a movie that's forgotten its plotline, has the appealing young everyman and current flavor of the month, Ashton Kutcher. There's something undeniably sweet and winning about the pretty-faced Ashton, and that's fine, because whatever evil deeds Evan may have done are performed by a child actor (sometimes a pretty foul-mouthed one) as Evan at 7 (Logan Lerman), or a tormented adolescent actor as Evan at 13 (John Patrick Amedori).  Kutcher, the centerfold version of Evan, never even says `damn,' except when he's in prison and he obligingly slips into gutter argot.  He's an innocent victim of a childhood tendency to have blackouts (that's the device that initially introduces all this stuff), and later on of his desire to escape alternative plotlines which may seem good at first but later turn into nightmares, sort of like Dudley Moore (or Brendan Fraser) making wishes in Bedazzled.<br/><br/>While Ashton manages the mild transition from an attractively hirsute undergrad whose roommate is a giant, obese punker, to the smooth, pampered frat boy, it's Amy Smart as Kayleigh, his childhood friend and later sometime sweetheart, who gets to do the more challenging shifts from depressed plain Jane in a dead-end waitress job - forever traumatized by the childhood sexual abuses wrecked upon her and her brother and Evan by a drunken, perverted dad (Eric Stolz, having way less fun than in Pulp Fiction); to a scarred, hardened druggie prostitute, to a pretty blond sorority sister - all of this with a lot of help from the makeup and costume departments, of course: but still handling the different turns quite well.<br/><br/>There are some very nasty moments when as child and man, Evan gets brutal beatings - not to mention the mutilations; but, as his many fans will be glad to know (if they don't already) Ashton never stops looking pretty (the only reason why he gets the acting jobs, his character boldly declares in Cheaper by the Dozen).  He looks particularly fabulous at the end as a prosperous psychiatrist. He's grown up!  -- Signaled by having his hair slicked back and wearing a nice suit. He always was studying psychiatry in each plotline, even if they sometimes forgot to mention it.  I guess he prepped for his final accreditations by experiencing multiple personality disorder.  A bit beyond the call of duty; but then, this movie goes the extra mile.<br/><br/>There's other nasty stuff.  A dog is tied up in a burlap bag and torched in repeated episodes.  A mother and her baby are blown up, though thankfully the results are unseen.  Eric Stolz as the pedophile drunk dad tries to stage a nude sex scene between seven-year-old Evan and his daughter, with her little brother looking on.  But this is the wicked, foulmouthed child Evan, and he'll have none of it (at least in some versions).<br/><br/>It's really difficult to summarize this movie and it would be pointless to try.  After a while when things get really dicey for the adult Ashton form of Evan, he grabs one of the composition book diaries he's kept all his life (this is particularly tough when he's in prison, but he manages somehow to get them brought in), looks up some primal, originally blackout-inducing scene, and, reading it, everything goes blurry and starts to shift and shake - and then a new plotline begins.  It's trippy - a little like a Cronenberg movie, especially the wild 1999 eXisTenZ with its virtual-reality game that taps into people's minds.  That's basically what's going on here too.  The somewhat confused premise of the blackouts and the journals aside, it's still fun to watch the alternative versions of Evan's reality being played out successively.  And when he gets a life he can live with, as it were, he burns all the journals and fixes things as they are.  And lives happily every after.  The End.<br/><br/>Unlike the haunting and truly angst-ridden - if occasionally confused - Donnie Darko, The Butterfly Effect seems unlikely to achieve cult status. But you never know. Given the current popularity of Ashton Kutcher, it should have a healthy video rental shelf life.  As you can see in Ashton's other efforts, he has a light touch that makes everything seem harmless. In The Butterfly Effect that touch keeps the proceedings from becoming flat-out nauseating.  Kutcher's natural manner is compliance and good naturedness. In Butterfly, he seems like a passive victim, who toughs things out.  He's astonished and not a little upset to wake up with his hands missing, but he can deal with it - till he escapes from it.  My Boss's Daughter, a hilarious but tasteless comedy in the post-Farrelly brothers mode of deliberately crude humor, which Kutcher produced as well as starred in, is more typical of the Ashton Kutcher touch. Ashton isn't really so much a comic as just a lighthearted guy who's also pleasant to look at.  Not capable of occasional drollness like Josh Hartnett, he's more a straight man than really funny himself:  his presence allows funniness to happen around him, as it abundantly does in Boss's Daughter.  After you've watched Dude, Where's My Car?, Just Married, and My Boss's Daughter, you realize that Butterfly Effect really is a big stretch for him.  But it's in the nature of a good movie actor to be able to appear in all sorts of situations. It's interesting to speculate whether an amazing director like P.T. Anderson could morph the Ashton syndrome into something subtler and more troubling, as Anderson did brilliantly with Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love."
"MrDerp","Null","0","1","12 February 2004"," Reprehensible Garbage
","Don't get me wrong, I love a good suspense film, but what disturbed me the most about the The Butterfly Effect was it's degrading, repulsive, and exploitative depiction of children. I'll mention just a few scenes I found objectionable:<br/><br/>1. mother and baby blown up with a stick of dynamite 2. child stabs another child in the back with a metal shard 3. child burns a dog alive 4. pedophile video tapes two children<br/><br/>And that's just in the first 20 minutes. I won't even go into the prison scene. Why have so many reviewers glossed over these important facts with small-talk about Ashton Kutcher and how good or bad his acting was - when a film is this bad who cares? Rather than create any real suspense, the makers of this film exploit children for shock value, pure and simple. This film represents a new low in American cinema and I hope more people speak out about this reprehensible garbage."
"vyperman7","10","0","1","16 February 2004"," This film is very underrated
","Ever since I first saw previews for this film, I was excited about it. Anytime the subject of time travel is approached, it usually makes for a good film with the acception of the god awful Time Machine. However, the film did have the critics going against it, and Ashton Kutcher trying to play in a dramatic role. <br/><br/>I finally got to see the movie recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie turned out to be. While it is not the best time travel film I have ever seen, it was extremely entertaining and suspenseful to see all the different lifetimes being played out. I really enjoyed the fact that Kutcher's character used his mind to travel in time and not a machine. The movie can be frustrating at times. In fact, after the first 20 minutes of the film I had serious doubts. Things would happen, followed by Ashton's Kutcher's character having a blackout right at the moment when an explanation was needed. This left myself and the rest of the audience feeling confused at what was playing out. But after the film gets over the initial speed bump in the beginning, The Butterfly Effect turns into a riveting thriller and everything is explained in the long run. The entire cast did a fantastic job in my opinion. While I still feel that Ashton Kutcher is not a very good actor, he did a lot better than I thought he would, especially considering the fact that he is known for being a comedy actor.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film was the ending. It was not your typical happy ending. While every character's life turned out for the better, Kutcher's character still experiences loss and regret by how the story turns out. I was very happy with the ending, because it actually manages to leave your emotions feeling conflicted, which gets you thinking about how things could have been. Anytime you leave the theater in discussion about what you would have done differently, it means that the film made an impression on you. That is definately something that The Butterfly Effect manages to do.<br/><br/>I really don't understand the harsh treatment from critics. In Entertainment Weekly, the average grade for this film is a ""C-"". While The Butterfly Effect does have its flaws, it turned out to be a riveting thriller, with an original take on timetravel and an unpredictable ending.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Penoyer1","9","0","1","15 February 2004"," Not perfect but better than expected
","This alternate reality movie (a la ""Groundhog Day"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"") caught me right from the beginning, surprising me with the quality of the acting and and the occasional comedic touch which is where Ashton Kutcher really shines.  Yes, there was never an acceptable explanation of how he moves from one alternative to another but THIS IS A MOVIE so not everything has to be realistic.  The ending, which could easily have been some ""feel good, everything works out for everybody"" thing, was just right which left me leaving the theater saying ""They could have turned this into a date movie but instead gave us something to think about.""  I'm glad they did!"

"MrGravano","9","0","1","13 February 2004"," Edgy.
","I've marked The Butterfly Effect as another fine example of critics writing their reviews before they watch/finish a movie.<br/><br/>  Ashton Kutcher is a polarizing figure.  It seems that the debate over this film's credibility ended at his talent.  He isn't Cruise, De Niro, or any other A-List star, but he effectively gets the job done.  Still, many chose to subtract points instantly because of what they heard in the media before this even hit the market.<br/><br/>  'Butterfly' uses a lot of surprise cuts throughout that will keep most folks anticipating the next loud bang or horrible turn of events.  Call it cheating if you will, but I think it adds a roller coaster element to the movie that really keeps you watching. <br/><br/> There was an above-par mix of action, humor, drama, and adrenaline that helped it through the slower moments that intrude a little after the midpoint.  <br/><br/>  Just give the damn movie a chance people.  Don't let prejudiced critics do the acting."

","I loved this movie! It's been a long time sense I've sat through such an enjoyable film and I was sad it had to end. All round I don't have any major criticisms.  The plot, acting, and directing were all wonderful.  I had heard awful things about this film and was expecting it to be a dud but I was totally surprised.  Ashton Kutcher did a remarkable job shedding his traditional comedic persona and showed his true talent as an actor in this science fiction classic.  The butterfly effect is a theory that a seemingly small event, such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings, can cause a dramatic change in the course of events to come. The film explores psychology and the consequences of the ability to alter one's history. I'm intentionally trying not to say anything about the plot because I think this is a movie which the less you know about it the more exciting it will be.<br/><br/>P.S. Keep your drink in it's cup holder because this movie will make you jumb 20 times."
"jeffzi","10","0","1","2 February 2004"," great movie -- the kutcher-bashing needs to stop
","It seems like EVERY TIME an actor tries to move away from a specific role or type-casting, the only thing the people can say about the movie is how the person needs to go back to their old role.  In this case, as with many others, the actor does a great job in the new role, and it's the viewers that either have something against the actor, can't adjust themselves to seeing them differently, or are just jumping on the bandwagon to bash the actor.<br/><br/>The concept of time traveling and one thing changing another unintended thing has been done before, but regardless this movie does a great job of telling the story and leaving specific pieces out that are filled in later, so you experience it in the same way as the main actor.  I found the story to be quite original, and the character development is done very well.<br/><br/>There are a few moments in the beginning where scare-tactics are used to make you jump and wake you up, but don't let that deter you from getting into the film.  Go see it with a group of people -- as long as all of them can get past a few minor plot holes and are open to experiencing a typically comedy-focused actor try something new, you'll be talking about it all the way home!<br/><br/>10/10"

","Just like I'd heard, this film is disturbing. Luckily, for viewers like me, a strong emotional reaction makes for a very enjoyable night at the movies.<br/><br/>I was prejudiced against ""The Butterfly Effect"" from the start, since the only thing anyone seems to say about it is that it was intended to showcase Ashton Kutcher's poor dramatic acting skills. But after seeing the film, I can only assume these people were unable to suspend their previous notions of him as an actor, since I noticed very few slip-ups on his part.<br/><br/>The acting in general is honest and believable, but that's not why I liked the movie so much. Because the script didn't always follow conventions, the plot kept me guessing. In several cases, I thought the story was over, but it wasn't--a quality I realize many audience members don't appreciate. That fact may explain the polarization of reviews: people who go in wanting a formulaic no-brainer with a Hollywood ending will probably be disappointed...but for those of you who like an emotional plot with true suspense, please don't hesitate to see this film.<br/><br/>Unless you are obsessed with plot holes and realism in movies...in that case, don't bother."

I personally thought that this movie was amazing.  Now, I know that I will probably get a lot of crap about this, but I thought that Ashton Kutcher did a very good job.  I don't really care what type of people actors are, I only see them as characters.  And also, people need to get past Kelso.  One character that is comedic and he is doomed for life.  But whatever you think about him doesn't really matter, the movie was great.  It had an original, complex storyline that made people actually think about it when they walked out of the theater.  This is a movie that you might have to see more than once and analyze outside of viewing.  And I know that it is difficult, but maybe study the ideas that it introduced.  The fact that it is a sci-fi, mystery that pushed the Hollywood standards and didn't have a lot of action made this movie very difficult for many people to accept, but if you think about it, most of the best cult movies have ended up like that and now they are huge and highly respected, not only in the indie world, but also somewhat in the main stream.

As long as a viewer goes in knowing just that they will be amazed at the writing of the story, I do not want to say much but i will say that the creativity of the writing was awesome. Performances by Amy Smart(Road Trip, Outside Providence), Ethan Suplee(Mallrats, Remember the Titans), William Lee Scott (Gone in 60 Seconds, Pearl Harbor), Eldon Henson as(Mighty Ducks, Idle Hands) and Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction, Anaconda) all had great realistic characters to portray which was done well.

","to influence the makers of this film in the making of the film, I would suggest that 1) John Patrick Amedori (Evan at 13) give Ashton Kutcher acting lessons. Apparently he took lessons from Keanu Reeves instead. 2) Suggest that they not try to insert EVERY possible disturbing human behavior (e.g. child abuse, murder, animal abuse, sexual perversion) into what could otherwise be described as an interesting time-travel story. I'd like to reiterate that the acting by the kids was excellent. The End."

"furiousneon","10","0","1","26 January 2004"," Very Good Movie
","Ive been interested in this movie since i first saw a preview for it over the summer.  Ashton Kutcher in a serious role? Sounds like Mission: Impossible.  Ashton Kutcher is Evan..a troubled young man who discovers that he can go back in time and change things from his past, but when he changes one thing, he changes everything..and  this can either be really good or really bad.  The movie had me on the edge of my seat for pretty much the whole time.  It is very random but in a good way and it does have a good, interesting and very original plot.  So does Ashton pull it off? Indeed he does.  I was impressed by his performance, as a matter of fact, I didnt even watch the film thinking it was Ashton, I believed that he was Evan..thats a very good thing.  I mean he wont be winning an award for this movie, but note that this is his first dramatic role.  Overall i really enjoyed this movie, its better than lots of crap thats being loaded into the theaters lately and it really, really does make you think.  Screw what the critics are saying, check this one out, you wont wanna miss it. 10/10."

","Black-outs plague a young boy, Evan Treborn, during his often traumatic upbringing. An upbringing that eventually places him at college, but leads his childhood friends to ruin. In order to help recover his memories during his black-outs, Evan begins writing journals to keep a record of his days. As an adult, he discovers the ability to travel back to those blacked-out moments in his history by re-reading his early accounts of those times. He further discovers that in his travels, he can alter the course of events, and attempts to use this ability to improve the present for himself and his friends. Unfortunately, every ""improvement"" he tries to make backfires in some unforseen and disastrous way.<br/><br/>Words fail to describe my confusion over the backlash against this movie. The story is intriguing and extremely well told, all the way through to the end. The effects are appropriately minimal. The violence, excessive to some, actually remains in the character of a given scene without being gratuitous. The acting, though not the best in Hollywood's history, is certainly believable and well-done.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher in particular has proved himself capable of serious acting. Anyone who feels otherwise has given in to prejudices spawned by Kutcher's earlier films. Such individuals need to recall Tom Hanks' and Jim Carey's careers, and give Ashton Kutcher a chance to develop his own career as well."
"jfbguy","10","0","1","26 January 2004"," don't believe the reviewers, it is a great film
","I went to go see ""The Butterfly Effect"" the day it was released. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. One of those movies where you leave the theater silent because you're too busy going over all of the facts in your head and small little details that made this movie unique. The last movie that did that for me was Fight Club, and that was a long time ago. Great plot, great visuals. You can tell that this movie's script was meticulously thought out. By the end of the movie, you end up matching so many early scenes to near ending scenes. Foreshadowing that is far from obvious. Nothing like Back to the Future, nothing like the Time Machine.<br/><br/>The main reason everyone else hates this movie is because they can't get their sense of Kutcher's comedic rolls out of their heads while watching the movie. This is their flaw, not Kutcher's. I've never had a problem separating actors from their other rolls, so I didn't have to worry about that bias.<br/><br/>One more thing I wanted to say is about the film's casting. The child actors were cast amazingly well. Three separate ages for the three main players in the film. You will be convinced that they are the same person at different ages. Best child actor matching I have EVER seen in a movie.<br/><br/>My rating for this film is 9 1/2. (I never give out 10s except for Casablanca and Kurosawa :)"
"dblittle","9","0","1","25 January 2004"," Walking in with Doubts...Walk out Pleased...
","When I first say the previews I was extremly sceptical, I must say after now watching the movie I believe many critics are underrating this flick. In the theatre with me was two other friends of mine who also shared in my doubt. Ashton Kutcher is not known for his dramatic roles, mostly only his comical ones, and thats really only counting his great role in ""That 70's Show"". When my friends and myself first sat down we all had that look of; ""did I just spend 10 bucks for nothing??"", on our faces. Yet the film is surprisingly entertaining even shocking the audience at times. Ashton Kutcher does a great job in this role, to my dismay and that of my friends, he actually seems to fit the role quite well. The story, which I will not reveal becasue I feel it's best to see it first, then to read about each scene, is well constructed and I'm not sure if it's quite a ""science-fiction"" film, but it definatly has it's science facts and the whole chaos theory thing is great to follow. It's safe to say that if you truely want a film to enjoy and that makes you think afterwards, this is that film to see tonight or some night soon. When I left the theatres I turned to my friends to admit I enjoyed the film only to discover they all seemed to as well so it was not just me after all. In closing I ask that you the reader watch the film and judge it on your own don't always take the critics view point, but I wouldn't mind it so much if you took mine ;)"

During the first half hour, some very disturbing aspects of the plot are revealed, at some points I felt like I might need to leave the theatre, but I stuck through and it was well worth it.  Anyone with issues concerning pedophilia, molestation, abuse, infantocide, or suicide may not be able to stomach the movie, yet a film that can send you on such an emotional rollercoaster, that can not only entertain you but involve you so much is truly artistic, truly worthy or praise.  10/10"

"litpics","9","0","1","24 January 2004"," Into chaos
","I'll start of by saying I never really liked Ashton Kutcher. He seems stupid, at least judging by all the film's and shows I've seen him in. However, a few months ago I read the premise of this film, and being a student of Chaos Theory, was intrigued. The actual butterfly effect is a great theory, because it's true. Anyway, the first trailer came out, then the poster. More and more I was intrigued. Then, I saw it. And loved it. I even liked Ashton Kutcher's acting.  The lovely Amy Smart did, as usual, a great character who constantly changes. From the very first moment of the film, I was creeped out, but in a good way. The feeling of fear in my stomach only grew with each passing moment. Every time he would attempt to change one thing, and cause an effect that alters the course of his life and others made me actually think. Not many movies can make one think, very few in fact, but this one made me think and wonder. So, if you like to think about the movie you are watching, and be creeped out at the same time, The Butterfly Effect is your movie.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

But the idea behind it intrigued me, & there wasn't much else playing in town, so my wife & I went ahead & bought our tickets.  +++SPOILER+++ It started out with the fairly common ""in the middle of the action"" scene that frequents movies with time-travel themes...but rapidly takes off to get into a solidly entertaining story.+++SPOILER OVER+++<br/><br/>And for all of the people who use ""Ashton SUX"" as their main reason to dismiss this movie, take the time to watch it first.  In about the first half hour of the movie, he isn't even there...and the younger version of his character plays the role very well...especially in the later episodes.<br/><br/>The approach the filmmakers take to chaos theory & its ""ripples in a pond"" repercussions is well thought out & presented...the thought that every small change in the past would be reflected in everyone's life from there out is one that could use even more investigation.<br/><br/>I don't think that anyone who sees this movie can say that they didn't get their money's worth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

So either this is going to be a great year in movies or the other 341 and 48 weeks are ganna suck. Anyway back to the butterfly effect. this movie had everything. scares thrills and chills. Mad scenes happy scenes leave you guessing scenes sad scenes and holy $#!% scenes. jumpback scenes and gasp scenes as well. you name it it had it in all the perfect places. it also made your mind think beyond all ones capacity and left you restless yet tired. it took my entire being for a most enjoyable ride. Ashton breaks the barrier in which jim carey is still trying to shatter ( hopefully with his new and anticipating movie to me ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") of comedy to drama thriller scifi...whatever. ashton breaks it in fact he blows the doors off along with the windows furniture and the neighbors mother-in-law. he also does a superb job of battling ""Morality"" VS/and through ""Desire"" (best way to describe it to me)  Every actor as a matter of fact could have only helped themselves including Smart and the young child actors/actresses in this fantastic film. i would give a review of it but im one for screwing up the plot so just read everyone elses. So don't screw up this oppurtunity up friends because this movie should and will be on IMDB top 50 within the year. if not, the movie business is sadly headed for the downhill.

","Wow...is the only thing that I can utterly spew out of my mind. I am a 15 year old student, and I went to see this with my family tonight. I first heard about this movie watching Return of the King, when I saw the trailer. Personally, it didn't look that great and I'm not a fan of Ashton Kutcher. But my family was going and I decided to go along too. Well wow the first half hour I thought about getting up and leaving(but not because it was bad), I was devastated. The more time that passed, the harder I cried and the more I liked it, and the more freaked-out I became. *Spoilers* Near the end, where he was in the 'loony-bin', I thought that everything was a dream and I thought it was going to end there. But good thing, it didn't and it went on. The last shot, I broke down and i cried so hard I just didn't know what to do I was shaking and crying. It was so good, but at the same, freaky and life changing. So, never mind the stupid trailer that makes it look crappy, go see it but beware, bring tissues and do not bring anyone under the age of 18. On my last note, Ashton Kutcher has shown the world he can act. And act wonderfully. Aston, never mind the critics' stupid bad reviews, they just couldn't handle the movie. Bravo. 9 1/2 out of 10"
"rexbot","9","0","1","23 January 2004"," Understand Chaos Theory? Then you will probably like this film.
","About Me: Avid movie goer. See 2-3 films in theaters a week.<br/><br/>As a general rule I absolutely hate time travel stories.  The paradoxes that any time travel story creates are huge and generally are either explained through faulty logic or never explained at all which is simply an insult to the viewers intelligence.<br/><br/>Very, very rarely however I come across a story where the storyteller doesn't take the easy way out and actually puts some thought into it.  And even more rarely they use it to create an interesting story (which all by itself is pretty rare).<br/><br/>So when I say I like this movie (and liked it a lot) it means that the storytellers have created something very special.  Bress/Gruber have coupled a new and rather thoughtful method of time travel with a group of characters that are interesting, believable and most importantly, that are worthy of being cared for.<br/><br/>Like most films this one is not for everybody.  There is violence, both emotional and physical.  It isn't glamorized or gruesome but it is realistic which is perhaps even more disturbing.  The plot is complex and necessarily told through some nonlinear storytelling methods so you have to pay attention to understand it.  Most importantly a basic understanding of chaos theory is necessary to understanding how the story works and unfolds, otherwise it may not make sense.  I think this may be where most of the professional reviewers lost the point and why this film currently seems to be getting rather poor reviews.  So read up a bit on the subject before heading to the theater (its a fascinating subject and well worth your time, trust me).<br/><br/>If you have the stomach, attention span and the prerequisite knowledge however this film is simply one heck of an entertaining ride.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cast: Excellent.  I was particularly impressed with the younger actors and especially John Patrick Amedori who plays the young Evan.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Very well done.<br/><br/>Story/Plot: Complex, intelligent, well thought out and interesting.<br/><br/>Editing/Direction: Superb.  Fast paced but the story is always driving the action.  I will watch for and expect great things from the Bress/Gruber team in the future!<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10"

","So, we've reached the bleak land of January.  The land when horrible movies rear their ugly heads in the theaters.  A time for movie critics to rip apart the sludge and let the world know that their pretentious opinions matter...<br/><br/>Before I went to the theater to see this movie, I checked the external reviews.  The critics tore this movie apart.  And there really was no reason for it.  This movie is actually very intriguing and interesting.  I think it's sad that people go into a movie with a predisposition.  Critics surely entered the theater knowing that they would hate the movie because Ashton Kutcher is the star and the directors aren't experienced.  I think the critics actually missed out on a good movie.<br/><br/>I will not say that this will be the best movie of the year, or even in the top ten, but it definitely deserves a viewing.  The screenplay is definitely interesting and fast paced.  The acting wasn't perfect, but not as bad as some would say.  The thing that I liked best about this movie was how it made me think afterwards.  Reality is a funny thing, and when you really start to think about things like alternate universes, or similar things, it can really boggle your mind.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything else away so I'll just add this:  I want to make sure that people won't miss out on a pretty decent movie because the critics are too close minded to know any better.

We get to see Ashton (Evan) go through age seven up to about age 22. As a kid, he has several ""blackouts"" where he can't remember what happens during a 1-2 minute period. His mother takes him to a neurologist, who suggests that he keep journals so he might remember what happened during these blackouts someday.<br/><br/>Evan has several disturbing things happen during his childhood, and Kayleigh, the love of his life, has some bumps too.<br/><br/>Don't worry, it ramps up.<br/><br/>When he gets to college, one of Evan's girlfriends asks him to read out of one of his journals. He picks a segment that describes a moment before one of his blackouts. All of a sudden, the present world fades away and Evan is back in that pocket of time. He doesn't know how he got there, and before too long, he's back in the present.<br/><br/>Evan thinks he's finally going to discover what's behind these repressed memories. Evan reads another passage, and while he relives one of those memories, he drops a cigarette on himself and it burns through his shirt. When Evan comes back to present day, he now has a burn mark where one didn't exist before.<br/><br/>From this, Evan figures out that each of his childhood ""blackouts"" was actually the creation of a waypoint, and he has the ability to rewrite events during his blackouts, to produce a new outcome.<br/><br/>
Evan decides to go back and enter another one of those memories - he picks the one where he was about to be forced to perform in a homemade porno film for Kayleigh's dad. When he gets there, Evan threatens to report Kayleigh's father to child services, and this time she told her dad off.<br/><br/>After this, Evan wakes up in the present, in a different room. All of a sudden, he starts to get a splitting headache and we see his old memories start to fade, while 15 years of new ones come crashing into his mind. He is now with Kayleigh, and things have changed. But not all for the better...<br/><br/>This is about all I can say about the movie without giving absolutely everything away. Seeing Ashton Kutcher doing a serious role was very impressive, given his performance in ""Dude, Where's My Car"" and ""That 70's Show"". However, high praise must be given to John Amedori and Logan Lerman; the two child actors who produced the changes in Evan's past, for better and for worse.<br/><br/>The ending was not what I expected at all, but it was a welcome one.<br/><br/>Definitely worthy of the movie ticket price. Go see it."

","Since I heard about this movie I've been wanting to see it as the premise seemed interesting and there were some great people cast [and no, I'm not talking about Ashton Kutcher, whom I have nothing against though the mention of his name doesn't exactly propel me into a world of pure joy]. I think it was well-acted in general, though Amy Smart did seem a little weak at some points. The infamous aforementioned Ashton Kutcher played his character convincingly, despite it not being his typical role. I was definitely impressed by both Elden Henson and William Lee Scott, as the various incarnations of their characters had extremely different personalities, and all were done to perfection.<br/><br/>Overall I definitely enjoyed this movie, and it had a lot of great moments. My only quasi-complaint is that it felt longer than its runtime of 113 minutes [my friend agreed with this as well]. I'm not sure what exactly made it seem so extended, it was just an overall effect. However, I don't think the movie would have necessarily benefited if scenes were cut to make it feel shorter; everything in it had a purpose.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I can't understand all the negative reviews I've seen. Perhaps people are trying to appear sophisticated by tearing down Ashton Kutcher. Regardless, Kutcher has a very solid performance and proves he is not the one dimensional ""Kelso"" character (nothing wrong with Kelso either LOL)on TV. No point in going over the story except to say that the film really takes it's time to develop the story before really getting into the meat of it. Some criticize the second half (in comparison to the first) and don't like the way the sci-fi element is handled. I couldn't disagree more, I think the plot holds together very well and it's amusing and sad to watch the twists unfold. As for the movie being too dark, it is but it is written well and gives much more urgency to the story. The cinematography is nicely done and special effects are nicely restrained but effective. There are several enjoyable montages throughout. This film really resembles ""The Lathe of Heaven"" in that it examines similar territory. Viewers of ""The Dead Zone"" and ""Donnie Darko"" will see similarities. If you liked the ideas explored in the Butterfly Effect I highly recommend all of these features if you haven't already seen them.<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILER!<br/><br/>For Animal Lovers: Yes a dog (in some realities) is burned to death in this film. It is NEVER SHOWN! Only a brief scene before it happens and after wards. It is tastefully (no pun intended) done and shouldn't stop anyone from watching the film. In the end the dog survives the final reality so fear not! :) All the performances were solid in this movie although the only one that really stood out for me was the ultra-creepy Eric Stoltz as a pedophile. It really blows the nice guy image he has built up through the years. It was a gutsy move for Stoltz in a role that really wasn't that big. Ranks up there with Ted Danson in ""Something About Amelia"" and Gordon Jump (no not as Arthur Carlson on WKRP) but in a guest spot on Different Strokes. All leave a bad aftertaste but good acting."

","Apparently ""what if"" has no interest for critics.  The Butterfly Effect is basically a thought provoking science fiction look at how someone might try to deal with child abuse, and the ways in which it could go wrong.  Some of the audience did laugh at inappropriate times, but I don't fault the movie --- they just have no sensitivity or empathy.  I thought Ashton did a good job in his character as well; the people picking on him must know someone who was Punk'd and looking to get revenge or something. The kids playing his character at 8 and 13 did an outstanding job, however, since they also had to carry off an older personality at times and did so very well."
"Hitoshirenu","8","0","1","24 January 2004"," Chaos and Time-travel(may contain spoilers)
","It is always hit or miss with time-travel movies.  Either they hit it spot on as in Star Trek 4 or it misses as in T-3:Rise of the Machines.  Now add in the complexity of the Chaos Theory and you have a premise for an interesting movie to say the least. The movie opens near the end and gos back to the beginning, a device that seems to me to becoming increasingly common in movies today.  After the opening sequence, we are treated to a series of small episodes setting up the blackouts that must be corrected.  The worse moments of the blackouts are, of course, blacked out.  We don't see what really happened until later on in the movie, when Ashton's character tries to change things. My reaction to this movie was strange to say the least.  This movie takes Donnie Darco to a whole new level.  The performances were amazing, but I felt Ashton was a little flat at times, sometimes going back into his persona on Punk'd.  Amy Smart an Ethan Suplee on the other hand gave amazing performances.  I walked away thinking this was one of the better movies to come out dealing with a difficult subject to write about.  Instead of having the audience remain blissfully ignorant of the inherent paradoxes in time travel, we are taken on a ride to see what would happen if we were able to go back and change the past.  Bottom line: 8/10"

Mackye Gruber Photography: Matthew F. Leonetti Music: Michael Suby Editor: Peter Amundson<br/><br/>Cast: Ashton Kutcher Amy Smart Melora Walters Elden Henson Eric Stoltz<br/><br/>Evan Treborn is a man struggling to overcome the horrors of his past. He tries to come to terms with the fact that his father died in a mental institution and  that his true love suffered abuse at the hands of a pedophile father. His periodic blackouts acted as a buffer between him and his pain. Or was there something else at work. His mother senses the turmoil of his life and moves them away when something happens to alter all their lives.<br/><br/>Flash forward 7 years ahead in time. Evan is now a wiz kid at the state university. But his past still haunts him and many questions remain. He begins to pore  through old journals that he had started taking since his blackouts began. Through concentration on his journals he discovers the ability to affect the past and the butterfly spreads its' wings.<br/><br/>***spoilers*** During his move he makes the promise to come back for her and this is what drives him to try to find a way to make their lives perfect. But his changes greatly change his life and others around. He travels several times to the past and every time a loved one or himself wind up hurt or dead. All this builds up to what I found to be a sad, melancholy  and ultimately inevitable end. ***end spoilers***<br/><br/>I got to admit the acting was a lot better than I had imagined. I had reservations about seeing Kutcher in s dramatic part (for God's sake he's Kelso) but soon learned he was more than up to the task and did very well. The beautiful Amy Smart turns in an excellent performance in her various guises. All the supporting actors did excellent job, of particular note were the young actors playing theyounger main characters.<br/><br/>Written and directed by the duo who wrote Final Destination 2 the script occasion takes giant leaps in logic but the actors sell us on it and strangely the one thing I hesitated the most about (the acting) ends up shoring up the scripts' shortcomings. The direction on the other had is above average and the effects enhance things nicely.<br/><br/>The music is a little transparent but adds enough sting to the scenes it needs to. Heavy on songs. A lot of strings convey Evan's longing for his love. The editing is quite good and even though there is not any horror per se, creates a startle now and then.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>An above average thriller than conjures up echoes of Donnie Darko and Stand by Me. Excellent acting partnered up with good direction and a decent script made for a Suprisingly good movie. Fans of Donnie Darko check it out.<br/><br/>

","All of life's mysteries are answered in the movies.  That loosely paraphrased Steve Martin line has held true for me for many years. So, how many times have you thought about freezing a moment in your past, and changing it?  Anyone who has seen ""Back to the Future"" knows that you cannot alter the space/time continum, but it still poses a great question.  Moviegoers throughout the years would love to implement this tool.  Imagine if you could go back to a point in time when you hadn't yet seen ""Just Married"" or ""My Boss's Daughter"" and saved yourself the agony.  ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a whole 'nother can of larvae.  The puzzle-like screenplay is top-notch.  The weaving of the character's stories in various points of their lives is expertly crafted, and sometimes gutwrenching.  Ashton Kutcher holds down the fort very nicely.  It turns out he can do something besides scream really loud.  He VERY toned down.  It's the kind of career turn that he had to make,( if he wants to have a long career) and he does it nicely.  He's got many more turns to make, but this is a great first one.  Let's put it this way, he doesn't do anything to take away from the superb story.  The screenplay is the real star of this film (although is is nice to see Eric Stolz is alive and well.)  I was about ready to send out a search party for him and Spalding Gray.  So, even if you hate Kutcher, this Ash has turned another cheek; and DUDE! is it SWEET!"

","For most people, childhood is a time filled mainly with happy memories of carefree playing, a loving family, and counting the days until the next school vacation.<br/><br/>Sadly, not everyone has fond memories of their childhood as for some; the years of joy and laughter are filled with pain and sadness. Such is the case of Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) a gifted and caring individual who suffers from memory lapses much like his institutionalized father before him.<br/><br/>A series of traumatic events occur forcing Evan and his mother to move from their home leaving his best friends Kayleigh and Lenny behind.<br/><br/>
Years later Evan is a successful and popular student at the state college and has not had a blackout for seven years, which is about the time his mother, moved him from the old neighborhood.  Evan is persuaded by a friend to read his old journal entries and in doing so starts to recover some of his lost memories.<br/><br/>With the understanding that he has blacked out traumatic events in his life, Evan returns to his old home to seek out his friends with the hope that his missing memories can be restored. Sadly Evans return does not go well and his questions cause consequences for those who can remember what exactly happened.<br/><br/>Desperate to make sense of what is happening, Evan studies his journals and discovers that he is able to travel back to the time he has blacked out, and proceeds to make changes that he believes will improve the long-term outcome.<br/><br/>Evan awakes to find himself with Kayleigh (Amy Smart) and learns that the two of them have been an item ever since his childhood. What at first seems like a dream comes true soon sours when Evan realizes that the ripple effect from his changes in the past have affected others around him. Desperate to undo a situation that now threatens him as well, Evan begins a series of trips into his past in an effort to recover his memories and right the wrongs that he is slowing starting to remember. Evan soon finds himself in a situation gone wild as no matter what Evan changes in the past, things are not put right as improving things for one person often makes others suffer as a result of the altered history.<br/><br/>Skillfully written and directed by Eric Bress and J Mackye Gruber `The Butterfly Effect' is a stunning look into a troubled psyche and a study in the effects of childhood trauma. The film is equally gripping and disturbing and tackles a wide-range of controversial topics. There is no sugar coating to the film as the depths of Evan's repressed memories are explored making the film one of the best Dramas in recent memory.<br/><br/>Kutcher is amazing as he handles a difficult and complex role with skill and passion showing that he is capable of so much more than the brain dead beefcake roles he has been cast in previously. Kutcher is the key that makes the film work as the entire film and supporting cast center on him and he pulls it off brilliantly. Strong supporting work by Amy Smart, Ethan Suplee, and Eldon Henson keep the film gripping and tense.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with the film was the ending, which seemed to me like a tacked on Hollywood ending and not in keeping with the tone of the film. That being said, `The Butterfly Effect' is a strong film and one that will not easily be forgotten.<P><br/><br/>

","This movie gave me the butterfly effect in that I'm here writing this review on how great it is. I just went into a screening tonight, expecting nothing. I never heard of this film or even knew that Ashton Kutcher was in it. But I definitely walked out pleasantly surprised. The thing about this film is that it kept me on my toes every bit of the way. The first 30 minutes kept me guessing what kind of film this was about. At first I thought it was a sci-fi movie, then a ""children of the corn"" type movie, then some kind of psychological thriller. The basic premise is that the main character, Kutcher finds that he has the ability to go back in time by reading his old journal entries and making little changes in the past which ultimately, greatly affects the future. The movie starts with a quote about the chaos theory how the fluttering of a buttefly's wings can cause a typhoon on the other side of the world. This is basically how the whole movie works, how a little change in past can cause dramatic changes in the future. After watching the movie, I read some online reviews and most publications have slammed this movie. I'm not a big movie buff, but this was definitely a great movie that had me raving afterwards. It is definitely worth seeing."

Kutcher and his swarm of mini-hims play a brilliant young psychology student, who as a young boy was haunted by series of blackouts. So, as a boy he kept a series of journals, documenting the times he could remember in hopes to jog his memories back.<br/><br/>All ready, the idea of Kutcher as a brilliant young psychology student makes this movie completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>What the journals do instead, years later, is take him back in time to the moment of his blackout and let him try to change the events that transpired. This leads to a series of `what-if's' as he tries repeatedly to save his childhood sweetheart, played by a series of young actresses and Amy Smart, from disastrous consequences, each worse and brought upon by his meddling.<br/><br/>

","I just saw this movie and it was excellent.  It's a great psychological thriller that makes you think.  I'm not a fan of Ashton Kutcher, but after seeing this movie my perspective of him has changed drastically.  Not only does he portray his character of Evan very well, but he seems to have left behind that goofy persona he normally displays in other roles.  The twists the movie takes is a never ending roller coaster of ok what happens now that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  With some movies you miss important details either because it doesn't keep your attention or you assume them to petty to bother with.  This movie hypnotizes you so that your eyes never stray from the screen.  You start to figure out what's going on only to realize that you have no idea.  The beginning of the movie sets up one idea in your head and as the film progresses your mind is full of subplots that could be anything.  You never really know what happens because there is no concrete evidence justifying your ideas.  But you would have to see the movie to know exactly what I mean."

Oh boy was I wrong! Butterfly Effect is a damn good movie. It captures you and takes on a ride. Usually I get distracted during a boring part of a movie and change my sitting position and check the time. Not once did I do such a thing during the film. Anyways, the movie starts of a bit weird and slow. The presences of unknown blackouts capture the viewer. As we begin to understand what is going a whole word of possibility of that Evan can do becomes mind-boogling. The effects that are used during the film are pretty cool. The difference in the colors during the alternative futures set the mood really well. Bress and Gruber's directing style takes the movie and makes it unique. The acting is good. Ashton's character goes through a range of emotions and his presence presents some comedy in serious scenes. However, in the end the comic reliefs deter away from the seriousness of the situation.

","I went into this movie expecting a really bad teen horror flick. But I was pleasantly surprised to see a genuinely entertaining movie with some mind-bending twists and philosophical underpinnings.<br/><br/>The movie is about a kid named Evan who has blackouts during traumatic incidents. When he starts studying psychology as a college student, he tries to find out what happened during his blackouts and finds that he can return to the time of his memories.<br/><br/>When Evan travels back in time, he realizes he can change the outcome of the future by changing his actions in the past. But when he returns to the present, he finds his actions have had unintended consequences. (Sort of a scary version of Back to the Future, if you will).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to make the audience understand what will come later, the filmmakers chose to show all of the childhood incidents first, which forces child actors to carry a movie in the beginning. Another gripe is the cheesy special effects they use to transport Evan back in time.<br/><br/>
But by the time the movie really gets going, you'll be so engrossed you won't mind these drawbacks.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher was also a strong leading man, and the movie really livened up once he took over the role from the kids playing his younger self. Amy Smart was also believable in her various roles.<br/><br/>This is really a movie that sticks with you long after you leave the theater."

This seems to be their `big chance,' if you will to `get him'<br/><br/>But what's to get?  This is a very good, if not great movie.  This is a story that has been told several times before, and, yet, the writers, directors, and especially the young cast, bring many, many new fresh angles to it.

He plays a young boy/teen/young man/adult trying to make things right.<br/><br/>
So, Ashton, if you're reading this: Know that you have a fine movie on your hands, the directing and writing are impressive, and this will be a cult hit not unlike the `Donnie Darko' phenom.  Be content in knowing that your negative reviewers `just don't get it.'"

I knew it was supposed to be a thriller, but I was not prepared for how grimly disturbing this film was.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher was surprisingly believable in his new dramatic role. And Amy Smart was awesome. I've always been a big fan of Amy, but this movie presented her the vehicle to show just how diverse she is as an actress. She plays a waitress, preppy college coed, hooker, and business woman all in one film and pulls it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was a bit confusing. But as the plot unfolds, the loose ends are all tied up nicely, leading to an ending that was somewhat unexpected.<br/><br/>The movie contains almost every kind of disturbingly taboo human behavior. Parts of it reminded me of ""The Good Son,"" which was also a very disquieting film. But this movie was multidimensional in that the underlying reasons behind all the troubling behavior are revealed in the plot.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the fact that the movie didn't have a lot of gore, although it certainly could have. It just didn't need to show it all to be effective (although there are a couple of places you might want to look away).<br/><br/>The movie left me with a lot of mixed emotions at the end. I thought the ending was basically fine, but not totally satisfying. And it just left me with an uneasy feeling. But after having time to reflect, I can say that I would recommend this movie without reservation. Just be prepared to he unnerved."
"wastebot","8","0","1","24 January 2004"," Excellent allegory for not trying to recapture the past
","It has my favorite type of ending - tragic yet happy.  A clever, and happier, variation on a Romeo and Juliet ending.<br/><br/>Along with Paycheck it has provided a great ending/beginning of the year for sci-fi/fantasy movies, especially after the very disappointing Matrix Revolutions and the mediocre Return of the King.<br/><br/>The story is so well developed, scary, and dramatic, I'm surprised it's not a book adaption.  Given that the main actors are more of the silly-sexy/teen lust variety, it provides a shock.  It focuses on the psychological and personal results of playing with time.  In the end, the result is an excellent allegory for looking forward, not backward.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it doesn't waste time inventing ridiculous machines to make the time travel seem real.  Hard SF has long since left time-travel to fantasy, and it would be nice if Hollywood did the same.<br/><br/>Of the variety of nice surprises in this film, 4 include:<br/><br/>-Eric Stoltz puts in a solid supporting performance.<br/><br/>-The R rating is not just for publicity reasons but because it actually deserves the rating.  It actually deals with adult issues.<br/><br/>-The soundtrack fits and doesn't interfere with the film.<br/><br/>-Exceptional visual FX that make certain aspects of the film seem real."

","I just saw this movie tonight and I was stunned. One of the most important things when seeing this move is to remain objective, it you keep Ashton Kutcher's old character in mind he will never break his constant type casting. Which is a complete waste of talent; in this movie he completely broke his mold.<br/><br/>	In the sense of acting this movie was great. Firstly Ashton Kutcher finally got his chance to do some real acting. His performance brought out his serious side, while still remaining that comedic charm he had. He delivered a strong and emotional performance. Amy Smart and Ashton showed true chemistry on the screen, bad you truly begin to believe the fantasy. `Willful suspension of disbelief' is the key phrase in this movie. And the perfectly cast younger versions of all the main characters made the past easier to accept and connect to the current place in the movie.<br/><br/>	The plot was great, apart from all the other time travel' movies; this one had much fewer plot holes. Those that did exist in the movie were minor and fairly insignificant. Every time he goes back, it is necessary and deliberate, nothing that he does in the past is accidental, but planed. The other thing that is awesome is how the visuals in this movie. All the colors in scenes (without giving anything away) were planned and deliberate, you could really tell what they were trying to say with each color choice.<br/><br/>	My personal favorite part about this movie is that the whole movie just came together perfectly. The actors fit the parts (Kutcher REALY did a great job, so to all you nay-sayers who said he's type cast for a reason' see this movie), and the visually, and the plot. Final verdict  a great movie, defiantly worth the money to go see it."
"rcavellero","8","0","1","24 January 2004"," A UNIQUE EFFECT!
","Walking into this film I'm sure expectations from anyone couldn't  be very high.  Especially since it's from the team that penned and brought together the Final Destination sequel and stars Ashton Kutcher in his first big dramatic role with a supporting performance from funny girl Amy Smart and unknown actor Ethan Suplee whom is just all over the advertising for this thing.  But throwing all those mis conceptions to the side. I must say that this film is pretty damn good.  Hell even great and has a very unique effect on it's surprised audience.  First I would like to give kudos to all involved the film is pretty ballsy, it's also extremely well done, has unpredicatble twists and is quite creative.  The only thing that falls semi flat is the acting, although it's not bad it's also not very good. And a story of this magnitude and importance could have used some better supprt. That said let's talk about what this film is about.  Sexy Ashton Kutcher stars as a young man whom has a strange illness that prones him to blackouts. As he grows older after an insufferable childhood he learns that he has the ability to go back and fix whats wrong with the past. But he can't do it without effecting the future. Every time he goes back he alters something else sometimes for the better but ultimately for the worse. His struggles invovlve a first love, a sadistic brother, murder, pedophilia, child pornography, drugs, prostitution and etc.  And that's putting it lightly the film comes together at an unexpected but necessary conclusion and manages to be truly one of the most depressing films ever made. So I urge all moviegoer's out there that wanna experience something different to run out and see The Butterfly Effect. It's more of an experience than a film and one thats not soon to be forgotten."
"Usability","9","0","1","24 January 2004"," Attend to the message of the film
","I am not sure why so many folks don't appreciate The Butterfly Effect.  OK, it is dark, both lighting and the feel of the movie is very dark.  OK, and it deals with escaping a bunch of unpleasant topics like perversion, killing, prison rape, prostitution, and, ...well the list goes on.<br/><br/>But let's rise above the setting, the desperation, and the grunge.  It is not the sexy grunge of The Matrix.  This is a great movie if you have the stomach for it.  The message of the film is ""What would you do to save the girl you love?""<br/><br/>If you could change the past, what parts would you change?  All of it!<br/><br/>Then there is the ending - you find yourself in a Greek-tragedy situation. I cannot give away the ending, but it rises above simple Hollywood.<br/><br/>What would you do to save the girl you love? What would you do to save the girl?<br/><br/>Attend to the message, not the grit."
"Juansmith","8","0","1","24 January 2004"," Disturbing, but incredibly well done
","There one was a director named Richard Kelly who made a little film called ""Donnie Darko"". If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. But I was intrigued when I saw this film's premise, and heard comparisons to Kelly's film. <br/><br/>I was also interested to see if the great and overexposed comedian Ashton Kutcher pull off a dramatic role. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Kutcher gives an impressive turn as a disturbed college student who can inexplicably travel back in time to reshape his existence.<br/><br/>
This film offers an interesting perspective into how events in our lives shape who we are. It demands that each member of the audience look into his own past to find the events that spawn the difference between the person you are, and the person you could be. It also makes you look at the effect you've had on others along the way.<br/><br/>It is not a happy tale; indeed, it is thoroughly disturbing at times. The ending, although only mildly unexpected, should leave the audience satisfied.<br/><br/>Amy Smart, Ethan Suplee, William Lee Scott, and Elden Henson similarly have impressive performances, sometimes being forced to play very different versions of themselves.<br/><br/>Not a film to perk you up, but certainly a satisfying experience, ""The Butterfly Effect"" gets an 8/10."
"SpiderCider","5","0","1","24 January 2004"," The definition of a thriller
","When I went to see this movie, I didn't expect much at all. During the first 20-30 minutes I was shocked at the subject matter that the movie was about. This movie is very, very dramatic. The things that happen in this movie are just so... wrong, and awful. I thought that the story was amazing, just simply great. The acting was also very good. Ashton Kutcher played ""Even"" in his 20's, very well. There were some sceen's that could have been stronger, but hey it's his first drama. But mostly in the movie he was totally beliveable and, very very good. Amy Smart plays ""Kayleigh"" very well, the character has so much range because of the story, it's hard to explain you just have to see it. Elden Henson was outstanding in his role of Lenny as an adult, simply outstanding. The sceen's he were in were just great. There isn't a bad actor in this movie, the jail section of the movie was just, disturbing. That's how I would describe this movie, extremley disturbing. This movie has the best child acting I have ever seen, bar none. I gave this movie a 10/10. This was the most intense movie I have ever seen, it was just great. See this movie."
"Chas_Wolf","Null","0","1","24 January 2004"," Nice premise, excellent ending? (No spoilers)
","So where should I being?  With the ending of course!<br/><br/>I was halfway expecting them to take the ""happy happy"" ending or the ""horrific and neverending"" route that most of today's films try to take.<br/><br/>To put it mildly, I was pleasantly surprised when they chose an ending that was an excellent fit with the material, and quite powerful in and of itself.<br/><br/>A very good choice, defying today's morass of instant gratification and cynicism.<br/><br/>While the performances weren't QUITE spot-on (Kutcher's a bit shaky at points..though, if I was hopping paradoxes, I'd probably be a bit shaky myself), they're not awful.<br/><br/>A bit more definition probably could probably have been given to the circle of friends surrounding Kutcher and Smart, though I'm unsure if this would have lessened the impact of the somewhat drastic changes they go through.<br/><br/>The only flub in the movie was the prison sequence.  Evan does something to ""prove"" his ability to another inmate.  However, in all actuality, the inmate's perception would have modified WITH the change in history.  So he wouldn't have been convinced of anything.<br/><br/>So one slight, but important ding on the plot.  Nevertheless, still kinda a funny-scary moment with the manufacturing of that proof.  And in a sci-fi/psych thriller like this, it's one of those ""payoff"" moments that makes people sit up in their seats.<br/><br/>All in all, I liked the film.<br/><br/>About the only thing I have to say ""bad"" about it is, I REALLY wouldn't take kids to see it.  Some of the subject matter's just a bit too ""adult"" for them."
"TheDemko","Null","0","1","24 January 2004"," Unique in its own right
","I saw this flick last night, and was more than impressed. The movie had many 'shock you' moments in it - moments that caused the entire audience to all gasp at once. I love movies that accomplish that. The concept of being able to arbitrarily go back in time and change what you think needs to be changed is not a new one, but in all other movies it's been in, typically paradoxical elements are easily noticed and somewhat bothersome. While there are logical flaws in the general plot line of The Butterfly Effect, the audience is brought on board in such a way that they seem to be more willing to go along with those flaws. <br/><br/>    One exception was (VAGUE SPOILER WARNING!) when Evan is in jail, and attempts to show his cell mate his ability to create scars on his body. That was one scene that seemed out of place and trite for what it needed to accomplish, especially knowing that the incident he caused during his childhood would have affected his future a lot more than it did. Everything else, I was on board for.<br/><br/>    Ashton Kutcher's ability to play a serious character, I believe, has been proved through this movie. Some say his ability to act has been called into question. I tend to disagree. I think his ability is fine. He's just chosen some poor roles up until this point, and now, he's been pigeonholed as a bumbling idiot. He plays a fine role in this... in fact, he seems to play several roles, changing just slightly for each reality. His emotions ring true.<br/><br/>    Amy Smart has come a long way since 'Road Trip', but her somewhat forced emotions still show through. She did well enough at the tasks which she was assigned, and did go above and beyond the call of duty, completely changing her character from scene to scene. However, her emotional displays did seem somewhat inept.<br/><br/>    The casting of the younger versions of all of the characters was excellent. I especially noticed this during the hypnotism scene with the younger version of Evan. His facial ticks and expressions very much reminded me of his older counterpart.<br/><br/>    Overall, I enjoyed the uniqueness of this movie. It was innovative in its time-traveling plot line, and the end-product is definitely one worth watching. Here's hoping you get the same enjoyment out of it that I did."

","So your life isn't perfect. You've had some pretty traumatic experiences you've managed to 'block out'. It's not that unusual; after all, you've experienced blackouts since childhood, most notably when these traumatic incidents occur. Must be your brain's way of coping, or something, because bad memories just aren't that great, right?<br/><br/>For Evan (Kutcher) a university Psych major, working on how the brain and memory are linked, and how memories can be recovered (specifically his own, perhaps?) maybe the occurrence of his blackouts mean slightly more than just a coping mechanism of his tortured grey matter. Having kept meticulous journals since he was a  kid on the advice of his shrink, Evan starts re-reading long-forgotten passages from the stacks of composition books he's taken with him to assist with his research.<br/><br/>That's when the weird stuff starts.<br/><br/>We're treated to nifty optical effects - the words shifting and fluttering on the page like a butterfly's wings (Meant, I suppose, to refer back to that quote from the ""chaos theory"" we're treated to at the beginning of the film - you know - the one about the beating of a butterfly's wings could result in a typhoon on the other side of the world, or whatever...) Evan is all of a sudden transported back to a time and place from his past - and he realises that what he is seeing is an event from one of his blackouts, what he thinks to be a repressed memory. Is it simply a memory he now is able to recall, or has he somehow found a way to actually physically transport himself back to that time where he can change the outcome of that event?<br/><br/>
We're never given any real reason why this phenomenon should occur - but that isn't what this movie is about. It is about a young man obsessed with creating for himself the perfect life, but in so doing either destroys the lives of those he cares about or has devastating consequences for his own. It makes us see that even the smallest event from our pasts and the choices we make then and there can have unforeseen and unpredictable results. Do we dare tamper with that if we had the ability?<br/><br/>Top marks go to Kutcher, because he gives an incredible performance that I didn't think he had it in him to give. The rest of the cast is simply superb, and the make-up artists need a big thumbs up for making us believe that the characters could appear mousy in one outcome, glamorous in another, horrifying and homely in yet another."

","Saw a trailer for it a few weeks earlier and really wanted to see it. Then went to a sneak peek tonite not knowing what to expect.  My expectations were met and exceeded by the acting, writing, and directing. Without giving anything away about the movie....  I thought it never dragged on, did an excellent job of the viewer sitting on the edge of thier seat waiting to see where Evan's flashbacks would take him.  It was a very solid movie and has earned Ashton Kutcher one more fan."
