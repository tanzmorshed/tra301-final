"DeadMansTrousers","7","30","37","23 January 2019"," Honest review of all 3 versions
","It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!<br/><br/>THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the ""cuts"" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.<br/><br/>SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the ""safe room scene"". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money."
"MR_Heraclius","8","47","65","23 February 2020"," I enjoyed this movie
","Deadpool is a great movie filed with a lot of jokes, however, it is above age 18 in since it contains a lot of bad words. The first movie of Deadpool I did not like a lot, however, the second one was a great movie. The first one was because it did not have a lot of meaning hidden, it was just a Marvel movie, however, the second one was the opposite its main idea was love, and this is the reason that I liked the second one more."
"Platypuschow","9","64","96","22 August 2018"," Deadpool 2: Worthy sequel
","I loved Deadpool (2016) I was blown away by it and Reynolds commitment to the character, it was fantastic.<br/><br/>I was however heartbroken when I saw the first trailer for this sequel, it looked pants. Not just pants, I mean granny pants. 15yr old, torn, badly stained (4 different shades) granny pants.<br/><br/>I've never been so happy about being wrong. Deadpool 2 delivers and is easily comparable in quality to the first movie and I sure as hell did not expect that.<br/><br/>With fantastic new additions, all the returning cast and excellent cameos this is the Deadpool sequel I desired but didn't expect (Or possibly deserve).<br/><br/>With it's brand of over the top violence, quick fire humour, endless pop culture references and Reynolds in the role he was born to play Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in a franchise that I don't ever want to end if it continues like this.<br/><br/>So damn funny, I can't wait to see what they do with the third movie. The concept however of bringing Deadpool into the existing Marvel Universe though fills me with dread. How could Deadpools brand of R rated goodness possibly fit into the Disney universe? Don't........do it!<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are fantastic again<br/><br/>So damn funny<br/><br/>Action packed<br/><br/>Soundtrack as random as it may be<br/><br/>The incredible during credits scenes<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>That kid, he's just beyond annoying in everything he's in<br/><br/>Some questionable casting choices for the new characters<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Everyday should be international womans day<br/><br/>Vinnie Jones is all grown up"

","I didn't think ""DP2"" could possibly be funnier than the first? It was! A bigger budget helps but as with everything? Writing, Directing & of course, the actors make this quite a film! It's all action & hilarity, from the first scene to the last! I'm not gonna spoil it? This movie grabs you from the starting credits, until the screen goes black! Not made for children!"
"kamau-15267","10","418","795","14 May 2018"," Loved it
","Your going to be hard pressed to find a movie more over the top than Deadpool 2, David leitch takes it to a whole new level entirely. It works namely because the violence here is just to creative. Sure it defies all Logic most of the time, but i was laughing and having a rip-roaring time throughout.<br/><br/>Go into this movie knowing that it is a campy, corny, over the top superhero/action/comedy that is just about crazy shooting sequences and one-liners, and you'll be fine. Do not go into this movie expecting deep plot, meaningful conversations among characters, or anything remotely resembling a serious action or drama movie. <br/><br/>Loved it...."
"agmuscat","6","352","698","16 May 2018"," Not as good as the first one
","After really looking forward to this movie, I came out of the cinema slightly disappointed. Theres plenty of joke and action but the jokes seemed to be a bit meh, I only remembered laughing out loud twice and story line is a bit disjointed. The problem I had is in the DP 1 you had the shock factor of a tongue in cheek mavel character but in this movie that's already gone, so you have to rely on a good plot but unfortunately it lacked that, so I felt a little bit bored by it. I'm not saying it not a good movie but I expected a lot more but sadly I felt let down."
"BiiivAL","8","336","671","4 June 2018"," The mad harlequin returns
","Two years ago, Ryan Reynolds' long-standing dream came true: the screen saw the screening of the ""Deadpool"" spitting on all morals and the foundations of the comic book. And as well as commercially there was a bomb success, it was proved that the charm is not only in black humor, greasiness and izhe.<br/><br/>And now the same team returned. Plus 100 million of the budget (the budget of the first in the region of 50), minus Tim Miller.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the director's change did not affect what was happening. But many were worried. It seems to me that everything is on Reynolds. On his charisma, zadore, drive and positive. Perhaps he was in the director's chair, and not only in the position of the co-author of the script and the producer. Even the promo campaign was also strong and with a ton of banter!<br/><br/>In general, the attraction develops according to the same plot scheme. Added characters, events. That's exactly what became more interesting - the appearance of the Cable. He really and excellent counterbalance to the mercenary-chatterbox, brighter than Ajax from the first part. Yes, the conflict built on it is also excellent.<br/><br/>And Brolin has finally proved himself in the movie comic book. It's not Thanos to voice! His bestial grin and brutality organically blended with the narrative. And I can not imagine an actor who played this character better.<br/><br/>Wonderfully fit and Bitz. Graceful young lady, perfectly acting out a comedic image. Everything is very organic. Boyega - learn!<br/><br/>And among the jokes about genitals, bunches and other sodomy, serious topics also run through: for example, the theme of family and relationships. And this, like in the case of the ""Sentinels"", is not attracted by the ears - dear audience, laughter with laughter, but do not forget about serious.<br/><br/>As for humor, then the authors also took a new line - in self-irony. I have not seen such a sincere and charming banter over myself for a long time! And here there is no transition to self-flagellation or kinks in the spirit of some publications. Even black humor and jokes below the pager are served deliciously and in moderation, rather than a stream from the machine gun a la modern comedies.<br/><br/>Keep the Mark!<br/><br/>An excellent adult action movie with meat, black humor, self-irony and banter over everyone and everything.<br/><br/>One question - what will surprise us in the third part? Question."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","336","677","11 May 2018"," Delivers the Hilarity, Vulgarity and Action-Packed Fun That I Wanted
","I was able to see Deadpool 2 at an advance screening. Deadpool shook things up and delivered offbeat fun when diehard fans were looking for something new from the genre. I thought it was a surprisingly well-rounded movie that perfectly encapsulated its hero and lovingly poked fun at both itself and other genre tropes. It was among my favourite movies of 2016. When it comes to bringing the laughs, I think Deadpool 2 is just as funny as the original entry. There's even more meta jokes, the same gleefully dirty spirit carries over and some unexpected payoffs left me cackling. They build upon some of the previous memorable bits (I admire Ryan for being so willing to relentlessly skewer his filmography) without it going stale. Luckily, they didn't ruin the movie by putting all the funny bits in the trailer and there's plenty to enjoy. They weren't afraid to push the envelope with the humour and stick around past the finale for a truly epic bit that rolls during the credits.<br/><br/>We've got all your favourite players back from Deadpool and I want to credit the writers for giving the opportunity for the characters to grow. Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is his typical wise-cracking self but he's found happiness and the change in his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) has really impacted his outlook. Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) return as X-Men members and while they're familiar, they're attitude does change towards Deadpool's antics. We also get back Dopinder (Karan Soni), Weasel (T.J. Miller) and Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) as the rest of Wade's crew and they all bring something new or hilarious to the film. I also really liked the new members of the cast; Cable (Josh Brolin) and Domino (Zazie Beetz) lived up to the hype. Cable has more depth than I expected and a highlight of Deadpool 2 was how they worked in Domino's ability into the action. They were so creative in how her abilities changed the way the action flowed. I also really liked the character of Russell (Julian Dennison) and how they used him in the movie. He becomes the driving force of the plot and they shape his character in a way that finds a nice balance between too soft and too arrogant. If I had any complaints, Eddie Marsan's character is one of the weakest villains I've seen in the genre, he has little dimension and his screen time is limited. I also preferred the treatment of a few of the original characters in the initial installment (Negasonic and Blind Al were stronger in the first movie). Keep your eyes open for a couple of surprise appearances by a few famous faces in the X-Men lore. <br/><br/>Director David Leitch is well known for his work in stunts and co-ordinating memorable action set pieces. This has carried over into his directorial efforts, I had a general knowledge of this going in, so I was expecting big things. Again, this movie rose to the task. It equals the original and, in some ways, surpasses it. I've already mentioned Domino, Colossus has a standout fight in the finale of the movie, the direction the movie decided to go with the initial X-Force mission was very surprising and I also liked Cable and Wade's first fight in the prison. The movie doesn't have a signature scene like the 12 bullets opening in Deadpool but there was never a moment that I was bored when the severed limbs were flying. Leitch and his team definitely got the job done and they balanced the humour and the thrills superbly. <br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds followed up his signature turn as the foul-mouthed mercenary with an equally impressive performance. He's joined Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr. as the benchmark of acting within the genre and I question if anyone else could even come close to him playing this character. Morena Baccarin still has great chemistry with Reynolds and their relationship remains as sweet as it did before. Brolin is appropriately cast as Cable, he lived up to high expectations and was appropriately gruff. Zazie Beetz is great as Domino, her casting was met with a lot of criticism but she's funny and I wish we had spent more time with her. Karan Soni carried over his charm from Deadpool as did Brianna Hildebrand. Julian Dennison did a solid job as Russell, I hadn't seen his previous work, but I can understand why so many people were excited to see him. Terry Crews, Bill Skarsgard, Lewis Tan and Rob Delaney were all good as the new X-Force members. Delaney was the standout as Peter. I also liked Stefan Kapicic and Leslie Uggams in their respective supporting parts.<br/><br/>One of the more surprisingly successful parts of the original Deadpool movie was the love story between Wade and Vanessa. It was surprisingly effective, and I dug the direction they took with it. Deadpool 2 is a story about family and while it still worked, it didn't tug at my heartstrings like the emotional core of the first one did. This isn't the fault of the actors or even the writers, it just didn't have the same impact.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a great sequel. It delivers a potent mix of both action and comedy. I was impressed that they refused to rest on the laurels of the original adventure and tried to do something new with it. If you found the first one too crude, too violent or too meta, I don't think this one will work for you. Its a movie that stands on its own, but you get the same creative expression as you did in the first one. I wouldn't say this is better than Deadpool, but it is on that same level for me. Its not perfect so I can't go all the way to a 10 but my actual rating is 9.5/10."

"jtindahouse","9","3","3","22 September 2019"," Now THIS is how superhero movies should be made
","I'm the first to admit I am not a big fan of superhero movies. They take themselves way too seriously, are all the same and are way too easy to write (because whatever power a hero needs to get the job done, he always conveniently has - something that is wonderfully made fun of in 'Deadpool 2'). The only superhero movies I have ever really enjoyed were 'Batman' when Christopher Nolan was making his trilogy. But now even 'Batman' films have become terrible sadly. That's why 'Deadpool' is such an incredibly refreshing character. Not only does he not take himself seriously, he knows how stupid all the others are for doing just that and makes fun of them accordingly.<br/><br/>This movie is flat out hilarious. It's one of those films where you aren't finished laughing at one joke before the next one is being thrown at you. It's actually exhausting (in a good way). I lost count of all the great quotes in this film. I kept thinking to myself that I need to remember them, but eventually there were just too many to do that. The writing on this movie is phenomenal.<br/><br/>If 'Deadpool' were a serious character I would be very frustrated by the fact that he basically can't die or be hurt (what would be the point right?). But because of the way the film sets itself up, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. In fact it just leaves more time for hilarity. The soundtrack on this movie is also amazing. 'Deadpool' is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and if you're like me and don't like superhero movies usually, give this one a try. I suspect you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"UniqueParticle","9","5","6","25 August 2019"," Beyond hilarious especially the extended version
","I originally saw this and Deadpool in the theater both fantastic experiences! Ryan Reynolds was born for this role; his humor is one of the best things ever and the action is entirely epic! I have enjoyed anything directed by David Leitch, his style is a hugely budgeted and exhilarating experience. No matter what others say this is just as good as the first one if not better."
"starlord-84597","9","262","564","15 May 2018"," An improved formula!
","Before the viewing of this film, I lowered my expectations knowing that majority of sequels are not as good as it's predecessors, but luckily the cast and crew made sure that this sequel is better in every aspect. Deadpool 2 abounds in funny moments, action scenes and importantly emotional ones, which were kind of weak in the first installment. This sequel bring some teachable moments on the table, but not too much, so the core of the movie is still very Deadpool-esque. The humor is similar to that of the first, with couple more pop culture jokes which might be a problem for some viewers, but for the most part they are easily understandable with the basic knowledge of pop culture. Along with well known original cast, we have couple of newcomers who fit in the cast perfectly. Brolin has a lot of screentime and he delivers in each scene. It features very entertaining references and cameos, and has one of the funniest post credits scenes in superhero movies, so be sure to stick around untill the very end. All in all, Deadpool 2 is a movie that can be enjoyable not only for fans of superhero genre, but for all who want to have a laugh while enjoying interesting action scenes."
"RetroRick","4","158","345","19 August 2018"," people in glass houses etc
","It just saddens me that this film is so highly rated. There were parts of it I enjoyed but not that many. The tie-in with the X-men world worked for a while because of deadpool's looser sense of ethics, and the reduced circumstances of his - and the kid's incarceration in mutant prison almost makes him vulnerable enough to care about, but none of that lasts, and for the majority - and after those events - remainder of the film, we find ourselves in the presence of someone who not only won't die, but - and of course it is his trade-mark - won't shut up. All superheroes are effectively immortal, but there is something about deadpool's unkillability that really destroys any tension in this movie, and unfortunately it is all done quite deliberately. In most superhero movies we know that that the (super)hero must survive but somehow also worry about them. With deadpool though everything is an in-joke, and that includes the fact that superheroes - deadpool at least - are indestructable, and the movie plays with that endlessly. There is at least one funny scene that arises out of this (consequent to his meeting the monster in the prison basement) but for the most part it simply means we don't care about what happens in the way that we normally would and since the writers appear to anticipate this we are treated instead to endless knowing jokes about his desire to die. The intention seems to be to try to make deadpool into some kind of existentially tragic figure - but unlike say groundhog day, where unkillability becomes a metaphor for sameness of every day, the writers completely fail in this respect. Deadpool's loss (of a loved one) and motivation never seem real, and when he somehow finds a mission in the redemption of one of the characters in the movie it just doesn't seem like something he'd actually do. 
 
There's also the politics of the film. Leaving aside the PC aspect (which is pretty much universal these days) there's also something disturbing about the hate figures in the film. The people who run the 'ophanage' in the fim are thinly disguised religious bigots, and not only the main 'preacher' like head of the institution but all of its staff - who are likened to paedo philes - are simply despatched as token 'haters'. Given the controversies surrounding some of the people who made the x-men films themselves there is something slightly ironic about this - people who live in glass cages shouldn't ....etc.. That's not to say the mutant hating bigots aren't to be faulted, but that we shoiuld perhaps be a little wary about taking our morality from anything as ethically warped as deadpool, a man who though he can't be killed or effectively injured despatches legions of bad guys more in offence than defence, and typically in nasty and fundamentally unfair ways. In fact at times, particularly at the beginning, deadpool as a superhero feels like the cinematic version of shooting, stabbing, hacking and decapitating fish in a barrel.<br/><br/>
I just find everything about this film immature and fake. However it probably does know its audience, who from the ratings would appear to like being force fed dubious easter eggs, not to mention hollywood politics and morality. In truth I'm probably just too old for this kind of film, but at the same time I kind of feel so should anyone older than a teenager"
"StaneSKT","8","230","522","12 May 2018"," Well-Done Action Packed Sequel
","As you expected, Deadpool 2 is all that we expected and above. The action does not stop almost the entire movie, the new characters are great especially Cable and Domino. The humor as you expected is something without which the movie will not be the same ... yet it is a distinctive feature for the character of Deadpool.<br/><br/>The story is good and you can expect some surprising people to interfere in the the movie, but I will not tell you, see for yourself. The effects are very good, the music choice fits great with the action scenes and the individual moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Supporting roles also do not lag behind and accumulate a lot of points. If I have to determine which is the best part of the movie, then that's undoubtedly Josh Brolin as Cable.<br/><br/>I advise you to stay to the end of the movie, there are some pretty good things waiting for you (aftercredit scenses)."

It works at first but after awhile becomes so annoying people quit laughing and just start ignoring the person. That basically sums up this movie. Funny for about 10 minutes, tolerable for the next 10 minutes, and annoying for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>As a result this movie quickly became a long, boring, clichÃ©d. over hyped, unfunny, annoying, and disappointing mess. Linear storyline, no plot twists, forgettable characters (with the exception of Domino), uneven pacing, marginal acting, and just totally forgettable. The entire movie was lazy writing!<br/><br/>One star for the character of Domino and one star for the rather interesting trailer insert at then end of the movie but other than that not worth watching much less paying to see it first run.<br/><br/>Look for this one to be out in DVD by July and in the discount movie bins at Walmart by Christmas."

I assumed it was a movie that got better the more you watched and they were saving the better laughs for the second half.

Cable was completely ruined and Domino is now a ditsy clown. They couldn't have selected a worse actor for the character for Nathan.

"xamtaro","10","93","214","17 May 2018"," Heartfelt, Tragic, and Darkly Humorous. Ups the Ante on Everything in the First.
","DEADPOOL 2 is a family movie, or so claims our titular protagonist. An extremely violent, witty, fourth wall breaking family movie. At its core is a tale of loss, a tale of wanting to belong, of failed father figures, and the cycle of vengeance all wrapped in a message of overcoming personal tragedy to be better individuals. It mixes genuinely funny comedy, pop culture references and lovable characters with a deeper more personal tale of the Merc with a mouth put through .<br/><br/>As with the first movie, DEADPOOL 2 defies genre and subverts viewer expectation at every turn. Each time a ""typical"" story beat or trope is brought up, it is soon subverted and deconstructed in the most clever way possible. An escape plan right out of PRISON BREAK? Does not end well for Wade and Russell. An action packed vehicular chase through the city? Very different from what one would expect. A team up with a bunch of badasses to form X-Force? Yup, definitely not how one would think it would go. In fact, DEADPOOL 2 subverts all expectations of what Deadpool should be about. <br/><br/>Even the characters undergo this subversive deconstruction. The poor abused boy who's supposed to be running scared? He's starting to show the makings of a serial killer. The part man part machine time traveler Cable? He is the embodiment of ""generic 90s comic badass"" taken to its logical extremes, complete with tragic motivations, growling voice and eternal scowl. And it all works in the context of the franchise's self referential humour.<br/><br/>Deadpool himself is slowly revealed to be a stepford smiler, using humour as a means to bury the pain he feels while he undergoes the various stages of grief. Ryan Reynolds effortlessly channels both Deadpool's funny and dramatic side, bringing an earnest portrayal that serves as the heartfelt emotional core of the film. The narrative does venture into some heavy territory, showing the initially self serving Wade subconsciously subjecting Young Russell to the same emotional neglect that his own father put him through.<br/><br/> The script, courtesy of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Reynolds himself is masterfully written, full of wit and charm. Jokes come perfectly timed where appropriate, segueing into drama and back again without coming across as jarring. It even improves on the musical aspect.<br/><br/>The score, now composed by Tyler Bates (WATCHMEN), sounds much more epic and unique compared to the previous work by Junkie XL. The choices of songs, peppered throughout the movie, have lyrics that run parallel to what is happening in the story itself; cleverly used to heighten the emotional impact of many scenes.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie and a great sequel. Not perfect though. The steady clear shots and fluid fight choreography that Director David Leitch brought to movies like JOHN WICK is missing here. Instead it is replaced by rapid fire cuts and some erratic editing which, in hindsight, may have been a cost cutting measure considering how some of the special effects, particularly on some fully CGI characters, look spotty at times.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, nitpicking aside, DEADPOOL 2 takes its titular character to new depths, ups the ante on everything that made the first movie such a hit, and then goes beyond with bigger action, a new cast of unique and relatable characters, and all while keeping it grounded in the very personal tragedy that is the life of Deadpool.

","Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry. <br/><br/>For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these ""cosos"" are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.<br/><br/>With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their ""toys"". <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichés.<br/><br/>Pretending to be ""set sail"" for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much ""attitude surpassed of everything"", both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line. <br/><br/>In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film's issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips. <br/><br/>The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body."

","I had high hopes coming to this movie but I must say it was chaos everywhere! The story line isn't great and although I normally find Ryan's comedy natural it does overstep and get annoying quite frequently in this outing.

"richrd-macwan","2","158","388","21 May 2018"," A sheet disappointment! (WARNING: SPOILERS)
","When I read that Tim Miller, the director behind the original leaked footage and the first deadpool, was pushed out of this project, I already had low expectations from this one. But man oh man, I didn't expect it to be such a pile of garbage!
I fail to grasp how this film has an 8.2 rating here!! 
The plot is too weak, the jokes are ok but mostly badly placed. The character of deadpool is one of the most innovative ones in the comics to which the writers should have been faithful. Reynolds has become so cocky with his success of the first film that he feels that 'Deadpool' is just a mixture of dirty jokes and action. I wish he had researched more on this character, tried to be faithful and not push his own interpretation of the character into the film. By the time we have the last Deadpool movie, I am afraid Deadpool would not be much different from his character in Van Wilder ! IMO , regarding the faithfulness of the character, the first leaked footage was perfect, the first deadpool movie acceptable, and deadpool 2 a complete disappointment. And yes, taking liberties with the character and story but still being faithful to the overall essence of the character is very well possible. Logan was an excellent example of this.
Thé stories of Deadpool are like a whirlwind, there shouldn't be really any sense in what he does because he is insane, clinically insane! Whereas Reynolds' DP just falls mild. True he is in love with Vanessa, but who says love cures insanity? Where are the voices in his head? It was there (barely) in the first film, during the bullet counting scene, but that's it. 
Where is the mess that he makes by bad misplaced decisions and eventually has to make the best of a difficult situation? Where's the conflict? In the form of the fat mutant kid who is abused. Original! Deadpool story arcs are generally out of the norm and downright weird, like a tornado where the characters get sucked in and are bounced around willy-nilly, eventually forced to make decisions, difficult decisions, to fix stuff. In the film, cable makes an idiotic decision of not seeing his now living family, for whom he was ready to kill a kid, by saving Deadpool. Whom he hardly knows, and in the process losing the opportunity to see his family ever again! Why? Because there was this 'indestructible' collar on his neck. Which we have already seen broken a few times earlier in the film.
I had missed the first 10 mins of the film, but I am sure that even if had missed the first 45 minutes, I would have easily grasped the nearly inexistant plot. For a moment I was hoping that after Deadpool's death (which I think should have happened in the first half) he would actually be able to meet ''Death' who is his love interest in the comics. That would have been really interesting. And you know who else is in love with Death? Thanos! It would have been a great plot device and a possible future connection with the MCU! Ridiculous but yet possible because, hey that's what Deadpool is all about, stretching our notion of impossible and ridiculous. Who else would be crazy enough to love death? Except Thanos of course!
And when was Negasonic a science genius who could repair such a device? I hate it when film creators think the public idiots. It's true many of us are, but we are not all so stupid that we will eat any commercial garbage you throw at us, just because it is based around a character we love. Stay faithful to the character!!!
And yes the CGI!! It was disturbingly terrible.. The juggernaut ? It felt like it was done by an amateur. Reminded me of the CGI in the films dating from the 2000s! There are many more plot holes, and problems with this movie, which would fill up a book. In short, avoid this movie if you really like the comics or the first film. I was heartbroken after watching this film. Many a times art is sacrificed because of vanity and greed, and this is an unfortunate example. I am going to erase this nonsense from my head by watching the leaked footage and playing the game Deadpool.
I give it two stars for the two times I laughed in the film. Once during the credits(related to Reynolds, mind, not Deadpool), and the other, I don't remember and frankly don't care ."
"grantss","8","5","7","3 March 2019"," Hilariously funny: a great follow-up to the first Deadpool movie
","After his trials and tribulations in the first movie, the life of Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) has now settled down. He's still killing bad guys, but it's more business-as-usual now. Moreover, he and girlfriend Vanessa are madly in love and want to start a family. Then a tragic event throws his life into disarray.<br/><br/>The first Deadpool movie was great, and was a very pleasant surprise, being a comic book movie. Instead of the usual CGI-driven, all style no substance, drivel that most comic book movies are, Deadpool was a comedy, and a really good one. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 continues in the same vein. Some brilliantly funny, laugh-out-loud moments, often based around in-jokes, cultural references and film-industry-deprecating humour.<br/><br/>More action than the first, which is disappointing. Part of Deadpool's charm is that it parodies other comic book movies. By becoming an action movie it threatens to become what it is parodying. There's always an element of humour involved though, even in the deadliest fight scenes, and in so doing the writer and director manage to avoid the hypocrisy of the film becoming what it mocks.<br/><br/>Great work again from Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool: his comedic timing and delivery is spot-on. Good supporting cast, with Josh Brolin playing a great straight character to Reynolds' clowning."

Simply having Ryan Reynolds break the fourth wall to acknowledge the fact that the writing is ""lazy"", does not make it ok for the writing to be lazy. I also feel the action was far worse in this film compared to the first one, with there being far too many cuts for an audience member to follow what's happening. Overall I feel every aspect of this movie was done worse than the first one. I frankly wouldn't reccomend it, as I was bored, unamused, and am already forgetting what happened throughout the film.

"morissaschwartz","3","124","308","18 May 2018"," Plotholes and Heartbreak
","Like most of us, I have been waiting eagerly for over two years to see Deadpool 2. I was so excited about this premiere, that I donned my Deadpool shirt, jacket, necklace, and socks and drove to a theater located an hour and a half away from my house, because it was the only one around showing the Deadpool double feature (at a pretty mighty $28 price tag). No part of me had even considered that this movie would be short of amazing. Boy, was I wrong! <br/><br/>Major spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>I loved Deadpool more than any other movie of the 2010s. Partly because of the humor and original take on superheroes (a genre that I keep up with religiously), partly because it came to me at a time when I was dealing with the cancer diagnosis of a close family member and the fact that Wade got his powers because of a sort of cancer treatment was pretty awesome, but mainly because of the smart writing. The latter sure went down the tubes in this installment. <br/><br/>Let's start with that beginning. Vanessa gets shot and killed. It seems that ever since Bateman V Superman, these new superhero movies all feel the need to kill off our main characters...but we'll get to that later. <br/><br/>Deadpool tries to unsuccessfully kill himself multiple times, and each time he is 'close' he gets to see Vanessa in this dreamlike afterlife for a brief moment...see, something I liked about Deadpool was that is was at least sort of 'believable' in a comic book sort of way. But these afterlife sequences struck me not as emotional, but just plain dumb. They did not fit into a movie like this. This is not What Dreams May Come. It's a humorous superhero movie. <br/><br/>Then, after a strange series of events, Wade goes to jail with a fourteen year old mutant. First off, why would a fourteen year old be going to an adult prison? I understand it's a prison for mutants, but you'd think they'd definitely separate the kids and adults. Also, the kid was clearly being abused. How did only Deadpool notice and take pity on him? <br/><br/>Anyway, while in jail, they have to wear these collars that take their powers away. Now remember, Wade's power is that his body instantly heals itself. So how is it that when the collar goes on him, his cancer instantly comes back? Because if we are going by that thinking, that anything his body healed after receiving his powers would be reversed, then wouldn't every bullet wound, knife slash, and injury that he has sustained since receiving his powers do him in? Otherwise, how is it that the cancer came back so quickly and powerfully? If it was eradicated, it would be gone! It would not come back...and certainly not at such an impact. <br/><br/>Now, the whole jail scene goes on wayyy too long. Why do superhero movies all need jail scenes now, by the way? Guardians of the Captain America: Civil War, Suicide Squad....enough! <br/><br/>I will also add that there were far fewer laughs at this point than in the original. In fact, laughs are pretty rare. And when there is a joke, 4/5 times, it is pretty cheap and unoriginal. That is, the original brought so much original material that any jokes here are pretty much a rehashing or something only a 14 year old boy while laugh at. <br/><br/>This is pretty much where the movie lost me. I realized that my beloved original Deadpool movie was an anomaly. A great treat. And Deadpool 2 would not be the same thing. <br/><br/>While there were a few more laughs as the movie progressed, most of the good one were already shown in the trailer. I kept searching for redeeming qualities and just kept getting let down. There were more plot holes than I could count, and Cable was underwhelming. <br/><br/>I will skip to the end, because that is where it really hits the fan. See, Deadpool even jokes about lazy writing at the fact that Cable can only travel in time twice: once to save his family and once to get back to them. At least he admits the writing is lazy. <br/><br/>Again, after an odd series of events, Deadpool winds up sacrificing himself for that fourteen year old mutant (who has an Australian accent that no one even addresses. Yet he way.) Yup, he joins the ranks of seemingly every other superhero in recent memory and dies. He does so by putting on the collar from prison that strips mutants of their powers and gets hit by a bullet. <br/><br/>But oh, wait, remember how Cable can go back in time? He does that and saves Deadpool. Now, if he really wanted to save Deadpool, why wouldn't he have just removed the collar as Deadpool was dying so that Deadpool could heal himself? The collars were removable. We had seen it get removed before! Then, he could have saved his time travel. <br/><br/>But nevermind all that, because as soon as the credits start to roll, we see Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her GF repairing Cable's time travel thingy, and guess what? They save Vanessa. This also allows Deadpool save one of the guys that he rounded up for his team...which makes no sense, as if he has the power to save that guy, why wouldn't he just prevent his team from jumping out of the helicopter so none of them died? Basically, this scene means that virtually everything that happened in this movie meant nothing. See when you add time travel into a movie like this, it renders so much of it nonsense. <br/><br/>There were a lot of other issues, but it would take a short book to point them all out. <br/><br/>The best way to describe how I feel is heartbroken. Deadpool was the rebel hero. His movie and comics were something different. He was sassy, funny, daring, AND smart. A part of me wants to purge myself of my Deadpool posters, comics, figurines, and apparel, but I can't let a bad sequel ruin the love I have for the original. At least we always have the brilliant original..."

"tomholland2016","7","91","221","12 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 is Alive of Pooling for Great Entertainment Purposes.
","Delivering a sequel means that the predecessor is a mainstream hit and a big success. Audience wants what they saw before but keep in mind that they too do not want to see what they saw before off of the previous installment. The quality of driving the path of a sequel has always been the journey of a bumpy ride of whether that movie successfully dodges the bullets of negative reviews or hits the bullseye mark of getting bad responses from the audience. Walk the talk, does Deadpool 2 live up to people's expectation???<br/><br/>Deadpool 1 has been a massive hit and die-hard fans have been asking for the second entry ever since. This mischief premise opens with Ryan's character, Wade Wilson babbles about his ongoing life and what has happened to him before we get to witness what brings him to be of that kind of emotional feelings that struck him to that day.<br/><br/>The plot here is rather simple compared to the previous movie. He keeps to his promises to narrate his own story. The dark green-blue tone appears once again to help telling Deadpool's depressing story who is bent on taking revenge for the miserable life he had. Deadpool 2 also shares an unbelievable delightful moral lesson as the curtains closes its storytelling.<br/><br/>This sequel delivers a top notch comedy compared to the original entry. It leaves you wanting more between stupid physical antics and harsh banters. However, there is a massive problem for the jokes to work out for people who do not have the knowledge of pop cultures. Why? Because David Leitch (Director) and the writers make use of mega-hit pop culture references from the latest biggest opening movie of all time, Avengers: Infinity War to the try-hard erotic sexual romance, Basic Instinct. There are so many of them you definitely can't count with your own fingers. Nevertheless, what makes Deadpool so fun is that the lead character is fully aware of this and is constantly commenting on it. This proves surprisingly fruitful terrain for a comic book movie. <br/><br/>Action-packed? Well, I hate to tell you this but it's not much. Basically, the probability of of action scenes is of the same percentage as the first one but it's more promising and stylish with Hollywood effects being thrown around for the sake of a good quality movie. Similar to Deadpool 1, the Big Finale is relatively small. It turns off people who are awaiting to hit a gigantic impact in the face for a final showdown because it does the same mistake by wasting the potential energy for the heroes to show off their mega powers and use the advantage to build the characters' developments with violence especially when it is given the golden ticket for a rated-R film. However, the problem with Deadpool entries is that it tries to be semi-realistic in the sense of a comic book movie with less action scenes and centralizes more of real-life teenage hormones affection. Ex: Dirty jokes, dumb characters.<br/><br/>You must be wondering the entirety value of the post-credits scene of either it's a precious gem or another waste sequence of garbage merely to fill up its holes for future entries/entertainment purposes. First off, Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips. But again, pop culture references are used in the making.<br/><br/>Verdict: 72/100. I personally feel that the sequel is better than its predecessor. It delivers humorous comedy that tickles both your brain and body. Deadpool 2 proves yet again that it is immature, childish, mischievous and entertaining in good ways. It also proves that Ryan Reynolds once again doesn't disappoint audience with his born-natural character. This is a movie that makes space for violence, sex, and swear words, but never bites the hand feeding it by diverging from formula. If there's one thing that we all can agree on, you will have a plenty of great time watching this movie."
"Jared_Andrews","6","19","38","6 June 2018"," An Infusion of Fun New Characters Makes DP2 better than the First
","The first Deadpool received much acclaim for being bold and unique. Viewers loved that it did and said things other movies were not willing to do or say. That's an issue for Deadpool 2 because it's a sequel and, by definition, cannot be as bold or unique because it is, by definition, similar to the original. <br/><br/> Many fans raised this concern about Deadpool 2. They worried it would be a rehash of the first film. I'm here to tell you that those fans are wrong. And they're also right. <br/><br/> Sure Deadpool 2 hits many of the same beats as the original. Hearing the notes a second time ring stale in some situations, but other times the writers tweaked the gags just enough to make them feel fresh. 
 One of the simplest and best ways to make a sequel feel fresh is to add fun and interesting new characters. Mission accomplished. Domino (rising star Zazie Beetz) announces her arrival loudly with a scene-stealing performance. The movie cleverly pokes fun at her possibly fake superpower, luck, while still empowering her enough for her to easily be the coolest character in the movie. <br/><br/> Josh Brolin also joins the cast for the sequel, making this his second villain role in a major superhero blockbuster this summer. Once again, he's terrific, settling once and for all the debate over ""can Josh Brolin succeed as an actor without a fake purple chin?"" Yes, yes he can. <br/><br/> The weak link among the actors is Julian Dennison. He plays the powerful and troubled teen, who call himself firefist. It's a terrible name and a mostly terrible character. It's not all Dennison's fault. He is not given much to work with in this part. The best thing he does in the whole movie is point out that no superhero or sidekick or remotely powerful person in a superhero movie is anything except exceptionally fit. He's right. Why not include one chubby friend who happens to have psychic powers? Or something like that. Be creative.<br/><br/> Firefist's relationship with Deadpool, along with some other event that I won't mention, provide the emotional stakes of the movie. My question: why is a Deadpool movie creating emotional stakes? Deadpool's entire gimmick is making fun of superhero movies and all their silly tropes, yet Deadpool 2 falls face first into those tropes. <br/><br/>This is supposed to be an action-comedy about a smart-mouth anti-hero. It doesn't need emotions. It rolls its eyes at emotions. The entire effort felt disingenuous. <br/><br/>The determining factor in this whole equation of movie's effectiveness is Ryan Reynolds. If you like the guy and find him charming and funny, you'll like this movie. If his schtick wears you out after a while, this movie will do the same. He rattles off what feels like nearly ten jokes per minute. Reynolds brand of comedy is an acquired taste and a potent one. A little goes a long way. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie works. It has just enough humorous moments, new material, and truth in its characters to accomplish the goal. It's a funny, self-aware, different type of superhero movie. It manages to match, or perhaps even exceed the level of the original. That's an achievement."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","16","31","22 May 2018"," Far from dead in the pool
","Like Marvel films better than some do, have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous MCU vs DCU war, and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing 'Deadpool 2'. <br/><br/>Being someone who really enjoyed 'Deadpool', though not completely loving it, expectations were high for the sequel and they were met. Like 'Deadpool', 'Deadpool 2' was very entertaining, and again credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. It's also a very good film and count me in as another person who found it an even better film than its predecessor (not many superior sequels out there), being funnier and more ambitious with a much better and memorable villain.<br/><br/>'Deadpool 2' for me did have its issues. There are instances where the special effects are rather ropy and artificial-looking.<br/><br/>Also personally found Julian Dennison on the annoying side and parts of the story are disjointed.
 <br/><br/>However, 'Deadpool 2' is very well made visually. Slick, stylish and brooding with generally typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp, and more in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting (the parachuting is unforgettable), the scale bigger and bolder, and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool 2' its heart. While not quite as resonant as in the first 'Deadpool' there is more of the man behind the mask.<br/><br/>Most of the humour is very funny and has enough freshness, though its extremely black and sometimes crude comedic nature again has proven to be an acquired taste. The jokes are more consistent and there are less ""don't quite land"" ones, while there is the vulgarity, the crudeness does not go overboard. As said, that it, like the first 'Deadpool', that tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally, while showing more ambition in depth and scale than its predecessor, and is occasionally disjointed, but the hugely energetic pace, emotion, tension and sense of fun elevated it. The final act is much better here, more exciting, less muddled and doesn't feel rushed.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma, vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role, one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. Even better is a brilliant Josh Brolin, bringing all the qualities, but with more gruffness and even more menace, that made Thanos in 'Avengers: Infinity War' such a great character and makes Cable a significant improvement by far over the villain in the first film, being actually memorable. <br/><br/>Zazie Beetz was a fun addition as Domino (don't agree with the criticisms directed against her), Morena Baccarin and her chemistry with Reynolds still has heart and all the cameos from the X-force members sparkle.<br/><br/>Overall, highly entertaining and a sequel and overall film that ticked most of the right boxes. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","Bad CGI, Barley a Plot, rushed villain & no where near as funny as the first film, negasonic barley gets any screen time in this, but the characters we do see are not really that interesting apart from Domino and some of the previous cast. Even though this film was Rated R it feels like Disney had some influence on this as it's a much safer deadpool movie along with so many MCU references. You can also really see the change in director as Tim Millers Deadpool was much more funnier, with a more dark X rated feel to it and a much more polished movie then this. Some of the action scenes are better this time around & stick around for the mid credits as they are pretty funny but that's pretty much it disappointing sequel."
"capaldimark","8","61","144","15 May 2018"," A rare case of a sequel being better than the original
","It's no secret that the first Deadpool movie was a huge hit, mainly because of its unique approach to a comic book movie, emphasizing comedy through its parody of various pop-culture references. Two years later, we now have the sequel, ""Deadpool 2"", directed by David Leitch, which is the eleventh film in Fox's X-Men film franchise. Deadpool 2 manages to be a slight improvement over its predecessor with plenty of the usual laughs you'd expect, despite having a plot that seems a little too familiar.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is seemingly set shortly after the events of the first movie, with Ryan Reynolds returning as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. In this, Deadpool is up to his usual antics: fighting crime, making jokes, and embarrassing criminals. However, things soon take a turn for the worse when he comes across a young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), who's currently being hunted by a cybernetic soldier from the future named Cable (Josh Brolin). To stop Cable, Deadpool forms a group with other mutants and calls the group ""X-Force"". It's an interesting story, but the problem here is that some of the aspects of the plot feel a bit too familiar. It's basic plot is very similar to ""The Terminator"", a robotic guy hunting down a young boy because the boy is important in the future in some way, shape or form. Of course, it's not exactly the same, as Deadpool 2 obviously has its own narrative elements that separates it from The Terminator, but the basic plot outline is a bit too similar. Nevertheless, the story does manage to be an improvement over its predecessor, as that movie had a very formulaic and predictable plot that bogged down the overall experience. Deadpool 2's plot, while familiar in a way, is much more coherent, unpredictable, and overall more engaging and satisfying. <br/><br/>What I really like and respect about the Deadpool series is that they don't follow the traditional comic book movie guidelines. Instead, it tries to be its own unique entity with its crude jokes and parody. Like the first film, it often breaks the ""fourth wall"" by making jokes about various other pop-culture fads and even other movies. It's a comic book movie but also a parody of everything that's popular in today's culture. It's certainly not ""kid friendly"" like Marvel's MCU movies, which is why it has an ""R"" rating. Although some may not like that, it's a refreshing and unique take on the superhero genre that helps keep it from getting stale. The movie has its fair share of jokes, but where it improves upon its predecessor is the quality of the jokes. I found myself laughing more often while watching this one compared to the first one where it only had a few decent laughs. Even though Deadpool 2 lacks the surprise element when it comes to the comedy because we knew what to expect coming into it, it still manages to be funnier than the first one, which speaks to the quality of the writing by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds. Speaking of Reynolds, he is just as good here as he was in the first movie. Many actors and actresses fit their superhero roles well, and Reynolds as Deadpool is no exception. <br/><br/>All in all, Deadpool 2 delivers exactly what you would expect: comedy, action, and an overall good time. It ends up achieving the rare feat of improving upon the original, even if it's only a slight improvement. In the summer of big blockbusters, Deadpool 2 makes it two for two so far."
"celtic451","2","69","165","5 June 2018"," Not really good at all
","This movie is way over hyped. I was sorely disappointed in it as I really liked the first one. The witty dialogue was way over done and over used - too much of it so it lost it's charm. And deadpool kept taking me out of the movie when he kept turning and talking to the audience about the movie's lazy writing - which ironically - he was right about. And why did they all think if the kid killed the guy that tortured him it would be bad for the kid? Deadpool himself killed the other pervert. That didn't make any sense. And what was the point of wasting our time interviewing for super heroes when they all died just skydiving? They didn't even get a chance to fight. And why was that one dude after deadpool in the first place? Too many holes in this thing. A complete mess. I want my time back on this one."
"RforFilm","8","20","41","21 May 2018"," Chimichangas! X-Men! Cable! Peter...and of course, Deadpool. Check out this review of Deadpool 2 written by the Merc with a Mouth.
","What's up suckas! It's your friendly Deadpool again with a bona fide sequel ready for your pleasure. You all probably remember the Oscar winning Deadpool (Fine! There were no nominations, but I should have won ""Best Actress""). It was a movie we'd tried to make for a while, but Fox wouldn't agree with the direction and the R rating that's the only way to do me justice. After much arguing and bedfellow time, Deadpool was finally made and was a big hit. That wasn't it for me. We then had shirts, cereal, a Christmas rap album, elementary school textbooks...you know, the stuff that appears everywhere!<br/><br/>Whatever, even if one or two of those things didn't happen, Deadpool proved that there is an audience for an R rated super hero story. So now we got more money and more freedom to do what we want with our sequel. So where do we go from there? In the previous movie, I teased that Cable would finally show up. It's not Keira Knightly, but I'm happy with what we have. We've also got more meta stuff, a full team, and plenty of the gory good stuff you want. Let's explore Deadpool 2 and see if it's just as good. <br/><br/>Just as I, Deadpool (Played by Ryan Rynolds) am settling into a nice lifestyle of sword slashing and target hunting, something awful happens to me when I nearly get myself killed...or blown up. It's only when Colossus brings me back to Xavier's (Stewart or McAvoy, take your pick) mansion where I agree to join the X-Men as a way of healing. When I try to help out a young mutant Russell Collins or Firefist (played by Julian Dennison), he and I get arrested where our powers are stripped as we try to do what we can. But that's the least of my worries.<br/><br/>Just as prison starts to look cushy, a cybernetic solider from the future Cable (played by Josh Brolin) breaks in to apparently kill Russell. I wasn't going to let this maniac get him, so I manage to separate us, but leaving Russell still in that prison. To prevent another strike, I finally decide to start a team I call X-Force. Joining this team also includes Domino (played by Zazie Beetz), Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand), Shatterstar (played by Lewis Tan), Bedlam (played by Terry Crews) and I think a guy named Peter; no powers, but seems like a team player.<br/><br/>What's best about Deadpool 2 is what you don't know. That's why I'm glad to say that the sequel is just as good as the first. Not better, not worst, but just as entertaining as my last outing. What's fascinating this time is that while the original Deadpool was a love story, the sequel is definitely a family story. Not that it's appropriate for children (which I'm sure they'll catch at a friends sleepover), but it's willing to dive deeper into my complex nature.<br/><br/>I have to say that aside from Ryan Reynolds doing another phenomenal job playing me, Josh Brolin makes for a fun Cable. Like a good buddy cop story, his grizzled (but understandable) nature is a fantastic contract to my anarchy ways. Perhaps if he's lucky, he'll get his own movie. I have to give kudos to young Julian Dennison whose not only a rare big kid whose not here to make fat jokes, but carries a lot of pain from his time before. Yet, I can't give away just why, but it involves more mutant discrimination. <br/><br/>So where does my movie not shine. I think it's from the fact that I seem too quick to the idea of joining teams even though my last movie was a tribute to why I wouldn't. That makes for a slight departure in character who only cares about himself and his close ones. That's not to say he gains new friends, but it could have used a bit more quieter moments to let it sink in. How about that humor? It hits well. My constant jokes, puns, and occasional forth wall breaks don't overshadow the movie's intent, but rather builds on that tone that people like.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight pictures of me with super soakers out of ten. What can I say but you know what your getting if your seeing my movie. So check it out if you want an X-Force movie...or at least a Deadpool 3."

"imseeg","8","2","2","29 May 2019"," Deadpool 2 is a great sequel, suited for adults as well. The same hilarious and riveting action as in Deadpool 1, but with more credible characters and better oneliners.
","A suicidal superhero comes to the rescue of a fat superhero kid who has got no friends. Will they live happily ever after? I didnt really like Deadpool 1, but I did like this sequel, because the jokes are better and thankfully there are some breathers in between the action scenes, so adults, who value characters and a good story, will be able to appreciate this movie as well.<br/><br/>Deadpool 1 had a too fastpaced tempo, which destroyed the fabric of the movie. Deadpool 1 was more of a longwinding gimmick, this time around though the characters and the story can be enjoyed though in a normal pace, which makes for a lot more pleasurable watching experience. The action is still fantastic, but even the action is more enjoyable, because it isnt non stop as it was in Deadpool 1. A pause now and then, with some hilarious sentimental scenes between the characters, greatly enhances the fun for me of watching these sort of bizarre action comedies, which are usually only made for teenagers, but as I said before this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well.<br/><br/>Watch out for some great short cameos by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. And there is some great seventies and eighties music to be heard by: Dolly Parton, AC/DC, Enya, Barbara Streisand and lots of others, whose music is truly hilarious in the context of this bizarre superhero story."
"statuskuo","3","40","91","29 May 2018"," Throw Things At A Wall
","SPOILERS!!!
There are a lot of things to like about this sequel, however politics aren't one of them. For one thing, referring to a weasely looking guy as Jared Kushner before shooting him in the head and excusing it as an act of revenge for a boy who had been tortured by anti-mutant hospital..defeats the purpose of showing the boy that killing is wrong to fix your life. Since in the future we see the boy grows up to destroy a LOT of life (Hitler anyone?). The point is Deadpool wants his cake and eat it too.
Sorry, the ultra-violent diffused with dark humor is the problem with desensitizing our young society into committing violent crimes. Regardless of studies, because frankly...overstimulation of this level of violence doesn't compute with the simple minded which is what we don't address. It's too touchy to say, SOME Americans are too dumb to differentiate fact from fiction. I grew up with violence on screen, but this takes it to a level where there isn't the consequences.
That said, the comedy also wears thin. Unless you grew up in a specific pop culture bubble, very little of Deadpool humor will land. You also get the sense that he thinks he is already three steps ahead of you before you can accuse him of anything. That smug attitude doesn't work in long form. Being this arrogant and then depending on the audience to root for you to get back to your love interest?...nope.
You just wish his likability didn't feel like a child who is yelling out loud for an adult to pay attention. Yes, it gets tiresome."

"moferner","2","50","117","6 June 2018"," Disappointing, chaotic and without any essence
","I went to see Deadpool 2, despite the fact that I usually dislike superhero movies. I've seen the first par,t a really funny movie that didn't take itself too serious and didn't care about the normal conventions of such movies, breaking the 4th wall, weird and misplaced humour made it an above average movie for me. 
So I went into this movie expecting something that would made me laugh and entertain me, of course knowing that second parts in generell tend to be more dull and less surprising.
What I got couldn't keep up with my expectations at all. 
Whoever wrote this mess of a plot should pay me my money back, it was like every existing clichÃ© of this genre was just mixed together to prevent making anything of value or essence.
But I wouldn't care too mzch about the weaknesses of the plot, if the movie,at least from time to time, would make me laugh and actually entertain me but that just didn't happen. So many characters, so many plots, so many different moods - are we suddenly supposed to take Deadpool's personal story serious? It is just as the movie couldn't decide if it wants to be something to be laughed at or not. And even Deadpool himself talking to us at certain points and telling us how stupid and lazy written the plot is can't save this mess. <br/><br/>The whole movie to me looked like all the worst parts of every superhero movie I've ever seen mixed together and combined with the deeply ironic ""Meta"" character of Deadpool, hoping to create something that in any way resembles the innovative and entertaining first part which just didn't work at all.<br/><br/>There was literally one joke in the movie that genuinely made me laugh and that was used in the introduction so I went pretty much a full 2 hours without anything making me laugh, which is pretty impressive because I think that in my whole life rarely 2 hours have passed where I didn't laugh or at least smirk about anything, so in that reagards the movie has done something pretty impressive,just being THAT unfunny. Definetely some of the least funny content that my poor eyes and ears ever had to witness."

","""Deadpool 2"" is a fine example of how the sequel can improve the original.

"MichaelNontonMulu","9","24","51","16 May 2018"," A Very Very Entertaining Sequel to the Wise Cracking Superhero
","Wow, this movie truly delivered. When I saw the first Deadpool movie, I was surprised at the totally different way of showing a superhero and I was really intrigued of how they would pull it off again in this sequel. It turned out that this time around, the action sequence was even grander and more amazing. I totally loved the scenes involving Domino, Deadpool and Cable in the city which were absolutely thrilling. And I was also amazed during the finale fights scene as well. With a great sound system from the theater, it really gave the complete awesome experience.<br/><br/>Just like in the original movie, there were so many funny moments which were delivered by the actors (mostly involving Deadpool and his friends). One person that was given quite a lot of comical role was the taxi driver Dopinder (Karan Soni) reprising his role from the first movie. Almost all the scenes in the film were funny and I personally felt that this one was even funnier than the original movie. It gave us various jokes and one liner, making fun of so many things which gave all the audience a good amount of laughter. My wife and I really enjoyed watching this movie as it made us laughed really hard a lot of time. My own personal favorite funny moment would definitely be during the scene involving Deadpool and his old roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) which was really hilarious.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was quite fast but there were occasional slower paced more dramatic scenes here and there. There was even a brief moment of touching scene towards the end that affected my wife a bit. Overall though, the movie was having a lot more fun and entertaining scenes. Through the entire movie duration which lasted for 2 hours, audience would be filled with a lot of craziness and jokes which should not be taken too serious. Like in all Marvel movies, this one also had 2 mid end-credit scene with the latter one also quite hilarious and should not be missed. <br/><br/>What I also like about this movie was the additional characters in this sequel were actually quite memorable. Domino was an awesome superhero and really kick-a$$. Cable was amazingly characterized by Josh Brolin (who was able to transform into a different character from playing Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War earlier). And Russel was also greatly portrayed by the young Julian Dennison. The chemistry of all those characters were nice to see and you would notice that they really had great fun playing this movie. One thing that I noticed missing here, were the use of the fourth wall was not as frequent compared to the original movie and replaced more by the narratives by Deadpool.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a very fun, enjoyable and entertaining superhero movie, which was very violent, had an R rating and should not be seen by children. There were so many killings, body dismemberment and foul language used here that were really not suitable for the young audience. So if you are a fan of the original movie, you should definitely watch this one and I am sure you would have just as much fun as my wife and I did.<br/><br/>For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
"keyope","4","135","346","16 May 2018"," Not very good
","Deadpool 2 has its share of funny moments and action but there is so little in the way of plot that it's impossible to care what happens to anyone. What plot there is doesn't even really start until about 45 minutes into the movie. The first 45 minutes is like an extended prologue that should have been cut to a montage in the opening credits.
The best thing in this film was Domino, the female character whose superpower is that she's lucky. The other new characters are totally forgettable. Even the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople is wasted here. His character isn't likeable and doesn't even have any funny lines that I can remember.
There were lots of moments that were meant to be serious, but with the lack of any conflict these parts were just boring. And whenever it did get funny, it usually had nothing to do with the plot.
Overall this film is badly paced and structured, with a plot that's barely there."

"hannahgrahambell","7","19","39","22 May 2018"," Successful Sequel
","Deadpool 2 masterfully pushes the wild humor and emotion to new heights, which sufficiently covers up narrative flaws and a misstepped social commentary.
Compared to Deadpool, Deadpool 2 seems more comfortable handling the elements that made the original a success. The humor is bolder and more self-aware because the audience is already familiar with the characters. Ryan Reynolds masters the tricky balance between heavy emotion and outrageous wisecracks because the audience is trained to expect a joke for every heartfelt scene, and the movie gladly obliges. Every trick in the book is used to evoke emotional responses, but the winks to the audience make such manipulation acceptable, even welcome. 
For those worried that Deadpool 2 is more of the same, they needn't fret. The movie introduces a handful of new characters, each well-acted and funny in their own way. There are also some celebrity cameos sprinkled in. Sure, some of them are there solely to make a joke or two, but a couple of the new characters clearly places in future movies. 
Compared to some superhero movies, Deadpool 2 has a streamlined narrative and pulls off a highly successful third act. The climax of the movie not only avoids the Marvel ""villain problem,"" but it's also packed with great action, hilarious jokes, and solid character moments. This success overshadows some plot inconsistencies in the first and second act, which are minor but might bother some hypercritical audience members.
Despite Deadpool 2's undeniable strengths, two features hold it back slightly. First, the subject of death is handled with such inconsistency that it seems jarring. One character's death is an unspeakable tragedy, while another's is just a comic bit. The movie missed an opportunity to make fun of the careless treatment of civilian deaths in comic-book movies, but instead fell into the trope. Deadpool 2 also tried to make a progressive commentary on diversity in superhero films, but its minority characters did not have particularly strong roles. Thus, this commentary seemed a bit undeserved and out-of-place. 
For fans of the original Deadpool, the sequel will not disappoint. The movie capitalizes on what it did well in the first movie and the result is a riotously entertaining, surprisingly emotional, and satisfying second installment."

","I loved the first Deadpool movie. It had good action, catchy one liners, and DP's trademark 4th wall breaking. This second outing has all of that too with the addition of Deadpool now being a full blown social justice warrior! Because that's exactly how a badass former special forces operator who is now a mercenary would talk. Calling Cable racist throughout the movie because he asked Dopinder to turn off his music. Saying Black Tom is using cultural appropriation (a hallmark term for SJWs) because he's a white guy using that name. I could go on and on. I admit there were some good pop culture references and lines that gave me a light chuckle but overall DP's left wing schtick got tiresome fast. He is nothing like that in the comics and he was nothing like that in the original movie. If you don't like being hit over the head with propaganda disguised as jokes watch the first one and call it a day."

More likely is that this is some sort of experiment/joke, with the studio wallers wanting to see just what they could get away with on a selection of gullible cinema goers. Sort of a 'the king's clothes' situation.

","Deadpool 2 is a example of what happens when you make a sequel and don't care.

"frank_foresta","2","59","145","26 May 2018"," I Really, Really Hated This Movie
","I need to start by saying I see pretty much every Marvel movie and usually enjoy them all. This one is an exception. I enjoyed Deadpool's first outing fine - but this one takes it too far.<br/><br/>I think based on the success of the first film, the people behind Deadpool 2 thought they could amp everything up - the sillyness, the crudeness, and the ridiculousness. While I don't personally have a problem with the amped up crudeness, the silly, nonsensical nature of the film goes way too far. At times it's a laughable mess that's absolutely unwatchable. <br/><br/>The whole narrative that this film takes on is unnecessary and the lengths it goes to in order to be able to tell the story of the helpless kid mutant is absolute ludicrousness. The kid's story is fine, but Deadpool's narrative suffers for it because the movie isn't really about him, his life, or anything that made us like Deadpool's first film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I wouldn't see this movie again if I was paid the ticket price just to go. It's that bad."

The story line was very good, but, as usual, Hollywood can't seem to offer America anything but filth.

Hoping to see some great X Force action then found out that they were Barely even a thought. Then read after the movie that all the sequences of the X force in the trailer were purposely filmed only for the trailer and were never planned to be in the movie except to accomplish a single pointless gag. Then you'd feel lied to like I did. <br/><br/>That aside the movie was a loud pointless crap show that tries way too hard to be witty and likeable but inevitably ends up cramming in every low hanging fruit it can. I assume that many will like that quality and will argue that that is the point of Deadpool. That being said. Even the first Deadpool had a sense enough to feel real and let the drama sink in here and there. It felt like the plot mattered."

And that first bowl is great but then the second not so much...<br/><br/>Something is off here and this is from a fan of the first one which I thought was both funny and well acted - great adult fare.<br/><br/>Tim Miller, the director of the first film, was pushed out by Ryan Reynolds who wanted to double down on the raunchy comedy. Though new director David Leitch easily handles the action, the problem is that the action soon becomes boring when there are no stakes.<br/><br/>Most of the cast are underwhelming which is shocking considering the talent. How can Brolin bring to life Thanos who is CGI and be so boring as a real life human. Even Julian Dennison who stole everyone's hearts in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" cannot save the film. The only one who impresses is Zazie Beetz, who doubles down from ""Atlanta"" to make an impressive addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Essentially there is no plot. We already know the schtick and also not as original or as kinetic as the first one. There is zero suspense and one surprise was some of the worst CGI I have witnessed in a big budget film.<br/><br/>The best joke in the entire film is the second of two credit stingers which is pretty damning"

","I went to see Deadpool because I wanted a big bag of popcorn and a coke. After the first 3 minutes I decided to ride this one out to see if it could possibly get any worse because I held no hope that it would have the slightest chance of getting better.
 That is when the Wizard appeared!! He had that big head like in his own movie and was obviously appearing from behind the screen. He said "" This movie really really sucks and I have taken you for twelve dollars and fifty cents!!!""
""Bwaa haa haa haa!!!!:""
 But still I pressed on! I spent the next few minutes trying to figure how many times the f-bomb had to be used to totally render it inconsequential. This word choice exceeded that threshold on the 172nd time of utterance. The Wizard chimed in and said"" Do not dwell upon nor ask about the Great Unknowables!"" I am certsin the grammer coach came over from 3 billboards in ebbiing.... 
 During these proceedings I kept waiting for something to laugh about or care about ot even cry about but there were no such emotional connections to be made. I wish I could say that there were plot lines that mattered or carried the film but I could not find any at all. Confusion, bewilderment, and boredom carried the day.

"Lewis_Heather787","3","45","110","19 May 2018"," Wow just Wow!
","Green Lantern was better!..............................Im joking its not that bad!<br/><br/>Bit of a precursor if your reading this, thanks, more importantly if you loved the film good for you I wish I did. Even though this review on the surface looks like a rant its not I assure you, even though I really didn't like the film I will try my hardest to give some positives with some constructive criticism.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no expectations going into this film, I personally thought the first film was good but I wasn't a huge fan. Trailers for this did look promising but nothing amazing caught my eye, however nothing prepared me for the full film. I have no idea what I just watched, did I see a different film to everyone else?? I'm going to try give some positives but this film was extremely boring. Im not gonna trash this film to pieces, I personally don't like doing that, I will try to find some positives. <br/><br/>There are only a few positives I can take away really firstly the best performance and most interesting character in the whole film is Domino played by Zazie Beetz. I though her character was an interesting and funny concept that actually worked however I feel her didn't get enough screen time. Another positive is the action and directing is ok from David Leitch, nothing mind blowing but all ok. Erm...........trying to think of something else nice to say...........erm..........Some of the jokes where ok I suppose but a lot of them did not land for me. Unfortunately thats it I think, which is a real bummer. <br/><br/>I'll keep the negatives short as possible, there are a lot of them. Firstly characters, apart from Domino, were all really one dimensional even though the film was trying desperately to give them emotion and backstory. The fact that a ""C-side"" character in Domino is the best character is worrying. The story as a whole is really boring, dull and nothing new, its sort of completely against everything the first film built up as a foundation. The jokes for the most part did not land for me, there was a huge amount of them but thats to be expected. What else erm..............you know it was so dull I think Ive forgotten a lot of the film.........Josh Brolin was getting a pay check. The kid oh wow was he annoying, why would you want to help that kid?? Even though there is pretty much action for a lot of this film, Ive never had an experience like this, I was bored out of my mind watching it.<br/><br/>Overall this film is definitely not what I was expecting and undoes everything the original film did so well. I hate doing this but 30% out of 100 or 3 out of 10 this film is bad and I certainly won't watch it again. If you loved this film great, fantastic and good for you but this was not for me. I know I will be in the minority on this but each to your each, It is sad because I genuinely wanted to like the film. Best thing to do watch the first film and forget this one!"

","I'm not a huge fan of comic character movies even though I watch them all but Deadpool is definitely my favorite Marvel character. I guess it's because he's just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That's something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn't fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I'm normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it's a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference. And for a sequel it's a good one, just waiting for a third one now."

","This movie feels like it tried too hard to be funny. They took so many parts from the first movie which made it too obvious and it ruined it. There is no originality that this movie brought to the table. They ruined this movie completely. There were way too many jokes being thrown that you couldn't even take this movie or the story seriously. I'm not really sure what they were thinking but they should have placed more effort on the screenwriting or directing in general. I must warn you that there are spoilers on this review because I am going to mention several things that they rehashed from the first movie. First one was when how Deadpool complains about why there were never any X-Men in the mansion every time he visits and how the studio completely cheaped out! Yeah that was on the first movie. Second was when
Deadpool narrates the movie and takes the audience back in time to get caught up, yeah that was also on the first movie. 3rd was when he grabs someones balls and tries guess whose balls it was, humor was rehashed from the first movie when he grabbed Colossus' balls and tried to guess whose it was. 4th, Deadpool gets stabbed in the head, has slow motion and a cheesey 80s music playing, also happened in the first movie and both scenes occurred towards the end also when they were fighting the bad guys. 6th when they all walked together to fight the bad guys at the end and the fighting music was playing, that was also on the first movie. hopefully they can fix this on the 3rd movie because this was a complete mess."

Almost all of the new characters introduced I did not care about at all, they were either unlikable or uninteresting. I say almost because Domino was the only new character I actually liked. The plot, what little there was, boring and forgettable. Had it not been constantly interrupted by gags and meta jokes, it might have been somewhat interesting.<br/><br/>All in all, a massive disappointment in my opinion.

","This movie had #predictable and #mediocre written all over it. As per this edition Deadpool apparently is a hero whose only specialties are profanity and double-entendres. Apart from that he's no different than any atheist punk with a good heart. He repeatedly takes jabs at Disney, Marvel's own, DC and others but on its own this movie is made for pansies. The action scenes were pathetic at best with the CGi plainly noticeable and moronic. There's no real story or sequence but Morena Baccarin gets the hard-on going as the prime eye-candy while Zazie Beetz keeps the eyeballs from wandering elsewhere. Josh Brolin will identify with fans of Duke Nukem. Karan Soni as the indian cabbie ends being a real clown than the one he's portraying. Brianna Hildebrand, tight as she is, is unutilized for action or eye-candy. 
The first movie was far more engaging while this seems like a half-baked effort made by someone on hormone therapy. <br/><br/>This movie is not recommended for kids not only because it's anti-God, profane and pro-homo but totally boring and unentertaining from the get go..So the two stars go for Morena and Zazie."

","When considering 'Deadpool 2,' there hasn't been another superhero sequel as good if not better than the original since Christopher Nolan flexed his muscles in the genre with 'The Dark Knight.'<br/><br/>The main body of 'Deadpool 2' blends together the action, plot and soundtrack to such a high degree that it's virtually unparalleled compared to other films. From recent memory, the only other film that comes close-besides the first Deadpool-was last year's 'Baby Driver.'<br/><br/>The film's dialogue is packed with movie references, nods at pop culture, and even jokes at Ryan Reynold's own expense, so much so that a second viewing would absolutely be necessary to try and catch them all.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect. For example, the first half of Cable's storyline feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the film. However, it steadily becomes increasingly well integrated over time.<br/><br/>However, for a franchise that prides itself on violent irreverence, it'd be unthinkable to assume that they were capable of making audiences well up with emotion at the end, yet they had the entire theater choking back tears, a rare achieve that strongly rounds out this film and places among the best in its class."

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","6","20 June 2018"," Grab some chimichanga and give 'Deadpool 2', a watch! It's worth seeing, despite some flaws!
","Like the 2016 original of the same name, 20th Century Pictures' 'Deadpool 2' is also, an R-Rated pop-culture spitting, raunchy fourth-wall breaking, violent comic book movie that is clearly targeted specifically at older audiences. Expect tons of extremely graphic violence, harsh-language, heavy drug-use and sexual nudity to go around. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and directed by Davie Leitch, the film tells the story of Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), trying to cope after the loss of a love one, by protecting a teen mutant, Russell Collins/Firefist (Julian Dennison), from a time-traveling cybernetic soldier, named Cable (Josh Brolin), whom sworn to eradicate him, before the boy can kill his family in the future. Without spoiling the sequel, too much, if this story sounds like familiar. Then, you're right. The three screenwriters: Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds basically borrowing most of 'Deadpool 2' story elements from far more superior rival action films like 1991's 'Terminator 2' & 2012's ""Looper'. However, they didn't use all the familiar clichÃ©s & tropes, correctly; leaving many mistakes, plot-holes & misdirection. Things like the 'Rule of Empathy' moral message felt like confusing regurgitation half-digested rehash. The movie could had work it better, if the writers took the concept more solemn. You know, show more of the emotional negative burden & pain, Wilson has to go through, when killing people, in order to show Russell that life as a contract killer isn't worth it, rather than showing Wade's selfish doing it to get some tail from his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). That might work. Even better, make Russell seem like he had some likeable innocent that could be lose. For the most part, Dennison's character was highly annoying and nasty. Nothing really worth redeemable. Since the movie didn't do that, the moral ground seem a bit muddle. So, it hurts the overall, emotional sentiment redemptive message about family & sacrifice, very much. For that reason, I found the movie's story to be jarring. After all, the movie makes killing look like a lot of fun & rewarding for the most part. There is even, another scene play off for laughs, where a minor supporting character from the first film, craves for a kill, like a sick psychopath. It's a bit disturbing to see this movie champion his wish; seeing how many vehicle mass-murders, happen in recent years. The moral message in the film seem a bit hypocritical. Another thing that hurts this film is not so serious climax. The mid-credit scenes including the ending felt like a cheesy cop out; a cheap happy go-lucky end that ruin the strong savage, inhumane nihilism ending, it should had. And above else, it doesn't make any sense; as why could Cable turn baby face and use his time machine to save Wade in the first place? It goes against everything that Wade wanted to do, in order to meet up with his wife. Wouldn't Cable rather use that time to revisit his family, instead? It's seem a bit off & odd. However, it could had been much worse, if Leitch kept the Hitler baby-killing post-credit scene. That was indeed too squeamish. Anyways, the ending for this film, didn't have the strength that previous 20th Century comic book movies, like 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' & 2017's ""Logan', had. It was highly disappointing. Also, those films, told the fatherhood & destiny concept way better than this film could ever do, as well. Honestly if you cut it away, all the fan service & jokes, the movie's plot is pretty damn simpleton & generic, rather than unique & original. This movie could had been a little more complex than surface deep. Sadly, the writers couldn't go to the next level. No wonder, why Deadpool in universe, lampshade the story elements as lazy. Despite that, the comedy side of the script bulges with rapid-fire one-liners and pop culture references to just about everything kinda works for the most part, regardless if it feels a bit forced. It's mostly hilarious. Jokes like the unfortunate demise of X-Force were funny. However, some of them, like the shot of Deadpool's vestigial regenerating penis is highly cringe-worthy. It's borderline child pornography. Others jokes like might feel dated, as the years goes on, such as the jabs to other present day comic book movies. Regardless, Reynolds as Deadpool dominates every scene, steamrollering everyone around him. Even returning supporting performers are all firmly pushed to the sidelines. Some of them like T.J Miller get little screen time. Thank goodness, because he is not funny. Plus, the sexual misconduct allegations against him, makes me, hate him, ever more. Glad, he wasn't in the film, much. Nevertheless, it's the new characters that really get to shine. Brolin gave a cold grizzled mysterious presence as Cable, which help the film a bit, since the writers didn't give enough space to establish much of his character's background. Zazie Beetz is also good. She was made Domino, into an interesting character with her demeanor, during her limited presence. Even the surprise cameos were fun to see. I enjoyed every last of them, including the Vanisher cameo & the gigantic CGI villain character voiced by Ryan Reynolds. Another thing that work, was the visual effects. It was improved since the last movie. While, the movie is less gory and crass; the quality of action is also a lot better. It was amazing throughout the film, with the train scene being a highlight. It was particularly witty and well-executed. The music by singer, Celion Dion was also great. ""Ashes' was a beautiful song. Overall: I have to say 'Deadpool 2' was a watchable superhero movie. It's a lot better than the first film, big time. So check it out with maximum effect."
"connorjw","8","4","6","14 June 2018"," Opening ruined it for me.
","If you forget the death of (SPOILER) Deadpool's wife, then it'd be a good movie. The original movie was practically based on Deadpool trying to get his girl back. I was so happy to see the ending in the original, and was dying for the sequel. I wanted to see character development, stuff like that. But you just kill her right off the bat. If she was able to stick around the whole movie then I'd give it a 10/10. This pretty much tossed the original in the trash. I didn't like it because of just that, otherwise, it's great!"

You know those mornings what I am talking about. The first half written by the ""adult"" writer and the second half by the ""disney"" writer. I did not care for any of those characters whatsoever except for Vanessa. There was no reason whatsoever to kill her for what exactly reason? Julian Dennison as Russel might of done ok job in Hunt for the Wilderpeople but this time he failed on all fronts and he should seriously question his acting ability.

"garethvk","8","23","57","15 May 2018"," A Littel Rough At The Star But Brings Home Another Winner
","The Mercenary with a mouth is back with the eagerly awaited arrival of ""Deadpool 2"". The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.
His first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.<br/><br/>One would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.
Undaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.
What follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.<br/><br/>My biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.
This time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.<br/><br/>They also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion. What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to ""fix"" various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.
I cannot wait to see what comes next as ""DeadPool 2"" is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.

"kevinthecritic","4","15","35","29 May 2018"," Deadpool 2: Silly Sequel is Surprisingly Dark, Relentlessly Juvenile
","2 out of 5 stars (has some good moments, but is overall bad)<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is the first disappointment of 2018. With a genius marketing campaign, hilarious trailers, and the prospect of seeing our favorite foul-mouthed antihero again, I was ready to dive head-on into this Pool. Sadly, Deadpool 2 is a needlessly darker and sophomoric outing that emphasizes violent action over clever wit, making for a film that will satisfy action junkies, but leave those who enjoyed the cleverness of its predecessor yearning for more.<br/><br/>The mess of a plot involves Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) mourning over the death of his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin), joining the X-Men, and attempting to save an annoying teenager (Julian Dennison) from, brace yourself, a cyborg from the future named Cable (Josh Brolin). Wade will sort of go on a journey to discover his inner hero and learn to move on from the death of his loved one, while still cracking jokes to the camera.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 could have been a savage satire on how sequels always darken, but falls into that trap instead. While still charismatic, Ryan Reynolds isn't as likable here, overdoing Wade's depression in the opening act and attempting to make out-of-place statements on sexism, racism, and other topics Deadpool should not discuss. Brolin acts like he's in a completely different movie, but has good chemistry with Reynolds when onscreen with him. The plentiful action sequences are well-done yet sadly unmemorable, and Dennison alternates between unlikable and annoying rather than menacing. Lastly, the supposed emotional punch of an ending rings hollow. I came here to laugh hysterically, not think about character drama. It's a sad state of affairs that should hopefully be remedied with the upcoming 3rd installment.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 has more than enough action, but the plot and tone meander without much logic, the characters aren't as endearing, and the writing is surprisingly juvenile rather than clever or witty. While it certainly isn't the worst X-Men film, Deadpool 2 is only slightly above X-Men Origins:Wolverine in terms of quality enjoyment. I am sad to report that, of the three films I've seen this week, Book Club was the funniest one, not this.<br/><br/>Rated R for Strong Violence And Language Throughout, Sexual References, And Brief Drug Material. Sorry, DP, but X is not gonna give this one to ya."

It does try to do too much at once and up the jokes and action at the same time, but sadly often it feels like a parody of itself(which is basically a parody of a parody). It is still funny and still cool, but somehow it's a very bittersweet experience.. I would have preferred a more streamlined and focused sequel.. but it is, what it is!"

","I was excited for this movie; at first. I'd seen the first movie, loved it, it was really original and fun to watch. It brought a lot of new elements to the tired superhero genre and it felt really fresh and new. And this is precisely the part where the sequel disappointed me so much. The over-the-top violence, cringy one-liners about poop and piss and grief-induced butt touching just didn't pack the same punch now that we've seen it all before. Gross regrowth of limbs and references to 'baby balls' just couldn't compare to the same brand of off-coloured humour we saw in the first movie and everything that works so effortlessly there needs to be hammered home so heavily here that the jokes just stop being even remotely funny. Moreover, the movie attempts to deal with mature and serious topics in a completely immature and goofy way, so any emotional impact they might've had is lost. Deadpool's silly one-liners have become terribly predictable, the character is consequently incredibly annoying and what was probably intended to be a heart-warming ending just turns into a cringe fest. I honestly couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Aside from Deadpool and Cable (ugh, that's all I have to say about that), the only noteworthy character is Domino, who actually does have some entertaining scenes, even though her bad-assery is a bit forced and heavy-handed. She actually does have a cool superpower, and it's something that fits nicely into the silly Deadpool universe. 
Overall, the movie is a letdown all around."

We know Ryan had waited a lifetime to play this role and he was genuinely fresh and funny in the original. Here, in DP2, his relentless yakking grows tiresome too fast and while there are some nice bits here and there, they are few and far between to make up for a show that just tries too hard with a ho-hum plot. Goes to show that only Disney-Marvel can make magic. I expect Ant Man & Wasp to kick DP2's ass.

"apryla-58795","3","4","7","29 August 2018"," The name of this film was Deadpool right?
","Ok first off let me be clear - I love Ryan Reynolds so much! He is so funny and clever and just seems like a good dude. And I've loved Josh Brolin since Goonies BUT both of them were wasted in this film. Way too much time was spent trying to fit every single character into the story that it ended up being way too much. I was overloaded and I couldn't figure out what was going on. And the jokes?! They just kept coming and coming and coming...after awhile I was like Ok already! We get it. You're trying to be cute and clever and cheeky and use inside jokes and trying to be too cool for everything and OMG! Just shut up and present an actual story! <br/><br/>You know what this felt like? It felt like I was watching 2 hours of a gag reel instead of a movie. And then to top it off this film was trying to make a statement with the girl power thing and the LGBTQ thing AND there's nothing wrong with that but is it relevent to this story? Cause it kind of seemed more like RR was just trying to throw everything against the wall hoping something would stick and those important issues got glossed over and didn't have an opportunity to be fleshed out. I think instead of bringing it to light they just kind of threw all of it in just so they could say they did and not because it was relevent to the storyline. I mean was it supposed to be relevant? I don't even know anymore because I'm not sure what this film was supposed to be about. I mean you'd think with the name of the film being Deadpool that it would focus more on him. Instead it was about Firefist. And by the way I don't care that the actor who played him was morbidly obese but I did care that he couldn't act. He was just plain annoying. I didn't feel anything for him and was disappointed that Cable didn't kill him. I mean he tried to so there is that.<br/><br/>And Josh Brolin wasn't given much to do. With all the build up for his character prior to the release of the film I was so excited to see him on screen and then he was just rolling around on the ground for most of the film. We didn't even get a chance to really be invested in him as the ""bad"" guy before he's turning around wanting to join forces. That just felt rushed. For all the hype they pushed about Cable prior to the release and all the work JB put in physically for this role he deserved a lot more than just rolling around on the ground and standing around trying like hell to look like he didn't have anything better to do. He can act but even he couldn't save this one. <br/><br/>You know what I would have liked to see? A movie with the assembled team members they interviewed about half way in. Now those characters were interesting and fun to watch. I wanted more of them. Brad Pitt was the best thing about this film as the Vanisher. His less than two seconds of being onscreen was better than the rest of the movie. If they had just had a full two hours of Vanisher it would've been better than this mess. After a certain point I was no longer interested nor did I care if Deadpool lived or died and that's a shame because I loved the first Deadpool.<br/><br/>This movie felt like that annoying acquaintance we all know that is always ""on"" and when you finally get away from them you're just exhausted. <br/><br/>There was too much going on with this film and the knowing looks and breaking of the 4th wall and inside jokes and ""nods to"" this that and a million other things. It's not funny if the whole audience isn't in on all the jokes. When you have to read the notes from IMdB just to understand the movie you know you pry should have just skipped it.<br/><br/>I do not recommend. Let Deadpool die. Make room for the X-Force team. Oh and definitely get ""Brown Panther"" his own franchise - that dude is funny!"
"kid-bukid","4","4","7","25 August 2018"," Too much comedy
","I'm not an expert but I understand that Deadpool tends to be on the humorous side. But I find the comedy too drowning. The story was good. There were several good laughs but overall, I felt like the comedy was too, too much. I wanted to have more of the action that is directly related to the story, not just some random stunt made to give way to the humor. It's not balanced anymore. They could just have Deadpool do a stand up comedy instead if they're aiming for the laughs."
"frenchconnection949","3","4","7","9 August 2018"," Sequel with poor story line and waster of new characters
","This movie was a bit too much on the bad jokes (unlike the first one) and a really weak plot.

I guess it's worth watching but only if you can fast forward to many useless scenes."
"deastman_uk","7","4","7","31 May 2018"," I believe X will give it to you, again
","I was expecting less, and pleasantly surprised that it over delivered. In the first outing, when the jokes were stripped away there wasn't a whole lot happening. This time, there is a greater belief backing the picture - probably because this time Deadpool and crew more tightly inhabits the MCU. The new characters are all well fleshed out, Cable is a great foil, Domino a great sidekick and the action is not second rate. In fact the action was very solid. Cable kicks ass in a non derivative way - he is clearly a soldier. The emotional story is played reasonably straight - another sign of confidence. It doesn't hang off the film, but is integral to it. The plot is strangely lacking in the usual jar load of massive holes - even given the time travel. This just all gives the humour even more space to stand. (For me, Weasel gets top billing)<br/><br/>I'm happy to give a film, however lowbrow, an appropriate score if it delivers on it's premise. But there is an issue here: this film burns it's own genre for heat. The X-men are thrown onto the fire right in front of our eyes. With Thor: Ragnorak also played for laughs, there will be a more stratified feel to future Marvel. There is room for funny, or political, or world stretching. But falling between these stools will no longer work."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","4","7","19 May 2018"," A sequel with more heart, violence, jokes and ambition.
","When I saw the first Deadpool, it was the perfect antidote to oversaturation of superhero movies that consumed the media. Since then the amount of superhero projects has ironically increased with Deadpool's second movie, once again, responses to this. This is especially clear when it released only a few weeks after Infinity War. <br/><br/>While John Wick's David Leitch takes over directing duties from Tim Miller, the writing duo of Paul Wernick and Rhett Rheese and Ryan Reynold's full embodiment of his character's off-kilter persona is what keeps the sequel from loosing its mojo. The jokes are twice as funny with visual gags that caused an explosion of laughter while watching it in theatres. The humor rarely ever feels like goes too far thanks to Reynold's execution and delivery of the script and blends very with bigger action set pieces. But probably what surprised me the most was the emotional depth has a lot more weight and complexity. While Deadpool 2 never forgets it's a comedy first, it puts the character on an arc that brings an existential question about himself. Sometimes the movie tries too hard to copy the same emotional beats from the previous X-men movie Logan (whether jokingly or unknowingly), it still makes you feel pity for Wade Wilson despite he is a cold-blooded killer.<br/><br/> 
While Reynolds continues to be perfect as Wade, the rest of the cast, both new and old, standout. Colossus gets more screen time to show more depth to the dysfunctional relationship he has with Wade. Newcomer Zazie Beetz as Domino becomes a scene-stealer even though she doesn't show up till the latter half of the film. Beetz's is hilarious especially with seeing how her character's power of luckiness works on a cinematic level. While still not as captivating as his previous Marvel character Thanos from Infinity War, Brolin still makes Cable distinct enough with how he talks and behaves in a grizzled and damaged way. While I wished there was more, his good-cop-bad-cop dialogue with a not-so-serious Deadpool was both fun and interesting. It was also great to see Julian Denison get to expand his acting chops even though his character Russell was a bit of heightened version of Rick Baker from Hunt for the Wilderpeople. It did feel awkward that TJ Miller's role wasn't shortened after the amount of controversial that has happened within the actor's personal life. It was a shame that Morena Baccarin's role as Vanessa is reduced for the sake of the story which felt a bit hypocritical at times.<br/><br/>Where David Leitch does improve from the first film is the action. Leitch's experiences in fight choreograph makes the practical fights in Deadpool 2 look more real and vicious especially with Wade's first encounter with Cable. There we get to see how far Wade's healing factor can go leading to some disturbing body horror. While Leitch is better with handling practical action, the use of cgi shows to be more of Miller's talent. Since Deadpool 2 does not have Tim Miller's visual eye nor his vfx company Blurr Studios that made the cgi for the first movie, the visual effects don't feel as seamless. It is especially the case when an iconic comic book character in cgi shows up in the third act and feels more cartoonish then real.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is funnier and more emotional but what keeps it from being better then the first is that you can feel the plot dragging by the last quarter of the movie. While the first Deadpool felt quick and short (compared to the runtime of most superhero movies), the extra 10 minutes this sequel has causes the runtime to feel more noticeable.<br/><br/>While Deadpool 2 does not have same surprise factor nor quickness, I can still say it is an accomplishment since most sequels to superhero movies and comedies fail by being too repetitive or not being ambitious enough. Deadpool 2 swings bigger then the first instalment and for the most part succeeds where others have failed. Also stay for the post-credit scenes. They are unforgettable."

","How is this comparable to Deadpool 1??? Bottom line, the film lacks a clear, meaningful plot or subplot. There is little to no internal character tension, no dilemmas, no character irony/complexity, all of which is compatible with, and necessary for, the execution of good humor. There were little blips of a pulse but, ultimately, despite several good jokes - which could just as well have been heard on a 30-minute variety show, there was no compelling story to which the jokes were attached. The film, except for the early scenes, when Deadpool struggled with the dead of his wife, failed to make you care about its characters - unlike Deapool 1."

","It is funny that I decided to watch this film, because I was sorely disappointed by Deadpool 2 in the first place. However, I loved the gimmick in how they would update the movie for a PG-13 rating. Despite the concept that could have gone so much deeper than it did, this ""update"" did not work for me at still. Every new scene with Fred Savage was completely hilarious, and even with me not ever seeing The Princess Bride, I was still completely enthralled. I loved how these new scenes were sprinkled throughout the entire film, instead of giving them to us all at once.<br/><br/>Regardless of how much those new scenes were great, the rest of the film, especially in the first half, are mostly garbage. The film really starts to get good when the auditions for the new superheroes happen, but it continues to get ruined by bad jokes and a horrendously over-the-top child villain. Compared to my first watch of Deadpool 2, I was genuinely bored in some parts, and had to resort to my phone so I didn't fall asleep.<br/><br/>I still love the original Deadpool and him as a character, but he did not work for a lot of the second film. Still, he works in these new scenes very well. The parachute scene will be the funniest scene of 2018. And the post-credit scenes were forever be ingrained in my memory.<br/><br/>I just wish the rest of the film was on this level.<br/><br/>Also, I might mention that my rating went down from my previous rating because with this being PG-13, all it did was remove certain scenes (intro scene) and bleep out the cuss words.

In this chapter Wade Wilson (AKA Deadpool) fights to defend a young gifted mutant, named Russell, from a time traveling mutant called Cable. He forms a new superhero mutant team, called X-Force, to help him. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds (reprising the title role), Josh Brolin, Julian Dennison,Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapicic, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni, Morena Baccarin and Eddie Marsan. It was directed by David Leitch (who also helmed 'ATOMIC BLONDE' and co-directed 'JOHN WICK') and it was written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick (the duo who also co-wrote the original film, and 'ZOMBIELAND') and Ryan Reynolds (in his screenwriting debut). I loved the original movie and I found this sequel to be almost as good (but not quite). <br/><br/>Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has been killing criminals for two years now (since the end of the first film), under the name Deadpool. He's planning to have a child with his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin), when tragedy strikes. Wade then befriends a young troubled mutant named Russell (Dennison), who he later learns has been targeted for execution by a powerful time traveling mutant, from the future, named Cable (Brolin). Wade forms a team of new superhero mutants, he calls X-Force, to help him protect the kid and stop Cable. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with nonstop gags and slapstick humor (just like the original), as well as really graphically violent action scenes (also just like the original). For me this film went a little too far in some of it's slapstick humor, whereas I thought the original movie had the perfect balance of action and comedy. This one also has a lot of sci-fi craziness on top of everything else. I still, of course, really enjoyed it, but I definitely can't say it matched the original. Reynolds is once again amazing, in the role he was born to play, and the supporting cast is more than decent. The script is clever and brilliant, and the directing is good enough. I think if they could have kept the original director though, this film could have been even better. As it is, it's still one of the best films of this year, and any year as far as superhero movies go. Too bad we won't ever get a true 'DEADPOOL 3', now that Disney owns the rights (and will never do a hardcore R-rated movie), but we can always dream."

","So me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this today and like the previous Deadpool, we both highly enjoyed this one as well! There's a tragedy at the beginning but things pick considerably after that. As before, the leading character breaks the fourth wall in his narration and onscreen and other stuff referring to other superhero movies make this quite funny most of the time. Also, we once again see some of the X-Men characters from the previous one appearing to help Deadpool whether he wants it or not as well as some new ones who also are welcome additions. So that's a high recommendation of Deadpool 2 from both of us!"

"odaleg","8","6","13","29 May 2018"," Like the first, but better.
","Film that follows the path of its predecessor in everything but adding slight nuances that differentiates and improves it.
One of the main improvements is in the guide, humor and tone outputs of the protagonists are more natural in the dialogues.
In the original it was noted that certain gags were forced or simply produced because the script so dictated, however, in the second part this is seen as something that flows in the conversations that are established.
The inclusion of secondary is done in a masterly way and they all look and feel fresh in a universe that does not lack this type of characters.
The rest of the elements that compose the tape are very continuist with the first and for that reason they do not fail in any aspect.
The most negative note can be given in the attempt to add a more serious nuance in certain moments of the movies and that some action scenes are extremely long and slow the narrative rhythm."

","Deadpool 2 was great. Fives times better than the first. Jokes were a plenty and in most cases, the amount would be overkill, but this is a DEADPOOL movie. Not some sappy action flick like Captain America. It has been a long time since I've laughed so hard. Probably since Deadpool 1. People complain there's no plot but they don't understand the character. He does whatever whenever. Doesn't have to make sense. The movie could be about him going after the doctor who slapped him on the butt when he was born. The plot here was simple. Someone close is killed off and he feels has nothing left living for. He meets *insert typical misunderstood delinquent here* who is in trouble for something he may do in the future by some guy from that timeline. He rescues the kid and in turn, rescues both himself and the humanity of the time traveler. Now insert super funny jokes every 10 seconds and you have a winner. I'm so excited for Deadpool 3. Keep them coming and I'll keep watching."
"maytheforcebewithyoumarko","8","6","13","27 May 2018"," I get the hate. This movie is just tooooo much...
","But that is the point!
We got used to serious films with deep messages and serious story, even while watching comic book movies so people got disappointed with Deadpool 2 which is actually closest to its comic book origins than any superhero movie ever.
With so much of goofy action scenes and jokes this movie is basically parody in the vein of ""The Hot Shots! Part Deux"" but it also has lot of serious stuff. There is no parody that makes fun of everything and also has the space for the meaningful story like this one.
I've expected something like Deadpool 1 but I've got Deadpool 1 on steroids :D<br/><br/>It has funny references and jokes for any kind of viewer.
There were some everyday jokes that casual viewers found hilarious and few seconds later there is some reference and parody of pop culture for geeks like me.
Even if you don't get half of the jokes, the other half will laugh your ass off. I think movie was written in that kind of way. To literally please everyone and surprise someone who will get all of the jokes.
Some will say it's just the lazy writing :P but that kind of writing is actually rare.<br/><br/>Some hate the movie because they think it's too much and I understand that opinion because it is too much haha, personally I don't like that in other movies but its really goofy made in this one and we needed that. When was the last time you laughed so hard in the cinema like you did watching Deadpool 2? It's really rare these days. We need more of this :D"
"peam-17547","8","6","13","27 May 2018"," Funny but not annoying.
","Deadpool 2 is exactly what you've expected it to be from watching the first film. The jokes are great, they're original, funny but most importantly, not annoying. Most films with this much jokes are too annoying because they are trying too hard to fit a joke into every scene.
The music is also great as expected, most of them being classic songs that everyone should know like: ""Take On Me"" and others.
Story-wise however, the story is definitely lacking and doesn't make sense at some points, but what did you expect? I went to the cinema knowing that I just want the attitude and sarcasm of Wade Wilson and the music."
"WubsTheFadger","9","6","13","27 May 2018"," Deadpool 2
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>After the massive success of Deadpool, we were bound to have a sequel. The sequel is just as good if not better than the first. Deadpool two has a more original and less cliched story. It also introduces some amazing new characters. As always, the humor is spot on and the violence is over the top. <br/><br/>The acting is very good. Josh Brolin plays Cable magnificently. I was skeptical going into the film but he blew me away. He is tough and totally awesome. Ryan Reynolds once again is a perfect Deadpool. Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, Karan Soni, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapicic all perform very well. Zazie Beetz was cast as Domino and at first, I was not happy. But she performed very well as Domino. All the X-Force members perform very well and are hilarious. I did not like Julian Dennison's character and he is a bad actor. He has a weird voice and his body is shaped like a pear. He looks like a Teletubby.<br/><br/>The pacing is fast and the runtime is good.<br/><br/>The CGI for Juggernaut looked quite bad compared to Colossus <br/><br/>Pros: Original and hilarious story, great jokes and gags, amazing characters, great new characters, Josh Brolin as an amazing Cable, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, good acting, fast pacing, and a good runtime<br/><br/>Cons: Julian Dennison looks weird, he is not a good actor, and the CGI for Juggernaut looked cheap<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.8"

"misfitone38","5","3","5","4 March 2019"," Moved A Little More Into The Shallow End
","There are some good laughs scattered around Deadpool 2 but all of the meta and self-referencing humor wore out by the end of the credits in the first movie.<br/><br/>Occasionally they try to throw in a one liner aimed at social and political targets. For example, there's a George W. Bush ""Mission Accomplished"" joke that's about fifteen years too late...and it wouldn't have been funny even if it had been on time. If you get all of your political insight from Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert then I guess this material is for you.<br/><br/>There's also groan worthy attempts at appealing to the #metoo movement, LGBTQ groups, and other Social Justice millennial groups. I wish writers would realize that these people are not capable of laughter or joy and its not worth the effort to try and entertain them.<br/><br/>That aside, just like the first one, Deadpool 2 is at its best with slapstick comedy and over the top violence. Unfortunately, that's hard to maintain for 2 hours. I guess that's why the Three Stooges made short films.<br/><br/>There's some good moments of parody in there as well. I especially liked the credits that mimicked the Roger Moore era of James Bond title sequences. Moments like that make Deadpool 2 momentarily worth watching. Now if they could just get Ryan Reynolds to quit ad-libbing to the camera how he's in a Marvel movie, then there would be more time for better jokes."

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","3","5","6 February 2019"," Bad-ass crazy kick-ass action sequel I ever saw
","Deadpool 2 the sequel to the smash hit ""Deadpool (2016)"" is an crazy insane bad-ass action I have ever saw. Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz did make this movie work for me and they kick-ass in this movie. The action in this movie is so insanely crazy. Those 3 guys battling each other while Deadpool try's to protect a kid a mutant who will become a next monster he is a Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison). The movie is fantastic, funny it has action, humor and sci-fi. It is an pair and equally damn good film as the original the first film is: I love this film to death it is equally too the original film.<br/><br/>I told you it is better than Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Black Panther, Thor Ragnarok and Guardian of the Galaxy 1 and 2 those movies suck. Deadpool 2 is a good action movie I have enjoy it and I love it. This time directed by David Leitch and not Tm Miller which David Leitch directed perfectly this masterpiece. Josh Brolin is a bad-ass as Cable a cybernetic soldier from the future who has one mission to kill the men who killed his family now he goes in too past to kill a young boy Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison). Josh Brolin is awesome as Cable I liked him much more in this movie than in Avengers: Infinity War as Thanos who sucked ass. In this movie he was likeable and great. His customize rifle is one powerful weapon, he has such a great weapons. Zazie Beetz is Domino a mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate luck. I love her performance she is such a bad-ass team mate to Deadpool's X-Force. She saved Deadpool and she helped him out. Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool is a bad-ass mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body. His performance as Deadpool is bad-ass in this movie I enjoy his performance so much. He even shot him self on the end of the credits for Green Lantern.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson, aka ""Deadpool"", who forms a special team X-Force to stop an assassin Cable who has arrived from the future to eliminate a young boy with supernatural abilities.<br/><br/>The film has a good, story, good written, good decent acting from everyone, great special effects. Has tons of action. Fights between Deadpool and Cable is bad-ass great chorography. Deadpool's team X-Force saves all the wise and tortured children in the orphanage and bring them to X-Men mansion. That is why I am saying the film is decent. Yes it has jokes but that doesn't make this movie bad it makes it good. Deadpool lost his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), but he decide to never gave up on that kid (Julian Dennison) before he kills the headmaster I love that in that movie. He saved that kid and make sure he didn't become an assassin going on a dark path, I thought that was decent in the film and not selfish! :P<br/><br/>I love the dialogue's in which Deadpool mentions Bucky Barnes The Winter Soldier, Black Widow and of course he mentions the lines for ""the Hulk"" in which Black Widow calm down ""the Hulk."" in (Avengers: Age of Ultron.) He mentions the Avengers and I respect Ryan Reynolds for that. Juggernaut was also voiced by Ryan Reynolds him self. Juggernaut was a good villain character portrayed in the movie I have seen. Thunderstruck from AC/DC is also in this movie a bad-ass soundtrack that I love it so much.<br/><br/>My favorite action sequence will be the fight with Domino and Cableon a Convoy in which Domino fire with a gun at him and fights him off. The score for me is 9 it is an equal film with the original first Deadpool film. It is decent, bad-ass action MARVEL film and it is rated R like the first film. If you don't understand the film or you don't like it for the action and jokes that's fine. I have completely enjoyed Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz and Ryan Reynolds in the film. P."

Technically done better than first one which I appreciate but almost all the characters were annoying but the cringiest part of this film is when it's tried to be ""dramatic""! <br/><br/>The movie breaks the fourth wall every five minutes to tell us a cheap joke about the last film box office success or how Logan died and few moments later it tried to act like a film with real consequences and drama and it's just pure cringe because the film does it unironically with sad music and so on.""Oh somebody died!

","The original had its faults, but at least it was made with an understanding of basic storytelling. Halfway through Deadpool 2, I thought, 'What exactly is the plot, here?'. Not even the eponymous hero knows, just some cryptic message from his deceased love, telling him 'Find your heart'. There is no antagonist either, until halfway when it's meant to be Josh Brolin's character that's the big bad, except he's not, then it's the troubled kid, except he's not, then it's Juggernaut. <br/><br/>I'd forgive the film its faults if it were at least fun, but we get a preachy, politically correct Deadpool who talks about gender equality, accuses people of cultural appropriation and racism, and describes old white men as rapists. I thought Deadpool was supposed to go against the grain? Not beat people over the head with the same rubbish that bores and patronises people every day in more mainstream fare. And hey, I know the movie makers made fun of it, but that doesn't excuse them from killing off his wife. They want to talk about gender inequality, yet get rid of her because they can't be bothered to write her into the plot, as it's much too much of an effort to have that complication in a superhero's life."

Juggernut was wasted as was shatterstar and the rest were lack luster and easy to forget... sadly yes even our trailer fodder Peter (except for end credits) The use of the Essex house and no Mr. Sinister was a shame. The rest of the film was trying to capitolize on the black pather crowd but this was a swing and a miss. It is not terrible, just save your $$ and wait til it is streamable.

"sujanfaster","10","7","17","18 May 2018"," A masterclass of destructive humour
","Savage. That's the least I can come up with to describe Deadpool 2 in one word. This will probably be the coolest movie released this year or for some time now. Sometimes crass, sometimes extremely clever and sometimes emotional, this movie does everything. The self destructive humour this time is up a notch compared to the last one. The comic book, music and other Hollywood references make this movie a treat for a serious movie fan. The humour hits the nail on the head and mocks Hollywood and meny sensitive issues. The promos themselves that lead to this have been brilliantly executed and the movie does one better. <br/><br/>This time the movie is not just about Deadpool himself but about the other mutant characters as well. The movie is probably building up to a new generation of XMen. Deadpool fights to save a mutant teenager from Cable who has come from the future. Things get complicated than they are supposed to be and Deadpool fights a moral battle within himself to make the right decisions. The action is indeed brutal thanks to R rating and yet is fun to watch. Old school rock and hip hop music adds to the funky flavour of the movie. <br/><br/>What makes this movie special is the way the characters are written. Every character is so unique and almost everyone makes an impact just because how weird the characters are (watch out for a super special guest appearance). Special mention to the dialogue writers of the movie for the insanely clever lines. Ryan Reynolds is just brilliant and it feels like he should be only be playing as Deadpool in whatever the movie he is in. The role of cable suits perfectly for Josh Brolin and with Thanos and this it seems like this is a second coming of his own. All the other support characters do a very good job and special mention to Karan Soni's Dopinder whose role is much more funnier than the first part.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 does everything what you expects it to do and still manages to surprise you. This movie will probably give birth to a new genre in Hollywood something in the lines of parody-satire-action. God bless the coolest crew who made this movie."

"mynban","8","7","17","16 May 2018"," Good Balance between Trailer vs Movie
","I want to start by saying having watched all trailers for DP2 as they came out over the past few months, I was starting to worry a little bit of trailers spoiling the movie but was happy with final trailer still not revealing much. To my joy it turned out they managed to strike a very good balance in terms of trailer fulfilling their teaser function without making me feel ""yea we can skip this part of the movie, trailers got it covered"".<br/><br/>It is not a masterpiece of a movie, but going to Deadpool with that expectation is no different than riding merry-go-round for adrenaline. Deadpool 2 successfully delivers its promise of being an action packed mockery of superhero genre. <br/><br/>The way it can go the lengths regular superhero movies can not dare go allowed the movie to accomplish some unique story twists and action scenes. <br/><br/>Without spoiling anything there is a particular scene where Deadpool and Cable handshake, and that scene alone is worth the movie ticket.<br/><br/>Plus kudos to Reynolds for the after credits scene."
"paulijcalderon","8","10","27","15 May 2018"," Delivers the same laughs as the first + some fun action set-pieces
","Well, I laughed and I certainly did not cry. Which probably wasn't the point. The ""John Wick"" co-director David Leitch takes command of the direction after Tim Miller left. You can tell the action sequences have been geared into a better level with more interesting scenarios and set-pieces. What I love about the humor is how self-aware it is. Deadpool pokes fun and satirizes the X-Men films and the genre as a whole. At times it can go a little too far with them overplaying some jokes or making others really obvious. It's OK to play hard to get, you can hold back at some moments. But I get it, the character is foul-mouthed, unfiltered and loves to let the audience know he's in control of this movie. I know I enjoyed the full speed ahead farce that it was. But I'm gonna have to process weather I like it more than the first one. Some elements for sure, but the bigger picture? Hmm.. Perhaps the freshness was gone, but that doesn't mean it's bad.<br/><br/>New characters were a well welcomed addition. And by that I mean welcomed with big open arms. Domino had lots of sympathy to bring but she was also a great fast thinking fighter. Josh Brolin is perfect for Cable. I liked the brutal intensity that transmitted across the screen whenever he busted through the walls. He made a great serious counterbalance to Ryan Reynolds' jokey, spandex, anti-hero man. It sort of felt like another ""Terminator""-like science-fiction movie when it was just a scene featuring Cable. Which reminds me that there are plenty of serious parts as well. By that I mean actual dramatic parts where there are no jokes. Which was a little problematic for me at first because it had been so full of jokes/meta-humor for the entirety of the run-time up until that point. So I wasn't sure how seriously I was to take a certain scene. Since I was sure it was gonna lead up to a joke that would ease out that tension. But, nope! The jokes didn't return until after they were done with the serious bit. A drastic tonal change from ""funny/poking fun at movies times"" to ""dead serious, no joke, drama where the hero cries"". So, there you go. My nitpick.<br/><br/>The mid-credit scene is fantastic though, be sure to stick around for that. It's worth it and it only makes me believe that Reynolds was born to play the role even more than before. So that really elevated the entire movie for me. Lots of in-jokes, so I don't know if everyone's gonna get it. It's pretty much a crowd-pleasing movie that doesn't hold back with the references. But only really to those who have seen the other X-Men or Marvel movies. That's a reason why it might not be so funny to everyone. And to be honest I did laugh at plenty of things. Especially at what the X-Force storyline leads up to. Did not expect that... At all! Oh, and also, You know not to bring the kids. It's R-rated for a reason. If the first one didn't do it for you in the joke department and you prefer the more serious work in the comic book film catalogue; Then this will not be so funny to you. Even though I prefer a more emotional and motivational superhero tale, I do appreciate the weird variety of character traits that Deadpool brings to an already crowded genre."

","I don't remember laughing so hard at a movie. I enjoyed the first Deadpool, sure, but I didn't love it. Deadpool 2 is everything I wanted in the first film and more. The narrative never completely ventures into serious territory, but the more compelling parts were pretty moving, despite the fact that there were gags around every corner. They never miss a beat; basically denying you of any room to breathe when you're laughing. The jokes are hysterical, the directions the movie go in are off the wall, the action sequences are incredible as well! It's not here to impress you, but somehow you're still impressed.

"somlaign1","10","4","8","24 May 2018"," Sequel that didn't copy the original.
","Deadpool 2 is fantastically done in that it retained the style from Deadpool 1 but yet not redundant. No one wants to see the exact same thing they've already watched. It's a different story line and doesn't rely on the first Deadpool to make it meaningful. Yes it has a more serious tone overall but still packs a lot of humor that is more mature and less silly than the first. The action scenes were great, and I don't see the CGI issue that some had mentioned. I don't agree with someone rating the CGI being in the same league as Justice League. Justice League was just awful and lazy, no good fight action just straight CGI. Deadpool 2 is not that. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I don't like Deadpool 1 over 2 or vice versa, I think they are both great in their own way. And I appreciate that they have independent storylines and have different takes on the adventure that is Deadpool."
"dyliebar5","10","4","8","24 May 2018"," The first one may have felt more fresh and special, but this tops the original overall!
","Deadpool 2 is the hugely anticipated sequel to the amazing first movie from 2016, and once again stars Ryan Reynolds as the titular character. In this film, Deadpool isn't seeking revenge, this time he must protect a kid from a mutant from the future named Cable, who was sent from the future to kill him. I know what you're saying, that is the plot of Terminator 2! Well, this movie is aware of it so you can let that go! So most of you probably know that I ADORED the first movie, it was my favorite movie of 2016, it was hilarious, violent, profane, raunchy, and it was a breath of fresh air! I was highly anticipating this movie, and this movie did not disappoint at all! This movie is even more violent, even more profane, and even more hilarious than the first one, they did tone down the raunchiness quite a bit though. This movie has rapid fire humor, there were very few moments where I wasn't laughing! This movie has sex jokes, fourth wall breaking jokes (it's Deadpool, of course there is!), and jokes about the DC Universe and the MCU! This movie has a lot of everything to offer. Ryan Reynolds once again NAILED it as Deadpool, Josh Brolin as Cable was perfect! It did take a while to get to Cable but when he does show up, he adds so much to the movie and it was fantastic! Let's talk about the action! The action in this movie is beyond amazing, not only is it filmed to perfection and complete with fantastic stunts and terrific special effects, the violence is gory as hell! This movie is almost as bloody and gratuitous as Logan was, and it was so satisfying! There is a lot of action in this movie, so if you thought there wasn't quite enough action in the first one, don't you worry, Deadpool 2 fixes that for you! The special effects, while not Avengers: Infinity War quality, are very good! The soundtrack is great too! There is one song in the final act that is used for a joke and it works so god damn well! It was hilarious and I am happy they used it for this specific scene! Also, STAY FOR THE POST CREDITS SCENE!!! It is quite possibly the greatest post credit scene I have seen in any superhero movie yet! If I do have any issue with the movie whatsoever, it is that it doesn't feel as fresh or special as the first one felt. It really doesn't have any of the emotional depth the first movie had either, but for what this movie was going for, it really didn't require that, so I was able to let that slide. So in the end, Deadpool 2 is a fantastic sequel! It was action packed, hilarious and endlessly fun! I can't wait for Deadpool 3!<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is........AWESOMETACULAR"
"JasonR77","10","4","8","21 May 2018"," Perfect Follow-Up
","I never thought there would ever be one Deadpool movie, let alone two. The first was a piece of utter brilliance made on a shoestring budget (comparatively) that blew up a lot of convention with its success.<br/><br/>This gave way to the sequel we have before us. The ability was now given to do Deadpool without unnecessary budget constraints. Would the change of directors matter? Short answer, no. Long answer noooooooooooooooooooo. David Leitch steps in and earns his opening sequence credit mention (you'll see), and throws us a Deadpool that is another epic romp of hilarity and action.<br/><br/>As before, the soundtrack is a great co-star to the movie, giving lift to the moments where Ryan Reynolds' DP is at his funniest or his deepest. And DP does have to find some depth within himself as he moves through the film in order to carry it forward.<br/><br/>
Some observations:<br/><br/>Every scene with Blind Al is brilliant. The interactions between her and Deadpool are hilarious, and there's a scene further on with the two of them that may leave you in need of a paper bag from all the hyperventilating you'll be doing on account of laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin gets Cable down perfectly, and this guy does not get nearly enough credit for his skill as an actor. Not everyone could make Thanos likable and Cable awesome within the same month, but he has done it.<br/><br/>Zazie Beetz is your show-stealer. She makes a great Domino, and her rapport with Reynolds is obvious.<br/><br/>Peter! X-Force!<br/><br/>
There's a lot of great stuff happening here, and this is the perfect Deadpool sequel. I laughed the entire time, and I can't wait to watch it again so I can really start quoting it."

X-Force does not go the way you think it will, but I'll say one thing... What they do with X-Force is freaking hilarious!

","I had to give a ten here for two reasons. One -this movie is a great second telling of the Deadpool story: amazing performance by Ryan Reynolds who has obviously stamped his humour throughout. The plot is almost irrelevant here as the movie has its own ""Deadpool genre"" thing that starts in the first movie and just continues here. Crazy funnny violent and amazingly entertaining: Two- how do any of you 1-2 star reviewers out there rate this so low? Just for the production value alone you should be ashamed to trash what has obviously been a labour of love for the writers producers cast and crew. So the ten should really be a 8 but for the small minded haters"

","Deadpool 2 follows deadpool's mission to protect a mutant boy Russell a.k.a Firefist (Julian Dennison) from the time travelling mercenary Cable (Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>This movie does everything the original did but takes it up a notch. There's more comedy, more action and more characters than before. Ryan Reynolds is once again excellent as the merc with a mouth. Deadpool is not just about quips and meta jokes all the time but there are even some emotional moments that I really liked.<br/><br/>I loved Cable in this film and Josh Brolin was a great choice for the role. Also just weeks ago Brolin amazed us with his performance as Thanos which is made fun of as we saw in the trailers. One big thing about Deadpool 2 was The X-Force. The trailers almost exclusively promoted the X-Force although after watching the movie I'm in a bit of a pickle. Without spoiling anything I think the direction that they took the X-Force was outrageous and hilarious but also a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>Apart from Deadpool and Cable, other notable characters were Domino (Zazie Beetz), Firefist, Dopinder and this one character I can't spoil. Also Colossus gets a lot to do and his interactions with deadpool are some of the highlights of the film. I quite like Colossus but the previous X-Men films always kept him in the background which made me very happy when I saw the original deadpool and he is just as fantastic in deadpool 2. <br/><br/>That leaves us with the rest of the cast including characters like negasonic teenage warhead (Brianna Hilderbrand), Blind Al(Leslie Uggams), Weasel etc. were entertaining but don't really get much to do. <br/><br/>Veteran stuntman David Leitch who directed this films has previously worked on John Wick and Atomic Blonde, both films with some exceptional fight sequences. So it was obvious that Deadpool was gonna have great fight scenes and it does deliver but doesn't surpass Leitch's previous work. The music is pretty good and it really works well with the tone of the movie.
 
Lastly my one problem with the movie which doesn't really bother me that much but still worth mentioning is this one decision that cable makes at the end that I'm not going to spoil but those who have seen the film will probably know what I'm referring to. <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 although at times may feel more of the same and has a few other minor problems is an extremely entertaining and hilarious film filled with cameos, easter eggs, references and a lot of graphic violence. I had a blast watching Deadpool 2 and I do like it better than the first one."

Deadpool has to protect a young mutant named Russell(Julian Dennison), from Cable(Josh Brolin) who is a mutant from the future.

Director David Leitch & writers Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick & Ryan Reynolds give us a film that is filled with hysterical one-liners, hilarious gags & the kind of raw, realistic action that made all of us fall in love with the first movie. Deadpool's appeal & what makes his character so unique, is his fourth wall breaking antics & constant references to other superhero franchises. The action set pieces are amazing. The visual effects are flawless. The extremely talented cast is the highlight of the film. Ryan Reynolds is spectacular as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Reynolds' effortless portrayal of the foul mouthed anti-hero, makes it seem like he was born to play the 'Merc With a Mouth'. Josh Brolin is outstanding as Cable. Brolin has given us back-to-back memorable performances of two iconic Marvel Comics' characters, this one & Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Morena Baccarin is awesome as Vanessa. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Domino. Brianna Hildebrand is great as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. T.J. Miller is superb as Weasel. Julian Dennison is brilliant as Russell. Karan Soni is excellent as Dopinder. Stefan Kapicic is impressive as Colossus. Leslie Uggams is unforgettable as Blind Al. Bill Skarsgard, Terry Crews, Rob Delaney, Lewis Tan, Jack Kesy, Eddie Marsan & Shioli Kutsuna are good as Zeitgeist, Bedlam, Peter, Shatterstar, Black Tom Cassidy, Headmaster & Yukio, respectively.

","It's finally here! The film all those creepy people at conventions who mistake cosplay for invasion of personal space will be quoting for years on end!<br/><br/>To preface real quickly: I truly liked the first Deadpool film. While I never believed it was as big of a 'game-changer' as most people branded it, other than it being the first R-rated superhero smash hit, I thought it was an entertaining and simple film that deserved most of the adoration it got from its fans.<br/><br/>This, though?...Wow, let's talk about this...<br/><br/>Deadpool 2, as most sequels do, takes its predecessor and cranks everything to 11. The jokes are flying at the audience faster, the stakes are heightened, the action is heightened, likely triple the amount of characters, a plot that is somehow jumbled and bloated in comparison to the original's simple one...<br/><br/>...And in the end, what we get is actually an absolutely great time at the cinemas.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this film is flawed. Its CG work is still absolutely horrid and little was improved from the first film, its characters lack much depth beyond a kiddie pool, and the plot somehow manages to feel overstuffed compared to the first's minimal plot, as it feels as if it has two Second Acts and two Third Acts.<br/><br/>But...gosh-darnit...this film is simply the most consistently hilarious comedy that has been released thus far this year.<br/><br/>From the first minute of this film, as one would expect from a Deadpool sequel, the jokes are flying fast and furious toward you. In terms of how many of them land...to give you a fair ratio, if one joke falls flat, about nine of them land.<br/><br/>This film is HILARIOUS, and while it never has anything too in-depth to commentate on regarding the superhero genre of film, which is coming dangerously close to the state of 'over-saturation', this deviation of the genre and take-nothing-serious approach is more fun than any DCEU film has managed to be, even when they try to be.<br/><br/>Dialogue gags, sight gags, editing gags, even an incredible credits sequence that comes straight out of nowhere that managed to both leave me in hysterics and somehow top the first film's excellent opening sequence, this film brings an entire arsenal of jokes that work nine-out-of-ten times. A ratio like that, I think any mainstream comedy would kill for.<br/><br/>The cinematography here is also surprisingly well-done in terms of action and choreography, which comes as no surprise to me considering the film was directed by one half of the creative team behind 'John Wick' (David Leitch), with cinematography by the man who did the INCREDIBLE camera work for the same film (Jonathan Sela). Whereas the first film looked muddy and ugly in its low-budget glory, this film trades that for action scenes and sequences that really do look FANTASTIC at times. When the scenes are allowed to be practical, and the ugly CG is traded-in for actual actors, these action sequences look great.<br/><br/>So yes, this film is not perfect. It certainly has flaws in plot flow, its FX department, and still doesn't truly commentate on the superhero genre in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>But with THAT said; this film is consistently hilarious, features great action, has an unending sense of fun that never ceases...and yes, has the best post-credits sequence ever.<br/><br/>I've thought hard about it, but...I think this is an instance where the sequel surpassed the original. Go nuts, internet!"

"khanh-18576","10","4","8","17 May 2018"," Here to balance reviews
","Deadpool 2 is tedious and a failure to brake the forth-wall.Late in the hodgepodge that is Deadpool 2, the superhero joke-machine confronts the muscular, time-traveling villain, Cable, who's trying to murder an adolescent mutant. Deadpool yells, ""Hands off that kid, John Connor!"" and part of the audience laughs and part of it stares dumbly, trying to process the movie's 674th pop-culture reference. But what's the joke, exactly? John Connor wasn't the time-traveling killer. He was the kid who the time-traveling Terminator was trying to kill - except (I think) in the last sequel, which no one even remembers, when he was trying to kill ... his own mother??? Himself??? It's not worth the time it takes to process. The basic joke, repeated ad infinitum, is that that Deadpool has seen the Terminator films, along with the Marvel and DC and Star Wars movies. He's like an especially obnoxious fanboy except you could punch a fanboy and he'd shut up. Deadpool takes a licking and keeps on sticking. We've reached superhero saturation point, and Deadpool 2 is less a satire of that condition than a symptom of it. It has zero suspense - it's too hip, too meta, for suspense. The action is brutally edited and mostly undistinguished - a surprise, given that the stuntman turned director, David Leitch, devised amazing, close-in, faux-single-shot fights in his last film, Atomic Blonde. But he's out of his element with such pro forma CGI, which not even Deadpool's CGI jokes can redeem. Although this is primarily a comedy (with gore), Leitch doesn't hang back and let the actors develop a rhythm, the way Taika Waititi did in the Hope-and-Crosby-like Thor: Ragnarok. He just whomps away. But dull-witted direction wouldn't matter if the script (credited to Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds) were more consistent. In my (favorable) review of the first Deadpool, I estimated that 50 percent of jokes hit home, another 30 whizzed by inoffensively, and only 20 percent were real stinkers. In Deadpool 2, the percentages are reversed. A small number of the gags land, among them a riotously tasteless parachute assault by an ad hoc team of second-tier superheroes. And I can never get enough digs - however limp - at the idea that all superhero mothers are named Martha. But there are so many wincers for so ramshackle a plot. The thrust of Deadpool 2 is that Deadpool, having suffered a personal tragedy, kinda sorta wants to be an X-Man but keeps screwing up on account of how selfish he is - until he meets an extremely unappealing mutant kid, Russell, and finally thinks of someone other than himself. His chief antagonist appears to be Cable, whom Brolin plays more or less straight and somehow invests with dignity and pathos - making this an unprecedented twofer in the morose supervillain sweepstakes. Zazie Beetz shows great poise as a fun new character called Domino, whose superpower is luck, and wittier filmmakers would have concocted lots of Rube Goldberg disasters around her. (What's there is decent enough to make you see what might have been.) But there's nothing much to be done with the Boris Badenov special effect known as Colossus, whose face is dully frozen. To offset the happy fact that there's a gay superhero, the writers bring back the babbling Indian cab driver, Dopinder, who in light of the recent Hank Azaria Apu hoo-hah goes over about as well as Jar Jar Binks. Deadpool makes a crack elsewhere about ""cultural appropriation,"" but he's silent on the dopey Dopinder stereotype. I suppose you could make a case for Deadpool 2 the way people do for Joe Dante's ramshackle sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch - a spirited goof on Gremlins - and, further back, Warner cartoon alum Frank Tashlin's antic Son of Paleface, in which Bob Hope shared the screen with Roy Rogers and Trigger. A superhero movie with the looseness of a Mad magazine parody remains a viable idea, as demonstrated by the underrated Mystery Men and, of course, Deadpool. But a film that spits one-liners as mechanically as a tennis-ball launcher is even more tediously predictable than one with no sense of humor at all. Incidentally, Deadpool, a 20th Century Fox release, opens with Reynolds exhaling a cloud of cigarette smoke into the camera, probably meant to tweak his superhero cousins at Disney, which doesn't permit smoking in its movies. Disney, of course, is on the brink of acquiring Fox's entertainment division, which will make it even more of a franchise-oriented juggernaut than it already is. Although that's an alarming prospect, I'm all for purging cigarettes from movies and TV, which statistics show have an undue influence in getting kids to start smoking. If the filmmakers were as self-reflexive as they pretend to be, they'd find a way to show that Deadpool's insides are becoming as charred as his face. In any case, he should enjoy his cigarettes while he can."

Well, this is NOT one of those times. <br/><br/>... wait for it...<br/><br/>It's so good you sometimes feel that you're watching Deadpool WITH Ryan Reynolds (not how Blake would be actually watching with him, but still)<br/><br/>... Dary ! <br/><br/>It sure did take many buses of incredibly talented individuals to make it happen. Not one bus, many.<br/><br/>It was legendary ! <br/><br/>The question remains : Is it Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool ? or IS Deadppool playing Ryan ?"

The first film was an excellent portrayal of the character, Reynolds proving the perfect choice for playing the inimitable Wade Wilson. Hopes were naturally very high for the sequel, but, as with all follow-ups, there was a worry that it wouldn't live up to the original; that it would perhaps go too far or be just a rehash of what we've seen before. Fortunately, that's not the case - if anything, Deadpool 2 is better than its predecessor, with a better story, more characters and much more references and humour. Still, although this film succeeds on every level, it still struggles to be quite as unique and memorable as the titular character himself.<br/><br/>The story in Deadpool 2 is hugely better and more entertaining than the previous one, jumping straight in with full-on Deadpool action and leading on to a genuinely engaging narrative. Unlike the first, this one doesn't have the handicap of being bogged down in an origin story. This results in a better story with much more heart and more even more comedy. In fact, the story takes a fairly surprising turn, taking us in an unpredictable direction. Despite the sheer volume of promotion for this film, it's commendable that much of its plot details were not leaked ahead of time. As much as it mocks fellow superhero films, in this respect it's an improvement on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film that was famously criticised for giving away the main antagonist at the end as well as the inclusion of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>On top of this, it has a different feel to a lot of other superhero films and comes across as notably fresh even in an already saturated genre dominated by the MCU. A lot of this has to do with how Deadpool is different and how humour is at the heart of both the character and the film. There are plenty of references which can make anyone laugh, particularly film and comic fans though. It takes a certain boldness for a film to ridicule itself, but it definitely works to its advantage here. There's even wise-cracking and jokes in the middle of intense action scenes, never falling short on laughs. These jokes make the otherwise breathtaking and exciting fight scenes that much more enjoyable. It's just as much a comedy as it is a superhero film, arguably even funnier than most comedy films released. This is precisely what we need in this genre, making Deadpool 2 stand out even though coming out just weeks after record breaking superhero film Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>Since wise-cracking and comedy is at the heart of Deadpool's character himself, it then comes as no surprise that this is without a doubt Ryan Reynolds' film. Once more completely throwing himself into the role, he's proven himself yet again to be perfect as Deadpool. This film managed to give him a chance to humanise the character, giving us a more emotional Wade amongst the ceaseless joking. Not that our titular hero gets edgy at all - that duty is served perfectly by newcomer Josh Brolin. Even though we've just seen him as Thanos, he makes an excellent adversary to Deadpool as Cable (although he's still called Thanos once in one of many great one-liners), with a large heart underneath the gruff, rugged persona. Another newcomer, Zazie Beetz also fits in very well as an opposite to Deadpool, rolling her eyes at all his jokes and quips, often effortless managing to steal the spotlight in some of the action scenes. Julian Dennison too is very welcome in his role, only his comedy talents seem slightly underused - still, he's gone from Hunt for the Wilderpeople to a more mainstream film. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction for a up and coming star. Other supporting characters return fresh-faced and excited to continue, but they never manage to steal the spotlight from Reynolds.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoyed the first film is guaranteed to enjoy the second. Everything that we liked from the former returns, this time bigger and better; more story, more characters, more action, more laughs, more heart - think Avengers was the only excellent superhero film this year? Think again. It's almost as if Black Panther was a starter, Avengers was the main, Deadpool 2 is dessert, and Ant-Man and the Wasp will be coffee. Not only is it impressive for Deadpool to stand among the MCU titans, but dessert has never been so fun."
"Jack_C_","9","6","14","1 June 2018"," Better than the original
","After buying the first Deadpool on disc, I discoverd that the jokes got stale and the pacing felt uneven on repeat viewings. The sequel excels in almost every way. From Julian Dennison, whom we loved in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, to Josh Brolin's hilarious deadpans, to Zazie Beetz, who is charismatic and beautiful even when sitting on a tree stump, Deadpool 2 just works on every level. It is genuinely funny even on repeated viewings. The zero nudity rating was a bonus that allowed us to bring our teenagers to the movies. Look from some hilarious A-list cameos throughout. <br/><br/>It is the Godfather 2 of action comedies."
"darkreignn","9","6","14","1 June 2018"," Cashmeousside cuz this film is amazing
","Have you ever done cocaine? Me neither, but I can imagine the effects that cocaine have on a person is similar to the same psychological and bodily reaction one gets while watching ""Deadpool 2."" Imagine buying a nice bag of 100%, pure, unadulterated, Colombian ""sugar,"" and you can already feel the rush through your body as you're walking home with it. Your hands are shaking with excitement, your heart is racing, and your brain is flooded with dopamine. Then you get home, ready to press your face against that sweet, sweet angel dust and breath in, and then the real rush hits you. Adrenaline, endorphins, it's like an orgasm times one million. You laugh, you cry, you feel your brain coursing with pleasure. <br/><br/>The process of going to watch ""Deadpool 2"" is like that, but better. First you buy the ticket, and you can feel a slight tingling in your groin area. Then you buy your popcorn, get a large soda because it's only 75 cents more than the medium and who could resist a deal like that, and as your wallet gets lighter because you just spent a week's pay in 15 minutes, the tingling increases, and you feel a slight sense of moisture (I'm trying to make this applicable to both sexes okay? This is 2018). Then you actually step inside of the theatre and you're basically a lake. Everyone around you is avoiding you because EVERY part of your body is dripping some form of liquid, and you're breathing heavily even though you didn't even snort any coke, at least, not the good kind. And then the trailers start and your excitement is almost unbearable. If you were having a sexual experience, which is practically what ""Deadpool 2"" is, you would have no doubt already finished and disappointed your lover. But then, finally, sweet release rushes over you as the movie finally starts, and it's as if you've taken a page from Paul Finch's book and studied the art of sexual tantric meditation because for the duration of the entire run time you feel pure, radiating sexual pleasure. <br/><br/>I'm not even exaggerating, but I am narcissistically stroking my own ego by overindulging in my own mediocre writing abilities, but that's how you get the A's kids, you write a bunch of fluff and make it sound professional, and now I'm making slightly above minimum wage in an insurance office doing work I did not go to college for so it looks like all my hard work paid off. Did I mention I made $160 in the stock market by selling a stock I owned when it rose a few bucks, but I could've made much more if I had any patience and waited only 3 hours later, at which point my stock would've rose to a number so astronomically large that I am currently considering checking myself into a psych ward because of how much I regret my decision? <br/><br/>Don't worry though, because ""Deadpool 2"" is funnier and more entertaining than my poorly written review. I laughed so hard that I have no doubt I made my girlfriend uncomfortable. My girlfriend, she didn't laugh that much, she chuckled, shook her head, farted a few times, but me, I couldn't stop. I was stroking my girlfriend's thigh slowly and suggestively during this movie because she's thicc and was wearing short shorts, but the stroking turned into iron-tight grips because I needed something to hold on to because I was laughing so hard. Seriously, my girlfriend now has bruises on her thighs and officer, I swear, it's Deadpool's fault. I really feel stupid because of how hard this movie made me laugh.<br/><br/>And if you're a killjoy and don't find anything funny, then you shouldn't go see this movie but if you do, at the least the action will definitely entertain you. The action is slick and clean and gory and bloody and very high-energy, and really reminded me of ""Kick-Ass."" And when it comes to energy and humor and high-octane, stylized, awesome action, ""Deadpool 2"" feels a lot like ""Kick-Ass,"" and coincidentally ""Deadpool 2"" is kick-ass. <br/><br/>9/10 so cashmeousside"
"tommertmag","10","6","14","1 June 2018"," All I wanted was a sequel that was not a disappointment. I got so much more!
","If you like the character Deadpool then you'll like the movie. There was so much to like and laugh at. There were no slow spots. The action was great. There were really fun suprises. So many marvel movies have a plot without any interesting twists, this was not one of them. I especially enjoyed seeing side characters change over time. Do yourself a favor and go see a movie that was throughly enjoyable. Even with Reynolds who makes fun of his acting skills. He had some moving moments in the film. Something I didn't expect to see from a guy that looks like an avocado."
"daniel_granda","9","6","14","31 May 2018"," Maximum Effort!
","This was a great follow-up packed with all the over-the-top violence, language, political, and show biz commentary you can shake a stick at. Most movies get dicey when you pull the time travel card and this movie is no exception. Many of the events in the film are seemingly erased in some post credit stingers, notably NOT the fate of Shatterstar. At long last we finally get Cable and Domino added to the MCU so that enters a whole new host of shinanegans. I thought Reynolds delivered another epic performance as the foul-mouthed assassin. While Brolin is a fine addition as the Techno-Virus infected mutant. There were some moments where they milked the scenes a little too much, the faux death scene comes to mind. Deadpool brings dark and side-splitting humor to the MCU and while a movie like this is usually a love it or hate it affair for viewers I felt I got what I expected going in and was happy with casting choices as they inject some mutants who are not afraid to use hollow points."

She was absolutely amazing and had by far the best action scenes that really showed off what she can do. Josh Brolin was definitely the perfect choice for Cable. Interesting that he's been in movies from both Marvel and Fox; I feel like he should show up in one of Sony's Spider-Man movies for a hat trick. Also, glad Brianna Hildebrand could come back for this one. She and Shioli Kutsuna are adorable together. Not to mention how great all the X-Force's scenes were (no spoilers). Plus, all these cameos! I felt like I was watching one of the new Star Wars movies or something! Fantastic movie. Is it too early to want a third one? Until that happens, I'll definitely be seeing this again."

","The simplest thing I can say about Deadpool 2 is that I actually laughed out loud. I don't normally laugh that much anymore from anything, but despite my cynicism of some of the regurgitation of material that was used in the original, this is one of the few movies that actually had me laughing out loud. <br/><br/>Seeing Ryan Reynolds reprise the role he was born for is such a breath of fresh air. Reynolds has been in a sort of time-warp for his entire career until he hit gold with Deadpool. He's unbelievably funny as the talkuntilyouwanttoshootyourself super ""hero"". <br/><br/>Josh Brolin is absolutely amazing and menacing as Cable. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Domino and because of her powers, her fight scenes are hilariously gory. I can let it slide that Hollywood needed to rub their diversity hands over her character and change her from white to black. This is the far left leaning Hollywood after all.<br/><br/>One criticism is the popping up of regressive left identity politics and views again. It seems like a lot of the movies and TV shows I watch are increasingly wagging their finger at these issues from a 1 sided perspective. <br/><br/>The most shocking thing about the movie is it managed to somehow keep the momentum of the original going, although it did lose some of the originality that made the first movie so amazing. Solid 8."
"hojjisan","9","5","11","27 May 2018"," Funnier, filthier, and a crotch riot
","Ok let's start off with the fact Deadpool 2 takes too long to get to the meaty bits and adolescent bathroom humor , but once it does, it gets its 9 stars. 
After the slow rocky start, you will be served up heaping piles of melodrama. Self-discovery. Trippy sequences, and Josh Brolin skulking in the background. All of this topped with a dash of some X-Men, and as an added bonus there's an extended joke that ends with a fatal attraction crotch shot that you will never be able to unsee. Oh and a teddy bear. Just focus on the teddy bear and you'll be alright<br/><br/>As a superhero movie, Deadpool 2 is a sequel that is not better than the original but it does builds on the original in the expected ways. The action's bigger, the cast has grown and Karan Soni's Dopinder steals the ending for himself!!
Of course you will get the obligatory end-credits sequences. They're not essential to move the franchise along, but they are hilarious and worth the wait.<br/><br/>As a comedy, is were Deadpool 2 surpasses the original, dispelling the curse of sequels being god awful and ultimately so terrible they are forgotten. You may be annoyed at first, but like its star, Deadpool 2 will irritate you until you're a slave to the rhythm."

","So I won't be giving an in depth review here...and to be honest it's not really a 10 star movie as I have rated it. This is still a super fun film and if you're a fan of the first you'll enjoy this one too!
You see, I'm here to balance the 1 star reviews. And try and try as they might, the haters still aren't knocking this one down below 8 stars yet. 
Sorry...but I've been a film buff for more than 35 years and have obviously seen thousands of movies and for anyone to rate this just 1 star or even 3 or 4 is just plain silly. 
So many people just love to hate! It must be their only means of justifying their pathetic existence. Complaining about plot (it's not trying to be a major drama here folks), complaining about how the characters don't reflect the comics (sometimes you have to adjust for the times and they are moving fast). If they made Flash Gordon today it would have to be silly...as the things people never thought possible like lasers are actually a real thing now!
It's supposed to be simply fun without having to be wrapped around some amazing plot and sub plots. You're just supposed to have FUN! It's meant to be silly. Loosen your sphincters people, chew some popcorn and have a few laughs!"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","5","11","21 May 2018"," F is for Family in ""Deadpool 2""
","""Deadpool 2"" is hysterical, whimsically crass, electrifying action, and despite superfluous intentions: ""Deadpool 2"" is about family. Sweet surprise. Ryan Reynolds is the mercurial snarky reluctant hero Deadpool and his human persona Wade Wilson. Wade possesses amazing mutant regenerative powers and martial arts skills. Josh Brolin is Cable, the mechanically armed cyborg from the future, seeking to alter the time line; thus, erasing his own personal tragedy. Wade's heartbroken cynicism and Cable's dour intensity compose this unique Yin and Yang of Director David Leitch's eclectic ""Deadpool 2"". <br/><br/>Leitch has a masterful eye for martial arts execution as displayed in ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"". Brolin's Cable and Reynolds's Deadpool go full throttle in vicious throw down, upon each other or in tandem thrashing a villain horde. With all the spectacular shoot 'em eye candy, gaudy CGI battles, and cleverer than thou self-conscious pop culture references the story by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds discovers genuine gravitas in its conventional heart: What is it to be a family? <br/><br/>At the narrative arc Vanessa, played by beautiful soulful Morena Baccarin, tells her lover Wade, ""Kids give us a chance of being better than we use to be."" In this ""Deadpool 2"" emerges greater. ""Deadpool 2"" is more of the same hyperbole action sequences and smart aleck sensibility. Yet, Wade experiences profound loss and discovers his purpose in saving suffering young mutant Russell, played by innocently brave Julian Dennison, who commands fiery flames through his hands. <br/><br/>In all its misdirects and the comic narrative obsession for Wolverine and Hugh Jackman, ""Deadpool"" is really about family and love. Deadpool himself would rather vomit in his confession. He forms the ""X-Force"" to complete his mission to save Russell's soul and the future's well-being. Strong mesmerizing Zazie Beetz as Domino, whose mutant prowess is luck, comments on the team's name: ""Isn't that a little derivative?"" Exactly. Zazie is total kick ass and a star. Domino. Cable. Deadpool. Russell. Family doesn't necessarily have to look a certain way. But you know when you are one. <br/><br/>Reynolds beautifully balances aloof smarter than thou and big-hearted hero. He is literally stifled in that red mask. Yet, Leitch wisely exposes Ryan's well of emotions when unmasked. Wade tells tearful Russell, ""You're a good kid..."" Deadpool reveals his own truth. Through all his bluster and irreverence, he knows that we all deserve kindness. Josh Brolin is Ryan's understatedly powerful foil. In contrast to motor mouth Wade, his Cable's selected words command gravity. He moves us as he speaks of ""the most pain"" you will ever know. <br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" is loud, smart aleck hysterical and total over the top carnage. No surprise. What surprises: It's sense of humanity. Seems even Deadpool knows that Hero is about family. Hero is about love. He might even say that with a straight face, if you could see his face. Just saying."

You're almost convinced he's ACTUALLY Deadpool.<br/><br/>This time, DP's joined by Cable (Josh Brolin), Domino (Zazie Beetz) and Russell (Kiwi Julian Dennison, who fortunately gets to keep his native accent) as well as a couple of famous cameos (you'll have to see it to find out who...), with Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Vanessa (Morena Baccarin Weasel (TJ MIller) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) returning.<br/><br/>Directed by David Leitch (credited as The Guy Who Killed the Dog in John Wick), DP 2 amps up the fight scenes and visual effects, which elevates it above the first flim, with plenty of violence and blood.<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't be a Deadpool movie without numerous fourth-wall breaks, movie/comic/pop culture references (including a brilliant Michael Keaton-era Batman line) and swear words. There's so many references that you'll need to Google them to catch them all.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay during the credits, with one excellent post-credits scene that allows Reynolds to gleefully poke brutal fun at himself."

A lot of the cgi was visibly very bad. Surprisingly bad actually. I have no idea if it was ironic or not but its really not that big of a flaw.<br/><br/>Ok so positive stuff: 
The movie was absolutely stomach-pain-inducingly funny. There are moments in this movie where the whole theater was screaming from laughter. I didn't notice a single joke that fell flat. Of course some are either low brow or just not as good but none of them were horribly cringy or in general bad.
Ryan gives, yet again, another perfect portrayal of the merc with the mouth. Born for it , literally. 
Josh Brolin was a absolute blast as cable as well. Layered performance and actually well written character.<br/><br/>I think this movie works best with someone who watches lots of movies, follows pop culture (particularly marvel (and heck even some dc) movies). The references are at least 60% of the humor along with the hilarious slapstick and visual comedy.<br/><br/>All of the characters are great, the standout being Domino. Not because of the performance as much as just the brilliantness of the idea of a lucky superhero.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed with a lot of hilarious visual comedy as well as plenty of gore and limbs to satisfy the R rated hungry Deadpool fans.<br/><br/>The movie has some seriousness to it too, not only being 100% wacky like the first Deadpool. The writers actually injected some emotion and ""family connection"" into the movie and it all worked very well.<br/><br/>Please do yourself a favor and stay until the after credits (of which there are two, just don't miss them).<br/><br/>Fantastic sequel and probably the funniest movie I have seen in a while.

","Deadpool 2 is my favorite Marvel movie. One of the funniest movies I've seen, as a Comedy is better than a superhero movie. Deadpool 2 was totally of my taste, completely loved it. Too bad it has to be called ""Deadpool 2"" just generically but people should know it is the superior movie. This movie could just be the original no problem, ""Deadpool"" the part 1 could easily not exist and nothing would be lost. I didn't even feel like watching Deadpool 1 for a second time when it came out. Instead I can watch Deadpool 2 two times in a row so I can pause it to laugh out loud aplenty and I've done that, it is just absolutely fascinating. Sooooooo funny, very few jokes didn't appeal to me, overall it cracks me up pretty bad. The part of the X-Force is the best, hands down, love the humor.
Cable and Domino are standouts. Josh Brolin, in real life he is just as a jokester as Ryan Reynolds. They get along so well.<br/><br/>See in Deadpool 1 there is a bad guy and he has no motivation whatsoever to antagonize Wade to the death the way that he did and I didn't like that, didn't convince me. To me that is weak, unlike this movie's plot. In Deadpool 2 is a lot more complex than just one bad guy, I'm not going deeper into that if you haven't seen it, but the theme of ""the bad guy"" is the central topic of the movie. That's why it surpasses Deadpool 1 which is said to be, according to Wade, a Love film. Deadpool 2 is a Family film.<br/><br/>The movie is HILARIOUS and this website is too bitter about it. A lot of negative reviews to knock it down from the 8/10. Childish users. Why aren't you happy that part 2 surpassed the 1st?"

"mrnajafi-22368","9","2","3","29 August 2019"," Mutiple elements, next to each other, in the best way possible
","I regret that I forgot to write this sooner and tonight I remembered how good this movie was.
Deadpool 2 just like the first Deadpool (2016) has everything, good directing, good filmography, good writing, good acting, good story, also it has comedy, tragedy, action, dirty stuff, narrator (Deadpool himself), etc etc. so many to name.
That said, there is barely any film that has all the elements possible and still works out great. When a team of film makers try to induce many of these elements in one work they most likely ruin their own work and it comes out very tacky and unpleasant, but not in this one.
Even though it uses so many cliches, it still has a high level of creativity. Personally I didn't think Deadpool 2 has anything new and I thought it would be only ok or good because it can't have the same creativity and can't have a new way of story-telling, because it was already used in the first one, but surprisingly the movie still had a lot to say.
Also I very much liked that Deadpool is not another (as a figure of spesch) a ""hero"" - who doesn't kill-.<br/><br/>I'm so disappointed in critics because of low rating, it's probably because they mostly look at things technically (as I believe they shouldn't). I also believe in any field, such as music, film, theater and painting when something has a new content, new concept or new way of doing or any kind of innovation -in a good way that comes out suitable and pleasing-, it deserves to get 1 or 2 points out of 10 just for that (unless it the whole thing is rubbish)."

","DEADPOOL 2
RATING: 3.8/5<br/><br/>I think the thing about these Deadpool movies is that you can tell Ryan Reynolds really cares about the character, so you know that he's not gonna phone it in. Honestly, Deadpool feels like this generations ""The Mask."" Yes, he doesn't have all the crazy magic powers Jim Carrey had, but his inability to die gives him a Looney Tunes quality about him. He literally comes back from every fatal injury imaginable like if he's Wile E. Coyote, which lends itself to some interestingly funny scenes.<br/><br/>I guess my main issues are the CG, and the action choreography. A lot of the CG is just bad, really bad. With all the money they made off the first movie, you'd think they would put in the money to have the CG look great, especially if they're gonna use so much of it compared to the first film. It took me out of the movie every time. A lot of the action feels a little on the generic side and not very creative unless it's played for laughs. It feels like a step back from the first Deadpool. Case in point, Dominos super power is luck, but it's portrayed like a Final Destination movie. The director must not have known that there's been 5 Final Destination films because the scenes here are pretty forgettable by comparison.<br/><br/>Overall I'm left with this feeling of unfulfilled potential with this sequel. The pieces are there for something greater than the first one, and although it may be funnier, story wise it isn't really that great the way things play out. For all the Domino controversy about her being Black, she's really not that big a character, hardly gets any development, and left me feeling pretty ""meh"" about her in the end. Cable is pretty great but he only gets bare bones development too. Every time he was on screen, i wanted to know more about him, and the future he came from, but they just never really deliver. The kid in the film is whatever, despite all the screen time they give him. Almost every character in the first movie gets relegated to the background this time around, and that just did not sit well with me cause i really liked the first one. Rather than building on the first film, it felt like they semi-scrapped it.<br/><br/>In the end, it comes down to what you find funny and what you'll accept, on whether this sequel is going to be better for you or not. For me, the laughs weren't as good as the first one but that's just my personal taste, and i would never really ding it for that. It came down to the bad CG, uninspired action scenes, and lack of development for everyone else but Deadpool, that kept lowering it's score from ""great"" and put it in ""pretty good"" territory. The first Deadpool is a better crafted movie overall, but the sequel is still entertaining, despite all its flaws."
"spkydst","10","2","3","18 August 2019"," It's Deadpool.... You know it's good!
","What can I say that the world doesn't already know about this film? It's the Shawshank Redemption of Marvel films! That is if Morgan Freeman happened to be a profane, wise cracking, badass superhero with swords and guns.
Ryan Reynolds may as well change his name to Wade Wilson as much as he has embodied this role, Zazie Beetz is flat out amazing as Domino, Karan Soni is hilarious as always, Josh Brolin couldn't have been a better choice for Cable, and T.J. Miller is just one of my favorite actors to begin with... but also does an amazing job as Weasel, the comedic voice of reason in Deadpool's life.
Not only does this movie just have, well... everything! It's also just great to see Marvel make so many pokes at its own franchise of films.
Really... this review is pointless:
If you've seen then first Deadpool... you've probably already watched this.
If you haven't seen the first Deadpool, you're probably living off the grid.
10 out of 10 from me... All I have to say."

","Love the snarky wit of Deadpool. Must say, I am very tired of the genre of blowing everything to smithereens and one explosion after another in this type movie so I often skip them. There was so much humor here that I found myself actually really enjoying it. This type of movie usually isn't loving on plot and Deadpool 2 follows right along with not having the greatest PLOT, but I highly doubt people come to action movies because the plot line is supposed to be believable, folowable or even make logical sense. Deadpool 2 holds true to form that an anti hero with loose morals can actually be a good guy in the end and come around to doing good things in a funny sort of a way...my favorite comic book type hero ever."

","Dead pool is one of my favorite movies. The 1st was sooo amazing I could not wait for the 2nd. My biggest critisizim of the 2nd was the timing of the comedy. It went to fast and did not have enough time between gags to appreciate each tidbit of humor. While I was thinking about the the joke they rushed to the next gag so I had to turn my thoughts to focus on not missing the next. It was like having to sneeze and missing it. WTG people's, it's more important to make the movie a little longer (time wise) or writing in time space for the joke to sink in. A missed sneeze is hell on earth"

"CubsandCulture","8","2","3","4 January 2019"," Not quite the first Deadpool, but what is?
","Everything here is a notch or too below the first film. Whereas the first made gags to mock lazy writing in other superhero stories this one mocks lazy writing to hide its own plot contrivances. In the first film Deadpool was delightfully queer and subversive; for example at times the camera the linger over his body the way women heroines have been film forever. Here the character is streamlined and made less queer. It is still subversive and funny. But it isn't the brilliance send up of the first film. I feel that more time should have been spent with Domino (and her luck) because that was the most inventive part of the film and the only thing that the sequel matched the first film on.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the story, a domestic drama filtered through the Deadpool parody of superheros, is engaging and actually touching. Good on the film for making the main antagonist a plus size kid. It is clever touch. Likewise, Reynolds is still absolutely perfect as Wade/Deadpool and he largely carries the film.<br/><br/>Solid follow-up to a genre and ground breaking original."

","Every bit as aggressively irreverent and wildly entertaining as its predecessor, ""Deadpool 2"" is a perfect superhero sequel. It takes all the elements that worked the first time around - from a surprisingly layered screenplay filled with a veritable assault of one-liners to extraordinary action sequences, among many others - and manages to successfully replicate them here without being reductive, repetitive or predictable. In addition, it introduces wonderful new characters and gives them plenty to do, while there's a parade of celebrity cameos and appearances that enhance how much fun the whole movie is. But really, none of it would matter were it not for Ryan Reynolds: He's a veritable supernova of charisma and likability, and his obvious, infectious enthusiasm for the role is palpable in every scene. Watch for some post-credits sequences that are laugh-out-loud funny."

"jaretricejhr","9","2","3","12 November 2018"," A fun action film for fun people.
","This has to be one if my favorite action flicks that I have ever seen in my entire life. Usually, sequels don't meet up to my expectations, but this one did just that! I meant to write this review sooner, but here it is now. This film mashed all of my favorite things for an action/comedy into one movie, talented and humorous writing, satisfying action sequences, a good plot, and good ol' fun. This didn't out rank the first deadpool for me, as I do love them both the same, because I definitely like going back to the first one for a much more simple action comedy, and back to this one for the incredible writing, perfect plot, and the many more Deadpool gags. I can't stress enough how much Ryan Reynolds fits this role perfectly, especially due to his actual personality. Vanessa's death definitely striked me as fairly depressing, but it did fit with the rest of the story/plot. One thing I wished for in this flick that I didn't get was seeing the X-force get more of a role in the film, and see them fight along Deadpool, instead of dying instantly due to severe winds, but other than that, the film was amazing, and couldn't be any more of a perfect action comedy, with the perfect cast.<br/><br/>Also, I definitely got a really good kick out if the alternate time travelling gag that played during the credits, my family couldn't stop laughing neither at the baby legs joke. I suggest you give this flick a watch if you hadn't already!<br/><br/>-Jaret"

Duh they're similar in nature, it's a sequel? Wtf do you expect?

","FIRST OFF... I feel like I need to get this off my chest to anybody who hasn't seen this movie and is reading these reviews to see if it's worth it... PLEASE, DO NOT even bother reading ANY of these idiots who gave this movie ONLY ONE star!! These are the type of people who would win a free trip to Hawaii, all expensive paid, travel on a private jet, eat amazing food AND STILL find much to complain about! There is NO pleasing these type of people! Seriously... what more do they want with this type of movie?!? The ONLY gripe they have that I could maybe say ""OK"" (and that is if I'm splitting hairs) is that it did use a lot of CGI... but didn't Avengers: Infinity War?? (And last I checked that movie was amazing!) For what it's selling, it AT LEAST meets expectations (or IMO) blew them out of the water, again!!! <br/><br/>HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD DEFINITLY know a few things before going into this movie. Expect A LOT of gore... A LOT of cursing... AND A LOT of dirty jokes! If I had kids, I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing anyone AT LEAST under 15 or 16 years old. (Basically the younger they are, the more cringy and uncomfortable questions you will be asked lol) So there is a REALLY good reason why this movie is rated R. (If you want to know more in detail of why this movie is rated R, definitely check the ""parents guide"" tab/link for this movie)<br/><br/>Bottom line... If you saw the 1st one, enjoyed it and had a great time... you will NO DOUBT enjoy this one as well! GREAT action scenes... HILARIOUS jokes... AND AN AWESOME soundtrack!!!

"cloudyear-71751","8","2","3","13 August 2018"," A Great Sequal that Builds Upon The First
","Deadpool 2 does what every Great Sequal should do it Builds upon issues with First an Improves some of the problems with such things as The Villian, Story, an Action. Lets start with the Villian cause its hard to pin down 1 Distinct Villian cause for the first half its Cable then things change in the story than its Russell is sorta the Villian but it Definetly fixes the problem of a weak Villian cause in this one everyones motivations are clear and there goals change as the movie goes along. The Story is also a improvement over the first which was just a Revenge Movie which works for the first Movie but this one is much better, what they do with the Characters mainly Deadpool was so well done it got Emotional at the end and was well earned. They brought in more character's for Him to play off of which was Perfect cause the side are just as good as Deadpool. Now most people would think its about X-Force which was a selling point of the Movie but SPOILERS They all die which was surprising but they use it as a Great Cameo that i would hate to Spoil all the Cameos in this were Great, especially the After Credit Scenes those were Hilarious Definetly stay for those, Back to the Supporting Characters Domino was great with the Banter her an Deadpool they almost come off as bickering siblings, the returning Characters were good as well such as Collossus an Dopinder I think that's how you spell it they all had there moments to shine, while on the other hand some of other Returning Characters like Nega-Sonic who i thought was Great in the first doesn't get as much screen time as I think she deserved but T.J Miller was pretty annoying in this movie as i felt he was in the First, an I Like T.J Miller but just not in this. Cable was where the real Comedic Banter shined him an Deadpool have Wonderful Chemistry an play off each other Naturally, Russell was a Antagonist you could say, his motives were well written, expect for some Choices he makes with his allegiance was kinda Strange but it doesn't Ruin the Movie, Then we get to the Action which is just Amazing they got one of the guys who did John Wick, and Atomic Blonde which was very exciting an they did a Amazing job with the Action, besides some Questionable Editing for the last Fight Scene, but that doesn't take it away from how well done all the other ones are, there Creative and Fun which is what you'd want from a Summer Movie, its my personal Favorite CBM Movie so far this Year, and that may seem Surprising since Infinity War is being hailed as the Greatest Superhero movie an its good but there's just things this movie does that I enjoyed more, sure it may not have the Scale or Budget but it makes the Small scale work and use the Budget the best they can it may not be the best but its certainly better than Bigger Budget movies I've seen this year, Now we get to the Humor, Comedy is very subjective what people find funny is very decisive I can say i laughed a fair amount of times it has some Great Jokes an some Meh Jokes but that'll happen with any Comedy I did find it funnier than the first and the Fourth-Wallbreaking works where they put it, So Overall this Movie does pretty much everything better than the first its Funnier, the Action is Way Better, and the Story an Villian work with this kinda movie its not Perfect but its really Good and I Highly Recommend it if you enjoyed the First 8/10 Great Sequel That Makes Me Very Excited For a Third"

As a side note, it is interesting to see how Josh Brolin, so in demand as he is, tries to differentiate one Marvel character of his from another Marvel character of his. There are some tints but maybe that's the entire point as this is not the glossy, intense superhero like the first one , which many of the lead actors already portrayed in the past so there will be some mild confusion at one point.

","Far exceeding the first installment of the potential franchise, Deadpool 2 brings more of what worked and less of what didn't. Many of the jokes land far better than the original, it was a a film that pushes boundaries in a way that might be considered forceful and deliberate but ultimately well suited for the loud mouth aesthetic of the merc with a mouth. The film takes itself a little more seriously than the first, this may be considered as a positive or negative pending on your opinion of the style that Deadpool brings. <br/><br/>The filmmakers and Ryan Reynolds understand the character well, it is a good transition from comic book to film, with interesting cameos and a plethora of references to pop culture. Side characters get more of a shine in Deadpool two and proves to be one of the strong suits of Deadpool as a future franchise. The film builds firm foundations for future installments beyond the necessary 'origin story' that the first film was almost obliged to convey as a priority. <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a welcomed addition and builds on what the first film was, better jokes, references and stronger character development of both Deadpool and the many side characters."
"Scriobh","9","2","3","7 June 2018"," A superior sequel
","This is one of the funniest and most action packed movies I've ever had the pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The only reason it lost a star is because there was a ""dead spot"" in the story towards the end - it just felt like there was 10 minutes of filler instead of actually telling the story itself. That and the tiny bit of sjw commentary, but thankfully that was kept to an absolute minimum.<br/><br/>Apart from that it was funny, tons of nostalgic and clever pop references, and Ryan Reynolds just doing his thing in the way that nobody else could. <br/><br/>This is how a fan movie should work - irreverent, entertaining and leaves you hoping for a sequel. You want to see it again straight away. Hell, it even managed to work a tiny romance sub-plot into the main themes of the movie itself, and it didn't feel pushed.<br/><br/>And the end credits scenes...excellent. <br/><br/>One for the collection, both for now and in the future.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr was born to play Tony Stark in the same way that nobody else can be Deadpool except for Ryan Reynolds."

"haarryi","8","2","3","6 June 2018"," An improvement on its fabulous predecessor
","I went to the theater without much expectations. Because I believed that the first movie worked because of its novelty and there is nothing remaining for a second outing. But, I ended up enjoying Deadpool 2 much more than the first one. To begin with, the increased budget showed and the resultant improvement in CGI was really good. While the first movie just depended on its lead's sense of humor and a few action set pieces, the second movie felt more holistic in its emotions. It was pleasing to see that. The story as a whole was more rounded than that of the first movie.<br/><br/>But, there were areas that I felt needed more attention. A major one is character development. There where a lot more characters introduced, but barely developed. What was worse what what they did with the characters from the first movie. Blind Al barely had any screen-time and was not at all developed. I felt particularly sad about the way they worked Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The character was brilliant and one of my favorites from the first movie. But, she is completely sidelined in this one. Colossus had a meatier role though.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a rather enjoyable movie. Feels a bit like a set up for X-Force, but still stands on its own. <br/><br/>Most importantly, it has the best mid-credit scenes I have ever seen."

And, I think my enjoyment is saying a lot because I thought the X-Force comic sucked, and particularly Cable, but I really enjoy the movie adaptation. I was a fan of all the X comic book titles except X-Force. I'm sure I don't need to name names but he also ruined the end of The New Mutants. And can't draw feet. Or hands. I loved that insertion into the film.<br/><br/>I really liked the addition of Domino, and like what the Atlanta actress brought to the role. Cable was surprisingly cool. I normally don't like Cable or the grunty tough guy, but he's a great straight man to Deadpool's humor. And Teenage Warhead, the teen with an attitude is just as fun in this film as the last. I also loved the cab driver. I don't remember him as much in the last film but he had some really funny moments in this one. Ha, and Paul or Peter was great. I was surprised by what happened to Shatter Star, but, in hindsight, his costume was ridiculous in the comic and he's got the whole two sword thing, Deadpool has the whole two sword thing, so, maybe for the best that he's paste.<br/><br/>Looking on the X-Force Wikipedia page I notice a lot of the team is comprised of New Mutants. With that film coming out not sure what their plan is on that for the upcoming X-Force film franchise. As long as they have Magick and Danielle Moonstar in The New Mutants, I won't riot. Personally, I think they should have all of the original team. And they should fight The Hellions at some point. And the Demon Bear. And bring Legion in and off that lame show. <br/><br/>There were one or two moments where I felt like a part of the film was missing, but, whatever, it quickly made up for it. I would say this is probably may favorite of all the superhero movies thus far. I have heart feels for the original Supermans, like all the X-Men films (except the garbage #3), and like Guardians, but Deadpool, a character I don't know if I ever read in the comics, is quickly becoming one of my faves. So, I eagerly await the next installment."
"ryanbartlett-870-746486","8","2","3","24 May 2018"," Adult Marvel Strikes Back
","Another rendition of the adult Marvel series, and another direct hit. In such a unique category of movie, Deadpool has the sole claim to the throne. They throw in a mixture of the standard superhero movies, but with the flare of making them rated R. Instead of your typical save the day and become the hero that the people deserve. Deadpool almost tries his hardest every movie to mess up the situation and to cause problems that he has to then go and fix. 
 The humor in this movie picks up where the last one leaves off, making fun of itself and every other movie with superheroes in them. They leave no jab left behind. Ryan Reynolds has no pause to become Deadpool and now the two are almost one in the same, passing up his history of being known as the Green Lantern.
 Deadpool capitalizes on its previous success and drives the story into the next. Will there be a Deadpool 3, 1,000% yes. Even if it doesn't bring in two billion dollars and doesn't match the success that other marvel films have. Deadpool is in a category all on its own, and until other competition comes to try and take it, I see no reason for them to stop. They have already completed all of the foundations with a solid cast and characters that play off of each other well, and have allowed for the story to really go anywhere they feel like going. Less external moving pieces allows for Deadpool to really just be his own loose cannon and explore anywhere and anything he feels like exploring."
"andythedarkone","8","2","3","23 May 2018"," A solid and enjoyable film for adults.
","Although not all of the jokes land, most will generate a chuckle, some will have you recoiling in disbelief whilst thinking 'they went there', I would rate this movie as been on par with the first, benefiting from more characters although not all of them are memorable, but I think it is part of the joke, with one particular character who's personality actually matches his persona in the comic book source.<br/><br/>I am not sure if the version shown the UK is lightly edited because of the 15 rating whilst the first was an 18 certificate, but still enjoyable and worth the price of admission, and buying on Blu-ray."
"BandSAboutMovies","9","2","3","22 May 2018"," A movie for nerds. Like me.
","Deadpool started as a ripoff of DC's Deathstroke the Terminator, but he quickly grew into his own character, a self-aware, speaking right to the viewer bit of anarchy in the Marvel Universe. Starting his life as Wade Wilson, he gave himself over to Department H, the same group that gave Wolverine his adamantium skeleton, in the hopes of curing his cancer. Yes, I wrote all of the paragraph from memory. I can go deep on the X-Men.<br/><br/>Even more complicated is Cable, the hero/villain of this film. Man, it takes a paragraph to explain him. He's the son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor, who is a clone of Jean Grey. He was given a techno-organic virus by Apocalypse and raised in the future by a psychic projection of his parents before coming back to our time as a much older, much more hardened mercenary who gathered the New Mutants as X-Force to stop the end of the world that his clone Stryfe would bring about. You don't need to know any of that to enjoy this movie. I know all of it. I also didn't get laid until I was 23. Such is comic books.<br/><br/>That said - Deadpool screws up and his life is ruined, so he becomes obsessed with ending his life. Then, he meets the teenage mutant Firefist (based on New Mutant Rusty Collins, played by Julian Dennison from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) who needs a friend. Of course, Deadpool screws that up. Then, he joins the X-Men and screws that up. Then, he forms X-Force. And screws that up. Basically, most of the movie is Deadpool being a colossal failure until he learns how he can finally die and be happy. Or not. I'm not gonna spoil it for you.<br/><br/>I'm also not going to spoil the big bad guy reveal either. But along the way, you get appearances by Negasonic Teenage Warhead (a Grant Morrison character named for a Monster Magnet song), Wolverine's ninja friend Yukio reimagined as an anime girl come to life, Colossus, Black Tom Cassidy, Domino, Shatterstar, the Vanisher and many, many more.<br/><br/>Cable is played by Josh Brolin, who really brings the crusty, always angry spirit of the character to life. I was overjoyed with his casting here, particularly since I didn't see Pierce Bronson or David Harbour as working in the role.<br/><br/>Basically, if you hate superheroes, you will hate this film. You can make that decision for yourself. If you love them, you will love this. And if you spent most of your teen years drawing pictures of Machine Man, Deathlok and Ulysses Bloodstone, then you're me and you were incredibly happy at the end of this movie."

"tmpsvita","9","2","3","21 May 2018"," it loses a bit of that heart and love that made the realization of the first chapter possible but is better in technique and ambition.
","The first ""Deadpool"" was a real breath of fresh air, a film that changes the cards on the table and that finally was told in a totally new and different way from the already vast panorama of the cinecomic both Marvel and not, thanks to its unlocked irony and its extraordinary breakages of the fourth wall, moreover it tried, succeeding successfully, to redeem a character who had previously been discredited in the universe of the x-men and an actor who had a great misfortune with the cinecomics; ""Deadpool 2"", however, manages to keep up its head growing in size (and budget: 58mln for the first while 110mln for this sequel), finally bringing a villain worthy of a strong counterpart as is Deadpool, played optimally by Josh Brolin from the great interpretation in the role of the best Marvel villain (Thanos), and proposing a plot with a more complex structure and a more refined and better studied script, with many quotations (always better contextualized) and countless beats inserted in a well calibrated , conscious way and with adequate time even if at certain moments it risks exaggerate, losing sight of the story and dedicating itself too much to them.
In addition to the villain are added new characters, those more present who less, like that of Domino, a girl who with good luck has a good connection able to trigger, as its name suggests, domino effects that offer a gratifying cinematic show, thanks also a remarkable direction entrusted to David Leitch who demonstrates his great talent in shooting very clearly and fluently action scenes full of discrete special effects, visibly improved compared to the first chapter.
Ryan Reynolds confirms once again that he is the best actor to play the hilarious, vulgar, violent, irreverent, unpredictable Deadpool (here even more in depth, revealing his more human and, if we want, deep side that makes him even more an interesting and appreciable character) thanks to his great feeling with it that allows him to interpret it with a lot of naturalness and spontaneity.
A film that runs very fast, having fun, involving and entertaining with jokes / gags that provide countless moments of laughter, lots of quotes and action scenes of exquisite workmanship; it loses a bit of that heart and love that made the realization of the first chapter possible but is better in technique and ambition."

","Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry.<br/><br/>For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these ""cosos"" are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.<br/><br/>With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their ""toys"".<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>Pretending to be ""set sail"" for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much ""attitude surpassed of everything"", both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line.<br/><br/>In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film's issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips.<br/><br/>The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body."

","Doing a good sequel seems impossible nowadays for Hollywood, but Deadpool 2 is an exception. As always Ryan Reynolds portrayed this antihero wonderfully: he's humorous, irreverent but he can also be lovely. In this movie his character was deepen and we discover more of his personality, confirming once again what I had already expressed in the review of the first movie: there is no other character like Deadpool in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and for me these two movies with Guardians of the Galaxy are the only ones that are really worth to be watch, because they are different and really intriguing.<br/><br/>This time we are also introduced to new heroes, such as Domino or Bedlam, that are a nice addition, even if they don't have much time on screen. Very weak the performance of Julian Dennison as Firefist. He is in fact really annoying and he is used only as a pretext to go on with the story. Honestly, creators here could have done a better job. I was personally very disappointed by the final fights that could not catch me much, as seems just another, generic battle against the super villain. I need however to say that the story and the narration were not at all obvious and there a few plot twists that I was not expecting at all.<br/><br/>For cinema lovers Deadpool movies are a must, even for people that does not love this genre:they are different and refreshing, you don't need to watch any Marvel movie before it, because it is a standalone movie. Even if X-Men are mentioned, don't worry, you don't need to watch the whole X-Men saga. There are many references to the pop culture, such as other movies or music. If you are able to catch them, the movie is even funnier."

","Marvel anti-superhero (super anti-hero?) Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) deals with a potentially rogue mutant, a cyborg assassin from the future, and guilt feelings about his recently deceased girlfriend, all while managing to keep up a never-ending stream of one-liners, insults and wise-cracks. A sequels go, this one isn't too bad and, since it doesn't differ much from the first entry in the series, if you liked that one, you'll probably like this one too (although the novelty of a foul-mouthed pseudo-X-Man mutant-hero has worn off somewhat).

","When ""Deadpool"" was coming out, I was hyped. I watched the trailer constantly, action was cool, Ryan Reynolds perfect for the role. All in all it seemed great. Critics loved it, people loved it, everyone loved it... So when I finally started watching it with my older brother, we were expecting nothing but a good movie. What we got was overglorified origin story with limited budget, disjointed plot and a humor like it was long episode of ""South Park"". Whole armies of guys in mindset like: ""MAN! THE MOVIE IS SO COOL! THEY MAKE PUNS, JOKES AND BREAK THE FORTH WALL! AND HE SWEARS AND KILLS PEOPLE AND THERE'S BLOOD AND STUFF! 10/10! MASTERPIECE! LOVE YOU RYAN REYNOLDS!"", defended the movie and praised it... And I was like... OK?... It was OK, but nothing special. 6/10 at best. Best parts of the movie were action scenes and Deadpool's relationship with the taxi driver which was the only thing in the movie that got us laughing. And then came ""Deadpool 2"" and I again liked the trailer. But this time I was skeptical. I waited and now that I finally watched it, I must say it's good... First few minutes I thought I'm in for more of the same, but then it switches to the real thing and it is such an improvement that I can't praise it enough. Story finally makes sense, Deadpool has reason he does things, action is even cooler, though lack of practical effects hurts me, but still... I laughed, I enjoyed it, I even almost cried at some parts. It's still the old ride of jokes and seriousness, but it's so great this time, that everyone can have fun with this movie. 8.8/10 from me and a very warm recommendation.

","Deadpool 2 is a very fun action movie, which is all it needed to be. This movie isn't better nor worse than the original, it is just as good, which is fine. This movie has incredible humor. with some amazing jokes and many many references. This movie also has some great action since the director of John Wick is behind it. Lot of fourth wall breaking, and even a great score from Tyler Bates. It's everything you could ever want from a Deadpool movie! Where this movie sort of loses me, and it's a nitpick, is when it becomes sad, yes a Deadpool movie has some depressing moments, and it's understandable, but I didn't really come to a Deadpool movie to see dark imagery and sad scenes, I came to have complete fun. However that is a nitpick for this movie is still great, Cable is a standout played beautifully by Josh Brolin; yet he is very underused and not used to his full potential. If you worried about the trailers showing you an Avengers like team up with Deadpool leading them, you have nothing to be concerned about since its nothing like that, it's still a fun Deadpool film. Deadpool doesn't really do anything ""bad-ass"" in this film, he's very funny but doesn't do anything that stands out really. A very excellent entry to the Deadpool franchise, but by the end of it, I wasn't asking for a Deadpool 3, not because I didn't want one, but because this movie feels like a conclusion for his story."

Though it's a funny and fast Picture, the overall meta-vibes are in cases way too many and makes the film looks heavier than it really is.<br/><br/>Quickly, I didn't love it as much as I loved the first one, but it was a perfectly nice follow up and it made me waiting for the next one!"
"drx0207","7","1","1","10 July 2018"," Not that great...
","To sum it up, the first movie had serious universe with characters that behave somewhat normal with a nonserius, meta deadpool in it. However in the sequiel tha whole universe seems deadpoolish, reacting fully out of place. 
That took away the whole point of deadpool and it became an average action-comedy superhero movie.
I liked it however...
Also this is exactly why you should not have timetravel in movies..."
"MadMax2710","7","1","1","3 July 2018"," A Fun Sequel With A Few Problems
","I was excited to watch this movie as soon as I finished watching the first one in 2016. This movie was entertaining but it didn't come without its flaws. The performances were really fun to watch. Morena Baccarin, however, didn't have much to do which was disappointing because she was a good character in the first one. The jokes were really funny throughout. The action was fun and violent. The cgi can be a little iffy sometimes but you won't pay too much attention to it as you're laughing at the jokes. The movie sometimes goes with a joke instead of having a cool or emotional moment which is a bummer. But overall it is a funny film that fans of the first one will probably enjoy."
"mramrever","7","1","1","18 June 2018"," The glass prison
","I noticed that the glass prison her in this movie is very much like the glass one used in the escape plan- 2013 movie for Arnold and Sylvester."
"swordsnare","7","1","1","10 June 2018"," Same same, but larger budget.
","Whoa...Polar extremes with most of the ratings/reviews here?! Expectations need to be dialled back a notch, it's a sequel??!!! It's never going to be as ""good"". To be honest, the first act was never a stunning masterpiece. Very entertaining, yes. I found this much the same, just on a bigger budget. Deadpool has been overhyped since the success of the first one. It still enjoyed it, even though some of the jokes feel a little flat."

"justinwfirestone","5","11","32","19 May 2018"," Not very funny, not at all
","Is it funny to be so meta? Not really. The welcome was worn well through with the first Deadpool, a refreshingly darker comedic comic movie. With our intrepid sequel, it is sadly not funny to reference Saw VII and High Fidelity, especially when you admit to ""lazy writing."" The writing is, indeed, lazy. That is possibly meta-meta? Two metas do not make a right or correct.<br/><br/>It's not funny to falsely accuse someone of being racist, unless, I suppose, you're a cancerous white male. It's not funny to make deragatory references to past X-Men movies, and it's not funny to pee your pants. It is not funny to have tiny legs, unless you're watching Avatar.<br/><br/>It's not funny to make fun of a chubby kid, and if you think it's funny to anarchistically and gruesomely violently kill off minor characters, then it's really not funny or even remotely sincere to attempt any meaning of love, heart, or family. No, all of that falls so splattingly flat in this extra and unnecessary revisit to the unkillable Deadpool (unless he wears a power-sucking necklace, perhaps a nod to the first Christopher Reeve Superman).<br/><br/>I could simply call Deadpool 2 a sloppy cash grab, something akin to The Godfather Part III, but that would be sloppy writing."

"DKosty123","8","7","18","28 May 2018"," A Lot of Fun & Action
","Deadpool's second installment does have some differences from the first movie. This includes an opening like but not like a James Bond movie with some crazy credits. That is only the tip of what is in store. Marvel Comic spirits predominate a talented cast and a script which makes too much sense. Deadpool 2 has another director from the first one, and though neither film has an experienced director (4 credits versus 5), the directors of this series are not real important. What is important is does the film have great humor and does the film mover along at a brisk pace? This one does....<br/><br/>Deadpool gets shot up, beat up, and finds love, loses love, finds luck, irony, drama, and comedy all in 2 hours of film. He also loses a few things along the way, and gets to pick up the pieces during the end credits. No need to wait until the end of the credits in this one. Now here is the major spoiler- the plot works itself out using the theme of a song. What is the name of the song?<br/><br/>""If I Could Turn Back Time""- yes it's Cher with an amazing vocal of her song included in this package. There is some pretty good music in this one. It's always in the back ground which is good. I don't think it would ever be a good idea for Deadpool to break out singing. After all, Clint Eastwood never boasts about his warbling in ""Paint Your Wagon"". Deadpool is a funny action hero who knows better than to subject his fans to any of that."
"lovefalloutkindagamer","10","7","18","28 May 2018"," What more can you ask for?
","I honestly believe our population is becoming spoiled with all the good movies that have come out these past few years.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Deadpool 2 is better than the first; it's also the best film to come out this year and it's just generally awesome overall. I've seen it twice, might see in theaters a 3rd time and definitely buying it on dvd.<br/><br/>This movie is riotously HILARIOUS. There were some parts where I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>I have to say though, if you didn't just watch the first Deadpool before seeing this then you probably didn't feel the impact of the more emotional scenes or get some of the jokes that were direct nods to the first. So my advice to you is before seeing this, watch the first one to refresh your memory. You can thank me later."

","A long-awaited sequel that exceeded my expectations and that personally, was better than the first part. This film has a very good plot, comedy from the beginning to the end, many cameos, surprises and easter egg. The initial scene is brilliant, I love it. A wonderful cast, Ryan Reynolds shines like Deadpool and proves once again that he is the only one who can make this character; Josh Brolin as incredible Cable, a great villain and Zazie Beetz as Domino, a great surprise, excellent character. Love the action scenes, the soundtrack very good and (although they were not great) very good special effects. The post-credit scene, without doubt the best and a great surprise. This movie has bright, incredible, funny and sad moments. I love it and it's the best superhero movie of the year."

","Unnecessary diversity that adds nothing to a backstory. They made the New Zealand/Arab looking kid a terrorist when he gets old, wtf why? 
Zazie's character as Domino was the most pointless character in any comic book movie to date. She was literally there for no reason and they had to make her back to put her on a poster. Hollywood needs to chill with this diversity for no reason thing. 
It's like black Annie, there's no point of it... If you're going to make diversity in a movie, don't make it the most politically incorrect comic book character of all time. Hollywood this isn't pokemon, we don't need to catch them all and shuv one of every race into a film, it's not necessary whatsoever.
I felt like they tried fitting in too much political crap, after reading this review you'll know exactly what I'm saying."

"cinmariechamb-62988","10","5","12","19 May 2018"," Worth the wait
","I went into the movie hoping it wouldn't be a lame attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first one. It definitely wasn't. As Reynolds himself said, the solo formula isn't good for more than a couple movies. Though they pushed it on the sequel it still worked. Mainly because there were so many twists in the movie.
Every time I thought it was getting too serious (I mean really, are looking for serious in a Deadpool movie), they threw a little twist and left you thinking, Ok, what's next?
The action was good, the humor was just as raunchy, and actually pretty topical without being to hipster.
Lots of making fun of himself, and others, throughout the movie.
In short, it was exactly what I expected, and wanted, from a Deadpool sequel.
The post credits scene was almost worth the price of admission by itself."

"sirwillisiv","8","4","9","31 May 2018"," Not fresh, but a mighty fun time...
","Truthfully, I'm really on the fence on whether I consider Deadpool 2 better or worse than the first film. This sequel does contain elements that improve greatly over its predecessor, yet its one key factor hasn't necessarily aged well. However, what Deadpool 2 gets right is it's surprisingly thoughtful story. The film follows Deadpool attempting to set a hate-filled young mutant onto a better path despite already reeling from a personal tragedy. Instead of going berserk and slaughtering everyone in sight out of grief (something you'd probably expect him to do immediately), Deadpool sees something of himself in Firefist and wants to defend him from Cable and change his future into a brighter, less tragic and destructive one similar to his own. This was an unexpected character turn for Deadpool, it was quite refreshing to see him display remorse and go to such lengths to instill hope into Firefist (something Colossus had faith in for Deadpool), despite a few needlessly mean-spirited moments where he weirdly broke that character arc for no foreseeable reason. At the heart-rending center is Julian Dennison, who does a brilliant job portraying a spunky, yet emotionally broken teenager that calls back to his breakout performance in Taika Waliti's indie film The Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which I highly recommend watching. It's funny, original, and GANGSTA! But, I digress...<br/><br/>With gun fights, swordplay, and bucketloads of extraneous gore splattering the walls, the action didn't disappoint, it lives up to the R-rating and it's a lot of fun to watch, especially when both Domino and Cable are thrown into the mix. In my opinion, Domino's mutant power is pretty ludicrous, but in an amusing way. She is able to survive potentially fatal events and change her opponents chances of gaining the upper hand instantly with just her presence. She can even twist a conversation to her advantage effortlessly like a Jedi mind trick or something out of Looney Tunes. It's absurd, but it results in some fast-paced, wildly entertaining action, and even some decent laughs to spare, namely Deadpool's confounded reactions to her success in combat. Cable is just a scary brute and some of the more grittier set-pieces involve him. When he strikes somebody you almost feel the weight and excruciating pain that comes with it, much like Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War (who Brolin also portrayed). It's quite astonishing to watch. I've never read any Deadpool comics that included Cable but I think I can say with firm confidence that the filmmakers really nailed the cyborg's beastly, intimidating figure and demeanor. Moments involving Cable really had me catching my breath (and in a good way, like a healthy work out). <br/><br/>Deadpool 2, like the first film, is the marathon of joyously ultra-violent action and flippant humor you'd pretty much expect, but I personally think it outshines its predecessor in terms of heart. I must say that the weakest element of the film was the comedy. The humor was hit-and-miss this time around for me, I mostly smiled at the gags, very few scenes had me audibly laughing, and I felt some jokes were a bit overplayed and try-hardy; the scene following the climax serving as a huge example. Brace yourself for some overlong, cringy, eye-rolling sentiment that could've been easily cut. Despite that massive personal setback, I was nonetheless stirred by the set-pieces and charmed by the characters. Deadpool 2 is not the freshest experience, but it's a mighty fun continuation. Make sure to stick around for the mid-credits scenes, they were quite a treat, especially if you despised X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern."
"brettneron","9","4","9","30 May 2018"," Never thought I would say it buuuutttt....
","DP2 is vastly superior to the original. In the 40 years or so I have been a film geek, I never thought I would be able to make this heartfelt statement...It's bigger, better, slicker and funnier than the first brilliant initial foray into the character. Yes like many other avid film buffs I would have had a similar leaning towards Aliens etc to hold the mantle but only now has my larynx been loosened by the total unrelenting rollercoaster of a ride that this film absolutely is and I have been able to say it with heartfelt sincerity. Ryan Reynolds is fast becoming the hot property his talent deserves and I highly recommend the full cinematographic experience (in other words don't wait for it to pop up on your telly)."
"lovitt-69777","8","4","9","30 May 2018"," Exquisitely careless
","Deadpool 2, much like the first film in the series (which will no doubt become a trilogy) is very clearly a passion project for Ryan Reynolds. His sheer dedication to portraying what we see in the source material and putting it to film is something that unlike other super hero blockbusters can only be achieved through a sense of cairlessnes from Director David Leitch and writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. This is due to the nature of the title character himself, the Deadpool that readers know from the comics doesn't care about studio rivalry, copyright infringement or timeline consistency. This is a character that says and does what he wants, when he wants and it's because of this that the Deadpool films have secured and maintained their own unique brand of humour that simply couldn't be achieved by any other character. Of course all humour is subjective though and one could make the argument that Deadpool 2 has an over reliance on pop culture references which is especially risky territory when it comes to comedy as anyone who is not as pop culturally aware as the common geek will be left wondering why everyone else in the theatre has tears of joy in their eyes while they're sat quietly wondering what the hell just happened. It's clear that the writers aren't going for mainstream appeal when they reference obscure 90's comic book trivia and why should they when this brand of humour worked so well in the first one? The plot keeps things simplistic and somewhat relatable, it's a semi unorthodox family tale with a revenge plot woven into it which is the motivation for Josh Brolin's mercenary from the future ""Cable"". The title character's emotional journey isn't anything we haven't seen before but it is a refreshing change of pace from the gorgeously gory action sequences we've all come to expect from this character. Deadpool's healing abilities are incorporated into the action in far more more interesting ways than what we've seen from Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"". There is no over use of shaky cam and the chase sequences are top notch and easy to follow. Overall ""Deadpool 2"" is a sequel that has an excellent blend of humour, action and emotion. It's certainly not something that will appeal to more traditional viewers who value immersion above all else but if that's what you're looking for then why would you even consider this film? 8/10"
"connorgoron","8","4","9","30 May 2018"," Better than the first. Very minor Issues
","I heavily enjoyed this movie, I found the story much more compelling. The story had some pacing issues through the middle with X-Force. It seemed only to serve as a cheap comedy act. <br/><br/>Some of the humor was misplaced as well as the 4th wall breaks."
"CinematicInceptions","8","4","9","30 May 2018"," Even DC isn't safe.
","When Disney bought 20th Century Fox a few months back, one of the first questions people had was what would become of Deadpool. Thankfully, nothing that brought the first movie to cult status was robbed from this sequel. I will admit that I was kind of disappointed by the first movie because of the hype surrounding it. But there was next to no disappointment in this sequel. Whereas the first movie had a surprising amount of dark and serious moments, there was almost no break from the comedy here. The fourth wall was broken a few scattered times in the first one; but now the fourth wall is basically non-existent. And no part of pop culture is safe from getting called out here, even those that seem like they should be protected by rights. References range from ""John Wick"" to ""Top Gun"" to ""Frozen"" to ""All the Money in the World"" to ""Batman v Superman"" and obviously Marvel. <br/><br/>A few familiar faces return, and several new ones come in. Whether they will be ones that come back for any more sequels is uncertain, but fans should be quite as entertained by the supporting cast as Deadpool himself. Several of them get chances to shine and some heroic moments, even from the ""powerless"" characters.<br/><br/>Though it is somewhat set apart from the rest of the X-Men universe, the plot becomes more deeply involved in the world of mutants. It doesn't get caught up so much in the cultural war between humans and mutants, but that constant force is undeniably present.<br/><br/>There was less heart to this one, which I didn't think was such a bad thing for a character like this. However, I was slightly annoyed by the way that all of Deadpool's emotions were used as nothing more than plot engines. It might have been okay if this had been called out, as so many other things are in this movie. But the fact that it wasn't called out makes me hope that any future installments lean more toward satire than drama. However, this shouldn't be a problem for most people since the first movie wasn't exactly bleeding with emotional drama either.<br/><br/>I do not anticipate that this will become any kind of landmark of cinema or even that big of a contender in the lower tier awards this awards season. But this was at the very least closer to what I hoped the first movie would be. If you hate superhero movies, I can tell you that this is free of many superhero movie tropes, but does retain a couple of them even as it pokes fun at them. Though it is just as crude and shameless as it is advertised, nobody who knows what they are getting into should be offended by the comedy. If you consider May to be Summer in movie terms, this is a great fun Summer movie. It's no ""best picture"", but it's good if you're looking for an excuse to take a break with some friends amid the final stretch of the school year or something to celebrate the end of it with."

"markj-02556","8","4","9","27 May 2018"," SO GOOD!!!!!
","In this film Deadpool puts together a team to protect a teenage mutant from the time travelling cyborg Cable.<br/><br/>This film is directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). It stars Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), Josh Brolin (No country for old men) and Julian Dennison (Hunt for the wilderpeople).<br/><br/>First of all, this film is so watchable, typing up this review right now, I just want to go a nd watch it again. Secondly, Leitch brings his considerable talents to the franchise and was such a good choice to direct, after Tim Miller left. Leitch adds these almost effortless one shot fight scenes, that I simply couldn't get enough of. This film is laugh out loud hilarious, even funnier than the first film in my opinion. Ryan Reynolds never lets me down with his performance. But to me Domino (Zazie Beetz) and Cable (Josh Brolin) are the stand out characters of this film. <br/><br/>However, the story is nonexistent, and the CGI, especially at the end was really noticeable. Yes, I know it was made on a lower budget than other superhero films. But if you think about it Deadpool 2 was made on a budget of about $110,000,000, that is at least twice as much as the original Deadpools budget and yet the CGI still looks the same even with twice the budget.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film is better than the original. I personally believe that the first Deadpool film is ok, but this film is great and a must watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This movie is the best film I've seen all year! I just have to type this review down right now because it's my 29th birthday today and this was the perfect way to celebrate it! This movie actually opens with Deadpool's girlfriend being killed. He then tries to become a member of the X-Men. There's this hilarious joke where he complains about the other X-Men not appearing. That was actually my favorite joke of his from the original film. We then see all the other X-Men in the next room quickly closing the door to stay out of the movie! <br/><br/>I remember loving the first movie, but thinking it was missing something. I just wish it had Deadpool reference Pinkie Pie. And guess what he does here?! He even winks at the audience probably referencing all the fan works the two of them appear in. I couldn't stop clapping in the theater! I think my only problem with the first movie was that there were some serious scenes that just weren't handled well and seemed out of place and this improves on that! <br/><br/>There's even this great scene at the end where he goes to Heaven to meet his girlfriend. Be sure to stay until the end credits, which feature him killing himself from ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and killing himself again (well, Ryan Reynolds) after getting the script to ""Green Lantern"". Cable is played by the same guy as Thanos from ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and he even does the same thing! He sets time back! It's a pure laugh riot from beginning to end with fantastic visuals, characters, and fight scenes. It's a film that must be watched to truly be appreciated. ****"

"GomezAddams666","8","4","9","20 May 2018"," The first movie was better.
","I will definitely start by saying that you might feel a change of tone from the first one, after all this movie is directed by David Leicht, one of the co-directors of the original John Wick film and as such he focuses on astounding action scenes more than comedy, that's not denying that there is plenty of comedy but if I'm being honest the jokes do not land as well as the first time around.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy is still pretty good and some of the jokes are very well crafted as a Deadpool film should be, but not all of them land as well, the humor feels a bit more forced in this sequel.<br/><br/>This doesn't make it a bad movie, tho. Deadpool 2 has great comic book elements and it makes some daring choices like giving Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) a same-sex partner, which does not feel like a gimmick but instead it feels very organic to the plot and I immensely commend them for it. Yet it is my opinion that Negasonic, Colossus, Domino and even Cable are not as well utilized as they should be. Ryan Reynolds is amazing as ever but they have decided to add amazing secondary characters without giving them much to do, the first movie was groundbreaking and I feel this one wasn't as good.<br/><br/>I feel that there's not enough effort into making it such a great film as the first one was, which is a pity because a Deadpool movie should be more than just a novelty, it should be a cinematic event.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, I still will rate this an 8 out of 10 because some choices they made including some cameos and the after credit scenes that make this film worth it. I simply expect better the next time around."

","EPIC!!!! Absolutely Hilarious! Now that is how you make a sequel! Take notes Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilms! <br/><br/>What a Great movie! The first half movie is about as good as the first Deadpool movie then about half way through the movie they turn it up to Eleven and the movie really picks up steam and packs in the laughter and action. Deadpool, Cable, Domino and were all awesome and there are some great cameos as well. I was also very happy to see Dopinder, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus return. <br/><br/>Also, I won't say who, but there is pretty well known and powerful X-Men villain that makes a prominent appearance in the movie. The overall story was good and the actors were all brilliant in their parts. The music, comedic timing and special effects were all top notch just like the previous film. I can't wait to go back and see it again and I'm really looking forward to next installment in the Deadpool franchise.<br/><br/>Lastly, I got to say the post credit scenes were amazing and probably the best post credits I have seen, so I advise you stay in your seats and watch them."

 Finally Deadpool shotted and he dies.and cable's time travelling machine saves him.after all the mid-credit scenes are the great ones of the movie.Deadpool time travel to the past where the Wolverine and first Deadpool character had a fight in Wolverine:the Origins.and this Deadpool kills the older one.and finally he went to the ryan renold's mention where the ryan reading a script with a big excitement.and Deadpool came and shotted him to the head.and the script is the ""Green Lantern"".ha ha that's so funnier.
 So this is a really good movie to have a big entertainment.Marvel works are so great.and hail Marvel!!!"
"Prashast_Singh","10","4","9","18 May 2018"," Deadpool outdoes his first coming, and this time, he DOES feel like a superhero!
","DEADPOOL was an awesome superhero film which opened an undisclosed chapter for R-rated superhero cinema. It did that so masterfully that upon watching it, I became an instant fan of DEADPOOL. I was very excited when I came to hear of DEADPOOL 2 and since the trailer excited me even more, I decided to watch it in theatre. It's also the first time I've seen an A rated film in theatre. But I'm already above 18, and thus it's not a problem.<br/><br/>DEADPOOL 2 is just mindblowing and even outdoes the prequel at times. Although DEADPOOL had its own classic moments worth remembering forever, DEADPOOL 2 blends action, comedy and even some drama to deliver a perfect and even better R-rated summer blockbuster. I was quite surprised but also very happy to find that the Indian Censor Board didn't make any major cuts (which it made in the prequel) and most of the cuss words and gory action sequences are retained. I was very happy to get DEADPOOL in his nearly full, uncut form. <br/><br/>The action in DEADPOOL is excellent, wonderful, spectacular and ""Marvel""lous. Each and every action sequence works, especially the final block. The visual effects are quite top notch and the visual quality of the film is a reason enough to experience it in IMAX. Even though it wasn't in 3D, I really loved the IMAX experience. Another great thing is that this time there is nothing much of the R-level except the violence and language. That, somewhat made me happy too.<br/><br/>The film comes with a lot of crowdpleasing moments as well. The comedy in the film is totally effective and works in every single way. Right from the very first scene to the last, the film makes sure you laugh out loud. The very last scene had the entire audience laughing out loud. Plus, this time it's hard to call DEADPOOL as an antihero. He does feel bigger and a better superhero than ever before, this time.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds is one of the biggest reasons why each and everything works so smoothly. To play a character of this kind balancing both its violent and funny alter egos is not that easy. He has done it with extreme sincerity. Josh Brolin is super impressive as Cable after playing Thanos brilliantly in the awesome and mindblowing INFINITY WAR. Zazie Beetz impresses as Domino, while the rest of the actors including Brianna Hildebrand, Julian Dennison, Morena Baccarin, and the ever-lovable Karan Soni do a splendid job.<br/><br/>To say that DEADPOOL 2 is just an entertainer would be an understatement. It makes sure you remember it even after you've left your seat, and also in a way succeeds to put the thought of collecting it upon digital release, in your mind as well. It's the best superhero film of the year after INFINITY WAR.<br/><br/>[P.S. To all the Indian audiences, please watch the film in English for the best and most original experience.]"
"YacineAlaya","10","4","9","16 May 2018"," The first movie is nothing compared to this one
","OH MY GOD. I just watched the movie a few hours ago, and i'm literally amazed and stunned by the beauty of this masterpiece, beautifully written and directed. Deadpool is one of the few movies that can deliver a better second sequel than the original. Packed with action, funnier than ever, i couldn't stop laughing during the whole movie, jokes were on point, nothing felt forced, there are a lot of surprises, so many unexpected events. Ryan is definetely was born to play this role, and now this may seems crazy, but for me, Deadpool is so much better than Infinity War, you can call me crazy, but the moment you walk into the theater to watch this movie, you'll know what i'm exactly talking about."

","I'm a regular movie geek, i see reviews before seeing movies but i made exception about this since i liked the first Deadpool and i was hyped like many other people about deadpool 2. I know this is an unpopular opinion but this sequel is better than the original in every way {action, storytelling, acting...etc}. It's not perfect, the first third of the movie is a bit slow but necessary to set the background of the story, and for the jokes, the whole movie is filled with them but some of them are pop culture related, that means if you understand them then it's a bonus, if not you'll just have to miss them. I won't unfold the plot because it requires a spoiler but i what i can say is that it's not what you think of it from the trailer, it's better and it may be even a twist for some. This movie is a must watch for marvel fans and superhero lovers alike, so...what are you waiting for? someone is taking your ticket while you reading this whoever you are."

","This movie is the latest Marvel offering in the newish Comic Book Comedy genre. I prefer my super hero movies to be a little more on the serious side but with the success of the GOTG movies who can argue? <br/><br/>I admit I loved the GOTG movies. The difference between deadpool and those movies is that GOTG had better stories and the jokes were less gratuitous. GOTG uses humor in a much more intelligent way. Deadpool 2 opens up the joke spigot and sprays the audience mercilously for 2 full hours. Another difference is that the GOTG writers don't see the need to use the F word twice in every sentence. That grates on you after two hours.<br/><br/>I must admit the opening credits were funny. The parachute scene was also entertaining. The rest just felt forced and inorganic. <br/><br/>In short, Deadpool 2 tries WAY too hard to be funny. Next time they should use a new team and go for a better mix of drama, action and yes, comedy."
"kukikid","5","3","6","31 May 2018"," Running on fumes
","I truly love the 1st movie. It's not perfect, but it's very funny and enjoyable. The 2nd movie has its funny moments and there are even some sensitive moments. The movie is far from terrible and definitely not great. I just wasn't into it much. To me, it felt thrown together just for the sake of having a sequel. Felt pointless. The jokes and frequent references grew old too fast. For me, the movie just doesn't appeal. I don't advise others against seeing it, though. My tastes and preferences are mine and no one else's. Others may thoroughly enjoy it. If you're a fan of Deadpool or just seek pure escapism, then go see it. You may or may not love it. <br/><br/>And that's my attempt at a review. I'm no Roger Ebert."

Sequel to the wildly successful original. However it's not as good. A LOT of the jokes are carried over from the original and they aren't funnier the second time around. Also at almost two hours it's too long. On the plus side the acting is good and Brolin clearly enjoys playing Cable. Lots of action and violence too. So--it's up to you if you want to see it."
"Tehmeh","6","3","6","25 May 2018"," Expected horrible, was OK instead.
","It's hard to follow a movie like Deadpool. The first movie wasn't a franchise film, it was clearly made with enthusiasm, and they had to fight the studio in order to make it. Deadpool 2 however is a big-budget sequel, a studio movie trying to follow the surprise success of the first one. The original director left the project, there were rumors of reshoots, and it felt like Deadpool 2 was becoming a parody of what the main character used to joke about.<br/><br/>Not quite. This sequel is very entertaining. It's uneven, not on par with the first one, but it doesn't feel as calculated and soulless as I thought it would be. I'm as grumpy and cynical as they come, and even I giggled here and there. <br/><br/>The main elements are there: Ryan Reynolds does his thing well, some jokes land, plenty of action, plenty of silliness and decent amount of blood too. There are some repeat gags from the first one, I don't know how I feel about them. <br/><br/>The main issue with Deadpool 2 is that it struggles to hold on to what it is, and it often comes off as pretentious, especially when it was fiddling with some more serious themes or trying to tug our heart-strings. I witnessed some absolutely horrible lines from Ryan Reynolds, talking to a child character, about how much he cares about him. It happened two times. It was not a joke. The movie was trying to sell me the idea that Deadpool would care about some annoying kid. It was played straight, and it was like some horrible soap opera. The writing and execution was just horribly off for a movie like this. If anything, these kind of scenes with cheap, tacky emotional manipulation - especially concerning child characters - are what Deadpool should joke about, because we've seen it so many times, and it's almost always horrible and dishonest. In these scenes, Deadpool became a soulless movie for test audiences and focus groups, nothing else.<br/><br/>Luckily, most of the time the movie works. It's not very smart, but it's coherent enough if you're willing to go along with the pace, and it's full of entertaining moments. Moments are what keeps this movie alive: it's never what the movie is focusing on, that alone will never do, but there are so many little touches here and there, in the foreground or in the background that kept me entertained. <br/><br/>It seems like there were plenty of reshoots, or then they just didn't know how to use money, because some of the CGI shots looked unfinished. The action itself was alright, not anything great like in John Wick (same director, or one of them) which is a damn shame, but at least serviceable and well enough shot/framed. I consider most action movies with a lot of CGI to have boring action, so take from that what you will.<br/><br/>To summarize, Deadpool 2, at times, feels like a mandatory focus-tested studio movie without much heart. The forced drama between Deadpool and the kid is absolutely horrible in how tone-deaf and pretentious it is, and the structure holds together just barely, but in the end it was a lot more enjoyable than it had any right to be. I cannot fathom how they'll do another one without the ""series"" really becoming a parody of what Deadpool should be parodying. If more sequels come, I really hope that there is more serious inspiration and drive from the creators' part, and less about trying to please every damn focus group in the universe. This time though, the experience was still positive."

The story rolls along without any dead spots. Josh Brolin is superb as Cable but all the supporting cast are excellent and they all get some good lines.<br/><br/>The star of the show though is Ryan Reynolds, and wow, he just dials it up to 11. The one liners and asides are punchier, filthier and funnier. Several times we wished we had a pause button because the whole cinema was laughing so loudly and for so long at a line that we missed the next 3. <br/><br/>Coming out afterwards our party and the people around us were buzzing, and all the talk was about how fantastic it was. <br/><br/>how to sum it up?

"ayoreinf","9","3","6","22 May 2018"," Clever script turns the breaking of the fourth wall into a story
","Lets go back to the 1st Deadpool. What we had there was lots of fun, lots of wit, but actually very little story development. I still liked it a lot, but it felt like the script writers were given a new toy - lets imagin the famous 4th wall is broken to smithereens and see what happens. And they loved this broken 4th wall toy so much all else became insignificant. But since Ryan Reynolds has tons of charisma, and Morena Baccarin isn't short on the stuff too, it worked.<br/><br/>We could say this is mostly true of the sequel, but it's done in a much more deliberate manner. It's as if the kids learned how to play with this toy. So despite of the fact that we rarely come across any real character in this movie. That is, we do see many cartoons passing by on the screen, most of them don't really matter, at least not in Deadpool's mind, and since the entire story is being told through his eyes we only see them as cartoons, even if Colossus gets a fair amount of screen time, he never grows into a fully developed character, others don't even get that much, passing as another short gag in the script. In fact only the talent of Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz creates a character where very little character is really written for them. And still it works. And it works better than it did in the original installment. Because it's done thoughtfully, it shows what one can do with complete creative freedom if one keeps his sense of boundries and limitations, and understands the nature of the media.<br/><br/>I only wish the writers of Avengers Infinity War had half the sense of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who wrote this with Ryan Reynolds. It would've made it into a much better movie too."
"SeshMesh","10","3","6","22 May 2018"," I loved this movie!
","I really enjoyed this movie. When I went to watch it I laughed like crazy, couldn't stop thinking about it and went to see it again next morning. Though I loved first one more than sequel. Even though I liked it more than Deadpool 2 this had more queerness, diversity and gore which was delight to see. I really loved the whole ""screw you"" attitude in this.<br/><br/>All the gay moments made me so happy and the fact how pansexual Wade was was what I hoped for this sequel and I didn't get disappointed. Also Negasonic's girlfriend was so cute and she was introduced so well. They didn't make it a big deal and they weren't too smushy or glamoured. The relationship between two lovers was normal and that was pretty much it. All we needed to see.<br/><br/>Cable and Domino both were amazing characters. I liked the way Cable and Deadpool teased each other and how they worked together. I also loved how Domino and Deadpool supported each other and X-Force even tho it went to crap in seconds. It was especially funny how Cable copied mr. Pool's trash talk. And the mutual Thanos joke was spot on. Somehow Cable's ""he even runs like pervert"" comment was too funny for me and I loved it. Domino's care free way of being and her ability was hilarious and entertaining. I really liked the way they portrayed her and many other characters in this. Zazie Beetz did wonderful work in this.<br/><br/>Though this movie was a bit all over the place and the X-Force fiasco was bit unnecessary. Tho can't say it wasn't funny. Heck that's only thing that mildly bothered me.<br/><br/>Also let's not forget the amazing soundtracks and songs that were made to this. They were perfectly fitted into themes and mood of the said scene. I didn't like the X-Men arriving parts of the soundtrack, but it wasn't due them being bad and they actually were spot on in the scenes.<br/><br/>The reason I love whole Deadpool francise is cause it's not too serious and isn't afraid to be dark and dirty. Deadpool isn't pure or perfect, but still he's comfortable and confident as he is. I see alot myself in Deadpool and what I can't relate to is something i wanna learn to become. This movie hit my queer ass trash heart in just the right places and I've been in such and euphoria since I saw it. It's really weird how one movie can make one so gleefully happy."
"the-roofer","10","3","6","22 May 2018"," Epic
","Best Marvel movie so far. When's Deadpool 3 released?!!!"
"PyroSikTh","9","3","6","22 May 2018"," Completely Different and Just As Good
","The first film was a complete surprise hit, that somehow managed to be way better than even die-hard fanboys could have anticipated. Initially that gave me a great amount of excitement for the sequel, but in recent months the doubt of sequel syndrome has been creeping in. There's no way it could be better, not with a bigger budget, more convoluted story, and more characters. No way.<br/><br/>I'm glad that, to a degree, I was wrong. It's certainly not better than the original, even if just because the first film was so fresh and unexpected and changed the entire superhero game for Fox. But Deadpool 2 does at least match it's predecessor by upping the ante in the best ways and never taking it too far. The story is a little more complicated than the first film (which ultimately boiled down to three scenes), involving time travel, assembling a team, and the lack of a real villain. While both movie's stories are not exactly the paragon of originality, both the first film and its sequel wear their influences on their sleeves.<br/><br/>Of course this is one of Deadpool's trademarks, and Deadpool 2 is no different. It's extremely self-aware, not only of itself but also of its context in the genre and pop culture in general. In many ways, Deadpool 2 feels almost like Ready Player One - chock full of references, easter eggs, and inside jokes. The film opens with a music box of Wolverine impaled on a branch in reference to the end of Logan, the opening credits play out like a James Bond movie, complete with a melancholic ballad by Celine Dion, Deadpool refers to Josh Brolin's character as Thanos, and asks how many Sharknado movies there are in the future, a prisoner number is the same as Hugh Jackman's in Les Miserables, there's a running joke about Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire, and on and on and on. Not to mention sly cameos from Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and the majority of the X-Men: First Class cast. Oh god it's a treasure trove, and each and every one is played for comedic effect (unlike Ready Player One that used it all as world building).<br/><br/>Time (and multiple rewatches) will tell on this, but Deadpool 2 is also potentially funnier than the first. Its jokes feels so much more natural, and they come thick and fast. Many of them are referential so they do depend on a certain degree of audience knowledge, but otherwise it's still packed full of more straightforward jokes like Wade having legs the size of a toddlers, Deadpool failing to die repeatedly throughout the whole film, unexpected side-effects of a superhero landing, and so on and so forth. Of course the humour is certainly not for those weak of disposition, with plenty of more adult-orientated jokes dotted about the place as well.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the gore is also not advised for those of a weaker disposition. In fact there might even be a bit more gore this time. Deadpool's ability to resist fatal injury is played up as far as it can go, including blowing him up into little pieces, having him torn in half, and breaking his back falling from a great height, but there's also plenty of graphic stabbings, shootings, squashings and beheadings that don't hide the details.<br/><br/>One thing that Deadpool 2 definitely does better than the first film is action. The action sequences in Deadpool 2 are super stylish and super entertaining to watch. I guess this is the benefit of having David Leitch behind the cameras. The fight choreography is on point, managing to be gory and realistic, while also making the most of the superhero benefits. Cable is a complete and utter badass for instance, punching his weight about with such a strength and ferocity in stark contrast to Deadpool's more reckless style. MVP of the action scenes though is definitely Domino who just waltzes her way through as everything collapses around her. Her superpower of luck is portrayed unimaginably well by putting her in the middle of chaos that simply can't touch her, but falls afoul of everyone around her.<br/><br/>But what made the first Deadpool so strong wasn't the humour, the action, or its self-awareness (although they all played a big part in it of course). What really surprised everyone was how truly charming and emotional it was as a Romance. The relationship built up between Wade and Vanessa is so endearing, and his terminal diagnosis really stings the tear ducts hard. While Deadpool 2 never quite reaches the same zenith of emotional depth, it certainly makes a good attempt at it. Wade's depiction of grief is top notch for starters, but the whole plot of saving the future by saving a kid from himself can also hit pretty hard.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a completely different animal to the first film. It's no longer held back by being the risk it was, and now that the origin story is out the way, it makes the most of giving us a bigger plot that's a little more standard for a superhero movie, but nonetheless still great. It's a laugh a minute packed full of easter eggs, cameos, and fourth wall breaks, but doesn't forget its more heartfelt core that keeps it's characters relatable and sympathetic. Honestly, I could talk about this movie way more, but by that point you may as well just go and see it for yourself. I give Deadpool 2 a cautious 9/10."
"KieranSaosila","9","3","6","22 May 2018"," Bigger and better than it's predecessor.
","Going into Deadpool 2 I was very excited, yet tried to remain skeptical. The first film was a financial success and a massive hit with audiences, breaking all kinds of film records. Upon conclusion I was left wondering where else you could take the character of Deadpool, while also keeping up the humour and giving us a compelling story. If like me you had any of these worries then you can put your mind to rest, because this film is awesome.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 builds upon everything that worked in its predecessor, while adding new elements to the film that helps to not make it feel repetitive. It's everything the sequel should be. Now it's up to Wade to protect a young mutant boy Russell from the almighty force known as Cable, a cybernetic soldier from the distant future. Despite the sizeable roster of characters and amount of story to tell, everything feels well balanced and runs at a smooth pace. All characters are well performed and have fun chemistry with each other, which is especially important when it comes to the bond between Wade and Russell which I think was handled well.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds is once again hilarious in the role of Wade Wilson. Maintaining the perfect amount of jokes that reference the universe he exists in, and of course breaking the fourth wall. For me, majority of the jokes were well placed and very funny. Though some just didn't make me laugh, it's not that the jokes themselves were bad, they just didn't land right for me. If you aren't familiar with the bigger Marvel universes at both FOX and Disney, you may be scratching your head a little with some of the self aware references. The same can be said for non-comic book readers. All in all the film is still hilarious, though may single particular members of the audience out with certain gags.<br/><br/>Joining the likes of Deadpool are X-force. A team of individuals recruited by Wade, who possess special abilities that may be of use to him on his mission. After watching the trailers I couldn't wait to see how things play out with the team, and without giving anything away I can tell you I was very surprised with the result, but at the same time, so happy. One of the standouts of the team is a character named Domino, who bends the power of pure luck to her advantage. This is something I really loved as we've never seen a superpower like this before, there are so many ways you can play around with that and it was refreshing to see.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin kills it as Cable. He's fierce and determined, while also easy to sympathise with as we're given a backstory fitting to his character, and also a plausible motive. Cable's scenes with Deadpool are brilliant as their opposite and diverse personalities are used to bounce off each other. I only wish he got more screen time as I also do with Domino, though I understand the decision as a balance between the characters has to be sustained, and of course this is still Deadpool's movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences are big and epic as they should be for a superhero movie, and the visual effects are top notch. The use of music is used perfectly and sometimes comedically which is a nice touch. I definitely feel this film bears a lot more emotion than the first, which to me is a plus, it not only adds another layer to this movie but to the character of Deadpool himself. Again the use of balance is done well here as Wade is portrayed as a wisecracking mercenary, though is able to convey emotion and has something to fight for. Family and love are central theme which becomes evident throughout the story and especially when paying attention to the relationship between Wade and Vanessa which is played out nicely.<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed Deadpool 2 even more than the first film as it brings back all the good tropes of the first film and builds to it. It's hilarious and action packed yet remains light hearted at it's core. Don't be fooled though, it's deserving of it's R-rating for sure, and uses it to the best of it's ability! Go watch it."

I Saw This Movie 2 Nights Ago I Still Remember this movie it was great a lot fun, a lot laugh's a lot of it their is little up and downs but it goes back up but not saying this movie is not worth watching well it is. i would even say it's little bit better then first movie because in first movie in opening of action scene, action stars then shows back story, then action well doesn't do that in this movie, this is a lot of fun full on the action full on GORE, full on laughs in movie full of it. I Thought new characters like Cable / Nathan Summers from Future (Josh Brolin) A time-traveling cybernetic soldier He Did GREAT Job in this movie i thought he was great character great looks of character, he nailed his role i rather say his role is better then Thorns In Avengers Infinity War David Leitch i loved his idea of sort of classic buddy-cop fare"", and compared them to the characters portrayed by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, respectively, in 48 Hrs. (1982). i thought story and direction is great same director who did Atomic Blonde, he was also Uncredited director of first John Wick (2014), so was one of stunt man in a lot of action movies so he knows Action well then to any another directors like Tim Miller but Tim kinda slow down the action in first movie. but this a lot full on this is a lot fun keeps you watching you have another weird looking cameos like Brad Pitt Vanisher he is invisible man you won't able to see him, Matt Damon as Redneck #2 (as Dickie Greenleaf) , Terry Crews from Expendables 1-3, White Chicks, Gamer, Everyone Hates Chris as Bedlam was funny and great to have him in movie but the thing is most stupidest thing is to waste him off ? i wanted him to be in all movie it would be more funny to have him he suits for action and comedy, Bill Skarsgård as Zeitgeist not much to say I guess he had time to do IT playing clown and Mutant in sametime in different role, that was weird and random like out of nowhere just wasted them for nothing of their talented just used them for nothing. new characters Domino (Zazie Beetz) know for the Netflix anthology series Easy she is A mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate luck i thought she was ok character did good, Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison) did alright was bit annoying time and time but wasn't annoying to any another kid roles in another movies like X-MEN movies, As well as portraying Deadpool and himself in the film, Reynolds also provides the voice for Juggernaut. The character is credited as being voiced by ""himself"". Juggernaut was previously portrayed by Vinnie Jones in X-Men: The Last Stand. they could still hire Vinnie Jones to be Juggernaut back why not ? this is related to another X-MEN movies why don't they just hire back Vinnie Jones BACK in BIG SCREEN see him again as Juggernaut back to this ? i mean why they use Ryan to provide the voice for it when Vinnie Jones is still around making B-Movies when they could just hire him back as same character ? when their is nobody else it just doesn't make sense and it's stupid they get back Vinnie Jones from X-MEN Last Stand to be Juggernaut ? it sounds oblivious stupid. i thought Villain AGAIN sucked Headmaster (Eddie Marsan) who worked with David Leitch In Atomic Blonde, He is in Ray Donovan, Miami Vice (2006), he turns children into Mutants Russell Wants Revenge, i am ok that was not interesting, the thing story a little bit of it was confusing as well you want to know it but it doesn't explain it but it doesn't ruin movie badly, their are a lot funny moments in this movie a lot of it makes you laugh even more and more
it's very entering, the action was a lot of fun, Josh Brolin kicking ass playing more bad ass then to Thorns in Avengers. action opening and soundtrack fits in perfectly i loved opening scene slaright away of Action and gore and laugh's slaright away that was great ! but it doesn't slow down like in first movie action story then back to scene witch i thought that was annoying but it doesn't do that in this movie.<br/><br/>and yes i didn't forget beautiful Brazilian chick from TV series of V for Vanessa
(Morena Baccarin) was not much in movie she was more in first movie but thank god movie at end it saved it not ruined as bad as what it is, when you watch movie you will understand what i mean, it's bit weird but hey it's movie you will get to point towards end of it. movie had a lot crossovers a lot it from X-MEN movies it's great sequel but not my favorite movie of franchise Just yet i am waiting for rest of another DEADPOOL movies Sequels DON'T EVER LEAVE THEATER OR TURN OFF MOVIE AT IN A MID-CREDITS SEQUENCE ,ENDING SCENE IT WILL EXPLAIN END OF MOVIE EVEN MORE PLEASE DON'T MISS THAT OUT IT WILL EXPLAIN MORE AND MORE. for me this movie 9.10 it's worth of your time, it's worth for money, it's worth to see this sequel if you loved first movie to death or fan of X-MEN movies, i enjoyed it i am into dark RATED Comic Book movies for this was right one for me to see.... everyone go and see it."
"pensacolacomputer","10","3","6","21 May 2018"," Better than the first
","I haven't laughed so hard in a long, long time. First and foremost, this movie is HILARIOUS. It has laughter, great action, sweet romance all rolled up together. If you have not seen it, stop what you are doing right now, AND GO SEE IT NOW. <br/><br/>Please continue making more movies like this for ADULTS. People are getting sick of all these kid movies all the time. And while you're at it, how about a rated R Jurassic Park? One can only dream. <br/><br/>I don't own a single movie, but I WILL BE BUYING THIS ONE when it comes out. THANK YOU Ryan Reynolds, this movie was awesome!!!! <br/><br/>Oh by the way, stay til after the credits, the ending is HILARIOUS!"
"richarwrt","9","3","6","21 May 2018"," Better than the previous one
","This movie really has the essence of the Deadpool character, scepticism and full of references, 4th wall breaking and comedy with Ryan Reynolds doing his part at the credits, maybe with some little argumental arc issues but it isn't noticed at all"
"mike-271-389903","10","3","6","20 May 2018"," Equal if not BETTER than the first!
","Just watched last night. Lately I've been waking away from movies wondering if I really enjoyed the movie. After Deadpool 2, I didn't want to leave the theater! I want to go see it again already. It was a master piece. No idea why some of these bad reviews are rolling in. I was worried I wouldn't like as much as the first, but so glad they killed it with this one!"
"realmuthaf","9","3","6","20 May 2018"," A sequel as it should be
","Finally, after all the underwhelming repetitive single-use superhero flicks Deadpool returns to save the day.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is the exemplary sequel - it just takes all the original's ingredients and carefully improves upon them.<br/><br/>The first movie felt a bit confined with just a couple of locations due to its low budget - this one feels like a proper blockbuster. The first had modest action - here the amount, scale and choreography (thanks to director Devit Leitch) of fight scenes is heightened noticeably. The situation with jokes here is on par with the original - there are a lot of them, some don't work, but many do and the overall impression is very much favorable, there are plenty of laughs to be had here. The sheer number of characters involved is also increased, which does leave some with little screen time, like Negasonic Warhead.<br/><br/>Had it not been for the stretched-out ending and a few story hiccups, this might've even been a 10/10 contender. While WB keep wasting their comic universe's potential and Disney keeps spitting out generic junk of descending quality, Deadpool 2 manages to be as good as its predecessor and set directly set things up for sequels. And I say, keep them coming."
"muvbuff-45737","10","3","6","20 May 2018"," One of the funniest movies i've seen
","Not only does Deadpool 2 up the action, it ups the fun and the humor as well as the emotion. Great acting, action, jokes, direction, and production all around. Go see it!"
"donancricchiasaverio","10","3","6","20 May 2018"," What a great movie
","One thing I have to echo is the Deadpool movies feel quick and to the point. As much as I love the other Marvel movies, those 2 hour plus movies, feel 2 hours plus. The Deadpool flicks, I know are slightly shorter, keep you entertained every minute of the movie and inspires to watch over and over again. Deadpool 2 offers the same. It's a fun great flick and Ryan Reynolds proves he is the franchise. Loved it"
"The-Sarkologist","9","3","6","20 May 2018"," Lives up to expectations
","There are these movies that when you walk out of the cinema you simply wonder whether anything is able to top it. Well, this happens to be one of those films. Okay, I wasn't breaking my sides all the way through, but since I knew what to expect having seen the first film, I have to admit that I was quite impressed. While this is a superhero movie, it is actually more of a comedy, and in a way it is quite a spoof of many of the other superhero movies as well.
 You see, Deadpool really doesn't take itself too seriously, even though they do drop hints that it is actually a part of the extended X-men universe (even though the time lines have changed dramatically, but sometimes that is just a few mistakes). However, Deadpool takes this too the extreme, and even goes as far as 'cleaning up the timelines' at the end. In fact, this movie is so crazy we even have Deadpool autograph a box of cereal half way through.
 So, Deadpool has found his sweetspot, and the film opens up with him travelling all over the world cleaning up everybody's mess (though I do wonder how he manages to get his swords through customs, though once again we really can't take this film too seriously). However, things do get out of hand, and he ends up losing big time, which is why the film opens with him lying on a number of cans full of gasoline. Of course, this is Deadpool, so he does have this annoying habit of regenerating.
 Anyway, in comes Cable, a cyborg from the future, who is attempting to track down a mutant that was responsible for the death of his wife and child. Deadpool has already been caught up in this mess, since he found himself as a member of the X-men (trainee), and was arrested when he attacked a nurse at a school for demutating mutants. So, the film ends up being one of those films where he has to get to his ward before anything nasty happens to him.
 As I mentioned, this film certainly doesn't take itself seriously at all, though it did get somewhat annoying during the time he was at Xavier's School for the Gifted (actually, there is a Xavier's college in Melbourne, and apparently the students believe themselves to be pretty gifted), because unfortunately the jokes do get a little annoying at times. I guess this is a problem with these types of films since they can go so overboard at times that the jokes are just plain annoying. Still, Deadpool 2 is a pretty awesome ride, and certainly lives up to expectations."
"robert-duda","9","3","6","19 May 2018"," Fresh yet familiar
","This was a great movie. The jokes were fresh, yet familiar to the first one. Josh Brolin was excellent. I'm glad we got to see more Dopinder. I thought it was a good story that would even be seen in the comics. I laughed during the first half of the movie, non-stop laughter during the second half."
"vengeance20","9","3","6","19 May 2018"," That's just lazy writing!
","Finally got round to watching this film after much talk since the original!<br/><br/>So without spoiling too much I must say this sequel was all I hoped it would be... ACE!!<br/><br/>The twisted humour, the action, the jokes all done to perfection!<br/><br/>There's a few sad moments in this film also but definitely outweighed by the happy ones also!<br/><br/>The characters are awesome & the story-line is good!<br/><br/>Overall, just as epic as the first Deadpool! 9/10 <br/><br/>Roll on Deadpool 3!"
"thesar-2","8","3","6","19 May 2018"," Wait. We Still Have Cable in the Future?
","Usually I save this to the end, but just like the two Deadpool movies, we must operate all over the timeline: DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS; THERE IS NOTHING THERE.<br/><br/>Now, the beginning of the end credits, absolutely. In fact, you MUST see those final scenes as the credits just begin as they (kinda 2) are thee best end credits scenes in any marvel movie EVER. They were absolutely the icing on the already best cake a Deadpool follow-up could've been. <br/><br/>Admittedly, I was worried this would suffer from sequelitis and almost didn't see it despite loving the first one wholeheartedly. Mercifully, I woke up in enough time to catch a Dolby® screening and let me say this: Not as great as the original, but pretty damn close and extremely worth seeing.<br/><br/>(Even) better soundtrack, absolutely hilarious jokes, inventive new ideas on the original's setup and excellent use of each character and their individual features are just a few of the many positives here. I was rolling in laughter for a grand majority and in awe on how they began with the same thread as the original and broke off with clever writing and directions - totally expanded the singular R-Rated Deadpool universe as if this was his own Avenger movie.<br/><br/>Deadpool's on top of the world, or at least all-around it, with fighting ""worse bad guys"" with more maximum effort and maintaining his love life until tragedy strikes sending him on a journey of self-discovery, love and family. F that. It's just a fun kick-A adventure. <br/><br/>The one thing that irked me though, was the pacing and length. Several scenes went on far too long even though some of those were meant for comedy and others were just poor choices. And you will feel every one of those 119 minutes. It's almost as if they felt this would bomb and they could never make another Deadpool movie. Hogwash. Of course, there'll be a third, fourth, etc. <br/><br/>Can't wait to see this again and with the (now) knowledge that the movie feels too long at times, I'll probably enjoy it tons more the second time. There is so much in here to love and so many jokes I *know* I missed. Heck, I re-watched the original last night for the xxx'th time and caught one hilarious joke I must've missed the many times I've seen it before.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTE recommendation. Really need to see the first one, but...nope, you must see the first one. But, hey, I gave that one 4½/5 stars so you really can't go wrong.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: While I began with the warning not to stay to the very end credits as there's nothing there, I will say the music choices all the way to the very end were worth it. I already loved the soundtrack, but it actually improved with the songs they played while the credits rolled."
"neobateman","8","3","6","19 May 2018"," A self aware spectacle.
","After the massive success of the first Deadpool film, it was inevitable that a sequel would be produced. This time the merc with a mouth (Ryan Reynolds) has to protect a little boy (Julian Dennison) from the time travelling assassin Cable (Josh Brolin, in his second appearance in a superhero blockbuster). This is about as much I will say about Deadpool 2 story wise because there many twists and turns that I didn't expect, especially from a Deadpool movie. I am going to be honest, I did enjoy the first film, I didn't love it though, there were a few moments where the characters annoyed me. The action in the first film also didn't impress me, bad cgi fights. However they improve on almost every aspect when it comes to the sequel. This time they switched directors, from Tim Miller (who will helm the new Terminator reboot) to David Leitch (John Wick and Atomic Blonde). Leitch is one of the best directors when it comes to shooting action sequences, and he shows of his brilliant skills a lot in the new Deadpool film. There a long shots that show off the very well choreographed fight scenes. This gives the film a sense of wonderment in a way of 'how does he do it?' but also realism. I was genuinely surprised that this film had me as involved as it did, especially because the first film did not always work for me. This is a genuinely interesting film, with a very cliched story pulled of in a non cliche way. The film is also incredibly funny, this film throws a lot of jokes at you, making fun of the MCU, the DC universe and even itself. Not all of the jokes work, but when you laugh for minutes straight, you won't notice that a few didn't. However there were some genuine moments where I got invested into the story, in particular Josh Brolin as Cable. His story makes sense and his motivation does, however there are some interesting twists and turns his character goes through. Not all of it was well written though, it seemed like that characters were presented a certain way and were deliberately changed to simply shock the audience. Sometimes this works when the audience gets an idea of who the character is, however in this film I felt that these changes felt too artificial, particularly singling out Russell, played by Julian Dennison. There is nothing wrong with his performance, he brings a lot of emotion and laughter to his character, however the sudden switch did not always work. Same thing can also be said about Cable. Reynolds and Brolin are truly the stars of the film, Reynolds brings his charisma and charm to Deadpool, whilst Brolin plays the straight man thrown into such a ridiculous situation. Overall I am probably in the minority as I believe that Deadpool 2 is a superior film to the first, it has a more compelling story with a more likeable protagonist. There is a more organic and interesting story that does have some emotional scenes, however it also delivers on what makes Deadpool so special."
"telecomtech78","10","3","6","19 May 2018"," What a birthday treat!!
","Went in expecting some formulaic story, but in turn, was pleasantly surprise with where the plot went. As twisted and warped as Deadpool is, and not too sound cheesy, he has a heart. This movie was entertaining, fun, wacky, and left you feeling satisfied. 10 our of 10 stars from me."
"trinaboice","8","3","6","19 May 2018"," Bigger, but better?
","B+<br/><br/>Rating: R, 119 minutes<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: Marvel is on a roll. The X-Force team assembles under the guidance of the most disrespectful, irreverent superhero ever, Deadpool, played expertly by Ryan Reynolds.<br/><br/>As Ryan Reynolds says in the movie, ""The Academy's watching."" The sequel is definitely bigger....is it better than the first? Umm....probably not. Did it make me laugh? Definitely. <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Tips for parents: 
Deadpool says in the beginning, ""Believe it or not, Deadpool 2 is a family movie."" Nope. Not true. This is a true rated R movie. If you set filters on VidAngel to delete profanity, violence and gore, this would be a 20 minute movie. 
Crude language and TONS of F-bombs. I hate it when kids swear especially, which Julian Dennison does as Russell.
Scoutmaster pervert joke. Ouch. I have 4 sons.
Lots of severed limbs and brutal, gory deaths.
Lesbians
You see a bottomless little kid's junk full Winnie the Pooh style and a man's naked rear end.
Super high body count, destruction, violence, crude gestures.
Guns.
Some fun music, but other songs with very crude lyrics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uplifting theme: 
""We all need that sense of belonging. We all need a genuine sense of home."" - Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds)
""Kids - they give us a chance to be better than we are...better than we use to be."" - Vanessa (the beautiful Morena Baccarin) 
Family
Sacrifice for others
""Pain teaches us who we are."" - Blind Al (Leslie Uggams)
""No child is hopeless."" - Blind Al<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Things I liked:
The trailer was hilarious. I loved the crack about Superman's mustache in the trailer, referring to when DC had to use CGI to remove Henry Cavill's mustache in the movie Justice League. 
I got a kick out of the opening credits. Most of the time, we just ignore them, but read them this time!
This is the year of Josh Brolin as the evil villain. He voices a fantastic Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War
Great action sequences. As Deadpool says, ""Big CGI fight coming up."" Yep, LOTS of them.
Tons of fun jokes and visual gags, all lightning fast. You'll have to see the movie again in order to catch everything.
We learn a lot more about Wade Wilson, making his character development more deep and grounded.
You're going to get a kick out of some new twists.
Keep watching after the credits for a couple more fun scenes, but there's nothing at the very, very end of the music.
The Logan music box in the very beginning scene got the audience I sat with to immediately start laughing. There is a running gag about Logan during the entire movie. So funny. For example, both films played the same music during the death scenes. Ha ha
Tony Robbins. Love that guy.
Wade and his girlfriend watch the movie Yentl I always loved that movie and the music. Deadpool points out that the song, ""Papa, can you hear me?"" is the same tune as Frozen's ""Do you want to build a snowman?"" I never noticed that!
X-Men - trainee! Ha ha
I like Dub Step too. Ha ha
Several Canadian jokes. A lot of locations in Vancouver were actually used in the movie. 
At the end of the movie, it says that 15,000 jobs were created to make the movie. The stunt work was amazing. Sadly a stunt woman, Joi Harris, died while filming one of the stunts on a motorcycle. Production stopped for two days.
Tons of fun Easter eggs. For example, Deadpool refers to Cable, played by Josh Brolin, as ""One Eyed Willy"", which was a character in the 1985 movie The Goonies which starred Josh Brolin.
Tons of movie, song, and pop culture references. One of the movie posters shows Deadpool in a Flashdance pose on a chair with bullets raining down on him. He definitely takes a beating in this film.
 <br/><br/>Things I didn't like:
This is the first Marvel film to NOT give Stan Lee a cameo performance! Drats! I always look forward to those little moments. Instead, you can see him in a quick picture montage. Definitely not as good.
Sometimes trailers are deceiving. In an earlier trailer for DEADPOOL 2, Deadpool says, ""Pump the hate brakes, Thanos,"" referencing Josh Brolin's role as Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, but in the actual movie, he's talking to two lesbians and he says, ""Pump the hate brakes, Fox and Friends.""
I don't read the comic books, but Domino's character and alliances are much different there than in this movie, as well as her color and eye circle. It certainly didn't bother me, but some fans might be annoyed. Zazie Beetz did a fantastic job.
SPOILER: Have you seen The Terminator? Yeah, that's this plot.<br/><br/>Funny lines:
""Forgive me for being late. I was busy gathering all the gluten in the world so it can not NOT hurt us."" - Deadpool
""That is why the man bun is just the Millennial mullet."" - Deadpool
""So dark. Are you sure you're not from the DC Universe?"" - Deadpool
""Mission accomplished?"" - Dopinder (Karan Soni)
""Well, in a George W. sort of way."" - Deadpool
""Every family film starts with a vicious murder...Bambi. Lion King. Saw 7."" - Deadpool
""It's time to get back on LinkedIn."" - Weasel (T.J. Miller)
Vanisher....ha ha IMDB shows his face listed as Brad Pitt! The studio actually wanted Brad Pitt to play Cable, but he had to decline that role due to scheduling conflicts.
""Never underestimate a man with a mustache."" - Deadpool
""I have no idea what's happening."" - Blind Al
""It's probably best."" - Deadpool<br/><br/>
Interesting lines:
""Family was always an F word for me."" - Deadpool
""You are not your father."" - Vanessa
""I fight for what's right."" - Deadpool"

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","3","6","19 May 2018"," Papa, Can you Hear Me?
","I did very much enjoy this film. Plenty of funny lines and moments. I loved all the different cameos and especially the after credit scenes. And surprisingly there was also a lot of heart and beauty in the film too. And Domino totally kicks ass and I can't wait to see more of her. Also, Im kind of hoping this film gets an oscar nom for the song ""Ashes"". That being said, I dont think it was perfect. One thing that kind of bugged me is they repeated the same trope where Deadpool starts off being in despair and he does ""Let me tell you how I got here"" trope. The CGI at times was also lacking. But those were my two big annoyances. Overall, it was a lot of fun and if you liked the first one I think you will like this one too."
"darryl-42069","9","3","6","19 May 2018"," 10 times bigger, with the same wit and charm we know and love
","It's rare to see a sequel that's bigger than the original, but retains the same wit and charm we love. Pacific Rim: Uprising, a movie that I'm excited for, that's bigger than the original, ultimately failed to deliver expectations and was hated by fans and critics alike, so instinctively, I was excited but also cautious for Deadpool 2.<br/><br/>Thankfully, with the help of the director who killed John Wick's dog, Deadpool 2 manages to be the sequel that's not only 10 times bigger, but also retains the same wit and charm we all love.<br/><br/>Characters: 8/10
I just love Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. He's just perfect for that role. I liked Josh Brolin as Cable. He's really good in this movie. Morena Baccarin once again did a good job as Vanessa despite having way less screentime. Karan Soni who plays Dopinder is my favorite in this movie. He had a lot more to do, and I love his portrayal. Zazie Beetz did a good job as Domino despite the controversy. Julian Dennison also did a good job as the mutant kid Russell. The X-Force team, consists of Terry Crews, Lewis Tan, Pennywise, and Rob Delaney did a good job as well. Stefan Kapicic (sorry can't spell his name correctly since IMDB has these odd limitations) did a good job as Colossus. I liked how Colossus has a bigger role in this film. Brianna Hildebrand and Shioli Kutsuna did a good job as Negasonic and Yukio respectively, but unfortunately, they got sidelined for Colossus, Domino and Cable (which is a shame since Negasonic is one of the best things about Deadpool 1, and Yukio is a pretty interesting character, that didn't got much time to shine). T.J. Miller didn't had much to do as Weasel, he's just there. Lastly, Leslie Uggams did a good, but brief performance as the lovable Blind Al.<br/><br/>Action: 10/10
I mean, it's directed by the guy who made the first John Wick, and it's female version last year, so I don't think we need to talk a lot here. Long story short: It's fast, it's fluid, not much shakey cams, and good uses of wide shots.<br/><br/>CGI: 8/10
The CGI is good, but gotten bad sometimes. Overall, I could compare the CGI to Black Panther, where sometimes it looked good, and sometimes looked bad.<br/><br/>Music: 9/10
Tyler Bates nailed the score for this movie. The song has opera-like instrumentals which is more prominent at the end of the movie. Songs such as A-ha's Take on Me, Skrillex's Bangarang (I think that's the title), and Celine Dion's new song Ashes just makes the movie even better. Oh, and the Deadpool rap from Teamheadkick is back too, which is the icing on the cake. Seriously, Ashes should won best OST at next year's Oscars.<br/><br/>Story: 8/10
The story is a lot more complicated than the last movie, but didn't get too complicated. Basic plotline involves Deadpool trying to protect a mutant kid from being assasinated by Cable. They did a good job balancing comedy and action, although the comedy got a bit too much. Surprisingly, there's an pretty emotional scene at the end of the movie, and I'll be honest, I never thought I got a bit teared up in an R-rated movie staring... A clown in a red mask.<br/><br/>Comedy: 7/10
The comedy is there, but this time some jokes got a bit stale and doesn't land. But there are moments where I can't stop laughing because how absurd it is. Overall, it's a pretty funny movie, but probably not as much as the first one.<br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 is a rare case where it's sequel is as good as it's predecessor. David Leitch and team nailed what makes the first Deadpool loved and acclaimed by many fans and critics alike, and made a fun and entertaining movie. Though not as funny as before, it still embodies the spirit of the original, and ultimately, it didn't disapoint.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8/10<br/><br/>Note: There's a lot of hidden cameos in this movie, so keep your eyes peeled :)"
"sydney-88760","9","3","6","19 May 2018"," Not sure what movie the haters saw...

I didn't notice the CGI, all I know is I sat in a theatre with people laughing out loud. <br/><br/>I didn't want to see a clone of the original and it wasn't, it was funnier, the addition of better characters and more froms some from the original. The only downside was the non appearance of Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Just sit back with a big tub of popcorn and enjoy it.<br/><br/>And don't forget to stay for the crazy credits, best ever."
"valeryvalk","10","3","6","19 May 2018"," Ofc it's not 10 out 10, but it's definitely the best 2018 so far
","We need more movies like this: r-rated, with Hollywood irony and dark humor. I feel like adults are being shoved aside by the big 6+ market of other superhero movies and Deadpool shines like true masterpiece among all of them. Please don't buy tickets to the Black Panther type of movies so we won't get more of them. Go for a 2nd run of Deadpool instead."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","6","19 May 2018"," Boundary-pushing humour + over-the-top action = another great Deadpool movie.
","""It feels bigger,"" runs the tagline for this potty-mouthed sequel. It's a cheeky double entendre that in fact holds very true; there's a massively increased budget ($110m compared to the first's $58m), an A-list co-star (Josh Brolin) to share the publicity burden, and an extra ten minutes on the runtime. But does bigger mean better? Not quite, but it's pretty bloody close. With extra cash to throw around and a director-swap seeing ex-stunts coordinator David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) take the helm, one thing is for sure: the action set pieces are more ambitious and accomplished. The bar is set high early on, the movie opening with a stylish killing-spree montage sequence boasting both an awesome Kill Bill homage and a sensational single-take bloodbath. From there we get a hard-hitting prison breakout (with Brolin's Cable stealing the show), a bonkers melee aboard a high-speed truck, and a finale featuring some slick close quarters combat; all sprinkled with some cartoonish ultra-violence befitting of a Deadpool outing. Adding lead star Ryan Reynolds to the screenwriting team - presumably to bolster the dialogue with his trademark attitude - the subversive fourth-wall breaking and offensive humour is in full swing once again. It doesn't land with the same did-that-just-happen impact of the original because this time it's expected; but a decrease in shock value doesn't lessen the amusement of witty pop culture references (the MCU features heavily) or blink-and-they'll-vanish celebrity cameos. And of course there's Deadpool himself. The charismatic Reynolds plays the Merc with the Mouth with unbridled smart-arse glee, clearly relishing every zinger and barb he gets to unleash. The supporting cast is a mixed bag though: Brolin and Zazie Beets shine as the badass Cable and the very lucky Domino respectively, but Kiwi jokester Julian Dennison fails to ignite as tormented teen Russell and returning cast members T.J. Miller and Morena Baccarin are under-utilised. A sequel that doubles down on its tongue-in-cheek tone, over-the-top action and savage humour, Deadpool 2 is an uproarious superhero ride that offers fans more of what they love."
"stevendbeard","9","3","6","19 May 2018"," Great Action & Laughs, But NOT For The Kids
","I saw ""Deadpool 2"", starring Ryan Reynolds-The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Amityville Horror_2005; Josh Brolin-Avengers:Infinity War, Men in Black 3; Morena Baccarin-Gotham_tv, Still Life_tv and Julian Dennison-Hunt For the Wilderpeople, Shopping.
This is the sequel to the 2016 Deadpool and they have already green lit a 3rd sequel. Ryan returns as Deadpool, ""The Merc with a Mouth"". And before I go any further, let me stress, this is not a kiddie super hero movie. Lots of language, violence, gore, body parts being dismembered, nudity, etc. This is an ""R"" rated movie-so don't take the little tykes to see it, because I saw parents with little ones in the theater I was in and it wasn't a pretty sight. Anyway, back to the movie. Josh plays Cable-comic fans know who his father is-a man from the future on a mission to kill Julian, a young mutant that will become a villain where Josh is from. Ryan befriends Julian in prison and tries to save him from the time-traveling Josh's wraith. Morena also returns as Ryan's beautiful girlfriend. The humor is great-lots of references to current events-and there are lots of cameos, including other heroes and actors in small parts-I remember seeing Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, one as a hero and one as a redneck. One person I did not see was Stan Lee! No cameo for him-maybe because of the R rating? But no, he was in the first Deadpool, so, what the heck? Oh well. There is a great scene, just as the end credits begin, involving time travel but there is nothing at the very end.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, gore, language, drug use, drinking and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","Hilarious, touching and irreverent, DP2 knocks it out of the park. So many laughs, so many feels, my favorite movie of the year. Actually manages to out do the original."
"bankofmarquis","8","3","6","18 May 2018"," More of the Same - and I'm just fine with that!
","Did you like the first Deadpool film? Was the humor right up your alley? Did you chuckle at the inappropriateness and the pop culture referential humor?<br/><br/>If you did, then you're gonna like DEADPOOL 2 - which pretty much gives your more of the same.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I wasn't laughing uproariously at the first 1/2 hour of Deadpool 2. I thought the filmmakers and Ryan Reynolds were trying just a bit too hard to capture the flavor and flair of the first film and so the jokes - whilst funny - gave me grins, but not guffaws. I was, if I'm honest with myself, beginning to get a little bored with the humor.<br/><br/>And then came the X-FORCE.<br/><br/>If memory serves, it was just about at the 1/2 hour mark when I had my first outloud guffaw in this theater going experience, and then the next one came just minutes later and then there was another one and another one and another one...<br/><br/>Credit for this must go to the writers of both Deadpool films - Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. They, wisely, decided to add the X FORCE into this film to take the burden of the humor of this film off of the back of Reynolds and spreads it out a bit to these characters.<br/><br/>Not that Reynolds needed the help. He is completely comfortable in Deadpool's skin and his natural charm shines through brightly and brings us a character that is one that we like vs. one that annoys us. Speaking of annoying, TJ Miller reprises his role as Deadpool's best pal, Weasel. I have stated earlier that I find Miller annoying. But...to be fair to him...he is not in this film. Maybe that is because he is not around all that much. <br/><br/>Also returning from the first film is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, Deadpool's girlfriend, Leslie Uggams as ""Blind Al"" and Karan Soni as Dopinder, the cab driver. It is a testament to this film that at the end, I wanted more of each of these characters (well...maybe not Weasel), but - especially - I really wanted to see more of Baccarin.<br/><br/>But I can't really complain because the ""Big Bad"" in this film, Josh Brolin, scores another triumph as CABLE. I won't give away too much about this character, but Brolin - much like his work as Thanos in INFINITY WAR - brings layers of humanity to his character and Cable is much more than just a ""Bad Guy bent on destroying things.""<br/><br/>As far as the X-Force. The less I say about them the better, but they are a highlight of this film. Terry Crews, Bill Skarsgard, a ""Mystery A List Actor"", Rob Delaney and, especially, Zazie Beetz are terrific as the band of misfits that Deadpool brings together to help battle Cable.<br/><br/>Also joining in - from the first film - are ""lesser"" X-Men Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapcic). It was good to see them - and to see this film answer the question about ""where are the other X-Men""?<br/><br/>Director David Leitch (ATOMIC BLONDE) keeps the action - and comedy - coming at a rip-roaring pace, not lingering on a joke or an action scene too long. Helming a nicely paced and nicely entertaining film.<br/><br/>As with all things Marvel, stay for the first 5 minutes of the credits for the ""extra scene"", it is well worth it. There is a humorous song at the end of the credits that is, quite frankly not really worth staying for.<br/><br/>I'm going to chalk up my experience with the first 1/2 hour of this film to me needing to get my mind on the right track for the type of movie that this is. Once I did that, I enjoyed myself quite nicely.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"foxcool","8","3","6","18 May 2018"," It's deadpool, but not as good as the first.
","The flow is all wrong and so is the plot and theme. It feels like it missed alot of what made the first movie great. <br/><br/>For the comedy part, a lot of the interactions like when Francis got away and deadpool cover his mouth in shock or the ""super hero landing"" scenes of the first movie are gone and replaced with one liners through out the whole movie in a one dimensional flow. <br/><br/>We know deadpool is a bit crazy but his craziness was always rational or at least something the audience can empathize with, a method to the madness if you will. In this movie, some of the plot makes no sense, like when deadpool recruit a guy with no powers. It's like the whole world has turned crazy, which is not what deadpool is about, he's about adding his crazy take on a normal world. <br/><br/>I'm extremely bias when it comes to this franchise since I really loved both the comic and the first movie, if I didn't, I would've rated this a 5/10. I can't help but think it would've been a much better movie had Tim Miller remains the director."
"quicksilverminecraft","10","3","6","18 May 2018"," Freaking Awesome!!!
","They done it, they actually done it. Deadpool 2 is even better than the first one!
I honestly thought nobody could make something as great as the first film but this is even better, with more action, iconic characters and jokes that will make you laugh for hours. Even if you don't take my opinion, the screening room I was in was packed with people laughing and giggling at what they were watching. 
going through the list i have nothing but positive things to say, great characters, great story. Even an awesome soundtrack of such memorable hits, hitting at the same entertainment of the nostalgic feel of hearing those songs as was done in Guardians of the Galaxy movies.
So a big well done to everyone helped in in way with this movie and to those looking for a recommendation i say go ahead and watch it, you'll have a great laugh."
"rebeccalucy","8","3","6","18 May 2018"," Really fun!
","Extremely fun and comedic all throughout, being a great update on the first. Ryan Reynolds brings so much into this role and it would not be the same without him. <br/><br/>Has some good cinematography, it is a bit more experimental than the other one. The jokes are well timed and keep up with the fast pace. However, the marketing seems to give far too much away in terms of jokes. Sometimes it goes a little over the top with the self-referential humour but that's expected for the character. <br/><br/>Also, it manages to break from the typical formula in a particular way which is quite good/unexpected. Definitely worth a watch for fans of the series."

","DP2 was funny, vulgar, and violent but part one still takes the cake for me. DP2 loses itself when it focuses on expanding the X-men universe with X-Force. Deadpool is not a team player and should stay that way. The humour doesnt always land but is still pretty funny. The best part of this film is Domino who brings something fresh to the Xmen universe. The worst part is Cable's robotic arm, it makes an annoying noise everytime it is moved throughout the movie(can someone please grease it up) but overall a good watch 8/10"

"umashankarpati1997","8","3","6","18 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 is a Riot.
","Directed by 'One of the Two Guys Who Killed John Wick's Dog,' the first 20 minutes of the film feature a good amount of gruesome but spectacular bloodbath as both Wick films combined. <br/><br/>Deadpool or Wade Wilson, is in the midst of slaying several crime syndicate bosses all around the world. However, his final battle, which takes place in his hometown, doesn't go according to plan. Distraught and beset by doubts, Deadpool joins Colossus from the X-Men and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Together, they aim to be a strong and ""good"" force. <br/><br/>However, this motivation dies out, when Deadpool goes on his first mission. In an attempt to protect a terrified and confused teenage mutant Russell, our red-suited hero makes an impulsive bloodthirsty decision, and this sets into motion events that catch the attention of the time-travelling mutant, Cable (Josh Brolin), a very angry, no-explanations-offered kind of man from the future. The three stage their fights at a lot of places, starting with a high-security prison with secrets of own. Cable is out to kill Russell, and Deadpool must summon mutants, that he proudly calls the X-Force, to stop him.<br/><br/>The new characters make fleeting impressions (there's a reason for that), but it's Domino or Lady Luck (Zazie Beetz), who shines through. That woman deserves a film of her own! Dopinder is back, played by Karan Soni, though his Indian caricature does get to you at times. Brolin as cable is spectacular.<br/><br/>The blind old lady Al, who is Deadpool's friend, tells him, ""You can't live if you don't die a little."" So Deadpool does die and big, in many, many scenes, and he does live and big, in many, many others. Reynolds shows he can be as charming doing both. The cameos are surprising. This is funny, has Meta jokes and also has a bit of emotional touch but it is not better than the first one though.
This is a must watch if you are a fan of the first part. Domino is magnificent. Hands down to the best post credit scene in the entire CBM history."

","I still love the highway sequence on the first and I gotta say DP2 doesn't top that.<br/><br/>But still its a great movie.<br/><br/>Its over the top, nonsense, illogical and downright ridiculous at times, but its DeadPoll so it kind of makes sense somehow.<br/><br/>The action is top notch, the references are great, and most of the jokes are good, some nice Cameos too.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like much is how the X-force is pretty much wasted. Specially with Terry Crews. The guy always take a piece of the pie in pretty much every film he is in, but here, he's mostly a Cameo and not really a good one.<br/><br/>Domino is AWESOME. She steals the show, she is in most of the best scenes (which is what I expected from Terry Crews)<br/><br/>Of the X-men that appear, only Collosus has significant screen time/action. I'll let it pass since its a DP movie and not another x-men/x-force movie.<br/><br/>There are a few jokes that I liked better on the trailers and a couple of scenes I wanted to see that didn't make the final cut.<br/><br/>BTW I don't think it deserves an R rating. There's very little sexual content and the violence is mostly funny. I don't see why a 10yo couldn't see this (acompanied by an adult of course)"
"neener3707","9","3","6","18 May 2018"," The Second Coming
","When the first Deadpool came out, I, like many people, was enamored with it and it was the first MCU film that I liked in at least 5 years. It was just such a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre, it was fun, silly, violent, and didn't take itself seriously like heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America. This sequel was more of the same but just a little more action, jokes, and hilarity. You've seen the trailer so you know what its about, and the story was just secondary, I came for the violence and jokes, and it darn well delivered. Its like the started where they left on the first one, the tone is exactly the same, this childish hilarity that we all loved so much. The action was cinematic just like the first one, and the up the violence a little so that was nice. This film, like the first, was a unique film in a sea of the same old trash."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","3","6","18 May 2018"," Fantastic Addition to the X-Men Canon.
","**Extra Spoiler Warning**<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is not just a great sequel to an already great film, it's also probably the truest X-Men adaptation since Days of Future Past (Logan is separate for me as that's a Wolverine centerpiece mostly); it's a stealthy ensemble film that captures everything which makes Deadpool a funny and memorable character to be around. This film also evokes the experience of reading the X-Men comics; at least for me it does, and that's something the earlier films respected, but never directly translated successfully for me (don't worry; I love the majority of the films, except Xmen-3, Wolverine Origins and Apocalypse). It's funny, violent and full-on meta in its Ryan Reynolds-related jokes ranging from Green Lantern to ACTUAL Ryan Reynolds being shot by Deadpool at the end of the movie (while holding the Green Lantern script).<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a cinematic blast that is a gorgeous expansion of the original film. This one can easily become a modern classic for the superhero age of cinema."
"JaikrishnaVS","9","3","6","18 May 2018"," A love story for the families, NOT.
","Deadpool 2 was one of the movies that we were waiting for since it was announced. We did manage to book tickets for the first day. It sure did deliver what it promised. It's an ode to the content of the script and comic timing of the actor that Ryan Reynolds is. There was not a single dull moment in the entire movie and yet it was not 'breath-taking' or 'out-of-the-world' by any means. The story line is hardly something to applaud but the dialogues and scenes make it interesting. I would go to the extent of saying that it is a movie spoof through and through and yet it is so original that you laugh till you cry ! Pssst..It has the best ever mid-credit scene of any marvel movie. <br/><br/>*** NO SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Deadpool dies or does he ?? Its not a spoiler if I leave it as a Open ended question ! Morena Baccarin should have had more screen time. But hey, it is not her movie - so I guess I cannot complain.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin (Nathan Summers / Cable), turned out to be nothing like Thanos. His backstory was inaptly handled and there definitely was no brooding sense of villainy surrounding him. He was the perfect 'deadpool-villain'. There were some other surprises as well with the cameo appearances from Brad Pitt and Hugh Jackman . Brad Pitt's appearance was a blink and you miss it one. Even though i saw the character, I failed to recognize him but my partner shouted out 'Brad Pitt'. <br/><br/>Zazie Beetz , rocked the role of Domino and kept on proving that luck is indeed a super power. Julian Dennison as Russell, the 'kid who must be saved' had some really goofy, off-the-charts moments with Deadpool. <br/><br/>Deadpool goes about making a mockery of everything under the sun including but not limited to DC, Batman, Marvel, Thanos, Green Lantern and Ryan Reynolds.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anybody who loved the first installment as it is more of the same. You can go in with head full of problems and come out with an clear head along with the satisfaction that you laughed your brains out to some of the wittiest dialogues delivered by some of the best in business.<br/><br/>Best Scene:<br/><br/>Someone: Who are you?<br/><br/>Deadpool: I am Batman!"
"madisonlboehm","9","3","6","18 May 2018"," The movie was so good, I can't decide which I like more, DP or DP2
","As a movie AND a sequel this one blew me out of the water. All the same things we love about that lovable asshole, Deadpool are present in DP 2. Ryan Reynolds played a hand at writing DP 2 and it shows. His razor sharp sarcastic sense of humor translate extremely well to the big screen. The movie manages to defy stereotypes while also making fun of them in a way that you cant help but to laugh. The problems with sequels is often the second movie is almost an exact duplicate of the first. The brilliance behind DP2 is they are able to build on the groundwork laid from the first movie while still providing a new and fresh film as well. Ryan Reynolds makes a lot of jokes not only at his expense but also in reference to the DC universe and other pop culture. Combined with all the bad ass action, the nonstop laughter and the newcomers who pull you in the moment they step foot on screen, this movie is a home run must see. 
The only reason I give this a 9/10 is because you have to be (vaguely) familiar with the Marvel Universe and pop culture references in order to understand some of the jokes. While I understood them, I know my parents, who would love this movie, the jokes would sail right over their heads which means they would spend the entire movie asking me questions which is why I don't watch movies with them anymore. But that's just me. If you and/or the person you go with are even a little bit familiar with Marvel, Ryan Reynolds and Henry Cavil's mustache, you will love it as much as I did. 
Do yourself a favor and get to a movie theater, you won't be sorry."
"mancinibrown","8","3","6","18 May 2018"," Review from someone who hated the first film
","To understand where I'm coming from, I disliked the first movie. I thought the jokes weren't funny, I thought the whole thing was juvenile, the action was too over the top to be enjoyable, just an overall dislike.<br/><br/>Going into Deadpool 2, I had worries about enjoying it. The first 15 minutes of the movie didn't do anything to dispel that. The humour was the same, the action was the same, it just wasn't my thing.<br/><br/>However, after that a few scenes started popping up that were well done. The acting was slower, more heartfelt, had some weight behind the scenes. I started caring about the characters (some, not all. TJ Miller is still TJ Miller). The action started clicking for me. The jokes started hitting. And I realized that I was enjoying this movie much more than the first.<br/><br/>Part of that credit goes to the new characters. Josh Brolin's Cable is menacing, but you care for him. Domino is a fun new character, with her (non) superpower.<br/><br/>There are still scenes which were too like the first movie for me, and I'm docking point for that. But, if you like that movie, feel free to consider this score 2 points higher."

","""Deadpool 2"" (R, 1:59) is a superhero action-adventure comedy, which is a sequel to 2016's boundary-shattering ""Deadpool"". This is the 11th of the X-Men films. Although Marvel Comics properties, neither the X-Men or Deadpool films are considered part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This one was written by returning scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, but this time with help from franchise star Ryan Reynolds. Version 2.0 has a different director, David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""John Wick""), after original director Tim Miller left the project due to ""mutual creative differences"" with Reynolds.<br/><br/>Much like the original, the sequel has plenty of sarcasm, inuendo, social political satire, meta humor, 4th wall breaking... and bloody violence. Fan favorite characters are back too! The titular ""merch with the mouth"" remains devoted to his one true love, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is still friends with his former roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), and continues to receive support from his best friend, Weasel (T.J. Miller), and favorite cab driver, Dopinder (Karan Soni), while still being frenemies with X-""Men"" Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). D2, however, has more heart, as Mr. Pool's capacity for love and self-sacrifice extend beyond his relationship with Vanessa and he begins playing nice with others... kind of. Well, some early narration does refer to this as ""a family movie"", so...<br/><br/>After a shocking tragedy early in the film (so early that the opening credits get all meta with it), Wade Wilson / Deadpool is acting darker than usual. Colossus and NTW take Wade to the X-Mansion and try to break him out of his funk by getting him involved in X-Men business. When they take him to a mutant rehab facility to try talking down an overweight mutant teen named Russell (Julian Dennison) who is threatening violence against the facility's manager (Eddie Marsan), the way Wade handles the situation drives a fresh wedge between him and the X-Men. Wade decides that Russell needs his protection (and that Wade himself needs to do some protecting), so he forms a paramilitary mutant group that he calls X-Force. This puts him, and new recruits like Domino (Zazie Beetz), Zeitgeist (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) and Bedlam (Terry Crews), up against a huge mutant called Juggernaut and a another known as Cable (Josh Brolin) who has come from the future for the sole purpose of killing Russell. Yeah, there's a lot going on here.<br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" would be a blockbuster if it were the first in the series, but can't quite match the original. Well how could it? 2016's ""Deadpool"" was a shock to the system, a real game changer. This one keeps in place the attitude and the actors which made the first one so popular and expands the title character's world to give us more to look at, but the sequel isn't as fresh and effortlessly entertaining as the original. D2 may be a little bit less slick than its predecessor, but in and of itself, it's still a damn good time. ""A-"""

","Deadpool 2 (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is back and turns out to live up to the first movie. With plenty of exciting action sequences, a wise cracking script and performance from Ryan Reynolds that delivers with lots of humor. Ryan Reynolds is born to play the character. Plus the humor in the movie does take a lot of jabs to the Marvel characters from The Avengers or making fun of DC for its seriousness. It may not be the best superhero movie with a thin plot or lacking depth with the villain (I will avoid spoilers on the plot). Is it better than the first film? I will say they are equally entertaining. The first movie did not have much depth with the plot either. <br/><br/>The plot follows Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) after a downhill spiral on life. He may be given another chance to do a good deed by saving a moody mutant teen Russell (Julian Dennison) who has the powers of firefist. When Cable (Josh Brolin) arrives from the future and his only goal is to kill Russell. Deadpool enlists new recruits to form a team called X Force with one of the members being Domino (Zazie Beetz). <br/><br/>I will say the plot felt a little thin when it comes to having a story. Has that Terminator concept with a man coming from the future to rewrite history. Sure, there is a joke thrown in there from that concept. The movie is nonetheless entertaining, funny, and exciting. <br/><br/>There are plenty of action sequences that keep the pace moving. The opening montage of Deadpool facing against criminal mobs internationally to an opening credit scene that feels like a James Bond movie with a song played by Celine Dion (which works with the setting and tone of the opening scene). The car chase scene with the huge armored prisoner transport vehicle and Domino and Deadpool facing against Cable was the highlight of the movie. I felt like the climax of the movie was a little bit short. Without giving away spoilers, the turning point of the villain was a bit weak. Also, you get to know a little about Cable and his motives on going after Russell. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin was perfect as Cable. It would be difficult to see anyone else playing the character. Morena Baccarin returns. Same with T.J. Miller the wise cracking buddy of Deadpool. Colossus returns as the goody good X-Men character that is trying to recruit Deadpool to doing good. Brianna Hildebrand is back as Negasonic Warhead but with a short role. Zazie Beetz is Domino. And her character is also the highlight of the movie. She did great with the role. I did not like Julian Dennison as Russell. A character that is moody with anger issues and undeveloped. It was difficult to care for the character even when Deadpool and Domino are trying to save him. <br/><br/>The movie had plenty of humor. It did not take itself seriously which threw jokes towards Marvel's characters, DC, even the I want to build a snowman from Frozen. The humor was fun and stupid. <br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 is a good superhero film. Ryan Reynold's delivered with performance and script. He is the wise cracking character, which also poked fun at himself. The action was exciting and also delivered by a director David Leitch (who did movies like John Wick and Atomic Blonde). Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz were great and highlights of the movie. The film is a lot of fun with plenty of humor and action. Also, there is two mid credit scenes that is a lot of fun as it pokes fun at the character. <br/><br/>I do recommend seeing this film in theatres if you enjoyed the first movie for the action and its raunchy stupid humor."

Great movie, probably gonna be top 3 of the year, don't miss it."
"bentrost","6","4","10","18 May 2018"," Surprisingly Disappointed
","Like most people I was a huge fan of the first film. So naturally I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. At the very least I was expecting it to be almost as good as the first movie. Unfortunately I left the theater bummed out and disappointed. On one hand there were definitely good things about this movie. On the other hand I thought the humor was forced at times and certain points in the movie I was actually BORED!? which I'd never thought I'd say about a Deadpool movie. Without going into spoilers, the film just felt strange, certain characters I didn't like or felt generic. At the end It didn't have the same satisfying feeling as the first one did."
"robfredric","10","4","10","18 May 2018"," YES YES YES
","I made an IMDB account just to write this review. What an epic movie.. don't listen to the critics.. this was an out of the park home run. Deadpool just knows how to connect his world with the audience.. I was checking my watch every 10 minutes in hopes that it wasn't close to being over!! AMAZING!!!"
"jordancornally","10","4","10","16 May 2018"," I'm gonna go see it again!!!

Deadpool 2 really lives up to the hype and o cant wait to see this movie again. I loved the first movie it was so different something marvel haven't really done before. DP2 is definitely better then the first in my opinion and that's strange.. I always prefer the original. I Hope this movie gets the credit it deserves, well done to Ryan and everyone involved definitely in my top ten movies"
"glide7","5","5","14","22 May 2018"," Really?
","Note to self: never get fooled by a trailer again. I laughed a few times, yeah, but that's it. The movie is packed with jokes but most of them are misfires, and of course they tried to turn the ending into a joke as well but it just drags on and never delivers, and left me bored and even a little sad. All the characters are pretty much bland with no depth and the plot is paper-thin. The first one was FAR better. <br/><br/>The fact that some people give this 10/10 baffles me, unless you're 10 years old, or have the mentality of a 10 year old."
"julius-14","5","5","14","21 May 2018"," Diminishing Returns
","Whatever one might have thought of the first Deadpool movie, it was definitely trying to do something new. The problem with Deadpool 2 is it's trying to do the same something new that the first one did. Meaning, of course, there is nothing new here at all. <br/><br/>And that's all the words I'm going to spend on that."
"ksn-30137","5","5","14","20 May 2018"," Disappointed
","The first deadpool always gets me in a good mood because of the movies ""light"" hearted nature, even though the movies deals with some heavy issues along the way.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 left me unsatisfied and kind of down in the mood department.<br/><br/>This movie is harsh emotional, and the movie lingers in this state for far too long whenever it goes downhill for our customeclad hero in contracts to the first movie. The characteristic humour of deadpool often felt misplaced, and did nothing to lighten to scene or the overall of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie tried too hard to out-do deadpool 1 in every aspect, and came up short in almost everything, and more often than not it felt forced and tame.<br/><br/>PS: The trailer is nothing like the movie, so if you liked the first one please see more review sites before buying tickets for this. You're not buying tickets for more of deadpool 1, but for deadpool 2, which is a different movie.<br/><br/>Score 5/10
Recommendation = Not for the price of cinema tickets"
"rgkarim","9","5","14","18 May 2018"," A Dead On Sequel
","Deadpool movies are so hard to review. It's not because their super complex, thought provoking, or even artistic symbolism, but it's more due to the fact of balancing ridiculous antics with serious hero quality. With the first movie being a breath of fresh air to the massively stuffed superhero movie genre, the sequel had a lot to live up to for pleasing the fanbase once more. After one of the most amazing advertisement campaigns to date, did this movie break the fourth wall of entertainment once again? Robbie K here to do his best to help you with your movie viewing pleasures. Let's go!<br/><br/>Movie: Deadpool 2<br/><br/>Director:
 David Leitch
Writers:
 Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick 
Stars:
 Josh Brolin, Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin<br/><br/><br/><br/>LIKES: <br/><br/>Acting: Given all of Ryan Reynolds ups and downs, the young actor shines so well in the reboot version of Deadpool. His sass from previous comedy stunts (like Two Guys and A Girl) mixed with his physique/delivery of superhero, leads to a well-developed lead who carries the movie heavily on his costume equipped shoulders. Brolin comes in again as the villain, bringing his grit to a less CGI rendered height that works well to offset the hyper, ADHD like energy of Deadpool and with it comes great comedic banter. Much of the supporting cast nails their roles well too, capable of dropping lines and rocking CGI stunts. <br/><br/>Domino: Of all of these though, Domino was my favorite character. In the age of rising female heroes, Domino is a well-developed character who brings so much to the weird table this film sets. Zazie Beetz really shines in this movie as a female partner in crime to counter the crazy of Deadpool. A great character who has a quirky power, this ""lucky"" girl brings bite to fight Deadpool's humor, decent skills with a weapon, and surprisingly some enlightened looks at life that bring some zing to the movie. This character was a fantastic addition to the movie that should help expand the audience. <br/><br/>Story: A Deadpool comic is often not the most developed in the story department, and given the direction of the cinema... one never knows how a sequel story will end up. Happily, I can report that this sequel did a nice job in the story department, managing to bring a decent plot that helps our characters evolve yet sticking close to the humor vibe of the movie. It's nice to see a ridiculous character grow, but still stick to the core qualities and Deadpool 2 did a much better job than I could imagine. <br/><br/>Special Effects: Deadpool's ridiculous stunts means needing to find some way to make the impossible, possible on the screen. Hat's off, or in this case masks off, to the department who made all the bouts, mutants, and futuristic technology come roaring to full force to immerse you into the action. Speaking of which, <br/><br/>Action: The action of Deadpool 2 is a mixed bag for me, but there are plenty of components that worked well with me. At the front line, are a number of bouts that have that chaotic, adrenaline fueled themes to it, mixed with snarky comments and unrelenting jokes that keep things fun, exciting, and a great opener. Seeing the moves, they choreographed/crafted, showed promise for some epic finales to come, always a good idea to cast the net and get them caught up early right. More on that later. <br/><br/>Comedy: In truth, the strongest weapon in Deadpool's arsenal is the comedy that this film is drenched in, and by drenched I mean caught in a deluge. This sequel picks up where the last left off and with it comes a cornucopia of styles all hectically crashing together in a giant abstract masterpiece. Nothing is safe from Deadpool's adulteration, as the red garmented maniac brings vulgarity, ridiculous finishes, pokes at stories, comics, movies (including the franchise itself), and of course slapstick that transitions to so much more. I kept laughing my head off in this movie and loved the writing, cleverness, and of course mid-credit scene that victoriously finishes the movie off and delivers the answer to the wishes and prayers of the fan base. So, so good. <br/><br/>DISLIKES: <br/><br/>Over the top moments: Deadpool I know is all about breaking the 4th wall on just about everything he can. And certainly, in this installment, the writers did their best to break that mold as often and intense as possible. Given the laxer ratings, Deadpool 2 shows no qualms with crossing the line. Primarily the cursing, Deadpool 2 doesn't know when to quit in terms of vulgar cursing and certainly goes down inappropriate avenues I didn't particularly enjoy. A minor one at best, be warned that anything is possible with a mad mercenary. <br/><br/>Comedic Stints Go on and on: Like this review, Deadpool's comedic banter sometimes treks on for too long. Those liking to see two smart alecks duke it out in a battle of insults, fake outs, and sarcasm for minutes on end will be delighted with the writing of this movie. I admit I did like it at first, but near the end this ploy had soon started to wrinkle like Wade's face. <br/><br/>Action: While I certainly liked the action for much of the movie, I can't help but admit I was a little disappointed as well. Sure, the humor is awesome, the inappropriate battle moves fit well, and it felt like a Deadpool sequence come to life with little to no punches pulled. Yet, I'm still spoiled on some of Marvel's glorious cinema wars and had hoped we'd get some match ups to give them a run for its money. The epic climactic fight didn't quite have the on the edge, clap in your seat, scream in excitement epic fights that the trailers had hinted at. Those moments were fly-overs in an extended montage. <br/><br/>Predictable: My buddy is right in saying that the movie certainly goes a different route than presented in the trailers. However,... the movie (perhaps as a stunt itself), dropped too many hints to lead you down the path to the answers that awaited. I was able to figure out all the twists with ease, and not have my mind blown as I thought it would. Another small dislike, but hey got to be honest at times. <br/><br/>Character use: The trailers promoted the heck out of X-Force, making sure that we got our eye fill on just about every angle of Deadpool's own team to rival the goody two shoes X-men. And while the characters got their time to shine in comedy moves, their overall contribution to the film was cheated out in my opinion. Maybe that's what the comics have done, or perhaps it was a brilliant comedic ploy. However, don't promote characters so heavily if you are going to dilute them so much. Even his fellow mutants from Xavier's got a bit of underplay, another example of too many pieces leading to sacrifices being required to not make the film too long. <br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/> Truth is I loved Deadpool 2 and while I had some issues, (which are pickiness of course), the movie accomplishes the goals of being a comedic spoof of superhumans that brings that bite to eat we hungered for. It's fast paced, it's witty, and it still keeps the story going on a level I didn't expect and this provides the breath of fresh air again that the first one did. Still, it's not a perfect movie for me and I still hope to get some more action and character usage in the next installment should Disney not limit Fox's creativity on it. Worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, though be warned that the movie is not designed for younger audience members, those with weak constitutions to blood, violence, and vulgarity, or those not ready to step over the abyss into craziness. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.5"
"brankovranjkovic","9","5","14","17 May 2018"," Deadpool 2: The Potty Mouth Superhero is back!
","Action packed superhero fantasy adventure, but not a typical Marvel film.
C15 due to violence and language content. <br/><br/>The opening sequence is genius, and is a roller-coaster ride throughout. The theme for this instalment is very similar to the 'Terminator' idea, it even contains subtle references to that iconic film. Keep an eye on the many brief famous cameo appearances. <br/><br/>It is rare to see a sequel as good as the launch film, this one is hilarious, gory, but also surprisingly warm in places. <br/><br/>Perhaps a few out-takes before the best post credit sequences ever filmed would have delivered some of the fun the cast had while making.<br/><br/>This has got to be one of the most entertaining films of the year!"

","Deadpool 2 a really good sequel to the first Deadpool which was release back in 2016. Thanks to who ever release the test footage of Deadpool. 
The movie starts from where it left of, with bigger budget, more explosions, amazing choreographed actions and bigger cast compare to the first Deadpool. Without giving too much away from this movie here are my good points and bad points for this movie: <br/><br/>The Good Points:
This movie has a great plot which gives you some heart moment feels,dialogues that will make you laugh, and great cast choice. Cable and Domino are two new characters that shines in the movie, when they are on screen you will enjoy their performance and make you hunger more of them in the movie.Dopinder have more role this time which is a great thing his scenes with deadpool are to look for in the this movie. Ryan Reynolds is the only person who can play deadpool, his performance for this movie was amazing. The movie also have ton of movie reference, compare to the first movie, you love the jokes made with the reference.<br/><br/>The Bad Points:
The main flaw in this movie is that even though the plot s good, you can feel some part of the movie to be a bit draggy and some jokes that fails to hit with the audience. It's sad to see the previous cast that made the first movie a success had only a few scenes. I was looking forward to see more of negasonic teenage warhead, colossus, Blind Al, and weasel. Hope we can see more these roles in the future movies to come. <br/><br/>Should you watch this movie:
To be honest, it's a good movie as a whole and you wouldn't be disappointed with this movie. Even if you have not watch the first movie or if you hate the first one, you might like this movie.It's a family movie for 18 and above. Hope we get to see more of these roles in the future again."
"HorrorMaster-13","8","6","18","17 May 2018"," Marvel did it again! It released another very good movie!
","I'm sorry if I cannot list all the good stuff about this Movie because this is my very first time that I write a Review for a Movie on IMDb.
Deadpool 2 is one of the funniest Movies in this year and probably one of the best Movies I saw in 2018. It surpassed its predecessor 'Deadpool 1' on nearly every Level. Every of the Jokes mostly land in this one, the Action is great and better than in the first Deadpool, the CGI is OK and all of the Acting of the actors and the actresses is Good.
Ryan Reynolds is the definitive Deadpool for me just like Hugh Jackman will always be The Wolverine and Robert Englund Freddy Krueger. I cannot imagine anybody playing Deadpool after Ryan Reynolds because he is born for this role.
Josh Brolin did an excellent job as Cable even so I didn't find him as great here as Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. Zazie Beetz did a great job as Domino.
The After Credit Scene in Deadpool 2 has to be one of the most hilarious things I saw in my life.
In a nutshell Deadpool 2 is a good Movie and everybody should watch it in Cinema.<br/><br/>I give it a 8/10."
"MrDHWong","8","6","18","16 May 2018"," A fun and hilarious sequel to the original
","Deadpool 2 is the sequel to the 2016 superhero film Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds in the title role. Directed by David Leitch (John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2), it is a fun and hilarious sequel to the original, thanks in part to Reynolds' lively performance.<br/><br/>Two years after the events of the first film, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), still going by his alter-ego ""Deadpool"" continues to live out his days as a mercenary travelling around killing the bad guys. One day, Deadpool is forced to form a team of superheroes known as the ""X-Force"" to protect a mutant kid from a dangerous futuristic time-traveller named ""Cable"" (Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>Although lacking some of the freshness of the original, Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in just about every sense. The meta-humour and fourth wall breaks still hit home when they need to and the action scenes are expertly choreographed by John Wick co-director David Leitch, taking over from Tim Miller. Once again, there is no doubt that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. His comic timing is perfect and even some of the character's most dramatic scenes can be taken seriously in the right context. However, it is Josh Brolin who shines the most. He nails the role of Cable and he holds his own without drawing too many comparisons to his recent performance as Thanos. Be sure to stay during the credits for two hilarious bonus scenes.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"bjoernidler","4","3","7","7 November 2018"," This is what's wrong with Blockbusters today
","In Deadpool 2 you can find lots of ingredients that are wrong about current Blockbusters under a magnifying glass. Here are some examples.<br/><br/>1. The good guy kills everyone but is mortified when a single person that accidentally means something to him dies. So he kills more people. Common practice in movies and politics.<br/><br/>2. How can the hero mean something if nothing can reeeeaally happen to him?<br/><br/>3. Using the R-rating as an excuse to squeeze in as much ""dirty words"" that wouldn't shock an 8 year old orphan.<br/><br/>4. Violence for the sake of violence. It doesn't mean anything and doesn't increase the fun in any way. Cgi limbs and blood always look fake.<br/><br/>5. Being 'meta' just to please the nerds and make people think of how clever they are to understand the popcultural references. In ten to fifteen years this movie will probably be terribly dated because of that.<br/><br/>6. Weakening every half emotional or serious scene with a laugh. This movie is so scared of allowing any real feeling that you can feel sorry for it. Why bother with showing serious stuff when nothing of it has any impact on the audience?<br/><br/>7. Plot seems to be overrated. Why confuse us with a real story when it's so much more entertaining to kill more people and drop more 'witty' oneliners?<br/><br/>I don't want to sound like an arthouse guru because I'm not. If you're one of those who can switch off their brains while watching a movie and are not appalled by the things I mentioned, this is your movie. It looks cool, it's loud and it doesn't expect a lot from its viewers.
If you want a good comic book movie, return to Logan, The Dark Knight, Superman or even Howard the Duck."

"davideo-2","9","3","7","24 May 2018"," Manages to match the tone and style of the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Saturday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), as his alter-ego Deadpool, has been travelling the world fighting crime and taking on the bad guys. However, when girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) announces she is pregnant, he plans a new life and settling down with her, only to lose her at the hands of some vengeful associates of some bad guys he tackled. Plunged into a depressed slump, he is pulled out of it when Russell (Julian Dennison), a young boy with super fire powers, lashes out at the brutal headmaster (Eddie Marsan) who's abusing him. Deadpool must then protect him from the time travelling Cable (Josh Brolin) who wants to eliminate Russell for what he becomes in the future...<br/><br/>The 2016 comic book caper Deadpool was one of those cult, sleeper hits that was practically crying out for a sequel. Rather than splurge one out less than twelve months after the first one came out, director David Leitch has given time for that film to absorb into the cultural consciousness, and the result is a film that hits a higher note because of it. This time around, it feels on more dynamic a scope, with a more ambitious script that wants to crank the fun level up another notch. And, with everyone on board in on the act and having fun, the result is for the most part a resounding success.<br/><br/>Returning in the lead role, Reynolds is once again suitably snarky and cool as the wise-cracking renegade, and the films tongue-in-cheek vibe is once again suitably in check. Like last time, it's loaded with pop culture references, some of which have developed since the last film (namely involving George Michael!) With all this, it's surprising that the film chooses to include such dark themes as grief and revenge in it, which may have been included in the last film, but not to such a sharp extent. It starts like this from the off-set, followed by a bizarre opening credits parody of James Bond films that feels ambiguous.<br/><br/>It's still great fun, though, not taking itself seriously at all for the most part, with some fantastic action sequences, cool, funky new characters and just generally being a very colourful and entrancing follow up. A third and final instalment should be okay on the basis of this. ****"

I don't want to spoil not even a second of the movie. If you don't have prejudices to hear profanities of all kind (related to isms, pop culture, marvel universe and anything you consider a tabu) and laugh on them this is your movie.
Don't miss the wonderful cameos along the movie and the extra scenes at the ending credits. There're two blocks separated by a credit and the second one has four different scenes. The two last are probably the two best extra scenes ever. Nuff said.

Way too many forced jokes. too many scenes for DP and his girlfriend in his psyche. also the action sequence was not as good as the previous one !"

","Taking you back 3-4 years back when I first heard that one of the loved(including me) comic book characters in History, Deadpool. Is getting his own stand-alone movie, The first thought that came to mind was, ""How are they even gonna get it right?"", that led me to lower my expectation quite low, very low in-fact having seen how adaptions of even the best Graphic novels/Books/Games can be butchered by Movie studios in recent years.<br/><br/>Then arrived 2016, I decided to not even watch the movie on opening day, wait to read some couple of reviews and read up on user opinions/feelings about the Movie. That too still left me caught up between a rock and hard place and the reviews & opinions were all mixed. Some loved it while some couldn't stand the movie, til I finally decided to go see for myself.<br/><br/>And boy oh! boy I had my undies blown straight out of the ocean, Deadpool was a breath of fresh air in recent times, reminded me of Shoot 'Em Up(2007) when it came out, the movies knew it was silly, over the top jokes with some illogical action sequences scenes, and as messy as this may sound, Director Time Miller just found a way to make it all work. And I can safely say I loved every part of Deadpool.<br/><br/>With it's (surprising) success, for a R-rated film feature, I did expect they would be making a sequel but the thought never sold to me, I mean how do you continue such a masterpiece without taking somethings which made us fall in love it in the first place, my expectation hit low levels when I had the director resigned or was let go for some reasons unknown, and David Leitch will be taking over.<br/><br/>But despite all this, I still found myself heading to my nearest cinema to catch an early screaning and again. Boy oh! boy... Boy did they nail the second it time around, having loved the first one, I had few moments in the film which I felt were over-done or unnecessary, for which they were corrected in the second coming. Just as we want to always be entertained by fouth-wall breaks, the silly and over-the top jokes, adrenaline action packed fighting sequences, heartfelt moments, twists & turns, complete surprise of an ending. And just for a cherry on top, the best post-credit scene in the History of Movies. The lady next to me leterally cried.<br/><br/>All of this make up Deadpool 2, believe the hype, this movie will leave you in stiches, I left the cinema with my ribs literally sore from the amount of laughter. David Leitch delivered a sequel we all could wish for in any movie sequel. And he does it in comic book style. As he makes us all wish to be the non-mutant member of the X-Force.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 delivers like the first, but surpasses in ways I could've imagined."

","I really liked the original, but this second installment seriously suffers from trying too hard to be funny and offensive, and spends too little time being a good story or appealing.<br/><br/>We have effects by the boatload, but they really fail to bring us anywhere in the story. There were only a dozen people at the saturday matinee I went to, and it was literally packed for black panther with no empty seats. I think this really illustrates the difference between good and bad movies since both are from the Marvel Universe. <br/><br/>For me, the best moments were the easter eggs after the credits. Anyway, there are a few moments worth watching (Like the line ""Kiss Me Like You Miss Me""), but the other 92% is just not impressive. I really did not feel like my ticket money was well spent."

The fact that Josh Brolin played as Cable in this making it much more hilarious for those who had watched IW. Even though it content many bad jokes and obvious ending, Deadpool never let me down."

","Dear movie freaks, in my country Indonesia, Deadpool is a popular movie. All seats are taken on the studio. We love Deadpool. I love Deadpool because the movie is so funny, full of sarcasm, heroic, meaningful, and cinematic enough in this modern time. Deadpool 2 is as successful as Deadpool. I was laughing since the beginning of the movie. Well, the main story of the movie is to respect family like you did to yourself. We can see all the plots, including the time traveller things, are coming up to this idea. Deadpool 2 has the great cinematography and the characters involved are improved, more powerful, and more funnier at the same time they give you the look of superpower is nothing without trust, friendship, and loyalty. In this Deadpool 2 we can see also new casts but they are acting so well like professional. I appreciate the Directors, Producers, and Distributor of this movie who can live up the hero movies of Hollywood, as well as to do auto-criticism. I rate this movie 8 because for me the custome and wardrobe, then the weapons are still old-school. Yes it is that Deadpool can not die easily, but please give us more modern technology, because here I can not see Internet. I just see time traveller things but not connected with the website links. This sound quite awkward for millenial people like me. But I love this movie. Go on watch it again and again!!"

","The first one tried, this one didn't. It's like how first albums are always better than the rest. They really laid the politics on thick in this one too. The Jared Kushner joke was funny...I guess. But the fox and friends joke was just stupid. Abby Huntsman is less offensive than Rachel Madcow, suuuuuure. There was really no story to this movie and the XMen cameos, although funny, are just getting so confusing. Brolin should stick to Marvel and Reynolds should stick to romcoms."

But otherwise, I found the movie to be unsatisfactory, even though I enjoyed its snide comments and good technical aspects (color, slo-mo, sound).<br/><br/>The writing could've been better. It follows well-known ways that films use to produce a sequel. It breaks the fourth wall a little too often. I have to commend it for not being homophobic.

","Deadpool aka Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), returns, along with his witty, random and (not to mention) crude sense of humour. This time, Deadpool will protect a young mutant boy from an unknown traveler going by the name of ""Cable"" (played by Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the 1st installment, then you will have a complete understanding of what to expect in this film. Thankfully, the sequel changes it up a fair bit and keeps the series fresh and entertaining. The film's plot, jokes and new characters, including the introduction of X-Force, are elements that add to the success and excitement of Deadpool 2. The film also manages to bring back countless familiar faces from the previous film.<br/><br/>While Deadpool 2 is loaded with jokes, I'm surprise to announce the sequel manages to deliver more heart than the previous film. There are key moments where I thought to myself 'the actor Ryan Reynolds is actually delivering a pretty solid performance'. It can also feel like this performance is more from the heart as he's not hiding behind the mask. As far as jokes go, yes, some jokes do fall flat or go for too long, but considering how much humour is actually carried in the film, it can be overall forgivable as the majority of jokes and one liners are creative and do work very well.<br/><br/>The action sequences in Deadpool 2 are awesome, insane and not to mention, the film has another outstanding film soundtrack. Heck, I'll even be as bold as to say I enjoyed Celine Dion's Deadpool theme song (yeah, I said it... I liked Celine Dion's song!). I also personally enjoyed the many nods and jokes that were related to other films, such as other super hero movies (Batman, X-Men are just a few to name).<br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 is a fresh and worthy sequel. Is fun, brainless, creative and surprisingly unpredictable as a film. Sure, the plot is rather basic, but people, it's a Deadpool film- what did you expect? For anyone who is a fan of Marvel films or Deadpool as a character, this is seriously a no brainer. Enjoy the fun and stay for the credits (staying for the credits for this film is a huge must!)<br/><br/>8.5/10

"andrewnmiller","10","2","4","8 January 2019"," Twice the Deadpool, twice the fun.
","Given how the post-credit scene at the end of the first Deadpool film teased a sequel, I honestly got quite gritty as given how much I adored the first Deadpool film, I couldn't wait to see it so once the trailers for Deadpool 2 dropped, I grew even more ecstatic to see the film but I ended up seeing Avengers: Infinity War instead. I didn't watch Deadpool 2 until a few months later and much like the first film, I absolutely loved it. From its strong direction and non-stop humor to its marvelous action scenes and top-notch acting, Deadpool 2 is another home run for comic book films as a whole.<br/><br/>The film opens with Deadpool as known as Wade Wilson blowing himself up following a traumatic event. The film then fasts forwards two years where Wade fails to kill one of his targets and celebrates his anniversary with Vanessa where the two decide to start a family of their own. That night, the target that Wade failed to kill tracks him down and in the following shootout and kills Vanessa only to have Wade kill him in retaliation. Blaming himself for Vanessa's death, Wade blows himself up a few weeks later. Upon seeing a vision of her in the afterlife, Deadpool's various body parts are reassembled by Colossus and as a form of mending his broken heart, Deadpool agrees to join the X-men. Soon after, he, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead respond to a faceoff between authorities and a mutant named Russell aka Firefist. After an incident where Deadpool kills one of the staff members, both he and Firefist are locked up in a prison for mutants. Meanwhile, a time-traveling cyborg more solid named Cable arrives from the future to kill Russell before he murders Cables' family. He then breaks into the jail and attacks Russell while Wade attempts to defend the boy but gets his ass handed to him. Wade then falls off a cliff and lands in a freezing lake, just before he dies, Wade has another vision of Vanessa which tells him to help Russell. Now, Deadpool must put his own team together to stop Cable from killing the boy.<br/><br/>More to the point, the movie doesn't go for the humor over an adequate story rhythm unlike a movie like the 2016 Ghostbusters remake. Deadpool 2 never tries to alter its story just so it can throw in a few more jokes into the film just for the sake of it. The jokes are there to serve the plot, not to dominate it. Sure, the gags are hysterical, but they aren't practically callous or critical. There's never a feeling that the film is or always will be a deconstruction of superhero movies in that it really doesn't have anything interesting or thought-provoking to say about the genre unlike The Dark Knight or Captain America: Civil War apart from admitting that most moviegoers are genre-blind when it comes to comic book movies but Deadpool 2 doesn't need that to be a great movie. Not all superhero movies need to be deep and pretentious as the genre really doesn't lead itself to that area of filmmaking with a few exceptions but Deadpool 2's real purpose seems to just be a fun movie without the need to talk down to its audience. Understandably, this is never a problem in Deadpool 2. As a matter of fact, what's most astonishing about the movie, especially in this age of reboots, sequels, and remakes, is the respective ability with which the movie tells a basic story. For all the gags about genitals and pop culture, there's always quite a few scenes of genuine emotion that do work much like in Avengers: Infinity War as do the characters in both films. Easily the strongest point of the MCU are the characters and how they grow and develop over the course of the films, Deadpool 2 is the same way. The characters here are nicely fleshed out, their arcs and ambitions are clear to the viewer. Despite all the humor, there's a layer of attractive and compelling depth that's not hard to find if you look closely enough.<br/><br/>Much like the first Deadpool movie, Deadpool 2 has been seen as a deconstruction of superhero movies as well as a comedic masterpiece and while that's a fair assessment to make of the movie, it's really a little bit of both to me. The movie feels most functional because it works so well as a basic and genuine comic book film with a whole lot more gore added in and just a pinch more self-alertness sprinkled in to give the film that extra kick. Of course, to say that Deadpool 2 isn't funny would be like saying Riders of the Lost Ark isn't an action classic or that Citizen Kane isn't one of the greatest films ever put to screen as the movie is an absolute laugh riot. Every joke that comes at the viewer is a gut-buster every time. Right when the opening scene starts up where they take jabs at director David Leitch as the guy who killed John Wick's dog in a jovial fashion, it's obvious that Deadpool 2 holds no pop culture subject sacred. During one action scene, Wade attacks Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld by saying he's a guy who can't draw feet, referencing Liefeld's erratic drawing style. Hugh Jackman gets a ton of jokes aimed at him throughout the course of the movie from Deadpool flipping the bird to the film Logan and how it's just cashing in on his R rating. Some of the other jokes aimed at Jackman include a wind-up toy with Wolverine impaled on a tree stake and a reference to Hugh's role in Les Miserables. Much like the first film, there are also some great visual jokes directed at the X-men such as when Wade claims to have never seen any of the team only to have a room full of them right behind him. It's a fantastic visual joke but also tires Deadpool's world back to that of the X-men nicely. Lastly, there are a ton of jokes directed at both the MCU and DCEU from the jabs at Batman V. Superman to Deadpool calling one of his teammates' Black Widow and calling Cable Thanos which were some of the best jokes in the film for me. Often, the set-ups for the jokes are even jokes themselves which makes the movie all the more fun. To add to that, the screenplay by Reese, Wernick and Reynolds is intelligent and funny as the dialog seems to carry all the action upon its shoulders and is laugh-out-loud comical as Deadpool's chain of thought speaking technique helpfully explains the films' events to the viewer not to mention the continuous fourth wall breaking that Deadpool is famous for makes the film have a very self-referential feeling to it, making it even funnier.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's no disagreeing that the strangeness of a comic book film turning a d-list X-Men villain called Black Tom Cassidy into a frequent gag with certain attention being given to the characters enduring comic book history. Deadpool 2 is certainly and clearly made by people who have actually read comic books or at the very least, understand them as opposed to making the film a total mockery of its source material like Fant4sic was. When Deadpool meets The Juggernaut, he specifically calls out the names of several comic books into his fanboy blubbering. Along with that, the movie never forgets that it is, in fact, an X-men sequel, not just inconsistency but also in its approach to the core themes of the X-men comics and how the film wears its progressiveness up its shirt shelves. There's a simple storytelling approach that Deadpool 2 uses in its acceptance of the eccentric hidden agenda from the offhand references to a strap-on to the remarkable moment of Deadpool accepting Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend, Yukio. Unlike other major Hollywood films, Deadpool 2 never makes its agenda the main focus of the film but uses it subtlety to assist the story at hand.<br/><br/>There has been an argument that Deadpool 2 is the best X-men film to date and while I still think X-men: Days of Future Past, X-men: First Class, Logan, and the first two X-men films are far superior in terms of characters and themes, that's not to say that this film isn't great in its own right. This is most apparent in the way that the story discovers itself undoing around the Essex Home of Mutant Rehabilitation which is yet a further inside joke poking fun at the change of heart rehabilitation which also makes the joke even funnier. Upon seeing the film, it's also clear that both director David Leitch, as well as the production crew, have read the Deadpool comic books given the number of story nods from various X-men and Deadpool storylines which do make the film a bit more tongue and cheek than most other comic book films. Even the tiniest details allude to four-color developments. When Deadpool brings together his cutting-edge counter team to the X-men, the filmmakers are cautious to include clever references to the diverse incarnations of the superhero team known as X-Force which is refreshing as well as hilarious to see onscreen.<br/><br/>Also, Deadpool 2 also works surprisingly well as an action film with a somewhat direct story and dependable characters with clear motivations. Given director David Leitch's background in codirecting the first two John Wick movies, it's hardly surprising that this guy knows how to shoot action scenes with his trademark bright and organized style that works wonders for the movie. As with the films in the MCU, the action setpieces in Deadpool 2 are loads of fun to watch and impressive given how bloated some action setpieces in certain superhero movies have gotten. The opening montage of Deadpool slicing, hacking and killing gangers and thugs all over the world is breathtaking to behold while the battle between Cable and Wade in the prison is nicely shot and nicely put together but the best action setpiece the movie gives us is the trunk chase where Domino and Deadpool are busy trying to drive a prison truck and battling Cable at the same time which makes for one of the best chase sequences in any action or comic book movie and what's even more wonderful is that although the viewer knows that the scene they are watching is all CGI but it does feel realistic in every possible way.<br/><br/>The story and character arches in the film don't offer much in terms of surpr"

"lesleyharris30","9","2","4","28 September 2018"," Great Fun, Bigger and Better than its Predecessor,
","Deadpool 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a tremendous cast that shine in both comedic and more dramatic moments. As much as I was looking forward to this, I really did not think it would manage to top the original, I was prepared to be entertained, but I did not give my hopes up on it being spectacular. I was blown away from just how thoroughly entertaining, funny and investing it really was, by far one of the best sequels that has been done in awhile, it manages to go bigger without getting carried away with itself. <br/><br/>
The only major issue I had with the film was the lack of development they put in to Cable. Despite Josh Brolin really bringing it to the part, they left a lot of details out about him, and being someone who was not previously aware of the character, I would like to have known a bit more, he needed a lot more scope. <br/><br/>The cast is all around brilliant, Ryan Reynolds is as great as ever in the title role that we can see is still a dream come true for him to play, and it's immense fun just watching him having a ball. Brolin, who already wooed the hearts of Marvel fans as Thanos, annihilates it again in a major part, Zazie Beetz, whom I really admire from her work in Atlanta, had a terrific presence as Domino and manages to match up against two major actors playing well known characters, she was an absolute scene stealer. <br/><br/>Pure fun, as well as an engaging story. Proving that sometimes, bigger is actually better, Deadpool 2 is a blast from beginning to end, I would recommend to all fans of the franchise, it is a must see.<br/><br/>

In fact, that's what i got but on a higher level.<br/><br/>I'd like to bring up especially the beggining of the movie, as a whole movie, this, not as the other kinda cliché movies where you can be really predictable, invocated in me that it is going to be really good. What I'm talking about are things, that are happening suddenly without useless backgrounding and slow progress. The movie has been packed with a lot of action like this, added with a great humour which left me laughing on a lot of scenes. Mixed with a sad moments which in conclusion were de facto funny, some heart taking scenes and things what every movie, supposed to keep you in tension, should have.<br/><br/>Cinematical level, which i classify as a quality of scenes and music, was also good. I have nothing to say to the music choice, every music fitted the emotions in the scene and helped you to fit´feel´ in it, too.<br/><br/>My final ´let's say subjective´ rating is that movie wasn't boring, there was a few scenes with my thoughts somewhere else, however it was minimum times and let's not count it.

","Yes its fun, irreverent and action packed and doesn't take itself too seriously BUT it has heart and passion.
But its the whole package that makes this perhaps the greatest Superhero movie. We know the MCU formula backwards - and its precisely that this does quite follow that formula that this movie shines. The pacing, music, the unexpected twists, amazing fight choreography all are obedient to telling a great story. This movie surprises and delights esp with the post credit scenes which make this story and the whole X-men universe make sense. There is continuity of development of characters the previous film and a bit less sexy stuff which I prefer (esp for teens who will watch this no doubt). The first movie was a love story.

"WanderleyG","5","2","4","19 August 2018"," Great movie until the half part
","I won't say the movie is bad because it isn't.
It's just great until a certain point, then it starts to be repetitive and at the last third is absolutely totally crap.
If you can get away with the second half you will probably think it's a very good movie, but it's not consistent.
This kid, Julian Dennison, he absolutely ruined the movie. I don't know what was up at he casting but he just ruins everything little thing, he is terrible as an actor and looks too apathic here.
Why do they even have to do that much close ups on his face when he is that bad?
The overall plot is ok to bad, at the second half its plain bad writing that forces tagging people as pedos to justify the massacre of civils.
I'm not being politically correct here, they didn't have to do it, they did and did it very poorly.
Even the characters motivations feel shallow at the ending, it feels rushed.
The boy plot is meeh and you just can't feel nothing for the boy because he is so bad.
Also, the final third is just forced meta.
The jokes don't work anymore, too much repetitive, they over use the meta to try to cancel the bad writing by saying it is bad.
The action it's very good, Leitch it's top notch at it and he did deliver even in a over the top movie like DP.
The action is bad, at some point you just don't want to look at their faces anymore. Reynolds and the girl are the only acceptable characthers, the others get boring too fast and they don't work. And I'm not even talking about the boy, his whole thing, plot and terrible acting, ruined a movie that could be very good.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, it's just not balanced.
Some things work very very well and others are so bad that have negative impact on the good things.<br/><br/>The movie works much better that the genre average at it's core elements, the action it's good, the jokes work until certain point and etc.<br/><br/>Some people will overlook the bad aspects and say it's a great movie, you might be this person or not."

It's a continuation of the obscene-over-the-top 4th wall-breaking not-for-kids-superhero-raunchy-as-hell action/comedy romp we were introduced to in the first film. 'Notice I said ""not for kids""? Yes, because it's not. Seriously, this is not Guardians of The Galaxy or The Avengers. It's definitely...DEFINITELY...for the grown ups only. Existing in the X-men film universe, it's a breath of fresh air from the goodie two-shoes heroes of the big screen we've been saturated with for the last several years.

"DeBBss","10","2","4","4 June 2018"," A True Deadpool Movie...
","Deadpool 2 is just a perfect representation of Deadpool; it's a perfect Deadpool movie. This movie did not take anything serious, and I feel like that's important for most comedy movies. The writers for Deadpool 2 pretty much nailed it for the comedy and the characters. I thought Deadpool 2 was going to be nothing compared to the first, but I think it's better. The jokes are funnier, the characters are far more likable, and the CGI looks better. And the Easter Eggs; if you think there was a lot of Easter Eggs in the first, wait 'til you see the Deadpool 2, there's at least double. Deadpool 2 was a bit of a disappointment for the characters. There was all these jokes and scenes in the trailer, but it never showed in the final cut. There was two scenes in the trailer that showed Bedlam and Shatterstar fighting, but it was like chunks in the movie were cut out. And I really wanted to see Terry Crews fight in a Deadpool movie.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>This is a perfect Deadpool story, it could also work for any comedy movie. I love the idea of time travel, and they used that idea perfectly, because one of the funniest scenes has to do with time travel. The story goes like this: Cable, from the future wants to kill Firefist, because the future Firefist kills Cable's family, and it's up to Deadpool to protect Firefist. The story is so unique because you'd expect Deadpool to protect Firefist through the whole movie, but then they become enemies, then friends again. We also see Juggernaut protect Firefist at the end of the movie, which is interesting. Although Deadpool 2 was just under two hours, I did want it to go longer; it was just an enjoyable film. The pacing was good, I was never bored when there was no action, because of the constant jokes. I usually complain about subplots, but I felt like there wasn't enough. Some subplots were really interesting, like in the future where cable's family died. I really hope they show what it's like in the future. Overall, the story is funny, entertaining, and unique.<br/><br/>Characters: 9/10<br/><br/>All the characters were good. They pretty much nailed Deadpool, with the jokes, and the fighting style. I liked how at first, Deadpool was fighting Cable, but then at the end they become best friends (In a way). The only thing that bothered me was how the original X-Force team died immediately after parachuting, it was a funny scene, but I hoped to see them all fight, especially Peter. We also see Juggernaut for a bit, which I never expected. And then we have the innocent Colossus. Colossus pretty much stayed the same from the original, and we also heard him swear for the first time, so that was good. I loved how in this movie, everyone gets the spotlight, and their own jokes; no matter how little the screen time is. And we see colossus fight dirty for the first time too, against Juggernaut. Overall, all of the characters were funny, but there was way too little screen time for the original X-Force.<br/><br/>Action: 10/10<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 was way funnier than the first. There was so many references to different movies that ruined the X-Men universe and Ryan Reynolds career. One of the references was about the leg cross in Basic Instinct; that was one of the funniest moments in the entire movie. The combat is brutal, even more brutal than the first, which is the way it's supposed, because it's a Deadpool movie. The director, David Leitch is so talented and underrated, and I really hope he directs another Deadpool movie. The CGI is decent, but some scenes looked a bit too cheesy. The choreography was good and action-packed, it was also funny; especially the fight scene with Juggernaut and Colossus. Overall, Deadpool 2 is an amazing action movie, with entertaining and funny choreography, and the comedy was hilarious.<br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 takes what made Deadpool 1 so great, and makes it better. I loved every moment in this movie, and I never wanted it to end. I love the character Deadpool, and this version; it's exactly like the game; I haven't read any of the comic books, so I really don't know if it's like the comics. But I really hope everyone gets a chance to watch this movie, it really made me laugh, and the people in the theater."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","2 June 2018"," ""Deadpool"" keeps on slicing off success because it takes itself more seriously than you think
","Hilarious movies don't often lead to hilarious sequels, but the R-rated, tongue-in-cheek fourth-wall-breaking approach ""Deadpool"" brought to the superhero genre in 2016 seemed like the kind that could have legs - and indeed it does. (That will be funny once you've seen ""Deadpool 2."")<br/><br/>With writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick back on board, this time in collaboration with star Ryan Reynolds, ""Deadpool 2"" promised more of the same outrageous violence, profanity and hilarity, even with a new director (David Leitch, ""Atomic Blonde"") in charge. The movie delivers exactly that. Everything about it dovetails with the original movie, which will delight those devoted return customers. <br/><br/>What both films do admirably well is take their characters seriously and nothing else. Maybe it's because they lean heavily on revenge narratives to provide character depth and motivation, but regardless, it works. The characters of ""Deadpool"" exist in more than one dimension. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has a soul, though he's not entirely sure how to use it.<br/><br/>The lineup of characters expands quite a bit in ""Deadpool 2."" In addition to the return of Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) as his occasional X-Men buddies, other comic characters including members of the X-Force including Domino (Zazie Beetz), Bedlam (Terry Crews) and others. The plot largely centers on a teenage mutant named Firefist (Julian Dennison) whom Wade is trying to protect from Cable (Josh Brolin), a dangerous mutant from the future.<br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" doesn't sacrifice all that much for upping the plot complexity and character palette. The narrative stays linear and focused - count that sequel pitfall as avoided. The recruitment of the X-Force is more about comedy than attempting to dazzle the audience; in fact, the movie's best and most original gag involves the X-Force's big debut. <br/><br/>Probably 80 percent of the humor if not more fills familiar territory from the first ""Deadpool"" and that's to be expected. T.J. Miller humorously tries to describe things, Reynolds calls people names that reference pop culture both mainstream and obscure, and there's no shortage of humor drives from violence, drugs and sex (though less of the latter two than you might think). It's a movie with a PG-13 heart that delights in R-rated aesthetics.<br/><br/>Being so similar, the differences between the ""Deadpools"" are slight. The edge in terms of storytelling goes to the original - the screenplay was tighter with more clarity. But the sequel has stronger villains and more dimension to it. If ""Deadpool 2"" had a few more fresher ideas and didn't lean so much on past formulas for success, it would have the clear advantage.<br/><br/>How long Reynolds and Co. can keep up this shtick without it getting stale remains to be seen, but ""remains to be seen"" is pretty good two films in. As long as the commitment to characters and storytelling worth a damn remains the priority over laughs and gleeful violence, Deadpool and the X-Force characters will have a long life on the big screen.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"stevenrotherforth","9","2","4","21 May 2018"," Great gags aside, the bar set by the first film is just too high
","Deadpool 2<br/><br/>This movie is one of my most anticipated flicks of the year.
After the surprisingly brilliant first instalment I had high expectations for this sequel.
Ultimately I think I set the bar a little too high. Giving DP2 an impossible task to live up to the original.
Not to say that this second coming is a failure. Oh no, far from it. Establishing the character in the first film allows new director David Leitch to hit the ground running.
The main problem is that the film doesn't run smoothly. It stumbles over the obstacle of having a clunky storyline. A common problem that many sequels suffer from.
By trying to outdo what has gone before the filmmakers try to cram everything in but the kitchen sink.
What results is a movie that just doesn't flow.<br/><br/>This time around Deadpool finds himself trying to protect a child with very hot hands who in the future murders the wife and child of Cable played by the excellent Josh Brolin. 
Cable is a time traveling mutant hell bent on revenge. Think of him as the Terminator but with a trendier haircut.
DP2 is a movie that beats you into submission with a torrent of gags and over the top set pieces.
In some instances the film bites off more than its budget can chew.
There's the odd CGI sequence that is so jarring it's like watching a low budget Sci-Fi from the mid nineties.
A particular scene involving Domino (Zazie Beetz) as a car flips over the top of her causing another vehicle to crash into a petrol station looks very poor.
Think PlayStation 2 quality graphics and you're on the right page.
Huge mutant Juggernaut is also poorly rendered. In some scenes he looks cartoonish like the Hulk did from earlier cinematic outings.
What cannot be denied is Ryan Reynolds comic timing.
There's so many one liners and references that the movie needs to be viewed several times to fully appreciate Reynolds brilliance.
Everyone involved puts in a good turn.
Both Brolin and Beetz are fabulous. A shame then that the comedic talent of the likes of Terry Crews is under utilised.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a mixed bag. In one hand it is a very funny comedy with outrageous action and fine performances.
On the other hand it is a over ambitious attempt at trying to recapture the magic that went before. There's glimpses of success at trying to do so.
But after the fantastic mid credit scenes have vanished and all credits have rolled it's a movie that can't reach the dizzy heights of the first film.
The original Deadpool was a simple movie with no expectations bestowed upon it.
Unfortunately Deadpool 2 has a burden too much to bare.
With its aforementioned clunky storyline and over ambitious CGI we get a movie that is enjoyable but a little unpolished.
It's certain that Ryan Reynolds crafted his gags to perfection and the cast are all having a blast. Sadly though I think everyone else's bar like my own may also be set too high.
That said all I have explained before in this review was from watching the theatrical release.
I recently purchased the Blu-ray of Deadpool 2 and the Superdooper cut elevates this movie from 8/10 to a solid 9. Why?
Well with added scenes and a torrent of more side splitting gags The Superdooper cut seems to flow much more naturally making for a more enjoyable experience.
No, it still isn't as good as the original but that high bar is almost within reach."
"alliedrein","9","2","4","21 May 2018"," Super cool and funny as heck!
","Saw ""Deadpool 2"" a few days ago! I must say that Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool is one hilarious cool cat who goes the extra mile to intice your funny bone. He comes off across as meandering with relentless pursuit for the inevitable. The cool thing about this movie is the homely way in which it was crafted, with endless line after line of comedic hilarity. The short-lived romanticism between Wade and Vanessa left Wade auspicious to favorability in many ways I come to see. Cable was one badass time travelling cybernetic mutant soldier with hardy moves and albeit relationally succumbing in character with his would-be allies. Russell possessed this haunting StephenKing-esqe sort of character about him of the likes of a demonized problem child immersed into witchcraft occultism, the kid was marvelously persuading indeed. Needless to say the comedic intent of the film in plain light is witnessed amongst its cool as fsck action and special effects one would come to expect these days, Hollywood has truly come a long way in producing outrageous real-as-life technicality in the stunt department I must admit. Wilson's team of ensembled mutants was refreshingly well selected with each member appropriating their own distinctly unique gimmick and comedic force into the act. Domino was one female on the team which seemed to stand out in the action and beauty department, she was hot as fsck with a sort of catlike strut about her, she was awesome. The plot and overall progressive nature of the story left nothing to be undesired in the popcorn movie department; There was especially this air of mysticism and infiltrative allure in the way the drama was shot and its action scenes executed. This film was one super fun ride fo sho!"

"ravithejaabboju","9","2","4","18 May 2018"," Deadpool is back with a bang!
","Deadpool aka Wade Wilson is back with a bang, this time with a family movie. Deadpool turns out to be another blockbuster outcoming from Marvel. Marvel always makes sure that it never misses a target. Deadpool stands out one of the best superhero films ever made. As usually Ryan Reynolds is remarkable in his Wade Wilson/Deadpool role, his comic timing, emotions, one liners, love and all makes us to fall for the character Deadpool once again. Josh Brolin is menacing and terrific in his role Cable. His screen presence is just awesome. Cable's characterization is the best one in recent times. He perfectly fits in his role and emotes every thing exceptionally. Cable's actually not a bad ass in this movie, he has a good heart which you have to watch it on screen. Julian Dennison as Firefist, the guy who Cable is looking for, he is also exceptional in his role. Zazie Beetz as Domino has got ultimate elevation scenes and she provides a very strong support to Deadpool in the proceedings. Negasonic Teenage Warhead, the longest name ever, she also got enough screen time in this movie. Colossus provides ample support to Deadpool again. The whole X-Force team found by Deadpool is just amazing and tries to stop Cable. The story of Deadpool 2 is entirely different form the first movie, Deadpool. There are too many characters in this film. Right from the word go, the movie is both engaging and funny. You shouldn't dare to miss the epic titles rolling. The first 10 minutes of the movie surprises you and brings an exclamatory mark on our faces. All the action sequences were extraordinary, same as in Deadpool. Dialogues were hilarious and mocks DC franchise mostly. There are too many Marvel, DC and other references in this movie. The best one is ""I'm Batman"". Comparing Deadpool 2 with Deadpool, I can say Deadpool is the best and favorite for most of the people. Deadpool is more funny than Deadpool 2, but makes your bones tickle in this one too. I was too late to mention our favorite character, Dopinder, he actually kills the bad guy(Spoiler alert). The post credits scenes of Deadpool 2 are the best ever from Marvel franchise. Flash is not only the one who changes timelines(Spoiler alert no.2). The biggest surprise is the Wolverine(Spoiler alert no.3). Finally, Deadpool kills Ryan Reynols aka Green Lantern(Spoiler alert no.4).
Final word- Don't miss Deadpool 2!"

","Remember when the very concept of making a Deadpool movie was a risk that no sane person or studio would dare to undertake? That was just over two years ago. Defying naysayers and sceptics, Deadpool became a cultural phenomenon: a seriously silly, smart, self-aware comedy that merrily skewered the entire superhero movie genre (sometimes literally), while repeatedly shattering box-office records and the fourth wall. If you enjoyed Deadpool's irresistible blend of satire, violence and irreverence, Deadpool 2 will be right up your alley. It's more (literally much more) of the same - in a (mostly) good way: this is blithely rude, clever filmmaking, funny and fresh enough that you'll be willing to forgive the movie its shortcomings.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool - a super-dude (not quite a hero, almost certainly not a villain) blessed and cursed with the inability to die. When we meet Wade again, he is trying - and mostly failing - to come to terms with how his work as a mercenary endangers those whom he loves, particularly his girlfriend, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). The tragedy of Deadpool - both the character and this film - is that his superpower can mend his body and his bones but, unfortunately, cannot put a broken heart back together again. <br/><br/>Not quite able to put himself out his misery, Wade keeps staggering through the land of the living. During a mission with some third-string X-Men, he encounters Russell (Julian Dennison), a troubled young man with a fiery temper. It's a fateful meeting, for it sets Wade right in the path of Cable (Josh Brolin), a grim, grizzled bounty hunter who's determined to take a life to change a future he cannot accept.<br/><br/>It may sound like a dismal experience, but it's very much not. Deadpool 2 is easily one of the funniest, weirdest films you'll see this year. Emboldened by the runaway success of its predecessor, this sequel dials up the wild, wacky humour to an almost overwhelming degree. Every frame of this film is crammed with jokes: from puns and pop-culture gags to sassy quips and meta references. This is story-telling by way of pastiche and spoof, which allows the film to flit from Celine Dion to '80s cult classic Say Anything and back again. At one point, Deadpool even refers to Cable (grumpiness in half-man, half-machine form) as Thanos - a perfectly pointed nod to Brolin pulling double-duty as the huge-chinned purple antagonist in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>The undeniable highlight of Deadpool 2 is Wade's ill-advised attempt to stop Cable by creating X-Force, his own band of morally ambiguous super-powered individuals. Everything about this endeavour is hilarious: from selecting candidates like Terry Crews' Bedlam and Rob Delaney's schlubby Peter, to leaping into the great unknown with them on their very first mission. It allows for a brilliant sequence demonstrating how Domino (Zazie Beetz) gets by on her powers of extraordinary good luck, as well as a genius split-second cameo that works precisely because it's so damn brief.<br/><br/>Not every joke lands, however - which is unsurprising considering how many are flung in the direction of audiences. There are several moments that are clearly meant to be hysterical but fall flat, which suggests that the script (credited to Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Reynolds) could have benefited from some judicious editing. An extended scene centred on Deadpool's fairly gross regenerative abilities - let's just say it involves a fresh pair of legs - goes on too long and belabours a joke that just barely works the first time around. <br/><br/>With a couple of exceptions, the film doesn't manage to do justice to the supporting characters in Wade's orbit. Beetz's Domino may swagger through scenes as a human blast of cool, breezy fun, but lacks anything resembling a backstory or personality. Russell also feels more like a walking plot point than an actual human person - that's a huge shame, considering the depth of Dennison's talent (cf. Taika Waititi's Hunt For The Wilderpeople). Even Brolin's Cable doesn't get much in the way of characterisation until the final act.<br/><br/>It's a really good thing, then, that the movie manages to stick its surprisingly emotional landing. At every step of the way, this raucous, knockabout comedy chooses the giddy over the grave, the satire over the drama, the caricature over the character. And yet, there's a genuine emotional darkness at the heart of Deadpool 2. The film doesn't shy away from examining the demons that haunt Wade and Cable, which lends real weight to their choices when crap finally gets real and sacrifices have to be made. (In a manner that will delight fans of this pairing in the comics, by the way!)<br/><br/>There's a palpable joy, as well, to Reynolds' performance that is delightful to watch. His own love of the character shines through - and no doubt helped during the film's troubled pre-production process, when creative differences prompted original Deadpool director Tim Miller to leave. (He was replaced by David Leitch, aptly referred to in the credits as 'One of The Guys Who Killed The Dog in John Wick'.) Reynolds is wonderfully adept at the Looney Tunes-style comedy that peppers Deadpool 2, somehow managing to emote even through a mask that completely covers his face. But he also sells Wade's heartbreaking connection to Vanessa, one that he spends the entire film desperate to recover. <br/><br/>At this point in the evolution of superhero movies, we've truly seen it all: from the gritty existentialism of The Dark Knight Rises to the soaring hope of Wonder Woman. Marvel Studios alone has produced a host of films in different genres: spy thrillers, political dramas, crime capers and more. But, in a day and age when special effects can accomplish the impossible, the Deadpool films still stand apart as something entirely different. There's a giddy, unrestrained joy to them that recalls the wild, unchecked imagination of comic books - where anything can happen and nothing is off-limits. That Deadpool 2 manages to fold so much heart into its humour is icing on the cake."

","They definitely put maximum effort into this second outing of the Merc With A Mouth.<br/><br/>This time around, we find Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) in the position of having to save a teenager from being killed by Cable (Josh Brolin) who has come from the future,. With the help of other mutants, Wade must form the X-Force in order to save this kid's life.<br/><br/>Invariably with sequels, especially comedy sequels, there are bound to be repeated riffs from the first film, and there are. However, the humor of Deadpool 2 is very unique from the first film. While both are very tongue-in-cheek, this film has many elements that work better. Whereas the first film had Deadpool for the most part on his own, this film depends on Deadpool bouncing off the supporting cast, and the results are nothing short of hilarious.<br/><br/>While the supporting cast suffers from a lack of any real character development, especially Domino who really would have benefited from some more backstory and increased chances at chemistry with Deadpool, this film is basically non-stop laughs. Whereas movies like Infinity War use humor to break up a serious story, Deadpool 2 uses a serious story to break up the humor, and it is a very important distinction that pays off in the long run.<br/><br/>I would very much recommend you see this film with an audience, as it is in the group laughter (or cringing) that a large part of the enjoyment comes with this film."

","I think it is another sequel where writers were under the pressure of the unexpected success of the first movie.
The biggest mistake was to give real, deep emotions to Deadpool., I felt, those parts are not integrated part of the movie, gives no real value to the storyline. -2 stars.
Beside that it is a great movie, especially for fans of MARVEL's superhero movies (fans of DC universe may not be happy:)) many of the jokes requires knowledge of those films.
Cable, Domino, DeadPool characters were great, good job from actors and actress, other characters were just name dropping, they were added in the right time, often makes me laugh.
I suggest waiting for the mid-post credit scenes, there are great jokes, if you have watched Green Lantern and appearance of Deadpool at the end of Wolverine movie:)"

","Deadpool 2 kicks more ass and are even more crazy than the first one. I still hold the first one as slightly better. DP 2's first act is the best in the movie. The jokes are hilarious, the action is raw and awesome and it is also surprisingly emotional. Deadpool is so one of a kind of a series. It breaks the fourth wall so many times, Deadpool jokes with X-Men actors, movies and cultural references. Unfourtanetely it drops in quality especially in the last act. The humour can be described like some of the lines, «Was that realt necessary?» and «That's disturbing». Deadpool jokes with «that's lazy writing» is funny but does not cover up the fast that it is lazy writing in some parts. Also the scenes where deadpool dies multiple times became just annoying and his quarrels with Cable made me check my watch, it felt dragged out. Still the movie is entertaining and I still give it a high score because of the first 30-40 minutes. Cable is a slightly better villain than Ajax, and I really like how he looks (although Deadpool harass with him ofc). The end credits follow up how insane deadpool is, when Deadpool shoots Ryan Reynolds in the head while reading the script of Green Lantern and also shoots his character in the Wolverine. I'm wondering how they're gonna follow up the next movies. Deadpool is a character who I feel don't have to have many movies because his character is just so crazy that people will eventually be tired of him. Still I enjoy the deadpool movies, it's just funny see a superhero movie where they are so little self righteous about their superheros like superhero movies usually are. Deadpool have no limits when it comes to blood, violence and insulting literally everyone. That is a plus in my book, in these days when we can't joke about anything."

However Deadpool's X-Force, the end credits and the X-Men bits make the movie. The action's tasty and it's not as plasticky and cheap as the first one. Probably get a damn good movie if you halve the first and second ones and then smash them together. The marketing was nice."

We understood them but overall, with its set pieces. Things did not match up. The plot may have been better. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool does good as he is him, but some of the jokes could have been better in sense. Many misses or jokes that felt flat. Josh Brolin's Cable villain was decent but wasn't rally much of a villain (as it turns out in the end), and the kid Russell was annoying from the start.<br/><br/>The character of Domino was a good touch as she stole her scenes, and in the end the use of Juggernaut was also well. Bringing back the female teenage warhead girl and Colossus weren't bothersome. Though overall, this film wasn't as great as expected.<br/><br/>Some of the highlights of the movie were the scenes where Wade assembles his new team (X-force), as the process of finding them. The uniqueness of each character was well thought out and quite funny, also their short timely deaths added some humor in that regard.

"csbob447","7","0","0","9 September 2018"," Still good, not as good as the first
","The first Deadpool, aside from being funny, was a well deserved spin on the superhero genre. So I was excited to see where this movie would take the character. And while it still is gleefully funny and raunchy, it is not quite as good as the first movie. And I think it's because the script this time around was weaker than the first. While it is true that the script never really subverted a lot of the superhero genre as it does blatantly copy all the cliches without much of the clever subversion the movie claimed, I felt that the movie was charming enough to really look pass the glaring issues with the first movie's script. This time around the story was just so much weaker than before, being written around a kid who is just not very good in this movie sadly, although that's because of the poor material he works with, as the character Russell is just not very likable or funny, outside of getting his ass kicked a few times which was funny (child abuse is bad regardless, but still it was funny). And it is in general weird that Deadpool would actually care about this character. It never felt like something he would do, although I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and say that it is true for him in the comics. The action, while not terrible, just felt kind of lazy and uninspired. Which is a shame considering director David Leitch's work on the first John Wick film. The only time I can ever say I felt any thrill was the fight on the prison transport. But other than that it's just by the numbers.<br/><br/>A big surprise was that the jokes and gags that callback to the first film wasn't the biggest problem with the film. Sure they do feel stale and a little lazy (although some callbacks are still funny), but for the most part I was still laughing and having a great time. Sure the constant sex jokes and pop culture references do get old, but the movie still does have a ton of wit to make the movie thoroughly funny regardless of duds that are in the film, largely thanks to Ryan Reynolds being perfect for Deadpool. Cable and Domino do make great editions to the film, as are the return of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (who doesn't get a lot of good lines in this movie like she did in the first film). The visuals and production are also a step up from the first film too, and also the intro is one of the funnest I've seen in a long time, although probably not as funny as the first film. Plus an absolutely brilliant post-credit scene.<br/><br/>It might not live up to the first Deadpool film, but it still is a fun ride regardless. Although I am rather worried that the third film will suck considering the trajectory of trilogies, plus the much weaker writing overall."

And knowing that some of those characters are from the Marvel comics, those hired superhero's had potential to be part of the action and have their own moments in the story. <br/><br/>If the writers wanted to make a scene with superheroes falling to their deaths, it would've been wise to create characters not originally from the comics and let them be amateur heroes who fall into an insane death-spree.<br/><br/>But other than that, it's a good movie."

","The sequel to Deadpool begins with a bang...or should I say ""boom""? It then works backwards to how things arrived at this point, which is rather apt, given how the story will mirror this narrative device later on in the film. Deadpool 2 also revels in the whimper too...it must have the daggiest soundtrack ever used, anywhere...which isn't a bad thing. Right at the start, you hear Air Supply's classic soft rock love song ""All out of love""...which I like. Really like. And I'm not just saying that because I'm an Australian. Didn't mind ""Escape (The piÃ±a colada Song)"" either...but not so much.<br/><br/> It takes something like 15 minutes, I think, for the opening credits to start playing, and I regret not paying attention to this right away, because the film refuses to take this part seriously. If you've ever seen a James Bond film, you'll appreciate the pop-cultural references that Deadpool 2 provides.<br/><br/> The plot of the movie concerns Deadpool being at a low ebb and taking it upon himself to help a troubled teenage mutant (think X-Men material) who flirting with the dark side, is he. That teenager's accent caught my attention...I wondered if he was Australian...or a New Zealander...fortunately Deadpool cleared that up for me...eventually.<br/><br/> Even though I hadn't seen Deadpool since the cinema release and I had only seen it once, I didn't really feel out of the loop like I did with the latest Avengers' movie, ""Avengers: Infinity war"". Speaking of ""Avengers: Infnity war"", since it's not around at the moment, I'll just say that it was good that Deadpool 2 had humour which actually worked. Its batting average for jokes was good, if not quite Bradmanesque. Cf. ""Avengers: Infinity war"", which seems to be have been written by Marvel's C Team's 2nd XI's bench players. The humour is quite postmodern, as in it erases the boundary between the real world and the fictional world of the film...I believe that phrase ""breaking the fourth wall"" is another way of saying this.<br/><br/> One character (metaphorically speaking...since I didn't know nearly all of them) left me feeling a little out of the loop...the bloke from the future...made me wonder if I had missed some film where he appears. He's kinda, sorta introduced to the audience after he's been carrying on for a while. The Marvel Comic Universe (MCU) does seem to rely on having a fan base which requires no introduction to its characters...so none is given.<br/><br/> Another disorientating feature of the film was the use of dream-like sequences. There's more than one. And it made me wonder if more of the film was actually a dream-like state than I had thought...which I don't think it was...but it would be have been good if this wasn't as confusing in the film as it turned out to be.<br/><br/> As for the ending...it does make me wonder if there will be consequences for other MCU franchises, even though I haven't gotten the impression that the Deadpool franchise really sets the agenda for that, as the other MCU franchises do. Also, the ending would seem to require a sequel which directly follows on from the events of this film, although that didn't create any issues for me, as far as feeling tricked into being forced to watch the next one (I got enough out of Deadpool 2 to keep sticking with the franchise, whereas after having seen ""Avengers: Infinity war"", I'm inclined to bail on that franchise...perhaps).<br/><br/> Deadpool was tracking as a 65% kind of movie to me, meaning with my harsh rounding practice I would have given it 6 stars out of 10. However, given that I liked the ending, I've decided to add a ""+"" to the 65%, in order for the film to graduate to a score of 7 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>N.B. It should be noted that this film is very violent at times, with accompanying gore...not for the squeamish at these moments.<br/><br/>Random observations:<br/><br/>* Check out what Deadpool writes on a cereal box in one scene<br/><br/>* Near the end of the movie, it seems a plot hole to me that Deadpool knew what the guy from the future had done...well, not so much a plot hole, as an obvious difficulty in making such story elements coherent... ""paradox"" would be a good word for it, I think<br/><br/>* Lead...I don't think that lead has the properties attributed to it in this film by Deadpool...as with my previous point, I think it's just basically another example of Hollywood type narrative devices which don't really stand up to too much scrutiny...suspend disbelief, in other words<br/><br/>* Also near the end of the movie, when Deadpool is supine, an expression does appear on his face, momentarily, which is uncannily reminiscent of how the Michael Scott character in the US version of ""The office"" would mug. Doubt that that was intentional, just noticeable (to me).<br/><br/>* What's a Jimmy Chunga? Not sure that I spelt that right, either...tried looking it up in the first week of July...didn't find it in the script, but I see my mistake, the word I'm after is ""chimichanga""...and I still have no idea what it means in the context...a meaningless catchphrase invented for the film?<br/><br/>* Note too self: look up ""Juggernaut"" on Wikipedia. I think that Deadpool says that that is his favourite Marvel character...or something...which I can't quite remember. Also look up ""Captain Marvel""...I came across this character when exploring something related to ""Avengers: Infinity war""."
"jake-young96","5","6","20","18 May 2018"," The merc with the mouth has got a muzzle on this time around.
","Wisecracking, fourth wall breaking and foul-mouthed mutant merc with the mouth Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), returns. Bringing together a team of fellow mutants, he goes toe-to-toe with time travelling mutant, Cable (Josh Brolin). Deadpool attempting to stop Cable from assassinating a young boy with superpowers, which Deadpool has taken a liking to.<br/><br/>By far one of the most notable things about Deadpool is that Ryan Reynolds clearly adores this character and I have to agree with the merc himself - he was born to play this role. It is that love for the character that absolutely seeps through the blank expressioned mask that makes Reynolds' performance both in and out of costume as pure as it could ever be. Reynolds is able to bring the larger than life character to the screen with ease, grounded in an absurdist parody of superheroes which unfortunately highlights that this time around the merc's mouth has got a muzzle on.<br/><br/>While there is still plenty of crazy comedy, sequences that do nothing but make you laugh with joy and touching moments to add some depth to the character. Deadpool 2 feels as though it has been reigned in after his first outing. The lines not quite as foul, the comedy not quite as appropriately deranged, the subversion of expectations severely lacking, the parody of the superhero genre somewhat missing and the timing not quite as razor-sharp. Shamefully Deadpool retreats from its subversive nature and instead bases the plot around an emotional core and expecting laughs from its name-drop references. While the emotional backdrop does a lot for making Deadpool more relatable and more grounded, I cannot help but feel this is the opposite of what Deadpool should be. Wade Wilson should be ridiculous but Leitch has turned Deadpool 2 into a generic superhero movie with some splashes of foul-mouthed humour that we expect from this character.<br/><br/>However, Leitch has successfully made Deadpool 2 - bigger. This time around the narrative scope and character arcs are certainly more juicy with more to digest and sink your teeth into. Leitch also successfully manages to add more dynamics to the Deadpool world, tieing it into a larger cinematic landscape without it feeling too forced (Although I fully expect the churning out of an X-Force franchise). It's in Deadpool 2's second half that this bigger scope culminates. Then it really takes off into what we came to see, the generic narrative is put aside in favour of subverting expectations with absurdist comedy and exciting us with large action set pieces that (with some crude CGI aside) rival the first film easily. Sadly its climax is clearly trying too hard and you're left wondering when the quip will come but Deadpool takes this moment far too seriously for a character that shouldn't allow it. It is rectified with one of the most side-splitting end credits scenes I have witnessed but all it did was give me the question ""Why wasn't the whole film like this?"""

A must for comic book fans..."
"dtwelsh-49724","8","3","8","25 May 2018"," If you're looking for substance, Deadpool 2 isn't for you. I wasn't, and had a blast!
","If you love fast-paced action, lots of vulgar jokes, and a character who breaks the forth wall constantly, you'll love Deadpool 2. As a matter of fact, if you loved the first Deadpool movie, you'll love this one ALMOST as much. The first Deadpool movie was better, just because it was something viewers hadn't seen before; a not-so-righteous super hero who makes jokes while killing the bad guys. And since Deadpool, Marvel has discovered that it can make lots of cash by including R rated super hero movies in the MCU.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie is, and it sounds cliche, but sometimes you just want to go to see a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. This movie is the epitome of that. Being a Marvel fan, and a Marvel movie fan, there were plenty of inside jokes that the casual fan may or may not get. Even so, the casual fan will have plenty to laugh at, if they enjoy lots and lots of raunchy, juvenile humor, like I do. <br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds was great this time around, but it was the newcomers to the franchise, Josh Brolin (Cable) and Domino (Zazzie Beatz) who stood out. With snagging the roles of both Cable and Thanos this year, Josh Brolin should send Kevin Feige a big, old gift basket. Cable was the perfect straight man to Deadpool's buffoon, and he embodied the deadliest of dead pan. Domino, with the powers of luck, had a scene fighting Cable that was beyond action-packed, and she could spout off funny one-liners with the best of them.<br/><br/>T.J. Miller and Karan Soni had expanded roles as Wade Wilson's buddies, which was just OK, in my opinion. Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead wasn't in this one as much as I would have liked to see, but there were just so many characters, it was hard for them all to vie for scene time. Stefan Kapicic, who voices Colossus, had another fairly big role as Deadpool's number one bro-mance. Colossus's fight at the end with Juggernaut was a showdown that ever Marvel fan wanted to see.<br/><br/>Over all, if you're looking for a movie with substance, skip this one. It's not serious, and doesn't pretend to be. If you just want to be a fanboy for a few hours and laugh your head off, go see this movie."
"FilmNerd2017","10","3","8","20 May 2018"," The perfect sequel for Deadpool
","Two years ago, I was introduced to Deadpool, the most amazingly unconventional anti-hero of all time, where his ability to break the fourth-wall and deliver the crudest of jokes was finally displayed on the silver screen in an X-Men spin-off film made partly to make up for that crummy Wolverine film from 2009. And now the sequel has arisen.<br/><br/>The story for this one is perfect for a sequel. It actually manages finds a way to develop the character of the wisecracking merc-with-a-mouth and a bit further from the last film. This story is also a lot more emotional than the previous one in the perfect way. Plus, one thing that makes the plot for this one a tad more superior to the first film is how the events are presented in a much more linear and sequential order, whereas the first film jumped around different points in time, which is one of the few little things that bothered me before.<br/><br/>The humor is about as funny as the first film's. But the most monumental laughs result from these scenes during the credits. I can't tell you why, but these scenes made me laugh 10x as hard as the time when I first saw Drax try to master the art of invisibility by standing incredibly still.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific. Ryan Reynolds proved in the first film that he was born for this role, and he still proves it today. He continues to perfectly portray the funniest and most bloodthirsty Marvel anti-hero ever. Josh Brolin does a good job playing the battle-hardened Cable while playing Thanos around the same time during production for this movie. The rest of the cast still carry the charm they delivered from before like T.J. Miller as Weasel, Karan Soni as Dopinder the cab driver, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and Brianna Hildebrand as the ""moody (mutant) teen"" with ""the coolest name ever."" I also really enjoyed Domino, played by Zazie Beetz, and how she and Deadpool are constantly bickering about her abilities. And Julian Dennison is also great as tough mutant urchin Russel/Firefist.<br/><br/>There's not a whole lot to say about the action scenes. All I can say is that the film has action scenes that are awesome to watch, and they each find a few good jokes to mix in. In fact, the final battle has music that works great for the sake of humor. Listen very hard for any dramatic-chorus theme. Plus, speaking of music, I loved the Celine Dion song.<br/><br/>This film is definitely the best sequel possible for Deadpool. It does everything a sequel should do, with some unique traits of its own. So in conclusion...WAKANDA FOREV...I mean...X-FORCE!!!"
"brennandube","8","3","8","20 May 2018"," Great fun all around, deeper plot than the first, slightly better than the first.
","After watching this film I can say two things, Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role and R-rated superhero films are absolutely kick-ass. 'Deadpool 2', much like the first, knows exactly what type of film it's trying to be and absolutely owns it. It's quite definite now that the first installment was not a fluke and I am already eager to see Reynolds back on screen as Deadpool again. The film opens with a moment that was very surprising and took me well off guard. This is a spoiler free review but I will say that what happens early on in the film offers our hero a new challenge on many different levels. That's what sequels are all about, giving the main character challenges greater than in the first, and the writers did that perfectly. I will say when I found out director Tim Miller was not returning to direct this sequel I was nervous for where it would go and if the tone would stay the same. When I discovered David Leitch (director of 'John Wick' and 'V for Vendetta') was set to helm the sequel my worries disappeared, and rightfully so. Leitch completely embraces the tone from the first film and did an incredible job directing this movie. He did such a good job that I hope to see him back at the helm of another potential 'Deadpool' film down the road. 
The film is flat-out hilarious, one of the reasons the first movie was so much fun was because of its sheer dark comedy and that was back in full force in the sequel. 'Deadpool 2' was extremely funny and it made for yet another fun time at the movies. Keep in mind, not all the one liners in this movie land perfectly and that is expected in a film like this, but overall there is not much of a gripe regarding that. 'Deadpool 2' is able to do something that it didn't do in the first - a balance of heart and comedic tone. Let's face it, these films thrive when it's time for some comedy but this film was able to adapt a more serious, emotionally touching tone than the first and it brought Reynolds' character, 'Wade Wilson', down to earth a little. <br/><br/>
The rest of the cast in the movie did an incredibly good job. Josh Brolin as 'Cable' was bad-ass to see on screen. It felt like it took a little while for Brolin to actually start kicking ass in this film but whenever he is on screen, he is quite entertaining. I felt as if the movie should've explored 'Cable' a little more but as the movie progresses you do learn more about this character and it was fulfilling in that way. Zazie Beetz as 'Domino' in this film was rather good and she provides some good action sequences as well as some subtle wit. 'Colossus' and 'Negasonic' are both great in this movie as their characters continued from the first movie, but I wished they explored these characters a little more. I personally found Julian Dennison who plays 'Russell Collins/Firefist' to be the one clear weak spot in this film acting-wise. His role in the film is rather important as he pieces together the big challenge that Reynolds must face but I did not like their chemistry nor did I enjoy his isolated moments in the movie. 
'Deadpool 2' got a huge increase in budget from the first film so this movie was clearly a much more extravagant and CGI centered film but there were times when two CGI characters went head to head that I did not fully buy into the special effects being used and I won't go as far to say that it took me out of the film, but it was a notable weakness. The rest of the action sequences in this film are awesome. Much like the first movie, there is gore... and a lot of it. The fight scenes in this movie with Brolin and Reynolds are ridiculously awesome and quite a lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>The Big Plus: Ryan Reynolds as 'Wade Wilson/Deadpool' is truly the role he was born to play. Incredible stuff from him and he is a thrill to watch yet again... Also, make sure to stay for the mid-credits montage.<br/><br/>Where it lacks: I would've liked to have seen more development from the secondary characters but to keep runtime down I understand why it was pretty much all 'Deadpool' based. <br/><br/>83/100 for me!"

"subxerogravity","8","3","8","18 May 2018"," X gonna give it to ya! Not as good as the first one however.
","The level of action vs. comedy was uneven throughout the film, with Deadpool trying too hard to have a story with substance .<br/><br/>I loved the classic comic book story line of Deadpool trying to stop a cyborg from the future from killing a kid that destroyed it as an adult. <br/><br/>As a comic book fan, I did raise an eyebrow when I saw how different Domino looks from her comic book version, but Zazie Beetz easily broke the mold with her portrayal of the character. She's so cute and funny that you no longer cared. <br/><br/>What was a minus was the treatment of the character Shatterstar. I loved the fact that he was also played, by someone who was a different ethnicity than in the comic (but easier to get away with because overall, technically Shatterstar is an alien from another dimension), but as a fan of the character they missed a golden opportunity here, similar to what they did to Deadpool in X-Men origins: Wolverine. <br/><br/>Same with the treatment of Terry Crews who could have used more air time (He needs to be a superhero). <br/><br/>Josh Brolin's Cable was no where near Josh Brolin's Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. He looked good as the time traveling Cyborg, but like Shatterstar, he was far too one dimensional and is not that interesting. <br/><br/>I like the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople as Russell, the fire fist. He makes Deadpool an X-Men story and was really the only substance the movie needed if they were looking for this to be more than an action comedy.<br/><br/>It's rare that the these Marvel Franchises don't get better as they go along: X2 is better than X-Men, Days of Future Past is better than First Class (in a lot of ways). It's not like DP 2 is not a great movie, it absolutely is, thanks to Ryan Reynolds understanding of Wade Wilson. The same type of understanding that made Hugh Jackman the perfect Wolverine despite not being right for the role (it's true). Also, give credit for finding the right people to play Domino and Russell. <br/><br/>The magic is not there.The action is not as good and the timing of the comedy is not as tight as the first film, plus some of the jokes seem so focus for Fanboys that I seemed to be the only person laughing in the theater (and that's saying something cause when you see a movie like this at midnight the whole place is filled with Fanboys).<br/><br/>I'm wondering if I should blame Disney who may have altered the final cut to make it less R rated, because that was a big thing about the first film that made it solid gold. <br/><br/>I don't mean to discourage, I'm just warning you not to get your hopes up."

"BA_Harrison","9","4","13","18 May 2018"," Dead cool too!
","If you enjoyed the heck out of the first Deadpool film, there's a very good chance that you'll be thoroughly entertained by this sequel as well. It's essentially more of the same, without being exactly the same. We get more extreme violence, more smart-ass quips courtesy of the main character, more breaking of the fourth wall, more in-jokes, and more expletives; all of this is wrapped up by an easy-to-follow plot that sees Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) trying to find a reason to carry on living after a split second mistake results in the death of his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).<br/><br/>Director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) does a fine job in emulating the style and tone set by Tim Miller's original, and ably delivers plenty of giggles to go with the action (although none of the gags made me laugh quite as hard as the gaggle of nerdy Marvel fanboys in the seats behind me, who clearly wanted everyone else in the audience to know that they got ALL of the clever references). An excellent soundtrack adds to the excitement, with everything from AC/DC's Thunderstruck (which accompanies the beginning of one of the film's funniest action scenes that features almost as many sudden superhero deaths as Infinity War), to Skrillex's dubstep anthem Bangarang.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the X-Men cameos, an appearance (or should that be 'disappearance') from Brad Pitt as The Vanisher, and a hilarious Basic Instinct-inspired shot during the scene in which Deadpool grows a new pair of legs."

"cherold","8","2","5","6 March 2019"," Iffy start, but ultimately hugely entertaining
","I was a big fan of the first Deadpool, which was both hilarious and had a strong sense of character. So I was really looking forward to Deadpool 2. But if I hadn't seen the first movie, I probably would have given up on this one after 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Deadpool traveling the world killing people. Who are these people? Why is he killing them? Do they deserve to die, and if so, do they deserve to die in such sadistic ways? The movie doesn't tell us; it's just fancily choreographed slaughter.<br/><br/>Then Deadpool experiences tragedy, and after a really clever title sequence based on that, we get about 20 minutes of our hero being really depressed. Which isn't all that much fun.<br/><br/>So after about a half hour of setup, the actual story kicks in and the movie -- finally! -- becomes fun. And once it starts being fun it never stops. It gets crazy, there's some sort of reason for all the violence, it is full of hilarious jokes, and it's more-or-less what I remember from the first movie.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is Domino, a superhero whose power is good luck. A scene based entirely on a series of fortunate coincidences is one of the best in the movie, and I really, really want to see Domino (played with kick-ass bravado by Zazie Beetz) get her own movie, although I assume she won't in spite of a lot of people wanting it because Hollywood won't be able to handle building a huge epic around a black woman (guaranteed some Hollywood exec is saying, ""we can't do it; Catwoman was a bomb"").<br/><br/>I can't agree with all the people saying Deadpool 2 is better than the first movie; the first movie was consistently good all the way through and had a better handle on the balance between spectacle and character. But 3/4ths of this movie is absolutely terrific."

","On a very base level this is an enjoyable comedy. One has to view it censoring all the cynicism, f-words, needless toilet humor kind of like watching 'MASH' of 1970. As usual in modern films it is almost impossible to locate a hero figure or idol. Everyone here lives in a gray zone between good and bad. It is to the film's detriment that they used a grossly obese teenager to try and garner empathy from the audience especially since Ryan Reynolds saps all the energy out of the film with his raw and sarcastic comic shtick which then makes the film a dark brooding piece of moral rubber. If he is the hero and we are supposed to believe he is really trying to be a kinder understanding person, why is he determined to undermine it at every turn or rather why are the writers trying to bring us closer to the mundane trailer trash mind while pushing an ending that is opposite and not believable? The fact is that almost nobody could like this child actor in the center of the film let alone the actors IN the film!? There is nothing to like about a spoiled brat sociopath who lives in comic bookland mentally. The writers seem to be saying that psychopaths are made not born when in fact psychopaths are born! Once again we live in a world in which pc people wish everyone to believe that we are all OK and good at heart even if we kill people for kicks like 'Dexter' did. The visits to limbo where he encounters his dead gf are idiotic. Firstly, Reynolds is so obviously gay and apparently has swallowed the current fad of acting 'bisexual' and 'metrosexual'. He's just this side of a flaming queen. He flirts with homosexual behavior constantly but then believes if his gf lived they'd be happy ever after. (I'm now going to vomit.) Typical Hollywood and America."

A few examples are the superhero landing joke, the empire not star wars joke, the fake intro credits thing, the tiny regenerating appendage scene, and maybe a few more i can't think of.

","Don't approach this as a super hero flick. This is Grand Guignol. Hollywood has a once in a decade success.<br/><br/>There are amazing comedies we watch alone. In company, we'd laugh in pack instinct. Alone we acknowledge the humour quietly. Few make you laugh out loud alone. The unique make you wet yourself. This is that film.<br/><br/>I watched it alone. I was afraid I'd wake the neighbours. Yes, I laughed. Loudly, to the point I did piss myself. I had to pause video because I could not take it all at once. This is a work of perverted genius.<br/><br/>Is it great cinema a la Aguirre? No. Is it great entertainment? Oh jesus shoot me. This is the greatest thing since _Fight Club_, to which it owes a partial (unacknowledged) influence. This is pure magic that deserves a 10. Black. dark, perverted humor has a new benchmark. Infinitely superior to original (rare)."
"paul_haakonsen","8","2","5","7 August 2018"," Every bit as enjoyable as the first movie...
","Granted, I am not one that is particularly keen on superhero movies, and usually tend to only sit down to watch them with someone else who is interested in watching such movies. However, I did like the first ""Deadpool"" movie, so of course I also wanted to watch the sequel.<br/><br/>I must admit that ""Deadpool 2"" was every bit as funny, action-packed, colorful and witty as its predecessor was. So if you enjoyed the first movie, then you will definitely also like the sequel.<br/><br/>There was a bit more focus on humor and jokes aimed below the belt this time, so that might work against the movie if you don't even that kind of humor. I found the humor to be funny though, so it worked out well enough for me.<br/><br/>The storyline was good, and I really liked the Cable character. And Josh Brolin was really well-cast for that role. Just puzzled me somewhat why they opted to go with him for both Cable in this movie and Thanos in the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" movie. Sure, you can't see it is him in that movie, but still...<br/><br/>The characters in ""Deadpool 2"" were every bit as colorful, interesting and funny as the characters were in the first movie. Aside from Deadpool and Cable being favorite characters, then I also think that Domino was a rather interesting character, and they had opted for a great choice by casting Zazie Beetz for that role.<br/><br/>The special effects were fantastic in ""Deadpool 2"", but then again they have always been so in all the Marvel movies, so I guess that is a standard of expectations for these movies.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed ""Deadpool 2"" for what it was; which was an equally entertaining movie as the first ""Deadpool"" movie, so just lean back and enjoy the ride, have the laughs and learn new jokes as the movie progress."

There are only a few movies that I've watched more than once in my life and then it'll usually be years before I'd watch those again, but I can't wait for DP2 to come out on DVD to watch it again.<br/><br/>The humour was as good or better than the original and now they had a bigger budget that I felt was spent very wisely to add some eye-candy to it."
"Alanaji_16","8","2","5","22 July 2018"," ""DEADPOOL 2""- MY REVIEW
","HE IS BACK!!! And this time he isn't alone. Back in 2016, we saw the rise of an anti - hero, Deadpool, who was foul mouthed but at the same time witty and adorable. So fortunately, the expectations for DP2 will be higher. So how's the film? Let's take a look. But before that the plot... Wade Wilson a.k.a Deadpool is a now a well know mercenary. After the murder of his wife Vanessa, he decides to commit suicide, but is saved in time by Colossus, who in turn asks him to join the X - men. Meanwhile, DP takes the responsibility of protecting a mutant child, Russelles a.k.a Firefist from a time travelling soldier Cable. 
 That's all I can tell u about the plot. The film is however slightly better than the first part. Anyway, that doesn't , mean that it's devoid of R rated violence . There r cuss words, body being teared apart, wire plugged into a#@ and so on. Anyway this is the best superhero movie this year along with Infinity war. The technical parts of the film were all good. Be it the usage of the background score during action scenes or the visual effects, all were done neatly. Dialogues were witty and has a lot of references to the old and latest released films. Action scenes were slick and not overdone. Editing was good , but there was some dragging felt towards the middle portion. 
 Now to the performances. Ryan Reynolds just rocked as Deadpool. His performance is sure to be appreciated. Josh Brolin as Cable was at par with Reynolds. Also the reference to his character, ""THANOS"" was funny. Another memorable performance was that of Zazie Beetz as Domino. Stefan Kapicic as Colossus had a small role but his scenes with DP are sure to bring in laugh out loud moments. Rest of the supporting cast were good, especially Karan Soni as Dopinder.
So all in all, DP 2 is superior than its first part . Go in and have a BLAST..... My rating- 4/5
P.S: Don't miss the mid credit scenes. They r the best seen in recent times...."

","Let me say off the bat that I'm really happy with Marvel's decision to take a chance on the first Deadpool movie based on the strength of the demo Reynolds made. As we all know, it paid out handsomely. And for good reason! It was fun, funny, and had... a story. I wont say it was great, but without Morena Baccarin, it wouldnt have been what it was. <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 was good. I liked it. The cameos were awesome and unexpected, Josh Brolin and the woman who played Domino were great, and the action scenes were decent. Morena Baccarin was good again. My complaint is with all the 4th wall breaking and the avalanche of pop culture, MCU, DC, and other relevant jokes. It takes away from the story. Yeah, I know it sounds funny. Like anyone went to see Deadpool 2 for the story. But when you have a storyline that requires a bit of acting and emotion, it's hard to buy into it when it's preceded and followed by ""thanos fart dildo Wolverine buttplug lol"" jokes like, for 20 minutes at a time.<br/><br/>Again, I did like it, and I did think there were plenty of funny moments, but it'd be neat if Reynolds could find a way to stop sucking himself off so much in the next one. I'm sure there are plenty of others would do it for him. Not that I'm volunteering."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","5","29 May 2018"," Solid sequel
","""Deadpool"" was a fun superhero comedy that was fresh and original. ""Deadpool 2"" is pretty much the same movie just without the freshness and originality. Despite this, it's a funny sequel that fans of the first film with enjoy. In the age of ""Black Panther,"" ""Avengers"" and a thousand different Spiderman movies, it's nice to have a raunchy, bloody comedic anti-hero put the other boring, stagnant superheroes in their place. I was hoping for a less obnoxious plot and maybe some more time from just Deadpool and not the overreacted supporting charters, but this is an enjoyable sequel that should hopefully end this franchise for good."

"AnishMisra","8","2","5","24 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 Review
","Deadpool 2 is a film directed by David Leitch. The trailers for this film looked fantastic. And, since I liked the first one I was looking forward to this film. And yes, Team Deadpool has delivered is what I can say.<br/><br/>Plot: Deadpool must save Firefist from Cable, a time travelling soldier, who has a grudge on him.<br/><br/>Story and direction: From the first shot itself, the mood is set. I also liked the way they actually had a kind of James-Bond song for the film. The film doesn't feel like a studio film who just wants to make money out of a successful venture. I can give that credit to the team. It retains the things that made the first film a success and just develops on that. Also, we do get to see Deadpool getting a whole lot of drama, which was something I wasn't expecting. But that was good since I got to see a whole new persona of Deadpool. And this film just doesn't feel like a set-up for future instalments which normally is the trend now in Hollywood. Since we have David Leitch on the director's chair, how is it not possible for the action scenes to be awesome? The score by Tyler Bates was awesome. I am a fan of the kind of music he incorporates to his films. Also the VFX has improved from the last time, although still there was one particular sequence that just felt CG-ed to mess. AS with the last film, I felt much wasn't going on in the story department. It's a kind of story that is seen before. Since the makers wanted to introduce a human aspect to the film, I felt the jokes were little less than the previous part.<br/><br/>Performances: Ryan Reynolds juts embraces this character of Dedapool. You just can't picture anyone else, since he is just perfect. Josh Brolin just proves that he is a brilliant actor who just can do any kind of role. T J Miller and Morena Baccarin were good too. Karan Soni's was also fantastic in what he was given. Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand also provided good support. Julian Dennison gave an earnest performance. Last but not the least I felt Domino was just superb.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one between Colossus and Deadpool during the final fight. I remember laughing so hard in that scene. The kind of chemistry these 2 characters have is like no other.<br/><br/>Verdict: Even with a few flaws, I still thought that Deadpool 2 was an entertaining film. I had a great time watching the film. Hopefully, the future films will be as good as or even better than this one. If I have to compare with the first part, I will say that the first part was better. Do wait for the mid credit scenes. I just loved that. It was so hilarious. <br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"garygwilliams","9","2","5","23 May 2018"," A guilty pleasure that shows why breaking the rules sometimes pays off.
","Ok, I admit it. During violent movies I will close my eyes periodically. I did it in John Wick. I did it in Kingsmen - The Secret Service. In this movie, I always reopened them too early. It is a violent, foul mouthed, politically incorrect movie about a hero only a mother could love. Oops, theat's his face. Oops, his mother would be appalled. This is the movie his ffans wanted and he delivered. The X-Force concept was executed perfectly. My favorite character was Domino because she reminds me of Angela Davis back in the day. Josh Brolin is tired as Cable but it fits the character. Morena Baccarin as his wife is the personification of hot girl loves bad boy."

","I'll keep this as short and simple as I can. Based off the trailers, I was expecting an ""Avengers"" team-up crapfest of a sequel -- but I will say that the trailers did not do this movie justice; in fact, it was almost downright misleading (in the best way possible).<br/><br/>The first 15 or so minutes were somewhat sloppy and stale, and a lot of the jokes landed flat. But the last half is where the movie really gets good, and it made having to sit through the beginning completely worth it.<br/><br/>Some characters from the first film have a much smaller role, while others (well, one other) has a bigger arc that suits him well. Yukio was surprisingly delightful to watch, and her chemistry with Deadpool was the strongest out of the bunch.<br/><br/>This sequel is far less funny than the first one, but it has more heart, which in my opinion makes it as (or almost as) good as the first one. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first."

"kubapawlowski","9","2","5","20 May 2018"," Another Superhero Landing
","Deadpool 2 comes two years after the wildcard film of 2016 Deadpool. Does it live up to the hype...<br/><br/>For me absolutely yes, I found myself laughing throughout the film in the two showings that I went to. Like all comedies though not all jokes land with everyone but humour is subjective and there is enough jokes in this film to rival the past 3 MCU films however its not flooded with potty humour such as in the first film, instead most of the jokes are the meta references and fourth wall breaks. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the first film (which you should) you may be in for a surprise; Deadpool 2 is very much like a Deadpool comic you take a simple story, then throw in Deadpool and the absurdity goes though the roof. Obviously they wouldn't be able to do that with their main star Ryan Reynolds who portrays the character like no one ever could in my eyes. Although most times I ended up liking the supporting characters more as they were so unique. It was just a shame that we didn't see more of negasonic teenage warhead (pff I know) as she was a personal favourite of mine in the first film.<br/><br/>If there was one thing that bothered me with this film it would have to be some of the CGI, this film is definitely ambitious and you can see see the budget running low with some of the big set pieces.<br/><br/>Overall Deadpool 2 is a solid action/comedy that lives up to the hype for me and I would recommend watching this film for both die hard and casual fans."
"yeehung5","9","2","5","20 May 2018"," Definitely a family oriented movie

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","5","20 May 2018"," Second verse, same as the first... for better, and occasionally, for worse
","Deadpool(Reynolds, in the party was born to play) continues to struggle with the idea of him being a hero. Will he try to be there for Firefist(Dennison, struggling with his powers and temper), or not? Things come to a head when the kid is targeted by the time travelling Cable(Brolin, badass and motivated). What reason does he have to kill a teenager?<br/><br/>Other than ditching the flashback aspect of the structure(the rest remains in place), and obviously the origin story, since that's out of the way, this is the same movie as we got the first time. Except it's bigger, and somewhat different in a few other necessary ways. As much as I love the 2016 film, in most ways, this is an improvement. Obviously the action and scope are increased, since the budget is. But in other areas, more is a good, not bad, thing. This time around, quipping isn't limited to the title character and Weasel(Miller, admittedly funny, despite, as we now know, being a scumbag), rather, basically every major character gets to(adding to the overall world having that flavor, which it already did to some extent). And they all get to be memorable in other ways as well. While I'll admit that the larger cast worried me, they gave everyone the right amount of screen time. With nearly all major scenes and jokes revisited or redone in some way(since they worked the first time), it's noteworthy and impressive that they're greater here. With few exceptions. The franchise building, though the marketing can make it seem obtrusive and excessive, is handled well. I can't wait to see more of Domino(Beetz, an inspired choice).<br/><br/>This has a lot of strong language and bloody, gory violence. It's also frequently offensive, crossing the lines of what's politically correct. I recommend this to any fan of DP. 8/10"

In fact it is an antihero. <br/><br/>This movie shows that the characters are flawed, which is a human trait. <br/><br/>This movie is different, and refreshing, which is hard to find these days."

"JosephD3193","9","2","5","20 May 2018"," An Incredibly Enjoyable Sequel That Really Delivers
","I had high hopes going into this film, but also some worries that they'd make Deadpool too much of what he is. But they really impressed me with what they made. Deadpool 2 does everything the first did, and a little more. <br/><br/>Despite what I've heard other people say about the choice of killing of Vanessa at the beginning of the movie, I actually thought it was a great plot element/motivation that didn't feel set up or forced in any way. Although, an issue I have with the aftermath of this, is that I feel like Wade, emotionally, gets over it too quickly. Fortunately, this does lead into some really mesmerizing and beautiful scenes of Wade communicating with Vanessa in the afterlife (it may have been consciously). It's also nice to see them take a real focus on Wade's personal life, which transitions into the main plot of the movie.<br/><br/>Wade has to protect a Mutant teenager named Russell, of which Wade feels sympathy for since the headmaster of the building Russell is held at tortures/abuses him. This also makes Wade reflect on his past with his own father who wasn't such a great father figure for him. However, Wade and Russell are arrested and are put devices around their necks which doesn't allow them to use their powers/mutations. We see a different side of Wade in the prison as he is no longer sympothizing with Russell, but rather relenting him since he gets Wade in trouble and severely hurt by other inmates. The relationship between thee two characters constantly change throughout the film, but make sense since Russell is only 15-16 and has still not fully matured. I liked the prison sequences and thought they worked well on developing the eventual change on which side Russell chooses to take, which is going against Wade and wanting to kill the headmaster. Overall, I wasn't a big fan of Russell in the movie really at all, but he was given enough character development that I gave at least a couple cares in the world about him.<br/><br/>When Cable enters the picture, it takes the film to a WHOLE new level story wise. Cable's come from the future to kill Russell because in the future, Russell kills Cable's wife and daughter. I do feel that Cable was a bit underdeveloped and I felt myself really wanting to see more of him the film, but it *is* a DEADPOOL movie, and they're saving that for the eventual 'X-Force' film that's supposed to be coming out. Never the less, the time when Cable *is* in the movie, he is completely badass and did feel properly used. And this leads into the best sequence of the movie, the car chase. The scene is really well-choreographed/directed, and this goes for nearly all the other action scenes in the entire movie. And I wouldn't expect any less from the John Wick director. The Kill Bill-like scenes in the beginning with Deadpool slicing people's limbs off especially felt like the John Wick style. Cable is really awesome in this sequence and it's so cool to see him in this movie in general.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Zazie Beetz (Domino) and Ryan Reynolds is really great and I wish we saw more of her as well. But again, they'll probably explore her character more later. She stole a lot of the scenes she was in and fought off her enemies almost effortlessly. This sequence of Deadpool forming his team also includes one of my favorite jokes, while talking about Josh Brolin/Cable, ""He's short! 5'11""! Not like in the comics!"". And of course Peter, who saw the ad, and thought it looked fun. And then they kill of the whole team (excluding Domino and Deadpool). Yep. They just all die while jumping out of a plane with parachutes. That was absolutely hilarious! <br/><br/>The ending is I guess a bit cliche-ish, but still a good moment between the characters.<br/><br/>The comedy, as expected, was really, REALLY funny and landed almost every time. The opening and end credits scenes are what really made me almost choke on my food . Deadpool going back in time after given a time traveling mechanism and killing the terrible 2009 version of Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and also killing the real life Ryan Reynolds version of himself about to read the 'Green Lantern' script were ingenious and made me laugh so hard.<br/><br/>Also, a cool little tidbit they put in there was as the X-Force were jumping out of the helicopter, everyone unintentionally formed an 'X' when everyone's bodies lines up. That was a nice little detail.<br/><br/>But overall, I do personally think this is better than it's predecessor and worth seeing twice in the theater.<br/><br/>RATING: 8.8/10"
"thomasgrindol","8","2","5","19 May 2018"," An underwhelming first half saved by a great second half.
","The movie started off by repeating some of the jokes from the first one. They killed off the henchmen, had Deadpool kill some guys which upset Colossus, and just repeated an occasional line or moment. When Deadpool was in the prison the movie lost a lot of momentum, he wasn't funny, nothing interesting happened and it just felt underwhelming. When X-Force was introduced and was killed off a few minutes later it brought the film back. The comedy became much better and it moved at a faster pace. The action also significantly improved as well and the characters had more meaning. The end credits scenes were also funny and poked fun at themselves. Ultimately, a slow if not bad start saved by a second half comeback."
"rockman182","8","2","5","19 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 (2018)
","Like many others, I did enjoy Deadpool when it came out a few years back. it was a refreshing and very self aware film that wasn't afraid to break the fourth wall and really go for it. Add to that that it was one of the few R-rated comic book/superhero films, which ultimately made for a fun time. Now after the dust settles from Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2 comes out and immediately from the trailers you can tell its going for its referential and aware humor. Sequels do not always work but I think in this films case it comes close to the original.<br/><br/>The film picks up after the events of the first film, but this time there is a young mutant named Russell Collins who Deadpool gets intertwined with. A time traveling soldier named Cable (very reminiscent of a Terminator) comes back in time to try to kill Collins. Deadpool is also trying to recruit a group of superheroes to come together to stop cable, and he wants to call them the X-Force. The film keeps many of the characters from the first film while adding new faces, the most worthy addition being Domino (played by Zazie Beetz).<br/><br/>If you don't like the first Deadpool you won't like this one. Its more of the same. There is high paced and every present action scenes, lot of bloody and gory scenes, foul language, and clever humor and a light hearted comedic attitude throughout. The film makes plenty of references to film tropes and other super hero films (as expected). I think the addition of David Leitch as director was great. The action scenes are excellent to watch, and Leitch is no stranger to style when it comes to fight scenes, having helmed Atomic Blonde and John Wick previously.<br/><br/>The story may be somewhat predictable, but the character interactions, the humor and the fast paced action make the film a fun ride. One cannot deny the charm that Ryan Reynolds brings to the Deadpool character, its a high point of the film. I also loved Zazie Beetz as Domino, love her in Atlanta. There is plenty going on and while the film could easily become sappy, tired, or cheesy, it doesn't really wander into that territory. I didn't like the very ending of the film and I feel like it prolongs a problem I see in these recent crop of super hero films.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first Deadpool but feel like the sequel is just as good, if not slightly better. This film has a much better villain and the supporting characters are utilized better. Its references are just as smart as the first, and this franchise and its lead character haven't really lost a bit, though it runs the risk of doing that with future installments. Deadpool 2 meets expectations.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Deadpool 2 (2018, David Leitch)<br/><br/>After the success of the first Deadpool after Fox gambled on an R rated super hero film with a lower budget in the X-universe, they have come back with another hard R rated chapter with only a slightly bigger budget. We see some old faces and some new characters with even some surprises. <br/><br/>The film is well made and has amazing action and combat sequences that put the last couple of films in the MCU to shame.. take note Disney/Marvel... this is how you shoot combat. The film is also hilarious, for the most part matching the laugh hit-rate and almost the unexpected heart that the first film had. It is however a bloodier affair and that works well in this setting.<br/><br/>I was worried that the change of director might negatively impact the film but it was a smooth transition to the new blood and this is most certainly the best superhero film of the year thus far and will be hard to beat.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Deadpool is the character that just breaks the forth wall in movies. Hilarious and great fun. Don't listen to the haters on these reviews. They are all aliens from another planet invading IMDB. Watch it, love it because I will say it is better than the 1st movie! Go Deadpool! Woohoo!!"
"psykosean","9","3","10","19 May 2018"," Superior To The First Film
","I see lots of reviews complaining Deadpool 2 has no plot, and I have to disagree. If anything, the first really had no plot at all, whereas 2 sets up the plot of the film and the surprisingly heartwarming message of the film, the real meaning of FAMILY throughout. <br/><br/>The early X-Force characters introduced in the film were wasted (quite literally) and Domino wasn't nearly developed enough, which is why I dinged this one star off.<br/><br/>Some complain there isn't enough humor in it. Personally, I think it's the right amount. The first and its 5-jokes-a-minute pace made you miss some of them due to laughter and felt like someone with ADD picked the pace. <br/><br/>Overall, very funny film with a superior plot to the original, exactly enough violence, and a perfect setup to make a full-on X-Force film where Mr. Pool is only ONE of the main characters, not the only star. A complete film that is surprisingly heartwarming."

"aarosedi","Null","3","11","20 May 2018"," Was the opening theme song bit done as a means for Mr. Reynolds to vent out his in-the-running-for-James-Bond fatigue?
","I'm the comic book idiot who don't know much of film adaptations of the other Marvel superhero franchise, and that is not necessarily due to snobbery. I just never had the chance. I only saw bits of the other superhero films in various places, never anything in its entirety, so all the Marvel universe references were totally lost on me. But after having seen the first DP movie that I have strayed upon on video and found it awe-spectacular, I made sure that I wouldn't miss watching the sequel in the theatrical big screen. And not to mention, I'm ga-ga for anything with a young, dashing Ryan Reynolds in it. <br/><br/>Though the comparisons to the first of the series would be inevitable, DP2 I'd say is way a different creature. The first film took pains in introducing the comic book character to the audience (especially to the non-comic book readers like me because those damn comic books are just expensive and not to mention expansive), managed to flesh it out to showcase Reynold's comedic acting range, (kind of did a Charlize Theron 2003 Patty Jenkins film Monster transformation there), which gave the Mr. Ryan his well-deserved Golden Globe win.<br/><br/>The second outing is more of just a means for upping the ante in Deadpool's horseplaying with numerous comedic references to instances that happened in DP1 that were hilarious. No, I don't think he's gonna be gunning for Academy Award votes for his acting on this one, but safest bet is for him nabbing another Golden Globe nom. But despite that, the movie still managed to be grounded in dealing with some exploitative topical issues, with DP's motives this time around pointing towards altruism to deflect his self-destructiveness.<br/><br/>The tradition of using the sappy songs (which are on my karaoke playlist) to juxtapose it those violent scenes and playing it for laughs still works great, but by the time the DP2 final battle came, all with the heroic slow motion involving Wade, the gimmick seems to have petered out there, I have to say.
 
So does the opening theme song done a la James Bond (which is a lampooning gold and a way better opening credits than the DP1) meant that the suave and debonair Mr. Reynolds have given up in being in the running in playing the iconic 007 (if he ever was) and used humour to help him deal with the fact that he will never be regarded ever as that kind of a serious action star? (Or perhaps just an attempt to dismiss specs if he wasn't in the running and remove his name from those odds-betting sites.) But he sure did look like one smelly loathing drunken guy in that parody with the Celine Dion song in the background. Hopefully, the X-Force separate film gig consolidates and DP franchise expands to make R. Reynolds a richer irresistible man more than ever instead.<br/><br/>My rating: A-minus."

"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","28 May 2018"," Very pleasantly surprised
","I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this. I thought the original Deadpool, while amusing at times, was also super forced. It seemed to think that because it was R-rated and had gore and ""bad words"" it was something completely unique, but it still followed all of the conventions of the genre. While it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't one I liked very much because it was just so annoying. To my complete surprise, I found the sequel so much better. Although the first act was a little rough, it finds its groove in a way the original didn't- it actually has a strong main storyline, strong antagonist, and it actually does break away from the conventions of the genre in a way the first didn't. Not to mention I also found it a lot funnier (the ""landing"" of the new superheroes Deadpool recruits was an amazingly done scene). It's not perfect, but this is the super entertaining, funny and outrageous film the first wanted to be but wasn't."
"kwarau","9","2","6","27 May 2018"," Best sequel ever made
","Let me start off by saying this is a better movie than the first one. The story the humor the story all fits perfect. <br/><br/>From the start you will be hooked however things takes a turn when the movie shifts its focus from Cable to the Russell. From the trailers it all seems like cable would be a badass and he in fact was but the movie completely shifted away from him. Why would you take such a strong character and not utilize it. He could have been taken seriously but instead he suddenly becomes Deadpool partner when his plan is revealed. Not only that he saves Deadpool at the end. It was all about that kid which pretty much destroyed Cable character. Because of this I had to give the movie an 8/10 <br/><br/>Overall it's a great flick and must watch"
"kushansworldofspace","8","2","6","27 May 2018"," Deadpool is crazy
","Just as the first one, Deadpool 2 didn't disappoint. It's a crazy movie that breaks the fourth wall and makes jokes of every single detail. It's an awesome chance to go and have a good laugh and for the best experience I suggest going to the cinema instead of waiting for the Blu-ray. The strong language in DP makes it all the more fun as it gives an idea of what the character is without restrictions. DP is definitely the craziest character in the Marvel universe and is real fun to watch. <br/><br/>This movie gets emotional at times but that doesn't keep DP from mocking things and making jokes. X-Force is a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>Unlike the first movie DP2 actually has a well thought out plot. One thing leads to another. Loved the story. <br/><br/>It's a must watch movie...."
"Pairic","8","2","6","26 May 2018"," Gags both verbal and visual abound. Good fun
","Deadpool 2: Full of jokes, visual gags foul language and extreme violence (which is a bit tongue in cheek). Deadpool/Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) tries to commit suicide after his wife Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is killed by an enemy but Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) puts him back together again. Dopinder (Karan Soni) is also back as Deadpool's reliable driver and wannabe superhero, he longs to be Kirsten Dunst to Wade's Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>The Cyborg Cable (Josh Brolin) arrives from the future, intent on killing the young mutant Firefist (Julian Dennison). Deadpool gets a new mutant group together: The X Force! Best of which is Domino (Zazie Beetz) who is very lucky. 
Megasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) returns, still with lots of attitude and a new girlfriend: Yukio, another X-Men trainee.<br/><br/>Deadpool is blown to pieces, cut in half, sent to a mutant prison, pursued by evil mutants and Cable. Brolin is quite funny with his Terminator take off but being half-human is pragmatic enough to compromise when needed. Some great car/prison truck chase scenes, a mutant rison high in the Rockies and an orphanage for mutant children run by a sadistic headmaster (Eddie Sarsan). Some of the action takes place in Professor Xavier's School for Mutants where the gags both verbal and visual abound. Good fun. 8/10"

"Deloron","6","2","6","23 May 2018"," Why does Deadpool need to be serious?
","First off, the movie isn't as bad as some reviews admit here, but definitely not a 8.2(!). So make sure, that you build your own opinion, that's the most important thing. <br/><br/>As I scrolled to some reviews here, I was pretty surprised that no one mentioned the major issue the movie has. Where there are few good and even great scenes, like the parachute drop, there are also some really bad one's. <br/><br/>Why does Deadpool need to be serious? 
All the background plot with his girlfriend and with ""making a baby"" was just terrible. First off, Deadpool is insane, why does he need real reason to do anything? I don't want that Deadpool is getting treated like other super heroes. That's unnecessary. I just want Deadpool being Deadpool, weird, violent and crazy. DP doesn't need a ""tragic Subplot"" that shows his motivation. I couldn't care less about Vanessa (girlfriend). There is unironically one or two scenes that should be sad and tragic. How am I supposed to feel affected by that? Every character is forgettable and exchangeable, besides Deadpool.<br/><br/>What I want is: A Plot that is just ridiculos and that DP makes fun about it, violence, 4th wall breaks, action, dark brutal humor, completely crazy storyline etc.
Indeed, there was some of this, but sadly not enough. <br/><br/>I will not start with the kid, the huge plotholes or with misplaced jokes. There are plenty other reviews that cover these topics already.<br/><br/>I'll rate the movie 56/100<br/><br/>Deloron"

","Although I liked the first movie a little bit more, this movie was still a blast. It is definitely funnier than the first. Be sure to stick around when the credits start for the mid-credits scene. Trust me. You don't want to miss what happens.<br/><br/>This movie has a better budget than the first one, which results in better action scenes and a lot more places and characters for Deadpool to interact with, which keeps things more interesting. Brolin does a good job as the straight man in Deadpool's world of insanity and kicking butt. However, it's Zazie Beets who really steals the show as Domino. She does a great job as the sassy, sarcastic counterpart to Deadpool and her luck powers work for some really creative fight scenes. No spoilers, but one X-Men character who has never gotten his or her due finally gets his/her cinematic moment to shine.<br/><br/>Now, why do I think the first one is better if this one is funnier? Deadpool 1 was a lot more solid plot-wise. Deadpool 2 is darker and more anarchist than the first. At times, the more serious scenes feel like they conflict with the more humorous ones. I do appreciate the need for an emotional backbone to the film, things could've been smoother. Anyway, if you liked the first you should still really like this."

Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, and Jack Kesy. In the film, Deadpool forms the team X-Force to protect a young mutant from Cable. It received generally favorable reviews. It is expected to perform well in theatres. I found it a little dark in the beginning and s bit slower paced at first.

So new face David Leitch came into picture for direction's post. David has triggered all guns in this part. Carry the momentum from part 1 and created plot for Part 3. This is the ultimate job of the director and David did it honestly.<br/><br/>Performance: <br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds is sure shot winner as an actor, writer and producer. His comic timing is just awesome. Josh Brolin who last appeared as Super villain Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War did good job in the role of Cable. Beetz was quite Lucky girl in the role of Domino. Morena looks pretty in the role of Vanessa. Again Karan Soni's inclusion add Indian flavor in X-men series like Part 1.<br/><br/>Script, Opening credits and dialogue:<br/><br/>Opening credits added another label of humor. Script was well written and create laughter riots on each and every dialogues. Raw writing keep you engage and entertain though out. Story revolves around making Selfless -Super hero from Anti Super Hero. Again they have included Bollywood song Yuhi Chala Chal song from Swadesh movie. Only one negative aspect about this movie is lack of super villain till the climax.<br/><br/>Music: <br/><br/>Music is another ingredient which make it perfect cinema. Tyler Bates did brilliant job as music director. Two songs: ""Ashes"" by CÃ©line Dion and ""Welcome to the Party"" by Diplo, French Montana and Lil Pump are already blockbuster.<br/><br/>Last Words: <br/><br/>If you love some experiment in super hero flick, this movie is pure treat for you."

","Here's my review of Deadpool 2. So Ryan Reynolds is back again as the Merc with the mouth and he does justice to the role by being the Johnny Depp to capn jack and the rdj to iron man. The movie is directed by the guy who made John wick and that results in the movie having zero shaky cams and solid action scenes unlike the first one. I also liked how there was a lot going on in this movie compared to the first one's linear plot. The kid who played Ricky in the Wilderpeople movie is in this and he does a really good job. Josh Brolin was great as thanos this year , and was good as cable ,but I can think of a hundred actors who could've played the same role . The pop cult references were neat and some of the jokes landed very well.The cgi however was not that impressive for such a big franchise, no I'm not saying it's like ""Henry Cavill mush"" like cgi , its just that it was revealing. In the end Dp 2 is the perfect sequel the first one can ask for with great action , memorable characters , studio assaults and probably the funniest fourth wall / post credits scene in movie history."

Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a lot more humorous and enjoyable than the first movie, better cast as well. Ryan Reynolds was born to play the role of Deadpool, as further showcased here in its sequel, and Josh Brolin was fantastic as Cable -- another role he's fantastic in besides Thanos. The action was on-point and there are loads of epic visuals throughout to help capture its essence. The comedy was well-written and I actually found myself laughing a lot whereas the first one, although funny, not just as much. There's a sense of charm and heart with this one more so as well, especially considering its ending.

The rest of it all sees him try to seek some kind of redemption, but the stories are too disjointed together to work as a whole.

I was hoping Deadpool 2 would be just as enjoyable as the first. Unfortunately, I wasn't amused.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Deadpool 2 doesn't offer anything more from the first one. There's still references, there's still breaking the fourth wall, there's still that trademark self-awareness. I don't really know what else I expected, but after the first five minutes, it just got old. The opening credits are especially cringe.<br/><br/>The first one sold me on its shock value, but the novelty wore off in Deadpool 2. I must admit, a good amount of the comedy is perfect and there are a few great lines to quote. I like the soundtrack too (minus the dubstep), but that's about all I see. I already have a chip on my shoulder when I see a Marvel movie, especially one with a child actor, so perhaps that's the reason this doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>On a different day, I might have liked this, but for now, it's gonna be a solid pass."

","As this sequel begins the unkillable superhero is trying to kill himself. A short flashback sequence shows the tragic events that led up to this. Inevitably he doesn't die; Colossus recovers his body parts and puts him back together. He is encouraged to become a trainee X-man but his first mission goes wrong; he realises the out of control young mutant, Russell, he is meant to stop is actually being abused at a Mutant Re-education Centre and kills one of the abusers. Deadpool and Russell are taken to a high security facility where control collars supress their mutant powers. While there Cable, a super-soldier from the future, turns up determined to kill Russell for crimes he has yet to commit. During the fight Deadpool gets out of the facility but Russell is left behind; convinced he has been abandoned. Deadpool determines to rescue him; to do that he assembles his own team of superheroes: The X-Force. Not surprisingly things do not go according to plan.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the original 'Deadpool' you are sure to love this; it has all the irreverence that made the original so much fun. It may be crude and violent but it isn't mean-spirited. The story starts well with his explosive suicide attempt; this is followed by a fun flashback sequence where he kills bad guys as Dolly Parton's 'Nine to Five' plays in the background (priceless) followed by a shocking tragedy. This all serves to lead to the main story about Deadpool's attempt to save Russell... this contains lots of action and plenty of good twists. Cable made a good adversary for Deadpool and the X-Force members were amusing, even if mostly ineffectual. Ryan Reynolds really carries the film as Deadpool; he is really great I the role; Josh Brolin impresses as Cable and Zazie Beetz is a lot of fun as the lucky X-Force member, Domino. The special effects, both physical and CGI are impressive throughout. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the first film... and advise viewers not to switch off when the credits start; there is more to come including some very important details."

"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","6","1","2","6 April 2019"," Movie Review: Deadpool 2
","I'm very split on Deadpool 2. Some elements of this film is very unexpected and others are painfully predictable. I really liked certain decisions towards the middle of the film regarding Dennison's character Russell and Brolin's Cable. Reynolds is again perfect for his role and again this is a very funny movie for the most part. There are a few times where the film takes the obvious joke and doesn't let serious moments lie for as long as it should, which is an issue I had with the original. As I said up top this film can be way to predictable, this usually isn't too much of an issue but the film appears to frame it's self as completely unexpected based on a small handful of moments that on the long run don't have much of an impact on the film as a whole. All action scenes are shot extremely well, which is to be expected as the director is one of the guys behind John Wick. It's an unpopular opinion right now but I this wasn't as funny or as focused as the original and it didn't leave much of an impression on me."

","The movie script of ""Deadpool"" is a story of a man who kills people for a living. In the opening scene, Deadpool is seen slaughtering people in many brutal ways. He murders many people and an SUV rolls over. Deadpool then breaks the fourth wall and discusses how he got his own movie.<br/><br/>With great power comes great responsibility, and this story could not apply more. Deadpool has a very accurate shot and is a very smart person. He can essentially do as he pleases. Deadpool originally became who he is through a science experiment that went wrong. It was supposed to be a cancer treatment, however, the scientists mutated his genes and he became the man known as ""Deadpool.""<br/><br/>Deadpool is a contract killer who uses his power to take care of evil people such as drug dealers. Deadpool has the power to regenerate his limbs as he is wounded. When he is hurt by bullets, though he feels the pain, his body repairs itself.<br/><br/>Deadpool is a story of great power and contract killing. The story shows that if you are not careful with the power you have, terrible things can happen."

","Deadpool the superhero so to say had some form of cancer before this healing factor was given to him. This healing factor gave his cells the ability to not die. In the first movie he seeks revenge on the person who changed his life forever. In the second story, this changes and now he joins the X-men a group of superheros that doesn't kill. This is hard for Deadpool because on his first mission he kills someone. I don't want to spoil the whole movie so I'm only giving a couple examples.
Overall this movie is really good due to its vulgar humor. The humor at times could be a little dry because most of the jokes are about the human body or just name calling. But for all the times in the movie where the humor is really dry. There are more funny bits. My favorite part of this movie is when Deadpool fights the Juggernaut for the first time because they have reference to other movies and brings a dark moment and makes it funny. Even though there are jokes about some parts of the body more than once. They still change it up to make it different from every other joke so it is always fresh.
The story line is also amazing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time and keeps you guessing because of how spartically it jump cuts. There is no part of the movie where there is down time and it is action pact to keep you involved in a sort of away. The story line is also different from the first movie. Where the first movie is mostly a lot of death and killing. The second movie tells more of the character deadpool is and how a murder can really show some emotions. I wouldn't change anything from this movie as it has many aspects of a great film. As it crosses both love, anger, fiction, and political beliefs all at the same time. I wouldn't change this film if my life depended on it."
"adragnam","10","1","2","21 February 2019"," Didn't know a sequel could be as good as the OG
","Deadpool 2 I feel was really good. I felt as a sequel it was great which doesn't happen often. The same characters are back for the story about a man from the future coming back to fix the well... the future. The boy Russell fits into the story well you get why he is the way he his. Also feeling bad for Russell in the process because of his goals trying to get revenge on the people who made him this way.<br/><br/>
Wade Wilson is trying also to save the future but in a different way trying to change Russell. In some points I didn't think Wade was going to be able to fix it like that. Being with powers for awhile ever since Wade had cancer and an experiment changed him forever. In Deadpool 2 he uses it for good mainly trying to find the world's most dangerous criminals.<br/><br/>Nothing is sacred here, except comedy. At the same time that ""Deadpool 2"" mocks everything from superhero action to audition montages, it inoculates itself against any criticism that might come its way."

","(Late) Deadpool 2 Review:<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is the hilarious marvel sequel to the first one. Deadpool is one of the best superhero and Marvel movies so I had high expectations. The expectations for me were met. Ryan Reynolds was once again spot on with his portrayal of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He is hilarious and just perfect. Josh Brolin as Cable was pretty good too. I liked his character, but not as much as I expected I would. He was still good. Other stand outs for me were Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Firefist, and as always T. J. Miller as Weasel. The movie had amazing jokes and was probably funnier than the first one. Sometimes it did rely on jokes a little too much which you could tell at parts. The action sequences were good, as they were either deep or humorous. The CGI was fine, there were quite a few times that you could tell it wasn't real however. The music choices were amazing. It reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy. The plot was interesting and kept my attention for almost the whole thing. There was one character that was added which I thought was cool but it just seemed a little bit out of place. I though Deadpool 2 was a funny and enjoyable movie. Not as good as the first one but still pretty good.<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"
"gurlgod99","4","1","2","25 October 2018"," Less funny, more vulgarity references and poor plots.
","It's not that I hate this movie....actually I don't even 'just not hate it'....but it definitely does NOT live up to the first Deadpool movie. If you're reading this and trying to decide if you should/shouldn't watch it just know that the hype build up for this movie was a LITTLE too enthusiastic to live up to the first Deadpool.<br/><br/>Bummed."
"p-jonsson","9","1","2","21 October 2018"," Marvel meets Kill Bill
","I have to say that I quite enjoyed this movie. Was there a lot of juvenile jokes? Oh yes. Was the characters sometimes over the top and silly? Yes again. Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>Despite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a'la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)<br/><br/>Everything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.<br/><br/>The action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.<br/><br/>I definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she's hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?<br/><br/>Most of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.<br/><br/>The team of fellow mutant ""warriors"" that Deadpool pulled together? Well let's say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat ""expendable"" but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought ""What the f...?"" and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.<br/><br/>To sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually."
"calmdowndude","8","1","2","17 October 2018"," Deadpool 2 is hilarious, brutal, and surprisingly heartfelt
","I won't say much, if you enjoyed ""Deadpool"" then you will enjoy ""Deadpool 2"" in terms of comedy. There's a lot of reviews here saying that it's just a rehashed version of the first film, I disagree. I think the comedy here was pretty fresh considering it's a sequel, which generally suffers from trying to replicate a formula that worked before.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's fourth-wall breaking, Wade Wilson is still a sarcastic, over-the-top smart-mouth, and the film is full of gratuitous violence - but reapplying those themes that made the first film a success doesn't mean you've created a carbon copy (or even close).<br/><br/>There was an actual maturation of Wade Wilson's character throughout the film, while there was very little development of other characters. For the most part, the supporting cast (new or returning characters) is under-developed, with the exception of Cable, who was a great addition to Deadpool's story. Cable has more depth to his character than expected here, and that helped the overall arc of the film feel more gratifying and less antiquated.<br/><br/>The big surprise for me was that, in the end, the film was pretty heartfelt - which was a big step for me with the character. Deadpool is an antihero, he's a total a$$hat, but in the end, he's someone who kills bad guys, and it's tough to understand WHY if the character doesn't have SOME heart. <br/><br/>That's what this film did well, they added depth to Wade Wilson, they added some heart overall - there was a moment or two that, dare I say, I felt these eyes begin to water, unexpectedly - which was a nice touch that was missing from the first film.<br/><br/>If the first film wasn't for you, this one won't be either - the antics still exist, but the formula is different. Reynolds is still prefect for the role, and Josh Brolin is a great addition to a surprisingly complex character. It ain't the Shawshank Redemption here people, but it's a fun ride with a ton of laughs. Sit back, relax and enjoy."

This is fun watch with all you would expect from Ryan Reynolds and his screen alter ego gives u worth your tickets n more. Josh Brolin as Cable albeit shorter than the comic guy does well in the role fit for him. The proceeding tend to drag a bit but great overall watch.

"GerryofNorVA","9","1","2","14 October 2018"," In a category of its own
","Deadpool is its own genre of movie - action/comedy/commentary, oh, and foul, foul language, my god, it's like over the top with the most foul of them. So though it's an ""R"", there should be a lower limit of age 14 due to language and so much massive amounts of gratuitous death and dismemberment. Seriously, there's a portion of the public that may need trauma therapy after viewing this. Anyway, it's a heck of a fun ride. Ryan's snarky commentary throughout is funny but it's uneven because he doesn't apply it to his love scenes with Vanessa (Morena B), but that's a minor nit that's certainly offset by so many other areas of strength. TJ Miller is always a comedic treat, just saw him in ""Ready Player One"" last night, too. And the character ""Domino"" made for some entertaining moments with her super ability of ""luck"". A fun, solid ""9"" of a movie - and I don't hand those out often."

That's something I'm wondering about a specific reviewer, though I'm sure he isn't alone in this. We have different tastes so it is normal for people to dislike this sort of comedy. But if you are with Ryan Reynolds, you love this as much as he does and you will have a great time. This ups the ante and has even more jokes, even small ones, where they actually are able to have big names for a punch line hired or just a visual joke.<br/><br/>Very funny, if you don't mind the non political correct route it takes ... because this is anything but nice ... and still manages to be sweet in its own right!"

","It has been said that ""Deadpool 2"" is even better than the original film, and I agree. ""2"" has the best elements of the first film, but taken to a greater degree.

And the same irreverence, the same self-referential comments, the same darkness, the same gore, the plethora of cinematic references. And more of it.<br/><br/>Some reviewers didn't find enough comedy in the film. Almost every line was a punch line, so were they not catching certain references? Possibly. Some complained that the film's POV was too far to the left. Yes, there were anti-rightwing insults, but there were also numerous lampoons of P.C. platitudes. <br/><br/>The best things about the Deadpool films are the level of originality and creativity, the willingness to take risks. Fortunately, the second installment does not back away from that formula."

","Marvel's merc with a mouth is back to spread teabags, gunsmoke and enchiladas throughout the extended X-Men universe. This time he's brought friends, with the grizzled super-soldier Cable arriving from the future and luck-generating sidekick Domino answering a classified ad. It's a fun time, light-heartedly profane in the same vein as the original, if not half as unconventionally creative.<br/><br/>With the enlarged budget and heightened expectations, not to mention the change in director, far more of the laughs feel forced and manufactured. If the first film spent 90% of its time in the character's wheelhouse, the sequel goes for something closer to 25%, and a majority of that is in the second act. Ryan Reynolds remains a picture-perfect casting choice, I loved his contrast with Josh Brolin as Cable, Zazie Beetz is a spunky, welcome addition as Domino, but the plot structure feels too tame and the jokes more restrained. Rather than doubling down, we've lightened up and settled for a handful of throwbacks to what worked the last time.

It just isn't necessary at the frequency they choose to use it. Almost as if they are saying ""Hey look, I can use all the vulgar language I want in this R-rated movie.""<br/><br/>For those who can get past that the movie itself is frequently very entertaining, especially when the humor is injected. One example, there is a character that is invisible, until he lights up after parachuting into high power lines. Whose face do we see? Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>So Ryan Reynolds is back as Wade Wilson who is mostly in costume as Deadpool. He also provides the voice for the very large convict, Juggernaut.

"masondbk-599-80448","8","1","2","14 September 2018"," a great followup to deadpool
","While not as memorable as the original, Deadpool 2 is one of the most unique superhero movies i have ever seen. The premise of the movie is that Wade Wilson is trying to protect an angry kid he befriended named Russell from a time traveling mutant named Cable. For most of the film Cable is portrayed as a sadistic villain who wants to kill a kid for seemingly no reason, until the final act where it is revealed that Cable is actually the good guy and he was only after Russell because the kid was destined to become an insane warlord in the future who wiped out mankind including Cable's family. This is where the movie really becomes unique because even though technically the antagonist is Russell, he's not really the villain either. the movie doesn't really have a real main villain, which is strange for a comic book movie to say the least. There are characters who do qualify as evil but none of them serve as a main villain to Wade. The first Deadpool movie had a clear antagonist in the form of Francis and the movie was basically a revenge plot. the followup portrays Wade as more heroic in terms of he's actually saving someone else and there is more at stake. He's saving Russell from both Cable and himself before he kills the man who abused him which according to Cable would begin his insatiable blood lust leading to the end of the world. But not only that, when Wade discovers Cable's motivation it becomes more than just saving the kid from a mutant cyborg, he realizes that humanity is at stake and if he doesn't save the kid and the headmaster of the orphanage who abused him. There is a lot of comedy even during the more emotional moments which is actually appropriate since it never really gets in the way. The only complaint i have is that the pacing is uneven every now and then but other than that the movie was everything i hoped it would be."
"theterminator-92378","9","1","2","13 September 2018"," A well deserved and lives up to the hype that it was given
","The original Deadpool introduced us to a R rated version of the x men universe and the sequel further establishes the universe with deadpool in it and deadpool 2 follows Wade/Deadpool learn the importance of family and responsiblity and also gives us a amazing version of the villian Cable who is so Badass that Josh Brolin really makes the character from the comics to be brought alive and Julien Dennison is a great fit for Russel and becomes some sort of son to Wade which fits with a complicated relationship they develop. And the X force storyline is also one of the reasons that you can fall in love with Deadpool 2 and they bring the rag tag team together from the comics.
Leading the cast as always is the super talented Ryan Reynolds who is back as Deadpool and gives a always funny but also some times emotional performance and also making their return from the original is Morena Baccarin,
T.J. Miller,Leslie Uggams,Karan Soni and Stefan Kapicic they are even better than in the orginal deadpool and continue on bringing such amazing talent and life into their characters. The breakout star of Deadpool 2 and a native of New Zealand is Julian Dennison who plays Russel/ Firefists and i loved his preformace he enbodyed what it was like to be in your early teens and being a muntant which we saw lots of in the X Men movies and played to perfection in Deadpool 2 he was by far one of my favorite parts of the movie hands down.
Zazie Beetz is another new face in deadpool 2 and she plays the lucky mutant Domino who is played to perfection and she was not at all a waste of talent and she brings a sort of sassy attitude which can clash with deadpool and she was a great new charecter to explore in the this one. And Finally the villian of deadpool 2 Cable played by superhero movie superstar who is also Thanos in the MCU Josh Brolin he is so great as Cable and his backstory made me feel for this villian unlike Ajax in the last movie their was no real reason he did what he did but with Cable we understand after losing his wife and daughter he must prevent their deaths and this why he is so cool and is by far the best villian in the X Man universe.
Overall I really enjoyed Deadpool the music was on point and the story was very enjoyable and the action scences were rich with violence and gore that we should expect from deadpool although I thought there was a lack of real meta moments which made me fall in love with the orginal movie and the pop culture refernces while good were seemed to be toned back a little more than in the last movie which may be fine for some people but for me it sorta hurt my viewing experince and also the swearing was also toned back as well which was something that did not work for me as I said it could be fine for some people but for me it was not really a deadpool movie without those things.
I gave it a 9/10 an i though it was an enjoyable watching experence and i can't wait to see what Ryan Reynolds will come up with for the 3rd movie or maybe a X Force movie."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Deadpool"" 2 (2018) is a fan escapism. Its not as bold, original and funny as the first one was, but i still had a good time watching it. Maybe by taking it into more dramatic places creators did not have enough room to inject the boldness that was present in a first movie, but i liked even the direction they took here. There are plenty of action here, cool special effects, some unexpected turn of events and some heart in between.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Deadpool 2"" is better then many of its competitors right now which are taking them self too serious. This movie also took some direction into more serious approach, and while that did not heart the overall experience, they should make the third one closer to the first one i think, Still, a good movie overall."

Some were funny and some forced. Through the first half it was a bit boring in parts but then picks up for the second half. It still an entertaining film and keeps true to its style and violence. Ryan Reynolds is undoubtedly funny and he is what keeps the deadpool movie alive and kicking.<br/><br/>Special effects and actions scenes were great and the villain is laughable, I guess it suits this kind of a humourous film."

","Boy this movie is another predictable movie with the most predictable story. The first was was great, but this second one is like what the fudge. The second part is a rehash of the first movie something happens that changes the main character. Main character takes action, and funny moments and actions just happens. The problem is the funny parts suck and the action parts are just action parts. I don't remember who is the main villian, and what was happening wasn't that interesting. I was bored the whole time. The gambler character played by the actress from Atlanta is great, and I love her character, but every thing other than that is straight boring. This could have been an awesome movie with awesome characters, but it feels like a boring movie with boring characters.

But the constant jokes to the audience that it's a low grade movie with a poor script, cheap X men characters, CGI) - well, these jokes get less funny each time, and they happen a LOT in this movie. And regrettably, the script DID feel poorly developed, the X men WERE uninteresting, and any potential for good drama or humor seemed to get lost in the bloody carnage. I love violence in a movie, but the level of gratuitous gore is definitely ""upped"" several notches from DP1, with some scenes being things I could have died without ever seeing and felt none the worse.

"michielodb","7","1","2","20 August 2018"," Less is more
","Let's start by saying that I loved the first Deadpool when it came out in theatres! I went to watch it with a whole bunch of friends and laughed more times than I could count. After seeing it a few more times, and of course also as a result of growing up, I could say that some things about the film where a little childish maybe (the overdose of sexual humor) but it was still a fun and original movie none the less! So naturally I was excited for the second one...and beyond all expectations...I really didn't like it that much.<br/><br/>Let's start off positive, pretty much all the characters are great. Ryan Reynolds is great as Deadpool, Colossus is a fun presence as well as Cable and Domino are two very nice additions to this universe. There's one big twist somewhere in the middle that I LOVED, the action is very well done, the acting is good, the movie has a great tempo behind it and last but not least, the credits scenes are hilarious!<br/><br/>So what happened? Well let's start by saying that it tries way too much at being as good as the first one. The method of narration is pretty much exactly the same, so it comes of as repetitive. The humor is once again good, but there are WAY too many times that it just doesn't work. I usualy don't mind pop culture references when they're done well, but here they just come out of nowhere and don't always fit in the moment. Another thing about the humor that didn't always work is that way too much of it is in your face. There's a scene where one person continiously says that a certain power of another person is absolutely useless while cette person is actually demonstrating to us that that power isn't useless. It was way too obvious what they where trying to do and I didn't find it funny.
The character of Cable is very cool and played well, but his introduction in this movie is extremely rushed, it almost felt like a bad Terminator movie at times, but luckily his character did improve. Another thing is the character of Firefist who is extremely inconsistent. This person changes his mind constantly during the movie that I found it very difficult to care for him, and the fact that this person plays a major part in the movie isn't that good.<br/><br/>This movie was a mixed bag for me.
The action is great, the cinematography is very good, most of the acting is good, there are some very fun references and a good portion of the humor is well done.
On the other hand it does try way too hard at being like the first one, it feels very rushed at times, some characters are pretty difficult to follow and the other half of the humor is either way too much in your face or it just doesn't fit in the moment.<br/><br/>It's a fun movie to go and see with your friends on a Saturday night, but nothing more.
I give it a 6.7/10."

","""Deadpool 2"" is the greatest superhero sequel since ""The Dark Knight."" Its rapid-fire meta humor, immense hilarity, and non-stop entertainment marks the second coming of Jesus. Ha just kidding. Let's be real, littleging12 is writing another wordy and pretentious review so he can pretend that he has a big penis, when in reality he has a chode. With these reviews, littlejizz hopes to deceive uneducated Mexican immigrants into thinking he is Conan O'Brien.<br/><br/>In his review of ""Deadpool,"" littleging12 stated that ""what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story, unimpressive CGI action, ineffective resonance and bland one-dimensional characters excluding the titular character."" If he was anymore pretentious, he'd get nominated for an Oscar. ""Deadpool 2"" improves over the original with a better story, better side characters, better CGI action, bigger heart, and smaller penis. What holds it back from getting a 10/10 is littleging12's bull sh$!$y rating system. <br/><br/>In all seriousness, ""Deadpool 2"" is very entertaining, hilarious, and one of the better sequels in recent memory. It may not be the most sophisticated or artistic movie, but it delivers everything you could want out of an irreverent superhero comedy. Deadpool is the character Ryan Reynolds was born to play and he will hang up his suit (and his dildo) as a pop culture icon. 8.5/10"

"AhmedSpielberg99","8","1","2","13 August 2018"," Bigger, And Slightly Better!
","DP2 goes bigger than the first in every sense, but also somewhat better. The plot is more convoluted yet way more convincing and focused. The story itself is more thrilling. The pacing is impeccable. The script also gave all the characters a fair share of screen time and importance that will make you thoroughly invested in them, specially the old characters.<br/><br/>In contrast to the original, the villains are very compelling and potent; because their motives are way more plausible, but most importantly more clear.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is also more heavier in meta jokes, and that's where ""bigger"" doesn't necessarily mean ""better"". Honestly, this movie has more creative and funnier jokes that you'd never believe they could exist, but the element of shock and awe can't be put back into its bottle. The result is a smarter, and quite funny, jokes that don't work as well as the original's.<br/><br/>The action is very good, and that's very frustrating! David Leitch is one of the best action film directors who work today, because he make design action sequences and stunt work that can't be forgotten; some of John Wick and Atomic Blonde's action sequences still stick in my mind. However in this film, Leitch made enjoyable action sequences, but totally forgettable.<br/><br/>What surprised me in this movie is that it has a strong emotional impact that is rare to be in a superhero movie. Some scenes are really touching and emotionally devastating.<br/><br/>All in all, I think Deadpool 2 is a slight improvement upon its predecessor, but it proves again that Ryan Reynolds as Wade WIlson/Deadpool is one of the best superhero casting choices ever along with Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Also, this mid-credits scene is simply the best and coolest mid-credits scene ever put to film!<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"
"tyson-hunsaker","6","1","2","6 July 2018"," Messy sequel that lives underneath its strong potential.
","""Deadpool 2"" is an overall successful attempt at bringing the humor, satire, and playful atmosphere of the first film, while at the same time, does a sloppy and incoherent job. With a new director and all too familiar approach, ""Deadpool 2"" did something that its sole job was to not follow in similar films of the superhero fashion and be simply ordinary. Perhaps that's why the film is severely disappointing despite it being a genuinely good time at the movies. <br/><br/>As expected, Ryan Reynolds nails the character of Deadpool/Wade Wilson. He brings the familiar character back onto the screen while enforcing the theory that maybe only he should play this role. He's hilarious throughout and proves to be the comedic lifeblood of the film. With him around, more comic relief is frankly unnecessary. Josh Brolin creates an interesting antagonist as Cable whose back story and depth feel much more entertaining the the first film's generic villain. <br/><br/>Both strong performances and quirky additional characters however, don't save ""Deadpool 2"" from failing on the screenwriting front. The story is messy not because of its ""busyness"" but its unfocused theme and message. The film promises a particular theme and emotional tug for its protagonist but is later abandoned and sometimes forgotten altogether. The plot even betrays this path of journey and change for the character and then returns to the third act to try and put those pieces back together. This made the film feel unfocused and not nearly as cared for as its predecessor. <br/><br/>Many major plot points as well prove to be unbearably cliched predictable. Drawing obvious inspiration (and maybe a little stealing) from The Terminator anthology and a few other science fiction stories, ""Deadpool 2"" doesn't feel nearly as fresh or original as it really could've been. Perhaps the film's greatest downfall is these fundamental script problems that keep it from becoming something more than just a sequence to make a sequel. <br/><br/>Criticisms aside, the humor (especially a the end) had me not only laughing but unexpectedly busting my stomach. Some jokes landed perfectly and created some of the biggest laughs I've experienced in a movie theater in a long time. At the same time, many jokes fell completely on their faces which really makes the film a hit and miss at the same time. <br/><br/>The general progression and tempo of the film is fantastic. ""Deadpool 2"" moves at a brisk pace and slows down at all the necessary places. Where emotion is the heart of the scene, the filmmakers allow us to feel what emotion is available to draw from. When action sequences kick in, they're thrilling and exciting with hardly any dull moments. Both qualities coupled with constant flakes of Deadpool humor make those sequences enjoyable compounded by more enjoyment. <br/><br/>Technically, there are several places in the film with honestly horrendous CGI despite its larger budget. One character in particular was not cared for at all and was painful to watch. I was honestly surprised to see how awful it was and see minimal criticism on this despite the budget it received. Still in the realm of visual aesthetics, the film overall has a better, more cinematic look than the first which feels right. It feels very much in the genre which contributes to a more engaging experience.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Deadpool 2"" is not nearly as good as it should be. It's disappointing and its script is incredibly messy. However, it's a good and funny time at the theaters and should satisfy the majority of the movie going audience and especially its intended audience."

"one9eighty","9","1","2","2 July 2018"," Your favourite ""merc with a mouth"" returns to learn about feelings
","Ryan Reynolds is back as the wise cracking 'merc with a mouth' in Deadpool 2. The first film established the origin of the titular hero so this one didn't need to go into too many explanations - it shows what's been happening since the first film, and then goes off on its own adventure. An event happens at the start of the film which disrupts Wade Wilson's life. Throw in the introduction of Cable - played by John Brolin, who's own story arc crashes into Deadpool's and you have a mayhem fueled adventure which features all the action, comedy and drama that you'd expect. Comic-book fans can expect to see characters and concepts they are familiar with from print - Cable, Domino (played excellently by Zazie Beetz), Weasel (TJ Miller), Blind Al, Black Tom, Colossus, Juggernaught, Shatterstar, Bedlam, teleportation, time-hopping, future timelines, breaking the 4th wall. Fans of the film version of Deadpool, likewise won't be disappointed with familiar characters, established jokes continuing (the X-Men mansion for example), action slo-mo's, elaborate stunts and gross out humour, visual vileness, chaos, easter eggs, and a ridiculous body count - oh yeah, keep an eye (and ear) open for celebrity cameo's and see how many of them manage to stay alive till the end of the film. <br/><br/>I was secretly hoping for an appearance by Nathaniel Essex (Mr Sinister), after it had been hinted in ""X-Men - Apocalypse"" and ""Logan"", and seeing as the Russell was living at Essex House AND cable was carrying around a teddy-bear (which is actually explained - although I'd hoped it was a nod to one of the famous Cable/Deadpool cross over comic events) - this hope for a Mr Sinister appearance is just my inner nerd projecting and it seems that we may get an X-Force which may or may not get a Mr Sinister - eek! The other hope I had was to see Lady Death, but it's probably too early in Deadpool's life (and death) to become obsessed with her yet, besides, Brolin as the Mad Titan Thanos in Avengers isn't doing the whole infinity gauntlet thing for Lady Death either - so would we realistically see her in Deadpool's life (I mean death) yet. For the time being Vanessa is still Vanessa, so Lady Death isn't a key player for Wade yet - I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, I was amazed to find that before I knew it, the film was ending and my disbelief had been suspended from start to finish. I laughed along and geeked out throughout, and I bloody loved the end credits - especially putting things right!! Some people have suggested that this sequel isn't as good as the first film because it has some similar situations and set up's despite a massive budget (which the first film didn't have), I didn't find this issue though - if you go to see Jurassic Park 2 or 3 you want dinosaurs, or if you see a James Bond film you expect one-liners and gadgets - so by that logic if you go to see a Deadpool film you expect vulgar lewdness, action, and gross out/ tongue in cheek humour. If you expect anything less then you are going to the wrong film. A total end to end fun experience had, I'd happily watch this again and recommend this to my friends, with the caveat that it's not for all ages mind. Like the first film this gets a good rating from me - 9 out of 10. Thanks."

","In this sequel, Deadpool must deal with his enemies, the love of his life being in danger and the strange partnership of a man coming from the future and a mutant kid. <br/><br/>There are no words to describe just how clever the humor in this movie is. The first Deadpool movie was groundbreaking and, surprisingly, the level of this one is even higher. I'm amazed at how the writers can so easily insert humor in action/serious scenes without breaking the tension and how, even scenes that are heartbreaking, fit so well with the continuity of the movie. <br/><br/>But there's more than just humor. The characters are amazingly developed, each one of them drawing you in with their different personalities. It also has great character development for Deadpool, something that we couldn't really see in the first movie since it worked as a presentation for the character. Still, it's just heartwarming to see that, even when he's a mercenary, he still has morals that he lives by. The combination of Deadpool and the mutant kid is adorable, and Cable and Domino steal all of their scenes with how good they are. The best team!<br/><br/>Absolutely loved it!"

It is an action-comedy movie that carries some dramatic tension at about the end of the story.<br/><br/>Deadpool is one of not many movies that break the traditional rules of making a film by allowing the main character recognizes that he is being watched by the audience, which is not a surprising thing because the movie is just an adaptation of an existing Marvel comic series. We can expect this kind of characteristic.<br/><br/>Since this movie breaks a common rule of a traditional movie, we can see a lot of chaotic going on in a funny way.

","What an outstanding job the filmmakers did on this one. One of the things that stands out to me amongst this entire franchise thus far is its sheer uniqueness of it. Not just the rated R aspect, but the flexibility of the humor. It seems that the humor is limitless. Also this films have elements of heart in them. As for this film individually, apply what I said before here. Additionally, the marvelous (no pun intended) performance of Ryan Reynolds showing he owns this character. Josh Brolin is a badass in this and has some complexities in his character. This film to me is even funnier than the first film. And an overall better film as well. No disrespect to Tim Miller (director of the first film), he did a great job with the first Deadpool. However, David Leitch made the best film a film like Deadpool could ask for. The timing of the humor is flawless, and the effects are bloody good. I hope and pray for a Deadpool 3. But on the flip side, the villains are all short lived and therefore underwhelming. Other than that this is a win for the filmmakers and the audience. But be mindful, this film is rated R, so kids should proceed with caution, lots of blood, severed limbs, language, and adult humor are present. For adults, get ready for a fun night out with friends at the movies."

","I really wish the golden arches of McDonald's weren't looming just across the road from the Cineworld in Brighton. Very tempting. Not healthy. Very tasty though.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is pretty tasty too.<br/><br/>It starts pretty much in the same vein and with a similar feel as its predecessor which in my humble, is both good and bad. Well, not really bad, but being R-rated, with swearing, people being turned into shish kebabs and breakings of the 4th wall and meta references, the first Deadpool movie was a very original breath of fresh air to the huge superhero genre.<br/><br/>Especially with all that DC crap trying to challenging and ultimately failing to rival Marvel Studios' success.<br/><br/>So sadly, we can't have that same breath of fresh air in the sequel but for me, the latter part of the movie really picks things up. There's one part in particular that takes a similar scene from the original but makes it way more hilarious. And from that point, we are properly off and running.<br/><br/>We are also treated to some nice surprises, bits of character development and story arcs therein and a surprise Marvel fan favourite villain that is foreshadowed for much of the movie.<br/><br/>A character, like Deadpool himself, who was done a grave injustice in a previous X-Men universe movie, but who gets an excellent redemption in this movie and I'm sure we will be getting to see more of them in the third outing which I am sure is very much on the table.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is still laugh out loud funny with a great story and superb addition to the franchise."

Deadpool ends up getting ripped in half by the end of the meeting with the Juggernaut. That was one of the hilarious moments with in the movie and then you have more sentimental moments with other characters like Cable. In the begging half of the movie Cable starts as the enemy but in the last half of the movie he ends up joining forces with Deadpool to stop Firehands. Cable ends up being buddy and saving Deadpool by changing a key moment of the movie. Watch it and you will find out the exciting connections he makes with all these characters."

","Deadpool 2 revels in it's absurdity and irreverence. From the graphic, stylised violence and crude humour to unconventional music and fourth wall breaking antics, the film punishes the viewer from taking it too seriously.

","I was really excited to see this movie as I like the first Deadpool. But like most sequels it fails to reach the level of the first one. It felt as the movie was patched together with a lot of bits. Ryan Reynolds does a good job of being the snarky Deadpool character but his one liners get old as the art of the story never seems to peak. With the introduction of so many other superhero characters with too much back story given, the simplicity of good guy versus bad guy is lost. I watched it on the big screen but it might be worth waiting for it to come out on streaming platform to watch on your lunch break. Dr. Wilson Triviño"
"davidlong-32113","10","1","2","18 June 2018"," What did I just experience?
","Deadpool 1 was hilarious, exciting and not what I was expecting from a X men film. Deadpool2 however......was how can I say this with using the odd naughty word, FANTASTIC.....Turned all the way past11 straight to 13.
I went with my 16year old son and we were crying it was so funny. I reads few bad reviews and I'm confused, maybe they watched a a foreign language version with sensored gags or bad over dubbing.
If you are human you will find this film a real treat."
"jamdoodle","8","1","2","18 June 2018"," Its exactly like it should be Deadpool knows what it is and how it should act.
","One thing I hate are reviews that are there just to swing the rating either really high 10/10 or just haters 2/10??? Really. Even if your a big fan of the comics or loved the first and wanted the same fuzzy feelings for this second outing and was disappointed... you can't rate it as 2 out of 10 or even below 5. Okay everyone has an opinion but some people just want to be heard no matter want the topic is, for them the film is i<br/><br/>Yes it's a blockbuster movie, and yes much more money was spent on it that the original but rightly so. The success of the first should allow the Writers and Producers a second shot with better backing from studios, Ryan Reynolds has done well with this series, there is no point comparing to Infinity wars or the DC series or all the X-Men back catalogue just judge the movie in front of you. <br/><br/>All the gags and style is back from the original which I liked, It's my sense of humour, there is a load of background gags and hints to the comic series and nods to other movies and the 4th wall gets broken numerous times like it should in a Deadpool kind of way.<br/><br/>The cinema was pretty busy for a mid week screening and there was loads of belly laughs and giggles throughout the length of the movie. I believe it was balanced well between giving the plot line something to cling to but allow the humour of the first and direct to not be bogged down to much by it.<br/><br/>It's suppose to be light, funny and sort of throw away in plot, I could easy sit down and watch this again and probably again, there are plenty of movies out there I couldn't say that to. Sometimes movies can be slowed and plot heavy to where it can kill it (Superman vs Batman maybe??)<br/><br/>Okay the characters can be a little sketchy in back story, but with movie goers complaining of long running times and drawn out sequences, I believe it's handled well here. <br/><br/>I think Cable is given enough screen time for us to care and enjoy Josh Brolin's acting prowess. In regards to the rest I believe the plot is a little light but enough to piece the sequences around. Firefist is okay as a Troubled mutant but I think his back story with the Headmaster is rushed and maybe could have been done better or differently, but that's really my only gripe. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are there with some good little cameos and gags, I try to not watch the trailers much so when the gags and action happened it was fresh and produced plenty of surprise and laughter. Along with wanting to see more of the character Domino, along with Cable in possible future features.<br/><br/>I'm 45, seen a lot of movies in my time and this is what this kind of movie is suppose to be. They've got it right, well done, bring on the next one, it's the funny end of the Comic world as it should be."

","There are a few things that I had a problem with in the first Deadpool movie.
1. The jokes were completely over shown in the trailers.
2. The cast and crew had little chemistry in the lack of overall story.
3. The story felt forced by the studio as if to compete with other Marvel Franchises.<br/><br/>This movie has none of these problems. Here is how it fixes them.
1. The first 2 trailers were not even about the movie. The Bob Ross and Cable introduction trailers were hilarious and genius in their own right and gave away nothing about the story at all.
2. This movie has a fantastic crew that is natural around one another within the honestly perfect story. Josh Brolin plays off of Ryan Reynolds with no effort needed to be any less than great. The romantic elements in this movie hit hard. The X-Force crew is more of a joke than a plot point. Overall the story finds its place almost immediately and just rolls with it.
3. Someone finally looked at Deadpool and decided that the safest place for it to grow is in the hands of its crew and cast rather than the people at the head of the chain. Thank god.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie 4 times and I'd gladly see it again."
"zardoz-13","10","1","2","13 June 2018"," The Best ""Deadpool"" Yet!!!
","Not only must good sequels live up to the original, but they must also transcend it. ""Atomic Blonde"" director David Leitch's ""Deadpool 2"" makes Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" appear almost prudish, boasting thrice as much profanity, promiscuity, and pyrotechnics, including our protagonist's smart-aleck asides to the audience. You've got to be a little warped yourself to appreciate Deadpool's antics. Make no mistake, ""Deadpool"" started the next stride in the evolution of cinematic costume-clad crimefighters. Starting with several ""X-Men"" (2000) epics, sequels and prequels, ""Spider-Man"" (2002) sequels and reboots, ""The Fantastic Four"" (2005) and its sequel ""The Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" and then ""Iron Man"" (2008), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008), ""Thor"" (2011), ""Captain America"" (2011), ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), ""Ant Man"" (2015), ""Doctor Strange"" (2016), and ""Black Panther"" (2017), the Marvel Cinematic Universe has outperformed its venerable rivals in the DC Universe, spouting risqué humor with PG-13 restraint, engaging characters, all swirled with sensational CGI. Although ""Deadpool"" (2016) never takes himself seriously, Ryan Reynolds is seriously sidesplitting. Skewering everything and everybody as well as himself and the eponymous character, Ryan Reynolds qualifies as the perfect match with 'the merc with a mouth.' Shattering the status quo PG-13 barrier, ""Deadpool"" plunged gleefully into forbidden R-rated territory. Earlier, no Hollywood studio would have green-lighted such an unconventional movie. Nothing in the ""Deadpool"" universe is safe from our crimson clad crimefighter's subversive sense of humor. If ""Deadpool"" ranked as the first exception to the rule, Hugh Jackman's, R-rated, swan-song ""Logan"" (2017) confirmed superheroes could thrive in an R-rated universe. ""Deadpool 2"" delivers every dollar's worth of its $110-million budget in energetic stunts, a James Bond opening credits parody, and a stouthearted Marvel character co-star who never lets Deadpool overshadow him. A minute under of two hours, ""Deadpool 2"" provides everything Reynolds promised during his after-credits ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" scene in the original. <br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" begins with Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds of ""Green Lantern""), aka 'Deadpool,' struggling to keep his gal, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin of ""Serenity""), out of harm's way. Unfortunately, he cannot protect her when gunmen invade their apartment, and Vanessa dies from a fatal bullet! Tragedy strikes early in this rambunctious sequel, and Vanessa remains on 'the other side' for most of it! A grief-stricken Deadpool catches her killer, disposing of him painfully as only Deadpool can, and then he obliterates himself in a fireball inferno. As all Deadpool fans know, Deadpool is indestructible as long as he has his superpowers. Mind you, he cannot kill himself, courtesy of Ajax's cancer treatments inflicted on him in ""Deadpool."" Incredibly, Deadpool's body rejuvenates itself! During a momentary absence, Wade visits Vanessa in 'the other world.' Initially, Vanessa had wanted to have a baby, but a bullet destroyed those dreams. Now, Wade Williams/Deadpool vows to save a child. This child is an obese teen with an attitude, Russell Collins (Julian Dennison of ""Shopping""), who has suffered grievously at the hands of workers in an orphanage. Russell can summon flamethrower fires from his blazing hands, and he vows to incinerate the perverted Headmaster. A sympathetic Deadpool befriends Russell, but the two land in 'the Icebox' Prison, where our hero loses his superpowers. He advises Russell to find somebody else. No sooner are they behind bars than a vengeful Cable (Josh Brolin of ""Sicario"") appears. Cable storms the mutant prison located in an isolated snow-covered mountain range. An indomitable half-man, half-cyborg, equipped with massive firepower, he blasts away at Russell. A flashforward reveals Russell cremated Cable's wife and daughter, after the teen had grown up. Cable plans to liquidate him before Russell grows old enough to harm his loved ones. However, Cable must bypass Deadpool, but Deadpool refuses to accommodate him. <br/><br/>Not only does grim-looking Cable resemble the Terminator, but he is also every bit as alarming. Deadpool compares him with 'the Winter Soldier.' A straight-forward, time-traveling titan on a personal vendetta, Cable has no tolerance for humor. Cable makes the perfect straight man, and the granite-jawed Brolin looks born to play the character. He disparages Deadpool as ""an annoying clown dressed up as a sex toy."" Cable looks nothing like Thanos. Another Marvel character who hasn't been seen since ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" appears in one of the more dynamic action scenes. After Deadpool abandons Russell, Russell forges a friendship with Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a muscle-bound behemoth who wears a lampshade helmet. Inevitably, Colossus and Juggernaut tangle, in a reprise of Colossus's clash with Angel Dust (Gina Carano) in the original. Deadpool resolves to thwart Cable and rescue Russell during an armored prison convoy transfer. Assembling team 'X-Force,' a bunch of mutant half-wits, he uses them to hijack the convoy. Their mission is doomed from the start, and Deadpool must contend with trigger-happy Cable as well as the barbarous Juggernaut. Amidst all this turmoil, Russell's chief adversary, the despicable Headmaster (Eddie Marsan of ""The World's End""), makes an unforgettable impression despite the modicum of time allowed him. 
""Atomic Blonde"" director David Leitch sets several exhilarating, over-the-top, acrobatic faceoffs to venerable Top-40 hit tunes. The action erupts with Deadpool's world tour where he assails crime families everywhere and racks up a double-digit body count. Indeed, ""Deadpool 2"" bristles with more scenes of simulated cinematic violence than its predecessor. Leitch's polished directorial flare; the top-drawer CGI effects; and Ryan Reynolds' nonstop humor distinguish this superior sequel. The scene where Deadpool shoots Ryan Reynolds as he reads the ""Green Lantern"" screenplay is riotous. Not as atrocious as Reynolds argues, ""Green Lantern"" went belly-up at the box-office, and he maintains his contempt for it here as he did in ""Deadpool."" ""Deadpool"" scenarists Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, along with Reynolds, make nothing easy for our protagonist. He suffers several setbacks. The Brad Pitt cameo highlights the hilarious ""X-Force"" debacle as well as the X-Men that Wade overlooks at the mansion. Altogether, ""Deadpool 2"" is far more entertaining and uproarious than ""Deadpool,"" and the writers create greater depth and spontaneity in this follow-up."

","Disclaimer: I am agnostic on movies, have no special attachment to either Marvel or DC comics (never read comic books), hardly ever go to the theatre to see a film (cheap, usually watch movies for 2.99 on youtube, and use speedup plug in to watch at 2x speed), and usually don't partake of R-rated films.<br/><br/>Other than that, I went to the theatre to see this film because I enjoyed the first DP film on youtube so much.<br/><br/>Refreshing anti-hero, anti-status-quo approach.<br/><br/>How the entire 1500 crew that was needed to produce this film made it hang together so well is sheer ..., well, art. Truly at the peak of capability.<br/><br/>There are almost 2 dialogues going on at once, one that follows the main trajectory, and the second dialogue that is all chatter that reflects what goes on in our heads, we that actually use filters before speaking, ha.<br/><br/>The campiness factor went right to 11 but never jumps the shark - I am sure that comes with much work on the film. Much care to create a really enjoyable, watchable movie. The 4th-wall breaks are all funny.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds: 1) I wonder what he ever would have done if he didn't use all this energy and creativity in film, and 2) I wonder how many people out the world miss their real calling.<br/><br/>Using an overweight adolescent for a superhero, unbelievable.<br/><br/>The only thing that disconnected my suspended disbelief was the incredible asymmetry of disaster. That usually happens in a film like this.<br/><br/>I get that the entire mood of the film has to be set using vulgarity and weirdness - I don't have people I know as vulgar as in the movie, so that demands more willing suspended disbelief. Harsh on the ears, much less the weirdness on the eyes. <br/><br/>All scenes with Leslie Uggams destroyed me - the comic creativity and imagination blows my mind. No spoilers, though."

","It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Deadpool is a unique film in the midst of plenty. Take even Deadpool's weird clownish costume in comparison with modern practical tenedencies.
To be honest I didn't expect any big movements in Deadpool 2 from its predecessor but I was definitely wrong. 
It's even weird to realise how one R-rated movie can be so dumb and so witty at the same time. It delivers you abnormal amount of profanity, flat and pervert jokes, puns, mocks and allusions on the film itself, Marvel comics themselves, not taking about mentioning and laughing at almost everything and everyone MCU and DCEU (and not only!!!) created; together with a story based on a personal tragedy of Wade Wilson and deeper understanding of his new motives.
At first, I was afraid that the film would overshadow Wade by having many supporting characters, but it all appeared (again in the dumbest and most cynical way possible) that it's not this case - it is still a Wade Wilson's ""asshole"" show with constant and shameless breakings of the fourth wall (if it even exists in this film at all).

","Deadpool 2 once again delivers with its over the top violence, comedy & sick jokes, foul language and so on. The fight scenes were really good and well orchestrated. Josh Brolin was magnificent as Cable and so was Zazie Beetz as Domino. The characters from the first Deadpool led by the great Ryan Reynolds himself were back and magnificent as well. The plot was ok but if you are planning to watch any Deadpool movie solely for a great plot, Deadpool probably isn't the best option though I got to admire Ryan Reynold's story telling/narrating skills in Deadpool as the main plot develops. I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for the usual elements that make a Deadpool movie great like the over the top violence I mentioned.
Job well done by the David Leitch and Ryan Reynolds."

"jhalcollege","6","1","2","9 June 2018"," Both better and worse than Deadpool 1
","Did anyone really see the first Deadpool movie coming? It pumped a good deal of freshness into a long expired genre, to the joy of both critiques and fans.<br/><br/>This iteration has many redeeming qualities, and a plethora of good and vulgar lines. If you came for kicks, you won't be disappointed. Everything good you enjoyed about the first is back. Enough said about the pros. <br/><br/>One of the flaws of the first versions was a complicated mix between joking and serious scenes. This occurs to a bigger extent in the sequel. After an entertaining, violent, and profane action sequence, the film takes a dramatic side for a few moments, only to return to whacking off more heads. Since parts of this movie don't take themselves seriously in the slightest (one of it's redeeming qualities), it's hard to sympathize when it does try to be genuine. How can the audience care about someone genuinely dying when dozens of others did so comedically? One may argue that the solemn moments provide a necessary break from the goofiness, but others will disagree. <br/><br/>In addition, some of the new characters weren't ideal. Fourteen year old Firefist isn't a particularly likable character, which is unfortunate since he plays an important role. Not to mention he sounds more British than Ron Weasley, which proves to be more of an ear sore. They also throw in a relatively pointless lesbian relationship between Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yu-Gi-Oh (both characters have next to no development, why even put Yukioh in there). And after all that, they even use the same actor for villain as Infintiy War (Josh Brolin) in case you didn't get enough of him for the first 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>All in all, the goods parts of this movie were quite exciting and fresh. But if we've learned anything from Newton, it's that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, and those opposite reactions will have you wishing you were out buying more popcorn."

","When Josh Brolin said in an interview that Deadpool 2 was funnier was the first Deadpool I thought it was some promotion BS but was i glad I was wrong Deadpool 2 was funnier and more action packed than the first Movie.<br/><br/>Before I say what I enjoyed about Deadpool I would just like tonsay although DP2 is funnier and more action packed it is not better than the first one and I will talk about that.First off the first act of this movie was weird ot feels like the movie is transitioning from the first movie even thought it uses from jokes from the first movie and surprisingly they work throughout the film.Although something emotional happens in the first act involing Deadpool and Mellisa's character Vanassea it felt like the director or writers did not know how to fully utilize until the later stages of The second act of the movie.
Although I have to say again again Ryan Reynolds Performance as Deadpool is Great and is never boring throughout the movie.
When the movie starts to go into the second act the story felt more clear and focused amd the action and humor are amped up with Cable being added to the mix making jokes about Dubstep and Deadpool with his dry humor.
The kid in the film firefist potrayed by Blah was okay he had a simple story with was the catalist for the entire movie and the performance was fitting.
The second half of the movie is were all the excitinv this happen with all the X-Force stuff amd the do something with X-Force thats hilarious some people may find it dissaponting but for me it was wonder amd Betaz character Domino was kind of badass who had the superpowet of luck with proved to be cinematic
The last act of the film was also well done a bit weird but well executed with very funny humor,explosive action
Now the villains of the story there was a surprise
Villain in the movie that I won't spoil but when whenever tnis villain was onscreen he was awesome and the other viallain which involved firefist and doing these bad experiments was kinda weakni mean you understood why they where villians but it was too generic and weak
And then there was the story arc involved the Cable and the kid which was a bit take it or leave it lod of thing but never riuned the experience of the movie at all.
The story may have felt of in the first act of the movie the story became more focused in the second act and again the movie is very funny on certain scenes i was literary crying from laughing even thought this certain basic instinct moment happened with was a bit much the movie was still great and the action was better and more epic.The returning characters like Colossus were also good in the film so that gets an up.And again Ryan Reynold performance was great the man can do no wrong as Deadpool.
So Deadpool 2 was not as amazing as the first movie it was still fresh,enjoyable,funny and i cant wait for more."

","I don't think I have spoilers, but I'm gonna put a spoiler warning just in case!<br/><br/>I don't know if the negative reviews have even seen the same movie or not, but I felt that Deadpool 2 was better than the first (as the title dictates). Most of these reviewers say the movie wasn't funny but don't realize that comedy is subjective. Another complained about it having a lot of CGI. Hello? It's a modern superhero movie. Of course it's going to have a lot of CGI. Then another said Justice League was better.<br/><br/>Okay, now that's just plain wrong. Subjectivity and objectivity aside, Justice League was the 2nd worst movie I saw last year (The Bye Bye Man was awful) and I know plenty of people who would agree with me on that.<br/><br/>Anyways, now that that's out of the way. The high points of this movie consist of great acting, a fluid storyline, memorable characters, jokes that hit, Peter, the villain's reasoning, BACKSTORIES!, Peter, amazing cinematography, fantastic choreography, well directed, and it takes a note from the comic books on how Deadpool truly should be like. Oh, and did I mention Peter? Sugarbear?<br/><br/>All in all, other reviewers crap on this movie like no tomorrow and other reviewers praise it. At the end of the day, it's just like every other movie. Don't list to reviewers, not even me, just watch the movie yourself and make your own opinion. AMC theaters have $5 tickets on Tuesdays for Stubs members. No, this is not a paid advertisement."

","Disclaimer: I'm not a big fan of super-hero movies. It hurts me when all the cliches are thrown in the plot, and I've literally fallen asleep on a few occasions during intense fight scenes. <br/><br/>That being said,I really enjoyed the first Deadpool. It seemed like a breath of fresh air and I LOVED the sarcasm, wit and humor. I think this second attempt is slightly weaker, although true to its original story. The characters are pretty damn interesting and more complex than in most movies of the genre. Deadpool is a jerk with some redeeming qualities (or maybe a good guy with some serious impulse control issues, that's for each to decide), and the bad guy actually has a backstory that makes the viewer really sympathize with his plight. <br/><br/>Now for the negatives. There were multiple times when the jokes left the audience in a theater of about 50 people silent. There were some really crass jokes that I thought had no place in the script (making fun of other people's appearance for no good reason is rarely a good idea, imho). And believe me, I have a pretty high tolerance for all sorts of comedy and usually enjoy pushing humor to the limit. But these jokes in the Deadpool script were simply not funny and left you wondering why the writers were trying so hard. Which takes me to my second point, that throughout the movie I had a nagging impression this movie was too much of an audience-pleaser to the point where it just didn't feel as fresh and well-crafted as the first Deadpool. In the name of the absurd and the parody, the risk is to deliver a mindless sequence of jokes that would address certain sensibilities/expectations of the audience without any kind of originality.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I had quite a few laughs and my favorite scenes involved the X-Force dying after skydiving and pretty much any scene with the blind lady and the Indian taxi driver.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty fun for a Friday night out, but nothing too special."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","1","2","23 May 2018"," The perfect sequel
","Nastier, meaner and funnier than the first part. Full of great references. Almost every scene and spoken dialogues is a reference of pop culture. The action works perfectly, sometimes maybe a bit overloaded but they still did not forget about the story. And even if it wasn't Shakespeare it is exactly what you expect and want from a film like that. Almost a parody of all superhero films out there - but with some depths. Yes you've read correctly: Deadpool 2 does indeed have depths.
Ryan Reynolds is great, no doubt, his performance is not refreshing or surprising as in the first part, but pretty much holds up to it.
Josh Brolin's cast was a perfect gig for the film, especially considering his new found legacy with ""Avengers"". Good performance as well.
Zazzie Beetz is also a wonderful addition and Brianna Hildebrand is always great to watch in that role. The soundtrack is an absolute blast and also there you find improvement from the first part, which already contained a nearly perfect soundtrack. David Leitch, who already delivered last years underrated action opera ""Atomic Blonde"" was the perfect choice for the direction. He understands to combine great choreographed action scenes with the ideal soundtrack. 
Cool cameos by Brad Pitt, Nicholas Hoult and especially Matt Damon to watch out for."

"FelipeCarrillo","7","1","2","23 May 2018"," Is black humor a racist disposition, Mr. Deadpool?
","I'm not sure if Deadpool would fit into Marvel Studios' new rising canon in relation to the recent billionaire contract between companies, hence the aggressive and abrasive superhero shines out in a simple, direct plot. The screenplay is written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick - two screenwriters from the first installment - and Reynolds himself, the story decides to develop itself within the limits fixed by the previously selected genres, resting, as could not be otherwise, on the scarred shoulders of the red-and-black hero. Nonetheless, this is a far-seeing second film, which allows nearly fifteen additional characters to be included in a split second, opting for a quintet/sextet - is Dopinder, the taxi driver and faithful squire, on the team? - that lays the groundwork for what will be their standalone film - cough, new franchise, cough,- X-Force. The exposition of the daring group is irregular because they don't present in their own movie, a fact that caused the writers to compact the materials organically without deflecting from the plot focus; having said that, watching them working on the screen isn't as magnetic and special as one would expect, but they produce enough charm to sympathize with each of them. The incorruptible morale of Colossus, voiced by Stefan Kapicic, and the commendable CGI effort bring a strong and fantastic counterpoint to our hero because they compose a ridiculously genuine bromance; Zazie Beetz's Domino doesn't reach Valkyrie's empowered female impact, but defends its lucky storyline by means of a sincere and distant acting development that falls apart trying to fill the impression she couldn't cause - it's respectful not include in the final footage the sequence led by her stunt double, Joi ""SJ"" Harris, after the tragedy that took place on 14 August last year; - Taika Waititi's big Kiwi revelation, who portrays Russell, is one of the characters who gains an important background and dramatic development, which helps him become a vital handle to the general plot by means of a plausible, emotional and, to tell the truth, quite realistic performance; as a mutant, Firefist is the spirited new youth incorporation in the clan, it'd be interesting to see how it would develop his storyline in a story in which he and his burning hands become part of a team; Nathan Summers' time travels are truly wasted - save the epic and meta-narrative post-credits scene - for large-scale situations, they're never used as an instrument in storytelling, are simply an input/output mechanism for a half-human, half-machine-and-armament hero; in the same way, its introduction is tremendously indecisive and ineffective, with a flat and out-of-place edition delivering short, insubstantial glimpses about the next member of the gang. However, ever-fierce Josh Brolin endows Cable, the most long-awaited new character by the fanatics, with virility and overwhelming visual portent, his scenes expel physical and mental strength, not excluding a subtle emergence of comedy through his unwavering and austere personality; And last but not least: Deadpool. The actor from ""Green Lantern -"" I'm sorry, I had to do it - found what Hugh Jackman and Tom Cruise found in Wolverine and Ethan Hunt respectively: the role by which he'll be recognized for the rest of his career. The naturalness, dynamism, vigor and passion impregned by the Canadian interpreter are really a cracker, the irreverence and comicalness of this fella, who had been pursuing these movies since his failed incorporation in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", reveal how much hard work he did, every line coming from his mouth, adorned with his characteristic gestures that aren't hidden under the suit, is cruel, dramatic and hilarious; it's incredible the power his performance has to know how to handle the rhythm throughout the film and the exact moment of each parodic insertion leaning on a brutal script. No doubt, this highly-anticipated sequel never loses sight of its raison d'être, providing an authentic, entertaining story, which is open to receive the incessant jokes coming from the screenplay. Ryan Reynolds is killing it as Deadpool. <br/><br/>It's increasingly obvious the writing of the screenplay was more complicated than you thought, as shaping the hilarious dialogues for the anti-hero demands inventiveness from more than one brain. Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds stick thousands, thousands, thousands of references, not just as the usual easter-eggs game. Pop-culture is key, the endless mentions on screen through one-liners are sickeningly amusing thanks to our strange time. No-one and nothing can get away from the vicious signs: literature (Pericles), music (dubstep), singers (Cher and Justin Bieber), actors (Jackman and, oh!, Reynolds), of course film (""Star Wars,"" DC, Marvel, 007's ""Spectre,"" ""John Wick"" and a long etcetera), and even the movie conception itself, laughing at the writing process, the production companies, its screenwriters and director through an unforgettable meta-cinematographic language. Such was the impact that I began to hyperventilate, picking references that maybe were never deliberately introduced by the screenwriters (""Spy"" by Paul Feig or ""Inception"" by Nolan). Hands down, the film with more explicitly-implanted-in-the-script pop-culture references I have ever seen. <br/><br/>It's sad to admit, but fourth wall breaking decreases in impact and number. It's an understandable decision because this time our hero isn't alone, but the movie should find ways and new narrative incursions which replace the role that played this brilliant technique. However, the few are short and don't get the importance they deserve, yes, we still have his peculiar voice-over monologues maneuvering anachronistically the story and mocking even the smallest detail, but they never bridge the gap of those long and hilarious soliloquies and conversations he held with the audience as a narrative mechanism with tremendous effectiveness.<br/><br/>
It'd be demoralizing to say that, after the titanic and classical work put into ""Infinity War"" with regard to the creation, treatment, and exposition of its villains, Marvel has taken a step back, sorry, somehow it did. All right, Ed Skrein's Ajax isn't the best Marvel villain of all time, but it's neither the worst because he gives it a proper development and time enough on screen to make the viewer understand who the bad guy in the movie is, however, on this occasion, there is no a delimited antagonist. Obviously, most viewers buy a ticket to see their favorite hero do and undo, but it's important to know if whoever gets such punches- curse words in this case -has managed to involve with the audience and the story, here, none of that happened of course. Villain's role changes so many times that, in the end, the course of events seems disoriented; firstly, Cable would become a pain in the neck for the antihero according to the script, however, thanks to a shrewd plot twist, Mr. Nathan gives up his seat to two more characters, a yo-yo move that doesn't favor and ends up giving the perception there is no real villain, perhaps, the only baddie is Deadpool. <br/><br/>This installment had the chance to remedy the lack of spectacle in the mise-en-scène and the exposition of the largest and most expensive set-pieces, however, even with a highly qualified stunt coordinator, you never get something really epic matching tremendous levels of violence with some kind of visual beauty. Stuntman-turned-filmmaker David Leitch is known for what ""John Wick"" is recognized as a cult-film today: its fierce, brutal, meticulously choreographed combats. Although it's evident an upsurge in less-artificial fighting scenes and comically bloody sequences, none of these serves to mask a lackluster visual buffet, in the last, lacking styled compositions that leave you astounded, doing no justice to the exquisite visuals and action in ""JW"" and ""Atomic Blonde,"" the two previous works of the filmmaker. Jonathan Sela's cinematography handles intelligent and frankly striking angles, but he never ventures to pass the limits over and decides to settle with a couple of laudable sequences that always shine under the shadow of the well-made fights in the first flick, I find it somewhat strange, especially taking into account who its director is, not even the final sequence which draws its strengths on the always-funny performances and the unbeatable screenplay. There are similarities in a specific sequence, one that many remember from Miller's pic for the misuse of special effects, yes, the one in which Wade Wilson is kicking asses along a freeway as an opening scene, here, it's Domino who must withstand an embarrassing set-piece, it's unheard of the poorly-achieved digital effects it must endure, it seems as if the crew had forgotten to finish it and had decided to release it that way, the scenes aren't realistic at all, it looks like a 2000's video game. Tyler Bates doesn't do a sincerely rewarding feat as his ""soundtrack"" for the film vomits hyperactive and energetic melodies over the frames, that don't contribute anything to the visual part to excel. The only original song which can really monopolize the spotlights soon is 'Ashes ' interpreted by the queen Celine Dion.<br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" by David Leitch unimpeachably dynamizes only some of the features which made the first movie so freestanding, unusually special and extravagant while neglecting aspects of cardinal importance as a good approach to the characters, a stunning visual section and a deep, conscious development and treatment to a powerful villain. But don't worry, you'll get more vicious action, trenchant jokes and one-liners, visual gags, a new volatile group of heroes, many, many references of all kinds and an experience that does not disappoint, but what's a Wade Wilson/Ryan Reynolds who gets his long-awaited sequel where the only thing that matters is the surface? By the way, did I leave the stove on?"
"Mr-Fusion","8","1","2","22 May 2018"," Goes full-on action movie, and it's a blast
","Between death, family and franchise-building, ""Deadpool 2"" has a lot of balls to juggle. And it's a testament to the talent involved that every one of them stays in the air. In this character, Ryan Reynolds has found his definitive role; it's the perfect vehicle for his class-clown personality, while letting his id run completely wild. Sure, this was on display in the first movie, but even he was bound by the constraints of the origin story mold. <br/><br/>And as a sequel, this movie makes clear that those bonds are history. It delves into the character of Wade Wilson while still offering a perverse take on the idea of the super team. It makes incredibly effective use of Josh Brolin as Cable, and even brings an array of color to Deadpool's farcical take on the X-Force. The whole thing is a rebellious ""wascally wabbit"" jab at the superhero genre, and I enjoyed every second. Not to mention the inspired casting of Domino, who gives The Merc with a Mouth a run for his money in every scene (swooooon).<br/><br/>I've seen this twice in the last few days and it's the most fun I've had at a Marvel* movie in quite a while. I love the violence, the cast and the satiric sense of humor. This is a franchise worth building. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>*Okay, Marvel property"

","After surviving a near fatal bovine attack, a disfigured cafeteria chef (Wade Wilson) struggles to fulfill his dream of becoming Miami's hottest bartender, while also learning to cope with his lost sense of taste. Searching to regain his spice for life, as well as a flux capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship, and flavor - finding a new taste for adventure and earning the coveted coffee mug title of World's Best Lover.<br/><br/>That was the synopsis of Deadpool 2 as released by Twentieth Century Fox. Typically, loony, irreverent and fun as the movie itself.<br/><br/>Deadpool: Fuck Wolverine. First he rides my coattails with the R-rating, and then, that hairy motherfucker ups the ante by dying! What a dick! Well, guess what, Wolvie? I'm dying in this movie.<br/><br/>As it was in 2016, there was Deadpool on one side, and there was everything else from Hollywood on the other side. Wacky R-rated humor paired with obscene violence, and frequent fourth wall breaking paired with a narcissist of an anti-hero, Deadpool set a template that only Deadpool 2 could hope to match up. And match up it did, with oodles of style.<br/><br/>Deadpool: And every good family film starts with a vicious murder - Bambi, The Lion King, Saw VII...<br/><br/>2017 may have been Wolverine's year but 2018 is Deadpool's. And as he points out just before he mourns Wolverine's death in a montage that will send most James Bond themes to shame- this is a family film. The Merc with a Mouth has gone global, diligently killing bad guys, while dreaming of starting a family with Vanessa. But one of his targets escape and kill Vanessa, leading to the unkillable Deadpool becoming suicidal.<br/><br/>Deadpool: George Michael was right, I'm never going to dance again<br/><br/>Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to make Deadpool into a X-Man but then shit happens. Machete don't tweet, and Deadpool no X-Man.<br/><br/>Colossus: We have rules. You are not judge, jury or executioner.
Deadpool: Fuck your rules! I fight for what's right, and sometimes you gotta fight dirty.<br/><br/>Deadpool ends up in a prison for mutants where their powers are taken away by a collar strapped on to the neck and waits for his death because with the collar on, his superpower is just unbridled cancer. As he quietly resigns himself to grow some tumors, he finds another reason to live- defending a young mutant (Firefist) destined for bad things from a super soldier from the future- Cable, whose family has been murdered by Firefist. In the future, of course.<br/><br/>Cable: Who are you?
Deadpool: I'm Batman.<br/><br/>And then it begins. Even though Cable in the movie is 5'11 only unlike the comics, Deadpool is badly mauled by him in round 1, and Deadpool assembles a team to take him on. Zietgeist, Bedlam, Shatterstar, Vanisher, Domino and Peter make up X-Force, because-<br/><br/>Deadpool: Thank you, Bedlam. I was always appalled by the blatant sexism in the group's name. X-Men? *Men*? The point is, our group will be forward-thinking. Gender neutral. From now on, we'll be known as... X-Force.
Except for Domino- the mutant with the ability to manipulate luck, none of the other X-Force team members make it beyond 2 minutes of screen time. And soon, the ""coolest Marvel character never to be used as of yet in the right way"" is unleashed- Juggernaut<br/><br/>Deadpool: It has always been a dream to see my face reflected in your helmet.
Juggernaut: I will rip you into half
Deadpool: That is exactly what Juggernaut will say.<br/><br/>Ripped in half he is, and like in Deadpool, Wade had to slow-grow a hand, this time he has to slow-grow a pair of legs. Soon, my enemy's enemy is my friend mentality takes over, Cable, X-Force and X-Men unite to take down the big bad while also preventing Firefist from becoming a killer. And kudos to the editing team to fast forward the climax just when it seemed it will go all Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>As they say, it is often not the actor finding the role, that the role finds the actor. Ryan Reynolds channelizes all of his rom-com pedigree to sell this chaotic comedy. All the other actors do a great job too, including Josh Brolin as the diametrically opposite Cable, Zazie Beetz as the straight faced Domino, and TJ Miller as the weaselly Weasel. Besides there is a host of blink and you miss celebrity cameos that are worth the price of the ticket- Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Alan Tudyk, the entire X-Men cast, and a thousand pop culture references (my favorite being John Cusack's boombox scene from Say Anything when Deadpool serenades Colossus) that will demand incessant viewings. <br/><br/>Bigger, better and more cohesive that the first, with a funnier script, extended special effects and great characters- Deadpool 2 sets the bar even higher for R-rated action comedies.<br/><br/>I am not saying that Deadpool 2 is the best movie of the year, but it is most definitely the one that you will laugh in the most. As Deadpool says, hope the Academy is watching."

If you choose Deadpool 2, you will get these but to be honest,it's not that groundbreaking like the first one. What I mean is that the movie is good but Deadpool itself got a little bit exhausted along the way and everyone is funny in this movie (except for Cable) even Deadpool is funny at times but his jokes are the same and sometimes it's boring. The character is still good but he's at best when he has the chance to interact with the others.

"bobandlulureview","8","1","2","19 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 - What's your favourite F word
","When I watched Deadpool way back in 2016 I was disappointed by all the cuts in the scenes and muting of dialogues. Therefore I ended up downloading it and watched the uncensored version on my laptop. I ended up watching the movie everyday as soon as I woke up for an entire week. That's how much I loved Deadpool. You can only imagine how excited I was about Deadpool 2! My friend went ahead and booked the tickets and we were all set for the movie on Friday for the 2:55 show. As expected it was house-full and the crowd as always was very ignorant. I am a pop culture enthusiast. I am an 80's child and I love music and I love my books and I love my actors and I love the characters they play.<br/><br/>James Bond, Flashdance, Logan, Talented Mr. Ripley, X - Men, Green Lantern, Terminator, Top Gun, Ace Ventura Pet Detective, Hulk, Avengers Infinity War, John Wick, Yentil, Frozen, Batman Vs. Superman, Interview With The Vampire, Basic Instinct, Robo Cop, Indiana Jones, Annie are some of the most glaring movie references made. Do I even need to begin with the comics? Ah... the scooter, the coffin, the feet, the lazy writing, the ash coloured suit are just a few.<br/><br/>The music? Let's get to that after the review. DP has a lot on his mind, making babies being one of them. Just when Venessa and Wade are ready to make a family, things go wrong. How wrong? Well DP wets himself in a bar. Tries to off himself but that doesn't work. His mangled body is taken to the one place where the mutants are sheltered - the X Mansion. He becomes a trainee only to become a prisoner in the ice box and you just won't believe who else is sharing space in the ice box. Brad Pitt. Nah.<br/><br/>Of course our anti-hero escapes the prison and forms the X Force who FYI all die except for Domino and that's when the story begins to take shape. Unlike the previous movie where Wade is trying to come to terms with his burnt ass body here he is trying to overcome the F word. You'll know which F word when you watch the movie. It is so unlike DP to get preachy but he does and that's when my heart began to sink but then I reminded myself that the movie wasn't over.<br/><br/>DP does some soul searching. He manages to get you to root for him and you know that he's a good guy with a potty mouth and you still love him. Of course there's Russell, Cable and Domino who all play a very important role in the movie. The movie does a good job of racial, body type and gender representation.<br/><br/>What keeps the movie going? It's definitely got some squirm worthy fight scenes. If we saw his hands growing in the last movie we see his legs grow in this one and we witness some really basic stuff and instinctively know what Wade is trying to do.<br/><br/>Is the movie as good as the previous one? I don't think I want to compare the two. As a standalone it does fine but I loved the first installment more. Then the credits started rolling in and I was suddenly enjoying the movie again!<br/><br/>If I had to sum up the movie in one sentence, I'd say it is basically DP meeting a boy going through puberty. As for what happens when you have a raging teenager who doesn't know the difference between good and bad? Watch the movie. You'll be reminded of your teenage days and your choices and most importantly it leaves you with what is rarely told out loud - Kids can change!<br/><br/>Things I enjoyed in the movie? Ah well mostly the way people die. DP comes with such innovative ways! Wonder why these ideas never crossed my mind!<br/><br/>Now coming to the music... Air Supply, Dolly Parton, Celine Dion, Ah-a's, our very own Udit Narayan and so many, many more are featured in the OST.<br/><br/>Recommend: This is a movie for pop culture maniacs like me. I'd recommend it for everybody who wants to 'off' others vicariously ;)<br/><br/>P.S: Unlike its previous installment, this movie doesn't have nudity just explicit language and references but otherwise is very mellow compared to the first installment. I just don't understand why this wasn't given a U/A certificate. To all kids who missed the movie, my heart goes out to you. This after all was the story about a teenager and the other lead actor is just 15 years old. Ah well... we are all lucky that comics aren't censored... yet."

","After all the waiting, hype and marketing campaigns Deadpool 2 fails to impress. I absolutely loved part 1 because it was fresh, funny and creative. Don't get me wrong, part 2 does have some amazing laugh out loud moments that are quite memorable and on the same level as part 1. Unfortunately, so much else seems forced and drags on unnecessarily where instead of witty jokes it becomes a cringefest. The story is as basic as they come and I was expecting them to come up with something interesting after all these years and addition of new characters. In my opinion, for an 18+ movie, action scenes are sub-par and unimpressive compared to other superhero films. They focused way too much on the jokes and barely managed to get half of the right.<br/><br/>If there was no Deadpool 1 benchmark, this movie would have been alright but there are no excuses to drop the ball after a budget increase. The movie simply tries too hard by adding more humor, more characters, more senseless killing and fails to match part 1 which was simple yet elegant and hit all the right spots using limited resources.<br/><br/>I am not discouraging anyone from seeing it, maybe I am the only one who was disappointed."

This is Deadpool. It's exactly that and it's building a good team around him."

"callumpenzer-79938","9","2","7","25 May 2018"," Deadpool 2: Better than the first!
","I believed that Deadpool 2 has been really overlooked due to Infinity War coming out a few weeks before but after seeing it I see why it made more money in its opening box office weekend - because it was incredible! This was hilarious I couldn't stop laughing from the standard jokes to the subtle and neesh jokes. All the references, gags, just everything had me dying of laughter.<br/><br/>All the characters in the film were perfect. Domino is such a cool character I could not get enough of her in action scenes. Zazie portrayed the character phenomenally. Ryan Reynolds of course pulled off Deadpool perfectly and I could not see anyone filling in that role but him. He is just perfect for it. Also, Josh Brolin. KILLED it as the villain once again. Twice in one year he managed to give an interesting character to the audience, even though he isn't really the main protagonist. By far the best surprise was to see the juggernaut in the film. I did run into a spoiler about his appearance but it doesn't change the fact I loved what they did with his character. Definitely did him justice for X-Men: Last Stand.<br/><br/>All the subtle hints and easter eggs where on point. Having a brief cameo of the X-Men in the mansion was perfect, the cameo of Brad Pitt which was out of nowhere, some other well known actors such as Terry Crews and Bill Skarsgård were hilarious if only brief. The other easter eggs such as the soundtrack behind Logan's death is also behind Deadpool's death were just perfect. The multiple character references listing from Batman, Thanos, Black Widow, Black Panther, Wolverine. It was all just spot on. The little hints to the director being the one to John Wick and the James Bond type introduction. It just all had me in pieces.<br/><br/>The emotion behind the whole of the movie is incredible and it just shows that Deadpool is willing to do whatever to stay with Vanessa after her very unexpected death, which may have been reversed in the after credits? Also, the after credits were perfect. The time travelling Deadpool to save Peter and Vanessa from dying seemed to be adequate for the storyline however the assassination of Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the assassination of Ryan Reynolds after reading the Green Lantern script had me crying. The little things like this just tied the whole movie together - perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall I am pleasantly met with my prediction that Deadpool 2 will top the first movie and bring in more laughter and references for us true fans and those wanting to get into a superhero franchise. I genuinely can't wait to hear future news of whether Deadpool 3 will become a thing. But until then all I have to say was this was incredible."

","I love Deadpool, I love the dark humor and the fourth-wall breaking. His character is by far one of my favorites. Often sequels fail to live up to the first film, but that was not the case for DP2.<br/><br/>Deadpool has a lot to offer from awesome new characters and diversity to plenty of creative deaths and fun dialogue. The Deadpool movies are always what they say they are. Just in a very unconventional fashion and that's kind of the point, Deadpool is a very unconventional character. It's why we love him.<br/><br/>Parent discretion is advised though.<br/><br/>Was is DP2 worth seeing in theaters? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Would I see it again in theater?

","Josh Brolin is awesome. For the last month, he has been dominating world cinema with his formidable supervillain Thanos. All the moviegoers have been talking about him and his character. Here in this film Deadpool 2, he continues his dominance with a new supervillain Cable, and this time the new character has a heart. In some way, Josh Brolin is transforming the character development of villain that is usually bad for no reason, in the sense that his charaters are either reasonable or not that bad, or both. <br/><br/>This sequel improves over its 2016 original movie ""Deadpool"" in terms of the number of jokes and the number of topics covered in the jokes. Particularly, it refers to Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech. It also touches on James Cameron's actioners ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" that some villain is traveling back in time to kill some boy, preventing something in the future to happen. Even Brolin's makeup is similar to that of Schwarzenegger. <br/><br/>Of course, nothing is perfect. The shortcoming of this movie is the same as its original, which is that the plot is too simple. Besides, the profanity and violence prevent it from being a family-friendly movie."

Can't explain the negative reviews, but in a world filled with easily offended, I can see how this could offend....because it is intended to and most know that walking in. <br/><br/>There were some parts that I saw some girls in their 20's crying, even us guys were almost sweating through our eyes lol.

","It does manage to do what most sequels don't: follow the original, stay ""true"" to it, but introduces some new stuff and lets go of some old stuff.<br/><br/>But, it has many of the same problems as the first movie, there's no improvement here. If you liked the original, you'll like this one. And if you didn't, then you won't.<br/><br/>There's much less real breaking of the 4th wall, which makes this less of a ""Deadpool"" thing. But, since it didn't really work in the original, I guess that could have been expected.<br/><br/>Sequel goes more for trying out jokes and more one-liners, sacrificing the plot, which is ridiculous anyways, so no loss there. It has a rather even pace of a good joke about ~15 minutes. In the meantime, though, it can get kind of annoying... like ""please, stop trying, you're not doing so well"". While these interludes are not as fun or funny as intended, they are somewhat interesting.<br/><br/>Zazie Beetz is very charming, which is a nice touch - basically everybody else is somewhat uncharming. Maybe they could have played a little more on that.<br/><br/>There's one interesting surprise at the end - the slow performance of the 80s hit ""Take on Me"", which works out great. The song was originally something completely different, that's why the surprise is so big and why it works so well.<br/><br/>It still doesn't really expose the superhero genre for all its silliness, that's obviously for some other movie to take on. Deadpool just tries to have fun and, at times, succeeds."

The first half of the movie kind of lags but second half makes up for it where all the jokes land and its action packed. <br/><br/>I give Deadpool 2 8.5 stars.

"MattJStevenson","7","3","13","16 May 2018"," Deadpool fans rejoice! They did it again.
","I had a really good time with Deadpool 2. It continues with the humour, action and awareness of the original, while also taking all three to the extreme. Action scenes are bigger, more varied and incredibly entertaining. Whilst turning it up to 11 works well for the action, I feel like the meta references and crude humour was stretched to its absolute limit and took me out of the movie occasionally.<br/><br/>One thing Deadpool had going for it was the heart, the love story/Wade's mortality elements of the narrative always felt earned. Sadly I do not feel the same way about Deadpool 2. This movie (like many other franchises) throws around the word ""family"" quite a lot. Whilst the old and new characters are all very entertaining and work well together, I didn't feel like a family was established. <br/><br/>Overall I would recommend Deadpool 2 to anyone who enjoyed the original. I know I have my reservations overall, but I agree with my friends initial comment of ""I don't think I have giggled so much in the cinema since South Park""."

Straights are still 90% of the population, so shouldn't movie at least have 90% of straight dialogs? How about that for a change?

"grantbullert","6","2","8","19 May 2018"," An Entertaining Sequel, but a Step Down from the First
","""Deadpool 2"" is enjoyable and fun, as raunchy as ever, and a bit too long.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: There are a decent amount of laughs in ""Deadpool 2"" but not as many as the first. The story is a bit forced, but that is not the goal of the film. The hope of the film is to make people laugh, which it was moderately successful at. It doesn't have the same magic the first film had. David Leitch does a decent job of bringing focus to the film, but a few parts are a bit messy. Of course, this is not your typical film so it's hard to judge. *Cinematography/Editing: The framing all throughout the film was fine, but the color grading is very distracting. It looks like a student film at times: way too much blue during moments that shouldn't be blue. It has a quality of a music video, not a film. During scenes with close-ups Jonathan Sela had too shallow of a depth of field. All that was in focus was one eye of the character, but 80 percent of their face was out of focus. The editing was adequate for most of the film. Cable's introduction was weak and felt out of place. But the fight scenes were cut together well. *Dialogue/Acting: With a film that had Deadpool as the main character there is bound to be some entertaining dialogue. It doesn't always make sense, but it is enjoyable. It is nothing special but it does the job of pleasing the audience. The acting is up to par. There are no powerful performances, just enough to carry a story and get a few laughs along the way. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is crazy and serves the story and tone of the film. It is not spectacular, but it gets the job done. The sound design and sound mixing is decent. Sometimes it is over-the-top with gory sounds, but it fits the film. *Production Design/Special Effects: The production design is not very complex. Costumes are pretty basic and sometimes cheesy, but that's the point. The set designs are average. Nothing really stands out as being exceptional. The special effects were great at some points and very weak at others. CGI blood looked rather poor. Colossus still doesn't look great, but he is not bad either. Juggernaut looked less than impressive. Explosions looked pretty good throughout. Injuries to Deadpool were believable (except for ridiculously crazy ones). Most of the VFX held up or were at least bearable.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Deadpool 2"" is a slight failure from a technical and narrative standpoint. But it stays afloat if one is looking through the lens of comedic enjoyment."
"zeljkoni2000","3","2","9","8 April 2019"," Spoiled by propaganda, reduced its quality to rubbish
","The second sequel has a few good action scenes, and it had potential to be a good movie, if it wasn't for the abnormal amount of gay sexual insinuations.<br/><br/>Those scenes serve absolutely no purpose for the plot, so the only logical conclusion is they are deliberate propaganda. Even the modified version that received PG-13 rating contains those scenes. It's beyond me how a movie like that could get PG-13 or be allowed in some countries.<br/><br/>So, one has to ask himself, what's the purpose of this movie? Is it to provide fun for the youngsters, or to be advertisement for a certain ideology, disguised into an action movie.<br/><br/>If they want us to watch a 2-hour commercial, they should pay us. Not vice versa. So... if the production house or cinema didn't pay you to watch this movie, then just skip it. Not worth your time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, propaganda scenes are so impregnated into the movie that they can't be removed. It would take away 50% of the movie."
"carlos37andre","5","2","9","20 May 2018"," It's funny (and you already know that) but is also inconsistent
","I didn't expect that much of the first Deadpool movie, and I didn't expect that much of this one either. I'll be straight to the point here. The movie is fun, there are a lot of great jokes, Deadpool character is the heart and the soul of the movie, and this is great, Domino is also a great addition, Cable is ok, he works in the movie, even though the character is a bit misplaced.<br/><br/>But what really makes the movie not reach its full potential is that they try to more than that, you know? They try to be, I don't know, a movie with some kind off depth? All the scenes, where Deadpool is kind of a ""limbo"" between life and death, and talks with Vanessa, just doesn't work, it's completely out of place. There is also the death of Vanessa itself, it brings to a big part of the movie, a Deadpool that we really don't need to see, he is sad for some part, depressive, and ok, you can understand why is that, but this really isn't the type of movie that the character claim for. We don't need a sad Deadpoo, and by killing Vanessa this is what they went for (at least for some 30 minutes).<br/><br/>I guess that people overal will love that one, I didn't love the first one that much (was good, not amazing), but I was really expecting just a fun, and unpretentious movie this time around again, but they try more, and it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Just one more thing, before I forget, the CGI is really a bigger problem here that was in the first. Colossos seems worst than in the first one, and with the Fanatic addition it's hard to not notice that the budget was not the ideal here. And it's funny, because some time ago a report came out saying that Tim Miller part way to direct this one because he wanted more money, to do a bigger movie, and Ryan wanted to stay in the same ""indie movie"" style, with less money, but, you know, if you are going to put a fight between to huge CGI monsters, you need a pretty decent budget to do it... (even Cable doesn't look the ideal). It isn't something that will ruin the entire experience, but you'll notice.<br/><br/>In short, Deadpool 2 is a funny movie, there are a lot of great jokes, but it wastes much time trying to be more than just this, and Deadpool really isn't that type of character."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","2","9","17 May 2018"," Deadpool 2 is more of the same, just for another two hours.
","Whether you view that as a negative or positive will depend on how much you enjoyed its predecessor. For me, it was decent with enough violence, fourth wall breaks and referential comedy to differentiate itself from other superhero flicks. This sequel, is unfortunately inferior. Deadpool must team up with his new X-Force members to stop Cable, a futuristic terminator, from murdering a mutant child. Reynolds is back as the titular anti-hero who's mouth needs some serious soap scrubbing. His natural charismatic persona is what gives the film life. Comedic execution, deadpan delivery, exaggerative body movements, Reynolds is experienced enough now to carry the enormous weight of a franchise (particularly one he adores). Brolin added a seismic amount of physicality as the antagonising Cable whilst Beetz' sassy sarcasm wins her additional lucky points as Domino. Leitch's directing background of action films meant that the combat choreography was excitingly executed, particularly within the confined space of an armoured convoy. Plenty of pop cultural references within the screenplay ranging from 'Passion of the Christ' to the pounding techno beats of dubstep, a script that still remains self-aware as it targets itself as well as other films and people. That's where the majority of laughs come from (however, again, I did not laugh once). Also a surprisingly sombre first act which caught me off guard. However, the self-awareness has suffered fatigue. It's no longer new, and unfortunately this sequel comes across as forced and annoying in parts, with many scenes/jokes/gags being prolonged for what felt like an eternity. Far too many jokes relied on bashing the DC universe or other films which, whilst humorous at first, becomes uninspired two hours later. Given the large budget, the CGI was rather atrocious. The third act was questionable with some character choices that I did not necessarily conform to. Also, the frequent scene cuts and transitions detracted from what could've been a cohesively edited narrative. A somewhat safe yet enjoyable sequel."

","Ryan Reynolds returns as Deadpool the fast-talking superhero whom with the help of his own pre-selected 'team' must work together to try to protect a mutant boy with supernatural abilities from Cable a time-travelling mutant from the future who has been sent back to destroy him.<br/><br/>I watched the first Deadpool film a couple of years ago and that film was like a breath of fresh air; the character of Deadpool was amazing and a lot of the dialogue was sharp, it was self-aware, very funny and broke the fourth wall like nothing I had seen before. It was kinetic and fast-paced and despite suffering from a thin plot it very rarely lost momentum and only occasionally suffered with dips in quality. This sequel brings some of the aforementioned qualities, but sadly there are more problems this time...<br/><br/>For a start, the plotting is a little messy here and some elements are either not explored or are not developed particularly well; I didn't really get much understanding of the kid's supernatural powers or how he acquired them? The headmaster tortures the kids if they are mutants and has a weird mankind vs mutantkind mantra which makes no sense and isn't explained. Josh Brolin is the cyborg that has been sent from the future to kill Russell Collins, but then the cyborg switches sides and decides to help X-Force in trying to stop Collins. What then follows is a rather messy finale with Reynolds giving a death-bed monologue which went on for far too long and stopped being funny after about the first 30 seconds... This section does let the film down slightly as there were many funny moments prior to this scene. I also felt the film had far too much emotional baggage which at times gave the film a heavy and maudlin feel which it really didn't warrant or need.<br/><br/>Despite some of the confounding and messy aspects of the plot Deadpool 2 still has fun and imagination; the opening credits were fun (with most of it being a homage or spoof to the James Bond film opening credits with one part seemingly being a Flashdance parody as well). The scene where X Force parachute out of the plane was also funny and there are some other subtle and clever references throughout the film that did have me laughing on a number of occasions - there is one scene where Wade lifts the floorboards up in the blind woman's house and he picks up a bag of Wade's cocaine, but if you look closely there is another item under the floorboards that says 'A Cure For Blindness' which is a subtle, but funny visual piece of humour.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is far from perfect and did not have me laughing as loudly or as often as the first film, but it is still amusing and has plenty of moments that do work. Some strong characters from the first film were underused here such as Negasonic and Colossus which is a shame as they provided great support to Deadpool in the first film. It's worth watching, but it doesn't quite reach the brilliance that was attained in the first film."

"williampsamuel","9","1","3","15 March 2019"," The Ultimate in Adult Superhero Comedy
","As other writers more talented and original than me have pointed out, the first Deadpool was a test of whether an R-rated superhero movie could work, and was still figuring out the right balance of sex, violence, and language. Well now that the filmmakers know that the premise does work and have the basic formula down, they can run with it and have a lot of fun with it.<br/><br/>And oh how much fun it is, from the opening jab at Wolverine to the fourth wall breaking post credit scenes. This time the fights are better, the villains are way better, and thankfully the lengthy, cringe inducing sex scenes from the first movie are gone. They were funny yes, but also severely cringe inducing. Now there's still plenty of deeply offensive sexual humor, and it's all hilarious, but this time around they don't beat you over the head with it.<br/><br/>Although lots of people do get beaten over the head. And shot. And stabbed. And blown up. And disemboweled and dismembered. Because it wouldn't be a Deadpool movie without somebody getting ripped in half now would it? And lots of pop culture references being dropped and the fourth wall getting broken. Which of course they are, and it is. By a school bus no less. There are also shameless rip-offs of iconic scenes of 80's cinema. And some pretty hilarious send ups of today's hypersensitive microaggressions culture. Let's see... Am I forgetting anything? Ah yes, the plot!<br/><br/>After a great personal tragedy, Wade realizes he needs to get his heart in the right place- in more ways than one actually. He needs to find a family and do some good. So that means it's time to join the X-Men, which goes even worse than you would expect. But then he finds a new cause. A young troubled mutant with a serious attitude problem who maybe doesn't need or deserve Wade's help, but damned if he isn't going to get it anyway. All of this, besides being over the top violent and hilarious, is just the setup for his inevitable showdown (and equally inevitable team-up) with Cable.<br/><br/>And for assembling the X-Force. They're great. Seriously. They're really awesome, badass, deeply dysfunctional people whose role in this movie is nothing like what the trailers suggest. I especially liked Domino. She's got some serious sass to go with her looks, and an excellent sense of dramatic and comedic timing. But nothing beats Josh Brolin as Cable. He is everything fans could have hoped for: tough as nails, ruthless yet professional, and absolutely deadpan in the face of Wade's constant quips. He's basically the anti-Deadpool, and the chemistry between them is as awesome as their prolonged fight scenes. I really hope he becomes a regular in this franchise.<br/><br/>Despite Deadpool's claims to the contrary, this is definitely not a family movie, or one for the easily offended, or really anyone who isn't more than a little screwed up. But if you're OK with that it'll probably be the most fun you'll have at the movies all year. And don't miss the credits."
"chasemykleby","8","1","3","9 March 2019"," ""Deadpool 2"" comes up a little short to it's expectations.
","Review for Deadpool 2
(8/10)<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 had huge expectations to live up to after it's origin story was a R rated thrill ride, but ""Deadpool 2"" comes up a little short to it's expectations.
The script, by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds, is loaded with winky, fourth-wall-piercing eruptions of meta, the kind of humor that can make even the slow-witted and literal-minded feel devilishly clever. Works for me, I guess. But this sequel to the R-rated, X-Men-adjacent surprise blockbuster of 2016 works maybe a little too hard in the service of a dubious cause.
""Deadpool 2,"" cracking wise at the expense of nearly every intellectual property in the DC and Marvel universes - and occasionally drawing metaphorical blood to go along with the abundant onscreen gore - uses its self-aware irreverence to perform the kind of brand extension and franchise building it pretends to lampoon.
Grief and despair drive Wade first to seek revenge and then to try to prevent two other acts of vengeance from taking place. The first 30-40 minuets of the movie weren't that entertaining to me, there were a few jokes that made me laugh, but for me the movie got going once Josh Brolin's Cable showed up and kick some ass. And Zazie Beetz is great as Domino. And there are some fantastic cameos, that definitely draw a laugh and a ""wait I know who that is"".
For me ""Deadpool 2"" is a good-enough sequel to the original, but it is definitely not better than the first one. I just wish we could of actually seen X-Force."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","3","8 March 2019"," A hilarious meta-comedy that's almost too serious and meta for its own good.
","At what point does the fourth wall stop? I only ask this because there's a point where an audience member will have to know not only the plot of the film that started the franchise, but the subsequent reactions to the film, the complete history of comic books, and the entirety of the lyrics to Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Major-General's Song"" to understand the references. While Deadpool (2016) maintained that sly balance between knowing winks to the superhero genre as a whole and being an actual superhero film, Deadpool 2 (2018) almost went toward both extreme ends in order to maintain its balance.<br/><br/>There were plenty of references and little sight gags that will leave true fans of the franchise pausing their Blu-rays for years to come, and I certainly did appreciate some of the meta-humor, but only to a point. Strangely enough, Deadpool 2 felt more like a superhero film than its predecessor, which seems odd as it seemed to be mainly poking fun at the genre as a whole. Sure, plenty of movies can be ""self-aware,"" but when you start to realize ""oh, they're serious here,"" then the meta gags don't work as well.<br/><br/>While often crude and gory, I do have to admit that many of the jokes really work in Deadpool 2, much like they did in its predecessor. I was still laughing at the ridiculous situations the X-Force found themselves in, which I felt was the best surprise gag of the movie. Much like Ant-Man (2015), Deadpool 2 works as both a comedy and a superhero film, especially once you realize that its primary purpose is to be a comedy. While the superhero bits distract a little from the comedy in this movie, the action sequences, especially the ones featuring Domino (Zazie Beetz), are top-notch and somewhat make up for it.<br/><br/>A hilarious meta-comedy that's almost too serious and meta for its own good, I give Deadpool 2 4.0 stars out of 5."

"leftistcritic","10","1","3","17 February 2019"," Funny, parody of superhero genre
","After watching a set of superhero movies this one subverts those movies. Deadpool is the anti-hero and the movie follows a standard Hollyweird storyline while also being generally funny with a good amount of breaking the fourth wall to the audience. There is an easy connection to other Marvel movies, but there is also a mocking of the X-Men for having a sexist name, smashing of racism (of Josh Brolin's character), and such. But we should recognize this is becoming the model and is earning Hollyweird execs the big bucks, in the millions of dollars. Still, this movie is good, with the Indian texi driver, Dopinder, even having a role in the bloodshed. They do such nutty stuff, subverting the happy-good-lucky sentiment of general movies.<br/><br/>There is much more to say, however. In this superhero film, Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Deadpool, making this movie generally enjoyable, as he seriously pokes at the superhero genre. In a different way, the long and unwieldy film, Watchmen (2009) does something similar, although it is far more depressing in that millions of people have to be killed (apparently) to bring ""peace"" and save billions. I especially like the drop sequence of this film where almost all of Deadpool's team are killed in one way or another, when in most movies they would have survived, along with his constant ribbing of the X-Men for their issues, declaring that his team are ""X-Force"" which is kinda funny.<br/><br/>With that, I don't think I have anything else to say about this film and this review has clearly come to a close."

","Currently streaming on your favorite service is the movie named ""Once upon a Deadpool"".

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY to watch ""Once upon a Deadpool""... because it's exactly the same movie as "" Deadpool 2"".. with the exception of a few changes from the original making it less bloody and violent. IMDB FANS SHOULD KNOW THIS and if you've seen '2' then DON'T waste your money to see the same movie over as I did. And I fault my tv provider for not making that clear, so hopefully the rest of you will find out from my post before you waste $5.99 to see the same movie you've already seen not long ago except many important parts are missing. Don't waste your money. Sure if you want to see the original again rent it, but don't rent this one. What a clever trick by the producers to attempt to squeeze a few more million $ from the movie, but because of this, ill not watch a third Deadpool movie. I don't like being duped and there should've been an obvious disclaimer accompanying the marketing and information for this altered version.

"leonblackwood","7","1","3","14 January 2019"," Not that much different than the first movie but still funny! 7/10
","Review:
Although I preferred the first movie, mainly because it was unique and quite shocking in parts, I did find this movie funny, even though I wanted Ryan Reynolds to shut up most of the time. The action scenes were pretty impressive and I liked Josh Brolin as Cable but I found Firefist a bit misplaced. Domino was also a great addition to the so-called X-Force but I would have liked to have seen more from Negasonic, who was great in the first movie. I think the main problem with this film is that we're not seeing anything new from Deadpool. We do get to see a bit of an emotional side after the dramatic beginning, and his relationship with Firefist shows that he has a heart, but from a superhero point of view, it's very much like the first movie. As usual, the jokes do go a bit far sometimes, but that's what makes Deadpool a unique character that is certainly different from the other superheroes on the market. The movie is set with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) successfully working as a mercenary for two years, but when his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is sadly murdered after they decide to start a family, Deadpool tries many ways to kill himself. Colossus saves him after another attempt on his own life, and he takes him to the X-Mansion to rehabilitate. During his rehabilitation, Colossus and Negasonic respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Firefist (Julian Dennison) at an orphanage labelled a ""Mutant Re-education Center"". Deadpool realises that Firefist has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of them, even though he agreed with Colossus not to kill anyone. Soon after that, Firefist and Deadpool are arrested and restrained with collars, which makes them unable to use their powers. Meanwhile, Cable (Josh Brolin) - a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Firefist - travels back in time to kill him before he ever becomes a killer. Cable breaks into the prison and attempts to kill Firefist, but Deadpool's collar breaks and he defends Firefist, who is unaware of why Cable is trying to kill him. Firefist overhears Deadpool saying that he doesn't care for him, so he gives himself up to the guards. Deadpool puts together a team, called the X-Force, to break Firefist out of a prison-transfer convoy, and defend him from Cable. During there mission, most of his team die whilst landing from a parachute jump, except for Deadpool and Domino (Zazie Beetz). Whilst fighting against Cable, Firefist frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who agrees to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Firefist to escape. Cable offers to work with Deadpool and Domino to stop Firefist's first murder and agrees to give Deadpool a chance to talk him down. After an epic battle between the newly formed X-Force, Firefist and Juggernaut, Deadpool fails to talk down Firefist, so Cable attempts to kill him. Deadpool ends up jumping in front of the bullet, and after Firefist sees his sacrifice to save him, he doesn't kill the headmaster, who is eventually run over by Deadpool's driver Dopinder (Karan Soni). With Firefist under control, Cable uses the last charge on his time-travelling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes to stop the bullet from killing Deadpool. It's hard to see where they can take this franchise because they cram so much into one movie. With the newly formed X-Force, and the introduction to some new superheroes, the possibilities are endless but Deadpool is the Marvel cash-cow that has got audiences begging for more. Personally, I think his non-stop banter, and crazy one-liners won't last forever, but now that he has access to the time-travelling device, Marvel has the chance to do something special with the 3rd movie. I just hope they don't mess it up! Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch, especially if you were a fan of the first movie, but I would like to see him face a worthy opponent, who he would have to take seriously. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Leitch, who also brought you John Wick and Atomic Blonde. He's due to remake Enter the Dragon, which should be left alone, and the Division starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal. He's also filming a Fast & Furious spin-off called Hobbs & Shaw, which is about Dwayne Johnson's character from the Fast & Furious, teaming up with Jason Statham. It also stars Idris Elba so it's definitely a blockbuster that should get a good reception. As for this movie, it's very well written and full of action from the beginning to the end. The references to different movies cracked me up, and when Deadpool went back in time to kill Hitler, I just couldn't stop laughing. It certainly went down well with the critics, and it made a hefty profit at the box office but it's currently 100th in the highest-grossing movie chart, with the original in 85th place with a $783million profit. Although it's primarily a comedy, there is a lot of gory scenes, which meant that it's not suitable for kids, so that might explain why the profit wasn't as big as a lot of the other Marvel movies. Anyway, I can't wait for a 3rd instalment, and I hope they involve some of the X-Men.<br/><br/>Budget: $110million
Worldwide Gross: $742million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi
Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Karan Soni, Eddie Marsan, Terry Crews, Brad Pitt, Paul Wu, Matt Damon, Bob Delaney and Leslie Uggams. 7/10"

It's a great experiment into what makes film ratings what they are and how this character could be utilized in the Disney owned Marvel Cinematic Universe without losing who he is. Ryan Reynolds & Fred Savage are great together in the wrap around story segments, blurring the line between film & viewer while poking fun at the whole experience. All of the best stuff from Deadpool 2 is still there, in a somewhat cleaned up way, with great action & laughs throughout. The Stan Lee cameo has a nice little added touch since his passing.

"classicsoncall","6","1","3","17 November 2018"," ""You're a super-hero now, Bubba!""
","After seeing the first Deadpool movie, I pretty much vowed that I would never watch a sequel because of all the vulgarity and nudity in the original. But then I thought, how can I be a Marvel movie completist without seeing this one, so I had to finally break down and catch it. Well, I wasn't as offended by this picture, as the use of the 'F' word seemed to be somewhat curtailed, and the nudity was removed except for that extremely juvenile scene in which Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) sprouted a young boy's legs. Oh, and Juggernaut's behind, but that was more gross than sexually explicit. Personally, I don't see how any of that adds to a movie's popularity, if it wasn't in there you'd never miss it. Where the picture excels is in the edgy humor and clever writing, the introduction of the X-Force characters a case in point. The only one in the story I couldn't warm up to was Russell/Firefist (Julian Dennison); for me, he had no charisma or likeability at all. Josh Brolin was surprisingly effective as Cable, even more so than Thanos in the Avengers franchise. Which leads me to consider, how lucky is it that a single actor gets to portray two iconic comic-book figures? It's like Ryan Reynolds showing up in both the Marvel and DC comic book universes on film, which by the way, led to a cool after credits gag dissing the Green Lantern persona like he did in the first movie. The one disappointment I had was not seeing Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee show up in this picture, or if he did have a cameo, I somehow missed it. However his name isn't in the list of cast credits, and with his recent passing just a few days ago on 11/12/18, his presence in future Marvel flicks will be sorely missed.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and if you do an internet search on 'dubstep', the comments section of any hit will tell you that ""Deadpool 2"" sent the reader there. The power of pop culture.<br/><br/>Addendum**** 7-2-2019 - Upon rewatching the film today, I caught a Stan Lee tribute where his face is painted on the side of a huge building with the notation: ""R.I.P. Stan Lee"". It goes by real quick during one of Deadpool's action scenes."
"primerealestatepro","10","1","3","22 October 2018"," Great adult movie without unnecessary nudity
","I have to say, this movie was pretty well done. I love the frequent use of unconventional movie elements such as ""asides"" and ""breaking the fourth wall"" but this movie also appeals to adult humor without being laden in graphic nudity and sex scenes - which is almost rare these days. The entire film was entertaining and incorporated not only the expected action and comedy but a great deal of heartfelt emotions, too with smooth comic relief that didn't require excessive vulgarity or crudeness to pull off. Very impressed. Still wouldn't allow my kids to watch this just yet but perhaps safe for high-school aged children depending on their maturity level and grasp of reality."

","Really I felt the jokes landed a heck of a lot more in this one than they did in Deadpool, and for a movie like this it counts for a lot.<br/><br/>It seemed to hit all ends of the political spectrum in the humor, and that too worked, especially as the character is satirical and prone to break the 4th wall...which also applies to our society as a whole. And it worked very well for this film.<br/><br/>The blood, the sex, the vulgarity all actually added to the plot as a whole, it fit like a glove and accented the humor as a whole to make the film darkly funny, especially with a plot that at times was intentionally inane and pointless and, at times, deeper than you'd expect for a self-deprecating super hero film.<br/><br/>It's worth watching twice at least, even if, the second time around, you see all the best laughs coming."

Despite some boring and lame left wing humor and some slow moments that drags the film by its balls painfully, the overall film DOES have some good humor, the action was bloody great, some unpredictable moments, the story was a bit disjointed but comprehensible enough, I like some of the characters like Domino and Cable and so forth.

","This movie was good because the plot was original and there were some truly funny scenes and some pretty cool action scenes as well.

Every time I heard a joke that was from the original movie, I always thought ""wow these writers really don't know what the fans want"". I never heard a copied joke and thought ""oh haha it reminds me of the first one because it's the same line from the first one"". This happened way way WAY too many times for a marvel movie, considering they basically own hollywood at this point. Again, the rest of the movie was good enough to overshadow the laziness in writing, but it's still there and it makes me mad. The best way for a sequel to pay homage to the original is by leaving it the hell alone, not by leaching off the funny parts of it in an attempt to get some cheap easy laughs that the other writers already got the first time. Worst part of this situation: it probably will only get worse in the next one. Still a good movie, 8/10 stars is still good! But lazy writing."

In the Super Duper Cut, in the final scene with Wade and Vanessa, the song playing in the background was changed from a beautiful, acoustic version of A Ha's 'Take On Me' to a soft, not-quite-acoustic-but-close version of the theme song 'Ashes'.

However, I disagree with the principle that drove the whole story arc... that DP must experience a personal and devestating tragedy in order to be interesting. Deadpool is insane. Adding the tragedy just changes his actions from ""insane"" to ""insane with a purpose"". For that reason, and what happened to ""everyone's favorite character"" early in the movie, I did not like it quite as well as the first movie. I do recognize I am in the minority however. Would rate higher than ""7"" if I were able to rate first one ""8.5"". In other words, I really liked it a lot, just disappointed with the tragedy arc, as I mentioned. <br/><br/>Anyway, the ""Super Duper"" cut is even funnier than the theatrical cut. Jokes are just slightly more raw but some of the scenes that seemed just a little awkward are better fleshed out. The Triad and Yakuza fight scenes are way better. So are the ending credits. His time at the mansion makes much more sense as well."

"torstensonjohn","9","1","3","8 August 2018"," A Secondary BLAST of the Red Suit
","The creation of Deadpool and Deadpool 2 would not be as cinematic and blockbuster if not for Ryan Reynolds. A strong showing of great CGI, tremendously funny and action packed. It all comes down to Ryan and his delivery approach. With a new director David Leitch and being written by Reynolds this film delivered above and beyond.<br/><br/>The addition of characters such as Domino, Cable and Juggernaut helped the film flow very nicely in it's plot. Josh Brolin cast as Cable was perfect and he came across strong, gruff, destructive and forceful. A driven plot that supports the narrative of family and what it means is what the film is about. I found the film to be raunchy, vulgar, action packed and deliciously funny. <br/><br/>
With such strong showings for both films it is a driven question of if there will be a third installment. One thing is for certain we need more Deadpool in our lives. Strong 9 out of 10."
"mtrburrows","7","1","3","5 August 2018"," This movie looks like a meta joke married a vulgar script
","The first thing to notice about Deadpool 2 is how much it improves on the first, from the comedy, to the story (which is 10x better than before), to the action, to the direction, to the characters. <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 feels more like a movie than the first, and not a 20 minute storyline painfully stretched out to be feature length. And while the first 30 minutes do become boring, overall this is a much better time than before, it even has some decent emotional moments (which could be completely undercut if the end credits scene is canon). <br/><br/>The story is still nothing special, and still falls into the trap of being exactly like the cliché comic book movies it ridicules, and is no where near as meta as it thinks it is, or needs to be, in order to be something really different, especially when all marvel movies mock themselves anyway. The Deadpool movies simply need to go further as at the moment the meta moments are by far the most forced and unfunny moments in them - why hold back? Why make a joke about there being a big CGI fight, but then have the CGI fight play out like a normal movie? Truly go for it, do something like render the CGI so bad and maybe you could get something more than a cheap laugh.<br/><br/>Speaking of laughs, this is THE definition of 50/50 comedy, and truly is one of the best examples of the writers throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds is clearly in love with this character and is a big reason these movies work, and with this being a large step up from the boring, formulaic first instalment, hopefully part 3 will top them both."
"e-70733","6","1","3","27 July 2018"," Although it is a cliché, it is basically done properly
","The script is barely fluent, but the first half is too sluggish. Of course, this practice of letting jokes go beyond the script may also be the intention of director and screenwriter. Although it is not conducive to the integrity of the film, it does attract some audience.
In terms of the construction of the world view, the film is not as sluggish as the Avengers, but it is also rougher (and perhaps a stylized choice), and basically only takes care of a specific audience. This is also a common problem of all kinds of mainstream superhero movies."

"Aaron1375","9","1","3","17 July 2018"," Deadpool is back and is less serious than ever
","I enjoyed the first Deadpool film and I also enjoyed this one. Anyone who liked the first one, but didn't like this one is a bit perplexing seeing as how it contains the same humor as the first film. It is not as if this one is a huge departure that experiments and does things completely differently or something. No, we get the same Deadpool we got in the first film, only with some more action this time around, but still the same amount of gags. We also get Cable, X-Force, Colossus and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff!<br/><br/>The story has Deadpool's lady friend from the first film being taken out by bad guys right from the get go leaving the super healing sort of superhero depressed and no longer wanting to live. Colossus tries to get Deadpool out of his funk and gets the crazed hero to join the X-men where he promptly gets himself arrested due to the fact he shoots someone during his first mission trying to get a mutant boy under control. The boy and Deadpool get sent to a prison and soon a mysterious warrior named Cable breaks into the prison to kill the boy. Deadpool makes it his mission to save the boy and forms X-force, but soon inadvertently frees not only the boy, but the Juggernaut as well from a prison convoy. Deadpool and Cable form an uneasy alliance and try to stop the boy before he kills and gets a taste for killing!<br/><br/>The characters were great and I like how they did the Juggernaut in this movie. The first film showed that they could have made a proper looking Colossus and this film shows they could have made a Juggernaut that looks like Juggernaut in the X-men films. Not only that, they had Colossus and Juggernaut fight in this film! This is something I expected to happen in the third X-men movie, but it never happened. The Deadpool series just does a better job of making the characters look right and give us what we want. <br/><br/>So, I enjoyed this film and I am sure there will most likely be another one. I enjoyed the humor and I really enjoyed the whole X-force portion of the film as the trailers I saw really had me fooled on how that would play out. Ryan Reynolds once again does a good job as Deadpool and I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as Cable too. Kind of funny seeing him in this considering he was also the voice and motion actor for Thanos. Domino was really cute and I liked her character and I liked the return of Colossus and the girl from the previous film as well. Just a fun film, nothing to take seriously and worry over that is for sure."
"rnlanders","9","1","3","12 July 2018"," Better than the first one!
","I can only assume that the folks giving 1 or 2 stars have no knowledge of Deadpool outside of the first movie, or maybe X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This sequel was exactly what it was supposed to be: fun, goofy, irreverent, full of 4th wall breaks (or as one hoity-toity reviewer called it, ""meta""), maturation of the lead character who struggles against being a hero, surprise character appearances, pain, loss, high body count, etc... True, it doesn't take an advanced degree to comprehend or follow the plot, but good God! It's a comic book movie! It's not Shakespeare or Umberto Eco. If you want that, read a book. If you want a fun movie that entertains and is probably the most accurate interpretation of any Marvel character, then watch DP2. Suspend reality, pull the stick out of your ass, and just have some fun."

","7 June 2018
Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Deadpool 2. Irreverent from the outset, and the same huge bundle of gag filled scenes complete with the bad jokes, bad references and bad taste we come to expect from Ryan Reynolds and co. Unfortunately it didn't rise to the promise of an excellent sequel and all the best bits were either in the trailers or the opening sequences. Don't get me wrong, it is a film worth watching, just not the belly full of laughs I was expecting. The storyline was okay if a little mundane, the effects were pretty good though, especially the scenes in slow motion. I do kind of adore the character of Deadpool and the opening sequences up to and including the humorous opening credits which did make me giggle. Don't know if it merits a third outing though."
"audrablum","10","1","3","8 June 2018"," A close second to the first
","This week I chose to watch Deadpool 2. The logline reads ""Foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (AKA. Deadpool), brings together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy with supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-traveling cyborg, Cable."" 
 To be honest, the beginning of the movie was emotionally confusing. Deadpool is supposed to be funny but it started off pretty dark, even for Deadpool's standards. As the movie went on it got a little more funny and I did think the story was enjoyable. It had all of the dark and grotesque humor of the first film (maybe turned up a notch or two). I was pleased with the ending and am wondering if Deadpool 3 is in the works? 
 The story had a lot of action sequences and some interesting CGI, but it didn't feel overdone. The dialogue was classic Wade Wilson mucking up the jokes and of course I laughed. The editing was appropriate for the movie, in fact it was done extremely well and made me regret my life not becoming an editor because the editing was so pretty. The thing I did actually catch myself thinking in the theatre was that this film knows how to breathe. Many films nowadays are made so haphazardly that the directors try to shove too much in to the movies and don't allow the audience to feel anything before transitioning to the next shot. Deadpool did a fantastic job at allowing the audience to process and synthesize the information before cutting to a new shot. I found it pretty ironic that the rogue movie of the Marvel studios was the one who got this the most right. The story was pretty great too. I will be the first to admit that I liked the first one better, but this was a pretty good second and good for Wade to really be tested as a character. I think that worked out well. 
 All in all, I liked this film a lot and hope to own them at some point. Even though the movie started out on an emotionally confusing note, it found a way to come back to it's classic content. Watching the movie I could tell that Marvel gave Ryan Reynolds and his crew a lot more leeway on this film since the first one was so successful. The cinematics were fantastic and the film held a lot of good film classic production values. I feel that many films can learn from this one and I look forward to watching it again."
"kz917-1","9","1","3","7 June 2018"," A sequel that delivers all the raunch and bawdry humor you didn't know you were missing!
","DP2 does it again. The action. The humor. The one-liners.<br/><br/>It was all great. <br/><br/>Several of the lines thrown at Cable aka Josh Brolin were fantastic. References to Goonies and Avengers had me rolling with laughter.<br/><br/>Not your momma's superhero flick with heart.<br/><br/>Did not disappoint."
"MikeyLikesIt_357","6","1","3","4 June 2018"," Could have been better
","I'm pretty mixed about this movie. I would say that it was better overall than the first Deadpool in terms of plot, but it wasn't nearly as funny as the first.<br/><br/>The jokes in DP2 were a carbon copy of the original ones, but they felt too forced and fell flat more often than not. There were still scenes where I was laughing out loud, but they did not come as often as the first Deadpool. Unfortunately I think they became just a little too aware of how they could push this type of comedy and just went too far with the references and little in-jokes.<br/><br/>I'm also mixed on the characters. Deadpool is more or less the same, as is Dopinder and most of the other side characters. I REALLY enjoyed Cable and also thought Domino was ok. Unfortunately I was very much disappointed in how they used Negasonic Teenage Warhead. In the first movie she played a useful role as the young, nihilistic, attitudinal brat that contrasted with Deadpool's over the top exuberance. In DP2 she was only there to showcase that she was a lesbian. I'm sure there is plenty of more meaningful footage of her collecting dust on the cutting room floor, because she just felt like half a character. The same thing goes for Yukio. A completely pointless character other than as a political tool. <br/><br/>Overall it just felt like they took themselves way too seriously this time around. The first Deadpool was so clearly a gamble of a movie that they treated it as the character should be treated. This time around it felt more like a corporate owned studio movie that had to tick off their list of items/political commentary that they always need to cover rather than just making it a fun movie."
"chris_reed194","6","1","3","4 June 2018"," Very Enjoyable but not as good as the first
","I saw this movie with the expectation it wouldn't be as good as the first and it was a correct gut feeling. <br/><br/>I felt more anger towards the guy who killed Vanessa than anyone else in the film. I really wanted to feel the satisfaction of DP hunting him down and killing him but it didn't go that way. I felt like Cable could have been expanded on. His character starts great and the mystery makes him interesting but then he teams up with DP and jumps to the other end of the spectrum with still no real explanation of what he's about. <br/><br/>I had zero sympathy for Firefist from start to finish. The character was really impossible to warm to and watching the film I couldn't really care less if he survived or not. <br/><br/>I'm actually glad that the team DP creates all get killed off bar Domino because it made it humourous and after all it's not an X-Men film, we're here to watch DP. <br/><br/>I don't really understand what Juggernaut brought to the film other than an easy tick in the box approval exercise for fans. <br/><br/>Overall, DP was outrageously funny, some of the gags fell short, some characters could have been expanded on but the story was definitely weak compared to the first film."
"Solnichka","5","1","3","3 June 2018"," Mediocre ... skip it, and you won't miss a thing
","This movie was really mediocre. Too much Deadpool and not enough of his co-stars. Seriously. If you're a teenage boy, maybe you'll like this. But otherwise, it's worse than the first film and basically devolves into silliness about five seconds into it. Save your money and watch it on cable later. The time-twist ending is just canned, as well. So predictable. And why cast Josh Brolin in ANOTHER Marvel role? That was just dumb. The best thing about this movie was the post-credit scenes of Deadpool using the time thing to erase his own big-screen past. When that's the best stuff in the whole movie, you know it's a dud."
"davewaldo-114-471767","6","1","3","2 June 2018"," Enjoyable but overdoes the self depreciating humour.
","Just like the first film Deadpool 2 is exciting and funny. Ryan Reynolds is again great in the title role and has great support from some new characters. The thing that let's it down is the continuous attempts at humour from the same joke. In the original the ""who's in charge now McAvoy or Stewart?"" line, was funny but trying to rehash variations of that same joke time and time again, became tedious. We know it's a film, they know it's a film, they don't need to keep on about it."
"masoperez","6","1","3","31 May 2018"," I enjoyed the jokes, if you expect more than you'll be disappointed.
","Watch Deadpool, if you enjoy the humour in it for what it is, then you'll probably enjoy the humour in the second. I went to the film with this in mind and got my money's worth, and enjoyed some of the parts I didn't fully expect, (such as the X-Force launch). The overall action-direction has also improved, with action being more fun to follow and funnier than the first.<br/><br/>That being said, besides the few times that it circumvents its own plot, Deadpool 2 follows a hackneyed, cliche plot that doesn't stray far from typical beats, and the ""sad part"" at the beginning feels incredibly shoe-horned in and weak. Many of the characters are also very under-written, such as Russel and Domino. A lot of wasted potential, but I'd say similar things about the first.<br/><br/>Worth the price, but isn't particularly noteworthy. I don't think I'd see it again, but I'm glad I watched it."

"AustinSober","7","1","3","24 May 2018"," ""Deadpool 2"" Review: Pools in a Few Improvements
","""Deadpool 2"" improves upon the previous film by providing a better narrative, a worthy villain, and well-staged action scenes to go along with all of the shock meta-humor from the first entry.<br/><br/>Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying the life of being an immortal merc with the mouth until this lifestyle leads to the death of his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). To redeem himself, he takes it upon himself to save a tortured mutant child named Russell, aka Firefist, (Julian Dennison) from the law and the vengeance of a time-traveling soldier named Cable (Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>I liked the first Deadpool film well enough, but I was far from a fan of it. Everything about the Deadpool character was well handled and Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. Not all of the humor worked with me, but most of it did. All of those same points carry over into the sequel just as equally. My major issue with the first film was the fact that if you took away all the humor being pushed into your face, the superhero story being presented was just kind of by the numbers outside of the cancer aspect. A man gets superpowers at a cost, seeks revenge, and has his girlfriend kidnapped for the final. It was fun, but there was just something about it that didn't make me love it. Perhaps the humor was too much? I tend to prefer subtlety more. Outside of that, the film had a lame villain and little to no action scenes. Luckily, number two fixes those things.<br/><br/>The story here seems to find more serious ground than the first and made some effort to give the Deadpool character a little heart. All the humor is still there, but things do feel more balanced. That's not to say every joke landed, but most of them did. The film is still a lampoon, but that feels like an extension of the character's behavior and not at the expense of the narrative.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin's Cable is a big assist to this. Just in appearances alone, he crushes the first film's attempt at an antagonist. A half-human, half-robot super soldier with a metal arm and multifunction gun that makes the Winter Soldier look like a wimp, even with a burnt teddy bear strapped to his belt. His character is very similar to that of a Terminator, sent back to eliminate Firefist in the past before he becomes a threat later. Actually, the whole plot is like ""Terminator 2"", considering the use of child and a seemingly immortal protector.<br/><br/>An invincible hero can often be a problem since we as an audience know that there is no real danger. This can make action scenes rather pointless from a dramatic standpoint. Maybe that's why the first film didn't do much in the way of creative comic book fights (aside from the highway scene). In any case, ""Deadpool 2"" ups the ante by providing more superhero action this time around, and it's all done very well, thanks in large part to the new director, David Leitch. He is known best for his choreography involvement in some of the best fights in American film and co-director of ""John Wick"" (aka 'one of the men that killed John Wick's dog' as the credits say). The film sports some good set pieces, with the raid on a prison convey being the highlight.<br/><br/>Outside of those three points, everything is basically the same as the last film. If you really enjoyed that one, you are likely to enjoy this one around the same level. Personally, I still think some of the humor does fall flat and tries too hard to be funny. The Deadpool films like to throw in everything and the kitchen sink, as the saying goes. (Ironically, as one of the posters LITERALLY acknowledges a kitchen sink). Either way, there is just an odd feeling when a film is constantly trying to get you to laugh at everything. I say it works at least 75% of the time. For me, a better example of a humorous superhero film was ""Thor: Ragnarok"" from last year. Still, to each their own. I definitely felt ""Deadpool 2"" was an improvement.<br/><br/>There are plenty of post-credit scenes to wait for with great payoffs. I should note that there isn't one at the very end. So, you don't have to wait around."

"theresews","7","1","3","23 May 2018"," Its overall IMDB-rating should be no higher than 7
","A rating of 7 usually indicates that a movie is good fun to watch, but won't revolutionize your view on the industry. This movie is very much like that. There are things in it that are hilarious, and if you are a frequent movie-goer, you will enjoy the many references and gimmicks. However, what that is said, no real story is ever told. There is no real arc for the characters, even though the movie attempts to force one down on them. It feels very much like a transport into the forthcoming X-force movie, and Deadpool 2 is, in my opinion, not able to stand on its own.
Another problem I have with it is, that it spends much of its runningtime, bashing other superhero-movies for being repetitive and franchise-hungry, but in the end, Deadpool 2 becomes all the things, that it is simultaneously making fun off. Therefore it doesn't become clever or edgy satire. Instead it becomes ""lazy writing"". <br/><br/>So, if you want to watch something relaxing and hilarious on a Sunday night, then by all means watch this movie. You will laugh, but no more than that."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","3","23 May 2018"," Almost as Good as the First
","There may not be a single superhero franchise more perfect for 2018. Staying irreverent, hilarious, ultraviolent, creative, and downright insane, Deadpool 2 is loads of fun even if it doesn't quite live up to the originals fresh tone. <br/><br/>Bringing in John Wick 2 director David Leitch to take over for Tim Miller, this film improves upon its action and brings in plenty of characters for Deadpool to mess around with, introducing members of X-Force. Which, by the way, made for one of the most shockingly funny sequences I have ever seen in a comic book movie. There's something to be said for making a sequel bigger and better, but perhaps even more impressive is when a film manages to bring a balance of that and resisting the temptation to do so. I loved most of the additional characters, including Domino (who was the clear highlight), Cable, and a few other characters with less dialogue. <br/><br/>With that said, I do think the thing this film was missing was more Morena Baccarin and her relationship with Wade/Deadpool. The film takes a particular direction with this arc and it could be slightly controversial, I was on the fence for most of it with this decision. And while the film is still, in a way, about their relationship, I think it takes a backseat to some newer characters and their arcs.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, the film also takes an interesting and bold approach to its antagonist(s). It was another element that I'm still not sure how much I like and how much I feel was a missed opportunity. But even with all of this said, I still found myself entertained from beginning to end, with laugh out loud 4th wall breaks and gags throughout. And I'm really just scratching the surface with how good some of this movie is.

","I like both DC and Marvel movies and this one is as entertaining as the first one perhaps even more. 
It nods so many films and characters such as DC comics (Batman v Superman: DoJ, Justice League, Green Lantern), Marvel (Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, X Men First Class, X Men Origins: Wolverine, Logan), 007, The Passion of the Christ, Panic Room, Flashdance, The Goonies (starring Josh Brolin), The Karate Kid, Terminator, Basic Instinct, Interview with the Vampire, Yentl, Frozen, My Little Pony,Top Gun and so many more. ItÂ´s happens so fast you have to really pay attention to it.
It even has at least 10 cameos in it.

"kjproulx","7","1","3","20 May 2018"," Just as Good as Its Predecessor
","I'll start off and be completely honest in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Deadpool film, but wasn't blown away or busting a gut laughing from start to finish. The meta jokes were fantastic and the story itself was even quite engaging, but it wore thin for me by the third act. That being said, I found myself hoping that a sequel would be even better. Deadpool 2 has just hit the big screen, and while I can't say it's a funnier movie, I can say the film itself is a vast improvement when looking at the filmmaking alone. This movie does a good job of creating new jokes and even making old jokes funny again, but there's something about these movies that has me having a hard time falling in love with them. Here's why Deadpool 2 comes highly recommended for fans, but not at all for anyone else.<br/><br/>Quite a few plot devices are used here, but without getting to any spoilers, Deadpool 2 follows Wade Wilson once again, as he feels the need to protect a young boy with superpowers, while a time-traveling mutant in Cable is one the rise, hunting this boy down. From realizing that he may just work better with partners, to realizing that he may love more than just himself, there are a lot of storylines and emotional aspects that elevate this from another average superhero comedy. I found myself shocked to see how much time was spent on action or drama, instead of the need to always joke around. Yes, this movie is riddled with humor from start to finish, but this felt like a more mature version of the previous film.<br/><br/>As far as the humor itself goes, I mentioned that I quite enjoyed what they did with the first movie, but felt that it wore out by the end. This time around, the jokes felt a little more spread out, which is why I believe they worked better here, so I could catch a breath and not be hounded with excessive amounts of comedy. You may actually feel differently about that because there are jokes throughout certain dramatic moments, but I chose to see it as a dramatic moment, rather than a comedic one. So I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice blend of those two genres.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds continues to prove that he was born to play this role. Not many actors/actresses can prove that they were meant to act in a specific role, but Reynolds is definitely one of the few who can. It goes without saying that his heart is in these movies until the very end, so how was the supporting cast? Josh Brolin delivers a solid performance as Cable, but I feel as though he comes out of nowhere during the beginning of the movie. I felt a little short-changed in terms of his development. His screen time vastly increases by the end and made his character worth it, but I still wished to see a little more from him.<br/><br/>Everyone has been seeing images and footage in the trailers for the tease at the X-Force team that Deadpool recruits here, and I can say that their screen time is easily one of the highlights of the entire film. Looking back on the movie, the character of Domino (played by Zazie Beetz) is easily my favorite in the entire film. Her ability is hilarious and very unique in combat, and each of these characters just added another level to the movie, whether they were shining in an action sequence, or just there to make the audience laugh, or leave them shocked.<br/><br/>In the end, I enjoyed this sequel just as much as its predecessor. I thought the first movie lacked a tone that this one presented, but the comedy will impress viewers more in the first film, so there is a balance that really has me debating which one I liked more. Deadpool 2 benefits from very solid direction from David Leitch and the fact that Ryan Reynolds joined writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick made it feel a little different from the first. The first movie was a celebration that a movie like this could be made, but this one dives a little deeper and I quite enjoyed that about it. While I don't love either of these movies, they are a blast to watch. Deadpool 2 has its issues, but it's a solid movie all around."
"opinionated-alchemist","9","1","3","20 May 2018"," Absolutely enjoyable: funny, engaging, edgy, action packed
","After a successful debut, it is often tough for superhero movies to offer a sequel, which doesn't go totally above and beyond (and fail, due to that gigantism). I had my reservations for Deadpool 2 before I have seen it because of that. <br/><br/>The team-up, the possible bigger scale of the story.<br/><br/>Fortunately Deadpool still stays a widely funny and focused movie. The movie seems less raw... but this is also a good thing.The team-up ""makes sense"" and never gets out of the right focus. The investment of the viewer is no result out of an armageddon-like global situation, but out of the personal tragedy of Wade Wilson. The story writing is clever and the movie is just very well crafted. Off course the best thing are the jokes of Deadpool. This time, it seems that the writers were more subtle in breaking the 4th wall... however the occasions are now far more integrated (""as dark as the DC universe""). <br/><br/>There is just not much, you could possibly desire more. It is a movie, which will be entertaining for multiple viewings - as the jokes which Deadpool cracks, are just too plenty to get at the first time times... and this is a good thing. <br/><br/>About the team-up - the assembly of (the original?) X-Force is hilariously funny - but thankfully kept short. Domino the ""remaining"" character of the ""original"" team is really cool from the time she is introduced in the movie.<br/><br/>Cable the antagonist is also ""well crafted"". I have to say, that the CGI and practical effects of his mechanical parts could have been done better. But it is never too disturbing or distracting, that it would be an issue.<br/><br/>With the big elephant released just beforehand (Infinity War) I really hope, that Deadpool 2 has a chance to shine. It is for sure a movie, which is at least as good as the ""big"" Marvel movie - if not better. I really enjoyed the tight scope of the movie. The imperfection of the characters and the humanity in them. <br/><br/>As nerd, only one thing has been missing for me: that Deadpool pulls ridiculous weapons (and other stuff) out of thin air.<br/><br/>There is not much more to say. If you are old enough (the movie is still R-rated) and like action movies, you should see Deadpool 2."
"arielprime","8","1","3","20 May 2018"," Deadpool and the cable guy
","Deadpool 2 is literally what I expected and more. This is one of those films that you don't need any real and serious expectations because you are confident in two things while you're sitting in your seat: you'll laugh and you'll be entertained. This time around the film is helmed by David Leitch (John Wick), who really carries over the technical skill in delivering easy to follow action set pieces.<br/><br/>What's great: The action and comedy is a cohesive blend. Cable. Domino. Colossus. <br/><br/>What's not so great: I can't even complain, if there was anything wrong with the film, I couldn't tell cause I was too damn busy laughing. <br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 follows the same formula of the first film, with an attempt to dive into the character of Wade Wilson more as a person, and it works because he's endearing and we actually care about him. The much appreciated addition of Josh Brolin as Cable is to be commended for his range in marvel characters. Go see this, my guys. It's a family film."

Now Cable wanted to kill this kid because in the future, he kills his family. Josh Brolin is badass and I love his arc. Ryan Reynold is impressive as ever. and Zazie Beetz is a total babe who kicks ass as Domino. I have to warn you. This movie is not for the squeamish or anyone who has extreme anti-sjw views"

","If only Untitled Deadpool Sequel was the title. If only. I just got back from seeing Ryan Reynolds' return as Deadpool and I didn't expect much, but found it to supply a lot of laughs and more breakage of the fourth wall. I didn't catch much of the trailers so everything in this movie was new. I liked the first one, but I was never much of a fan like most other people. <br/><br/>Deadpool's woman dies by some criminal and Deadpool kills him. I thought this was going to be a revenge story (might have explained the plot in the previews but I missed that) but instead he joins the X-Men and saves some kid with fire hands. Then we are introduced to Cable (Josh Brolin) who wants to kill this kid while Deadpool in the kid are stuck in the prison from Escape Plan. <br/><br/>The action scenes are spectacular. Honestly, what's even better is the ending to this movie. Let me just say it is good to stick around to the end (nothing after the credits so don't bother) and you are in for a treat. I was taken by surprise by it and it was very clever. I love it.<br/><br/>I am certainly positive they will make a third installment. If you are a fan of comic book movies or Deadpool is your thing, you should really see this. I'll be honest, I thought this was going to be an average sequel that doesn't live up to the first. I don't remember much of the first but this one might be better. Just remember, it's a family movie."
"bastille-852-731547","7","1","3","18 May 2018"," A Razor-Sharp, Funny Sequel
","Ryan Reynolds' Merc With a Mouth is finally back in action. While not a perfect film, this sequel is incredibly entertaining and is probably guaranteed to please fans of its predecessor. This movie primarily centers around Deadpool forming a team of amateur superheroes known as the X-Force to stop Cable (Josh Brolin) from killing a mutant teenager named Russell. The R-rated action and humor moviegoers come to expect from this franchise is on full display here, with impressive action scenes that operate on a greater visual scale and with deeper interpersonal stakes than in the first movie. One skydiving sequence that occurs midway through the film is particularly memorable. Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking, foul-mouthed dark sarcasm certainly doesn't disappoint in the movie. The film is loaded to the brim with meta jokes that take on everything from comic book movies to music to politics. Generally, the jokes on display here do feel fresher and funnier than the humorous lines in the original ""Deadpool,"" which is greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Reynolds is always great as Deadpool, nailing the part just like he was able to do in the original. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job playing Cable, giving him a unique sense of grit and depth absent from many other superhero-movie villains. In fact, the unique personification of Cable's own circumstances adds a layer of subtle sophistication that enhances audiences' perception of the narrative. The other new characters, from ""ordinary"" X-Force member Peter to Russell to Domino, are all quite strong. The movie is a bit too long and suffers from one overly generic action scene (the prison fight) and a moderately erratic third act, but it's an incredibly entertaining ride that will induce plenty of laughs and cheers from audiences. Just be sure to stay for the credits! 7.5/10"

","Deadpool puts together his X-Force team, to help save a teenage boy from Cable (Josh Brolin) a time travelling super soldier, who has come back from the future to kill him before he can cause devastation in the future. <br/><br/>""Deadpool 2"" is good, It is, . . . it's just not great. It's too similar to the first one, for me. In some ways, that's a positive. The returning characters are definitely welcome but there are a lot of gags from the first film that are reused, line by line in some cases and a lot of times I feel the writers assumed that swearing will be enough to be funny, when that's only sometimes true. Also sadly true - even though they sometimes used alternate takes - a lot of the funniest lines and references were in the trailers.<br/><br/>Maybe part of the problem is that the MCU have stolen away some of Deadpool's gimmick. Self-referential humour is as prevalent in ""Thor: Ragnorok"" for example, as is was in ""Deadpool"". Deadpool is left with little except taking it to more of an extreme and repeated jokes about paedophilia can start to drag after a while. <br/><br/>The new characters are welcome additions though, particularly Domino and Cable, and giving Reynolds a larger group to spark off is a good idea. I do hope that a proper ""X-Force"" film does come next. The action scenes have improved, as you might expect when switching to a director who worked on ""John Wick"". <br/><br/>It's has its moments definitely, It's just that it somehow doesn't add up to a particularly memorable whole."

"charlie-krausse","7","1","3","18 May 2018"," Deadpool's Formula Equals Hit for Summer Fun
","There's something about an opening scene, it either instantly grabs you or it doesn't. Some movies have a set up to an opening scene, but they still have an opening scene. Throw in a classic hit from your childhood and you find yourself already liking the movie. Its a cheap, simple formula, but it works. <br/><br/>Deadpool 2 started out just that way. Cue the music Dolly! From there, Deadpool 2 never took itself serious, so it could mock itself, other movies and even its star. Incorporate lots of famous movie quotes and references throughout and you've created something people will talk about at the water coolers the next day. Or in my case, 4-O. Now, the only thing missing from the formula is will it be a hit. Mix in some comedy, action and a few Easter Eggs leaving us wanting more, and you have just that - a box office hit.<br/><br/>Deadpool teased us enough with the expanded Marvel Universe but yet focused specifically on the lead's story. Running time of was just under 2 hours where realistically, they could have cut about 10-15 minutes to make run smoother with less slow points.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the main film, you may leave after Cher completes her soundtrack as there is no final-final Easter Egg after the credits, like most Marvel films. I didn't expect Nick Fury to come to Deadpool saying he was putting together a team, but seeing Jean Gray and Cyclopes would have been awesome. Oh well, still a fun summer movie!"
"iamjacksmoviechannel","7","1","3","18 May 2018"," The Merc has still got it
","""Deadpool 2"" is a reminder that a movie coming out of the gate is completely different from one that comfortably falls back on characters and intentions.<br/><br/>That first movie was a shocking blast of the profane, the crude, the gorey, and yeah just the all out mayhem of it brought to film with stunning energy.<br/><br/>This feels like it's falling back; trying to do the same thing over again but as is the case with shock, it doesn't work as well the second time.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is a bad movie, in fact it's a perfectly entertaining one, but it does feel like a come down from the first. <br/><br/>It sees Wade going through personal changes, becoming an X-Men trainee for a while, taking the fat kid from ""Hunt for the Wilder People"" under his wing, and dealing with a time traveler named Cable.<br/><br/>You can't fault this movie for trying. It goes for something crude or edgy in every scene, a scene where Wade regrows legs is guaranteed laughter right there.<br/><br/>Does it strain for laughs at times though? Absolutely. You can be edgy without telling 20 pedophile jokes. Five is more than enough. <br/><br/>You can never go wrong with throwing movie and pop culture related gags at movie fans though and these movies roast better than most.<br/><br/>Taking on Wolverine, Passion of the Christ, Batman vs. Superman, Star Wars, and Yentl this all works really well. <br/><br/>Oddly the most surprising thing here is that the movie does try to touch upon subjects of grief and the power of love admidst all the rampant sarcasm.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds is carrying most of the load and there's no doubt this will go down as his signature role at this point. From the fourth wall breaks, comedy, action, even a bit of drama, this is the most all-around comfortable we've seen someone in a super suit since Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man.""<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is good here too in a villain role that is both lethal but also in the realm of world saving. After Thanos and then this, we can basically call Brolin a villain who cares. 
The new character Domino is really cool here. She's played by Zazie Beets, who you'll recognize if you watch the show ""Atlanta"". <br/><br/>And Julian Dennison; I like this kid. He's got attitude well suited for comedy.<br/><br/>And really that's what this is. I thought when the movie brought in ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"" director David Leitch it would up the ante on the violence but it definitely stays within being a comedy with action in it. <br/><br/>There's a lot of physical slapstick here, stuff he handles really well. <br/><br/>This is a funny movie that the people behind it are really working their asses off on. <br/><br/>It's also a funny movie that seems to be trying just a bit too hard to top what came before and in that you can see the seams straining at times. <br/><br/>But action, comedy, Ryan Reynolds, the rest of this cast, it's a good time and so 3 out of 4 stars is what i'm going with guys.<br/><br/>If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more."

It's exactly the kind of sequel you thought it would be. What does it all amount to? A time at the movies that leaves you rocking in your seats till the credits roll. But the jokes come flying at you so fiercely, it's noticeable which one stick from which ones that fall completely flat. Yes, most of the jokes hit hard and left me howling. From unsubtle jabs at the X-Men franchise, to baby legs, to an impressive diagetic use of showtunes, to a vicious roast of Ryan Reynold's cinematic decisions. Deadpool 2, is Deadpool in and of itself. It doesn't really care. It's lovable in that respect. Along with the fun is Josh Brolin who makes a welcomed addition to the team as Cable.

"eagandersongil","7","1","3","17 May 2018"," DEADPOOL IS THE HEROI WE NEED
","In the midst of hundreds of superhero movies, we need a satire about this universe, as it always did in movie history, in the waves of terrors we had ""Todo Mundo em Panico"", ""Airplane"" did it for the blockbusters of the 70s , and now, Deadpool does this for the universe of superheroes, be it DC, or Marvel. With a somewhat confusing script that tries to create narrative parallels that do not work in such a slashed movie, we get a bit confused, the behavior of acts is terrible, the development of the story is completely confusing, it is difficult to know when we are in the middle, at the beginning or in the end, but luckily, the script jokes win us, and in some moments justify the holes of the same in a way didatico, plus hundreds of references and joke POP culture that end up amusing and pleasing the audience. Technically the film is almost impeccable, its special effects are simple but beautiful, we notice the chroma key but it gives a kind of charm to the film, besides the wonderful choreographies and use of cameras in the action scenes, David Leitch was impeccable again in the question "" Porradaria "", besides an absurdly sagacious soundtrack that travels between decades but establishes itself in the romantic classics of the 80s, Deadpool is a technical perfection, even better than other superproductions of Marvel and DC. The actors transpired charisma, Ryan Reynolds does well, Josh Brolin does very well, Morena Baccarin has little screen time, but when it does, it enchants everyone, but the biggest highlight of the film for me is for Zazie Beetz. Deaadpool 2 improves everything in relation to the first one, less the script, the long one has many problems, but nevertheless, it is exactly what we need, a film that guides a wave of films of hero, causing us reflections on everything that we have already seen and we continue to see, laughing, and breaking the fourth wall, it is a film that will become very popular over the years, but for our current time, it is essential, he shouts at the viewer ""WE ARE LIVING THE AGE OF ADAPTATIONS OF QUADRINHOS, PAY ATTENTION, THAT WILL END A TIME!

Deadpool/Wade (Reynolds) is back as the ""merc with a mouth"" and the film kicks plenty of action as he takes down a syndicate, but also sets up the plot with something he has to atone for - and why he wants to try to save Russell (Dennison). Also, the Bond-rip off titles are excellent.<br/><br/>The support cast is excellent, with Vanessa (Baccarin), Dopinder (Soni), Colossus (Kapicic), Negasonic (Hildebrand), Weasel (Miller) and Blind Al (Uggams) all back. The additions of X-Force are pretty hilarious - especially Peter (Delaney) - but Domino (Beetz) steals the show, with her ""lucky"" superpower. There's some great cameos, which I won't spoil, but they all bring laughs of recognition. Cable (Brolin) is a great tough guy, who's motivations are slowly revealed, but not in any great detail. <br/><br/>While still a very fun film with plenty of laughs throughout, sometimes it's hard to keep up, since the pace is unrelenting. There does also seem to be a bit more darkness underneath (which is also poked fun at) which is why it maybe doesn't quite reach the heights of the first film. It's probably slightly too long & tries to fit a bit too much in. Stay for the credits scenes - some excellent call-backs/""alterations""!"

Unfortunately, the high level of comedy that bounds audiences to their seats for a full two hours was not achieved properly by the cgi which made me almost thinking I was watching a non-disney/pixar movie produced by a startup animation company. Another downgrade form Deadpool 2 also come from an underused character that has so much potential to be interesting and well-received by all DP fans but she was just proving her own worthiness at the very end of the movie. Despite all of that, this is the first time, in the history of a comicbook cinematic universe, where we see deadpool acts as a real hero instead of an anti-hero (the role he plays most of the time in the comic book) without changing his fourth-wall-breaking-with-a-lot-of-adult-jokes attitude which makes us love him even more.

","I really liked the first Deadpool, but this movie does not have the same charm. The excess of jokes, extreme violence and politically correct policies spoils so much the movie that they become unbearable. The opening song is boring, and does not fit the story. The CGI starts reasonable, however in the middle of the movie become bad (Do not get to be level Justice League). The biggest problem of Deadpool 2 is in the weak script that sounds so childish and lacking a solid tangle. Some action scenes were good for example when Cable appears in prison. The rest of the action scenes did not excite me. But why put the X Force team in the movie? To kill the whole team ... what a waste of the scene. The worst is the Firefist kid. The boy reminded me so much of Dakota Fanning in the War of the Worlds. That there were times when I wanted his death. One thing I did not like was putting Deadpool after the death of the beloved wanting to commit suicide. In today's world, suicide is a huge problem. And for mentally weak people you get the wrong message. (The same would be said in the previous film when Deadpool advises Dopinder to kidnap the rival).
In the end, Deadpool was made for money only. And it does not even have the passion seen in the previous film. For a Marvel movie I expect quality and passion, but this film has other priorities."

","Deadpool 2 stars Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, and Zazie Beetz. Ryan Reynolds is back as Deadpool or also known as the merc with the mouth and in his new installment he has to protect this kid from Cable who is here to kill him. We all know Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool that's a fact so it would make sense that he would return for the sequel and he kills it like he did in the previous one. I'm really skeptical when it comes to sequels because it's a hit or miss either its better than the first one or it completely falls flat on its face. And I can tell you that it is better than the first one. It's got more action and humor combined so we get to see more jokes from Deadpool and the rest of the cast and crew. But that isn't to say that the movie does have its faults especially in the second act, which started out good, but there was one joke that was carried out for too long that wasn't necessary. Also added to this new installment we have Cable played by Josh Brolin a Terminator who goes back to the past so he can kill this boy who murdered his family in the future. I found Cable to be one dimensional, as we've seen this done multiply times over and over again so that bit I didn't find particularly interesting. I'm not hating on Cable and props to Josh Brolin who took this character very seriously and made everything he said and did with such believability that I have respect for the character even though I don't find him interesting. The real star of this is Domino played by Zazie Beetz. Domino has the power of luck, which sounds kind of lazy as Deadpool puts it, but its so fascinating. I know nothing about this person, but she does have the power of luck on her side and it shows how well they stick that in the movie. Overall, I will say that Deadpool 2 is a perfect sequel without its faults."
"hp-33729","8","1","4","17 August 2018"," Why the hate?
","Lots of 1 point reviews here. People get so dramatic over movies these days... ""Oh my god the worst 2 hours of my life!"" It most definitely wasn't. OK, it's probably not on the same level as the first Deadpool movie, but it's still enjoyable. Deadpool is more annoying this time for sure, and there's a rapid fire of hit and miss jokes. Maybe less would be more, but at least you can tell that a lot more effort was put into this movie than into other recent comedies. As for the plot, I wasn't really into it, but the characters' personalities still made the movie enjoyable for me. If this is the worst thing you've seen, consider yourself very lucky."

I couldn't stop laughing even through the 'sad' parts. Especially the delayed opening credits. A surprise monster of a special guest with nice juggs, you will get this if you watch it. Also a shout out to Karan 'Dopinder' Soni the cabbie from the first film, you play that great song from 'Swades'. End Credits are enjoyable as well. You shouldn't have Deadpool a time machine since he is so meta. Not only Canada but probably the whole world thanks you for that one.

","Even though some people may criticize the movie for it's cliched plot. I really enjoyed this movie, I loved the cast and the characters which helped built this movie throughout, making it in my opinion the best Deadpool movie since ""Deadpool"" in 2016.
 
The action scenes were great but not up to the John Wick style, that David Leitch promised. But they were pretty over-top but realistic at the same-time.
One of my favorite scenes was the prison and the end fight scene and the ""Hand-Gun"" scene, that was in the first trailer.<br/><br/>The comedy in this movie was performed perfectly, the comedy still worked when it came to some serious scene. And the way they change the tone of the film was executed perfectly.<br/><br/>The performance is the heart to the film like a blood is to a penis. Ryan Reynolds nails it again as Deadpool, Karan Soni reprise his role as Dopinder which we see more of (WE NEED A PETER and DOPINDER SPINOFF). Josh Brolin does a pretty intimidating and really cool Cable. Zazie Beetz was great and surprisingly interesting as Domino aka The Girl who's Lucky. Rob Delaney was really great being Peter and I hope to see him in future Deadpool or X-Force movies.<br/><br/>The plot was really simple to understand, which I really look for in a movie tbh.
I'm not a huge-fan of complicated plot lines, that leaves me confused but some of them are done really well.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a FAMILY and ACTION PACKAGED THRILL-RIDE OF FUN with COMEDIC ELEMENTS.
Everyone needs to watch Deadpool 2."

Perfection.<br/><br/>Then the association he continually makes himself to Jesus. Maybe connected to the ciggy? Not so sure. Deadpool does make the comparison 4 times. Why is that? When he actually whispers the word ""Jesus"", it reaches a new level of creepy. Listen for that one. it's later in the movie. His head is blowing off or some such thing.<br/><br/> A R-rated movie targeted to teens. Sure, smoke away. And target the teens around the world.

","Truthfully, there was heart, action and pretty awesome humor, however, there was no excitement. Deadpool is unique in that, it is or can be too much, but it's a franchise that positioned itself to also be, enough, simultaneously. This is bad, good and weird.<br/><br/>Deadpool, as in the character himself, is like that amazing movie with a twist you never saw coming, so, the second watch of said movie will still be amazing, but, knowing the twist already, takes a little something away.<br/><br/>The humor has earned its license to overkill, but, it also threatens the survival of all the other characteristics. For instance, the action is there and it's pretty cool, but it's not exciting, and the heart is there, but it's not, pounding.<br/><br/>Many of the references were priceless, and the fate of the X-Force during their mission was, altogether, inspired. The story, was actually quite fresh, and many may feel it didn't have a story, because quite possibly, it's a story that would've flourished far better in another film, or tone. Not that it didn't belong in this movie, or that it was wasted on it, rather, it was obscured.<br/><br/>Deadpool was an amazing film which is good, however, Deadpool 2 is somehow better which is weird, because it's familiar, which is bad. However, being able to live up to its predecessor is respectable. 8/10."

The problem I had is in the DP 1 you had the shock factor of a tongue in cheek marvel character but in this movie that's already gone, so you have to rely on a good plot but unfortunately it lacked that, so I felt a little bit bored by it.

I couldn't sit through it, especially once I figured out how the rest of this movie would go. That was about at the halfway point. To that point it was a continuous riff by Ryan Reynolds of snarky, crass quips. And because this is the second installment of Deadpool, he was going for more shock value than in the first flick. It got tiring and offensive to me. I gave it 5 stars for production quality."

","After being brutally separated from his girlfriend with whom he wanted to form a family, Deadpool seeks to fulfill a riddle of hers. Thus he's determined to help a young mutant who is threatened by a powerful character from the future. <br/><br/>It's a movie with a good and apparently emotional premise which follows Deadpool in an attempt at redemption. Due to his flamboyant character, he ends up in a lot of trouble but his new team will be there to help him out whenever he needs.<br/><br/>As you might expect, this movie is a joke and thus it should be treated as such. It's full of puns, jokes and references to other movies, characters and so on. It tries so much to be laughable that it somehow manages not to be as intended. Yes, it is funny but you won't get to laugh out loud or anything like that. It seems forced and this alters the overall experience.<br/><br/>From my point of view, a good superhero movie needs to be serious in order to be good. It has to transmit emotion to the viewer, it has to be consistent in its decisions, it has to have likeable characters, ones for which the viewer to care about. Unfortunately, you don't get any of these with this movie. Just when you think you'll see something even remotely breathtaking, you're slammed by a misplaced joke which is not even funny enough to make it worth the turnover.<br/><br/>It is an average movie as far as I'm concerned, with good special effects, but with average characters, an average plot, full of jokes which try too much to make it funny which end up failing. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie and I knew from the beginning what I was going to see, but unfortunately it failed to change my opinion regarding superhero movies, proving that going all out funny isn't always the right way to go."

 Sadly where this falls flat is the humour. Firstly there's just too many of them, its almost impossible too keep up with them all or get all the references. Secondly and more importantly the jokes are just NOT FUNNY. In fact, they're less funny than even the last movie, jeez, even Green Lantern wasn't as unfunny as this, well, maybe that's extreme but that's just how unfunny the jokes are. Its like writers were so smugly laughing at their own jokes, they thought everyone else would be too, well sorry Marvel, i didn't laugh, not once.

"rustonreviews","5","1","4","22 May 2018"," More of the same.
","When the fourth wall breaking anti-hero Deadpool made his official cinematic debut in 2016, it became quickly apparent that I was in the small minority of folk who just couldn't jump aboard the bandwagon. Deadpool, to me, was a decent one-time watch, but I never felt the desire to revisit the film once it hit the shelves. A sequel was of course inevitable, and due to the originals incredible success, the pressure to deliver a worthy follow up must have felt like a tremendous task for everyone involved. I had hoped that Deadpool 2 would be the film that would finally enable me to understand what makes these films, and the character, so beloved. Somewhat unsurprisingly, it didn't. Two years have passed since the original film, and Deadpool (Reynolds) has found work as a mercenary. His talents in the field are gleefully presented to us in a fun opening sequence consisting of plenty of blood and guts which sets the stage for what's to come. When cybernetic soldier Cable (Brolin) travels back in time from the future (Terminator style), he sets out on a mission to kill young pyromaniac Russell (Julian Dennison) to prevent the death of his family, resulting in Deadpool stepping up to protect Russell before Cable successfully terminates him. <br/><br/>Now packing a much bigger budget than its predecessor, Deadpool 2 ramps everything up to 11. Sure, it's bigger and louder with set pieces they never could have made first time around, but that's not to say it is in any way a step up above the original. If anything, it feels somewhat more like a step down. One of the films biggest missteps is the humanization of Deadpool. My knowledge of his comic book counterpart is slim, but from what I've gathered thus far this isn't particularly something that fits the character, yet strangely it becomes one of the most central points of the film. Saddled with that is the rather naff storyline that feels absolutely all over the place. Cable is never quite as interesting or entertaining to watch as I'd thought he would be, and the addition of Dennison (who is great in Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople) isn't quite enough to rescue the poor cast of characters. Essentially, the film feels more like just a bunch of stuff happening with nothing cohesive to hold it all together to form a sturdy narrative. <br/><br/>Sprinkled within what is mostly an unorganised film is one hilarious set piece, an awkwardly funny conversational moment and a post credits scene that riffs on genius. Yet even with Reynold's still owning the character better than anyone else could, there was still nothing about Deadpool 2 that really struck a chord with me. Unfortunately, it just feels like more of the same, but for those who loved the original that's hardly a bad thing."
"The Grand Master","9","1","4","20 May 2018"," Deadpool returns and exceeds all expectations
","Deadpool was always going to be hard to top however the sequel excels all expectations. Everything is turned up full volume from the crude humour, the blood and gore, the action, and further character development. This had to be the first time that I have laughed so hard in the cinema.<br/><br/>Deadpool/Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) returns and we pick up where we left off from the first movie where he dispatches bad guys and lets fly with crude and witty one liners. Wade is also living the seemingly perfect life with his love interest Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) along with his fellow friends the hapless taxi driver Dopinder (Karan Soni), bartender Weasel (T.J. Miller) and Wade's neighbour Blind Al (Leslie Uggams). Deadpool finds himself teaming with an unlikely group of superheroes including Domino (Zazie Beetz) to go up against the brutal and ruthless mutant Cable (Josh Brolin who is a standout and this is one of his most memorable roles) who has travelled back in time to kill the unstable young mutant Russell Collins (Julian Dennison). Deadpool also reunites with fellow rogue allies including Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). <br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, I don't need to say that you'll have a blast with the sequel. Ryan Reynolds is a perfect fit as Deadpool/Wade Wilson. Josh Brolin as Cable was amazing, and his dedication to the time spent in the gym was well worth it. The rest of the supporting cast were awesome as well. Keep an eye out for a number of blink and you'll miss it cameos as well as some small roles that pop up.<br/><br/>Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds have done an amazing job as writers for the sequel and everything has perfectly fallen into place. Everything just works and the everyone in the cinema thoroughly enjoyed themselves.<br/><br/>David Leitch (John Wick) takes the director's chair from Tim Miller and he has done a fine job here.<br/><br/>One does not simply leave a Marvel movie during the end credits, so do yourself a favour and stay right until the end credits. I'm not going to share any spoilers, but I strongly suggest you don't leave the cinema early.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing the sequel and today upon watching the sequel I walked out of the cinema very happy with a huge smile on my face. You'll have an awesome time. I guarantee it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Marvel is on the roll! After fantastic and super successful Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool is arrived to entertain public. With the solid comic elements, 1st installment of this franchise got fantastic response. And so do we all are expecting with the second edition.<br/><br/>Ryan Raynolds as Deadpool is just become a part of X Men trainee. But, as you all know about his mischievousness, he tries to overdo things (to entertain us!) In the meantime, because of the biggest loss in his life, he changes a lot. Tries different things. But as we all know him, he changes accordingly but with the same behaviour. I am not telling anything about the storyline, because it will become spoiler. It is because of the simple story of this part. <br/><br/>I have seen it in Hindi. As the first one was super cool in Hindi! Also, every superhero films have to be seen in Hindi language, for the extra amount of humour! As we were thrilled to see 1st part and its comic timing because it was natural and unexpected. Here, the problem is there are only punchlines, nothing else! Too much is also harmful for the cinematic experience. I felt that film and characters are speaking constantly non-sense! Hehehe. Yeah, may be because of poor dubbing. Or even unmatchable Ranveer Singh! There are some moments when the whole theatre split apart. But they were very few moments. Even it was stupid that he saying like Ranveer toh India ka best actor hai! Hahaha... He even tries to promote all his films with SLB! Ufff.... Having said that, I would like to say that usage of old Hindi songs in Hollywood films surely make you smile. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly, post credit scene in this part was fantastic. Never seen like this before. I want to write about that part, but have to stop here! Hehe.<br/><br/>Some slow motion scenes were fantabulous. But, if you want my honest review, I am not satisfied with this part. This happens many a times that in a franchise, mostly the least part has been the second one! I will put Deadpool in the same category. May be because I have seen it in Hindi, may be because I have seen the ultimate Avengers Infinity War just in last month, or the biggest reason is- May be because I'd seen the first installment just yesterday! These are the assumptions of mine for not getting the feel of Paisa Wasool! May be I am wrong, or may be not!<br/><br/>Best scene is jumping from the plane with the entire X-Force team. I am eager to see what will they bring to us in the third part after watching the post credit scene here. So, on the whole, it is just a one time watch film for fans. 3/5."
"leegato","8","1","4","18 May 2018"," An Improvement Over The First Deadpool
","I want to say I hold the unpopular opinion that I felt the original Deadpool film wasn't perfect, or very good. I felt it was just a decent superhero film that was exactly how I think a Deadpool film would have gone down, but it didn't do anything more and didn't extend past that. To me, the first Deadpool relied too much on shock factor. Sure, I got some chuckles, but I left the theater watching the original Deadpool slightly disappointed, hoping the humor would be much better. With that said, I left Deadpool 2 feeling much more satisfied with the characterization and humor. In Deadpool 2, shock factor is no longer the primary vehicle that drives the film, making plenty of room to flesh out the film's ultimately clever writing, pacing, and story.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 sees the return of our favorite Merc with a Mouth, who finds himself protecting a young Russell Collins (AKA Firefist) from the time-traveling mutant Cable (portrayed by Josh Brolin). DP2 doesn't need to try hard to be funny, and they pull no punches when it comes to the biting self-referential jokes and pop culture references, whether it comes to dishing on the DC Extended Universe (as a DCEU fan as well, I really appreciated those) or even the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The otherwise formulaic story is substantial enough to drive the plot, and has significantly improved in characterization and writing with strong supporting characters and villains, particularly in fleshing out the relationships Deadpool has with Firefist and Cable. Many of the vulgar and flat-out incredulous jokes are paced perfectly within their respective moments, and happen with respect to the plot, not the other way around (as I felt the first Deadpool sometimes had done). This comedic structure helped give DP2 a more refined direction in story and humor. Cable serves as the perfect contrast to Deadpool; the writers weren't afraid to give him some of his own snarky lines, and Josh Brolin delivers them so seriously and in character that you laugh at his lines as they bounce off of Deadpool. <br/><br/>Overall, Deadpool 2 is the most unlikely buddy comedy family film of the year, with enough serious moments to drive the story but far more jokes to not take itself too seriously in the process. With humor adapting to the plot instead of the plot being driven by the humor, DP2 is a refined improvement over its predecessor, and becomes all of the things the first film should have been."

","Deadpool 2 was tremendously hilarious. All though its narrative is occasionally clunky and its attempts to be emotionally compelling feel sometimes unbalanced, this was nonetheless, a solid follow up. Also, the car chase sequence was comedic perfection! (Verdict: B)"
"nodlimax","6","1","4","17 May 2018"," Fun ride overall with some pacing issues
","Let me start by saying that I like the movie overall. The characters are pretty good, the story fits for the characters and the effects are alright as well. Also the humor and references are a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I completely lost it during the mid credit scenes.<br/><br/>The movie has weak points though. The pacing is a bit inconsistent and some stuff is to drawn out and in terms of humor missfires.<br/><br/>I'd give the movie a 7/10 but I have one problem I cannot overlook which drags it down to a 6. There is some extremely forced social justice nonsense that just makes my eyes roll. It's just unnecessary. The humor related to it doesn't work for me as its not really represented in a sarcastic way.<br/><br/>In the end you need to decide for yourself whether or not you want to give the movie a chance. It is not as good as the first one, but still has quite a few high notes."
"alindsay-al","7","1","4","17 May 2018"," A good fun entertaining sequel
","The success of the first Deadpool film was a great thing for R-rated comic book films and now we have the sequel Deadpool 2 which is enjoyable even though it is not up to the levels of the first film in my opinion. The premise of the film sees Deadpool attempt to save a kid from a time travelling mutant who intends to save the future. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, and he was born to play this role. He has incredible whit in this film and is an incredibly funny and charming hero for the audience to root for in this film, he also stretches to some very well done dramatic scenes in this film that was not present in the first film. Now the year of 2018 will be remembered as the year of Josh Brolin as he is crushing it at the moment, in this film he plays Cable and he was the perfect choice for the role. His gruff, tough attitude was perfect to work opposite Reynolds and he does a great job of adding depth and humanity to the character to make you root for his mission to a certain extent. I also really enjoyed watching Domino, she is a character who works with Deadpool and I really enjoyed seeing her powers in action, her personality also added a lot to this film and she was a shining light in this film. The returning characters are really good also even though some people may be disappointed as they're screen time is cut down to make way for some of the new players. The story surprisingly has a lot of depth to it, and sees Deadpool go on a pretty well done emotional journey throughout the film that I was surprised worked so well. However, the studio obviously increased the budget for this film as they try to cram so much into this film that didn't need to be there and it made this film feel more bloated then it needed to be. The script has obviously some really funny quips and references that had me laughing, also as mentioned some of the drama was handled pretty well. Though in this film, I felt that the contrast between the two wasn't handled as well as the first film and took me out of some of the most important moments in the film. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it that took advantage of the things that they can do over other franchises. However, the final battle feels less then the previous film and overall it just feels like there is less action scenes in this film too. This led to a few pacing issues in this film and the film drags a little bit longer then it really needs to. Overall this is a fun comic book film but this won't be remembered as a truly revolutionary film like the first one will be, though fans of the first film should definitely watch this film."

Everyone wants the best for him, but he stuck in everything bad about his life then wallowed in it, then justified the wallowing with a cliche instead of bouncing back and moving on. It gets sadder as it goes on and you don't care at all about the character, and therefore the movie."

","Deadpool 2 same as the first film is a mixed bag. Obviously the studio wanted to stuff their pockets full of cash again, so they didn't dare to stray from the established formular.<br/><br/>As a comedy Deadpool 2 works really well. The gags range from genuinely funny to slightly cringe worthy. If you expect to get a few laughs out of this you will not be disappointed. I promise.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you are a X-Force comics fan, stay away as far as possible. The casting is hilariously bad. The middle aged Hollywood actor who plays cable is absolutely mis-casted. Beats me why they didn't ask Dolph Lundgren to play cable.
As mostly with these superhero cash grab fests the whole cast looks like cosplay gone horribly wrong. And of course the lameness doesn't stop there. The CGI design sucks balls as well. Juggernaut looks like a deflated Juggernaut Jr, and Colossus looks like they barrowed him from a cheapo Saturday morning kids show.<br/><br/>Seriously if you cant even do Superhero characters the slightest justice, stop trying. It's embarrassing and it outs you as the money grubbing dolts that you are."

","I can't believe the negative reviews this movie has got! I mean it's Deadpool! What did you guys expect? Or is it the butthurt JL fans? Anyhow, let's get the thing clear and loud. Deadpool 2 is Super Duper Fun! 
Having watched the Super Duper Cut last night which has alternative jokes, added scenes and roughly 15 minutes of extra footage, within the 1st 5 minutes I knew I'm in for a ride and it was a madcap quirky ride, and I savour each moment of it. The director change thankfully didn't effect the movie. In fact, I would say the Jokes are funnier, the action sequences more better. Ryan Reynolds is a riot. He was born to play Deadpool(and to screw Green Lantern). It seems Deadpool has completely become his baby, not only does he use self depreciating humor but also shares writing credits and produces the movie. Maybe in the future, we might see him directing as well. Josh Brolin, after his brilliant turn in Infinity War, plays Cable here, and blends in well. We will see more of him in the future movies. As DP puts it, X Force is nothing but a scheme by Fox to keep Brolin employed! 
Among the downsides, I would say the plot isn't that strong. Though I personally didn't mind it. The irreverent tone of the movie doesn't go with a serious plot. As long as it's fun, you know it's a good movie.
The Mid credit scenes are a riot. Especially the bonus scene. That was ROFL. 
Overall, don't listen to the purists. If you like your movies fun, you'll love DP 2. 
Pump the hate breaks haters!"
"arjunflamingfeather","10","1","5","1 August 2018"," DEADPOOL, a circular thought to entertain.
","Being in the movie Ryan Reynolds did the role off: Deadpool. In the universe, entertainment lives with the audio visual stimulation that DEADPOOL TWO offers. This movie is the movie that did the trailers that had the DEADPOOL with a paint brush. 
The effects of a movie that is a success is because the movie did well; success failure are rated. On the INternational MOvie Database the movie hit eight rating bar by average because the film did please the appeal. Appealing to have men middle aged who are fit and without the kilos on the waistline is motivating; obesity at a younger age like in 'Just FRIENDS'. 
Writing about DEADPOOL TWO needed a refresh because like in the movies the taglines are judged on the merit of smartness rather than humor. The sequences are visual and did please us with graphics that are enormous and safe to view."

","Oke so I thought it would be way worse than the first movie, but it wasn't. The trailer does some deception though. After the cinema trailer I was certain that some charaters would fullfil a much bigger role then they did, On the other hand it still is someting else from the rest of the marvel universe. Most Marvel movies feel the same each and every time wich is why I stopped visiting most of them.<br/><br/>The comedy still makes everyone in the cinema litteraly laugh out loud. But the bigger buget has made the movie worse than the original. It has become less down to earth. The writers have become a bit lazy. <br/><br/>So in the end I would advice to watch the movie but hope the changes aren't increased in a possible third movie."
"nidheeshnarayanan","9","1","5","2 June 2018"," An appealing sequel
","Unlike its predecessor, DP2 is more about a mission which is not against a villain mainly though it was to bring back someone to life. DP himself was going through the extreme pain of loss & regret and still formed a team to fulfill his mission. However the movie's heart, soul & spine is the humor element :)<br/><br/>Dead Pool is a selfless mutant who got super heroic powers & abilities after being experimented to heal his cancer but also disfigured him. The first part narration was completely through hilarious voice over by Dead Pool himself, looked innovative. But Dead Pool 2 was ridiculously hilarious, such a charm to watch over the performance of each which turn our smiles to laughs and cherish the cinematic experience inside the hall. While the flick is hilarious - it's emotional too, it goes through loss, guilt & regret ... And in fact the movie starts with the suicide attempt of Dead Pool. It's hard to judge the joner of the film, DP2 is not just a Super hero movie, not an action movie too, not a hard core adult movie either. It's a mix of all, you get to experience extreme action sequences, vulgar killings, Sarcasm (Off course), comedy, thriller to the core etc . The action scenes are glorious without any doubt. It's entertaining in its own way. From the beginning to the end my eyes were glued on to the screen without being bored even for a sec. The movie is filled with small surprises too, like time travel.<br/><br/>Everyone performed fantastically, but Ryan Reynolds was great as such an ass kicking super hero. Cinematography was excellent, even on screen we can sense that there are no drop of shadow falling on frame during the scenes in extreme lighting conditions. The edits were crisp as well as the fantastic CGI / VFX deserve appreciation."
"jboothmillard","8","1","5","26 May 2018"," Deadpool 2
","This first movie was a terrifically funny alternative superhero movie, with its middle finger-brandishing spirit, there were high hopes for another slice of the spin-off from the Marvel X-Men series, we got it, and I wondered if it would be as much enjoyable, directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). Basically foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has been Deadpool for the last two years, and it is his anniversary with girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), he is delighted when she wants to start a family. As Deadpool, Wade failed to kill a target, this assassin tracks them down and kills Vanessa, he kills the man in revenge, and blames himself for her death, six weeks later he attempts to commit suicide, blowing himself up. Wade has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but his body pieces remain alive and he is put back together by Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Wade is left only with a Skee-Ball token as an anniversary gift and final memento of Vanessa. Wade recovers with his healing abilities at the X-Mansion, he agrees to join the X-Men as a form of healing, he joins Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) at a standoff between authorities and unstable young mutant Russell Collins aka Firefist (Julian Dennison) at an orphanage. Deadpool realises Russell has been abused by one of the orphanage staff, he kills one of the staff members, Colossus stops him killing anyone else, Deadpool and Russell are arrested. They are taken to the ""Icebox"", an isolated prison for mutant criminals, and restrained with collars that suppress their powers. Meanwhile, a cybernetic soldier from the future, Cable (Josh Brolin), has travelled back in time to find Russell, his family were murdered in the future by an older Russell, he has come to kill the boy before he ever becomes a killer. Cable breaks into the Icebox and attacks Russell, Wade's collar is damaged in the chaos, he attempts to defend Russell, Cable takes Vanessa's token, forcing Wade and him out of prison, but not before Russell overhears Wade deny that he cares about him. Near death again, Wade has another vision of Vanessa, she convinces him to help Russell, so when he recovers, Wade organises a team called X-Force to break Russell out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. Deadpool advertises for anyone with superhuman abilities to apply, mutants recruited are Domino (Zazie Beetz), who has the manipulative ability of luck, along with Bedlam (Terry Crews), Shatterstar (Lewis Tan), Zeitgeist (Bill Skarsgård) and the invisible Vanisher (Brad Pitt), and human Peter (Rob Delaney) is recruited, he applied because he thought it would be fun. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachuting from a helicopter, but all team members, except for Deadpool and the lucky Domino, die during the landing. While Deadpool and Domino fight Cable on the fast-moving convoy, Russell frees mutant inmate Juggernaut (voiced by Reynolds), he agrees to repay Russell by helping him to kill the abusive orphanage headmaster (Eddie Marsan), Juggernaut destroys the truck and he and Russell escape. Cable agrees to work with Deadpool and Domino to stop Russell from committing his first murder, that would send him on the future path, he agrees to give Wade the chance to talk Russell down before attempting to kill the boy again. They arrive at the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut, while Russell attacks the headmaster, and Colossus, who at first refused to help Wade due to his murderous ways, shows up to help and allow Wade and Cable to confront Russell. After it appears that Wade fails in talking Russell down, Cable shoots at the young mutant, Wade leaps in front of the bullet, wearing an Icebox collar, causing him to die, reuniting him with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing the sacrifice, Russell no longer wants to kill the headmaster, this changes the future, Cable's family will now survive. But Cable uses his final charge on his time-travelling device, needed to return to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token onto his chest to deflect the bullet. Deadpool survives, Russell still has his change of heart, and the headmaster is run over by Wade's taxi driver friend Dopinder (Karan Soni). In the mid credits, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna) repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wade, this allows him to travel back in time to save the lives of Vanessa and Peter, he also rights some wrongs, by killing the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version of Deadpool and killing actor Ryan Reynolds while reading the script for Green Lantern. Also starring T.J. Miller as Weasel and Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and cameos by Nicholas Hoult as Beast, James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Evan Peters as Quicksilver, Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Alexandra Shipp as Storm, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler and Stan Lee on a mural. Reynolds is again fantastic as the wisecracking anti-hero, he does many more fourth wall breaks, send-ups of clichés and in-jokes, Brolin (who is also Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, released only a month before this) is also great as the complex and compelling antagonist. The first film was funny, action-packed and fun, well this sequel is even better, many more explosive moments in the many fight and chases sequences, and visually stunning special effects, and it is hilariously funnier, with its black comedy violence, more vulgar language and bitch-slapping of past superhero movies, the highlights are an opening credits sequence with ""Ashes"" by Celine Dion, spoofing James Bond opening titles, and Flashdance (with bullets instead of water), and the genius end credits sequence and end song, overall it is a brilliant fantasy action comedy. Very good!"

","Simply put, if you loved Deadpool then Deadpool 2 is most certainly your newest must-see slice of crass language, over the top violence and more self-referential digs than you can poke a sword at.<br/><br/>One of the biggest surprise smash-hits of the last decade, the first Deadpool had no real right to be as entertaining and amusing as it was and benefited greatly from an audience across the globe that didn't expect it to be nearly as proficient as it was, so in many ways Deadpool 2 has a lot more weight thrust upon its shoulders in today's climate, with many eager fans awaiting more of Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds under the guise of a tight red gimp suit.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that new director David Leitch (aka one of the guys that killed John Wick's dog) doesn't mess with the formula here, maybe a few less genitalia jokes, but by the by Wade Wilson's newest adventures being the world's most smart-mouthed anti-hero are going to play out exactly the way you thought they were going to.<br/><br/>As was the case with the first film, Deadpool 2 doesn't try overly hard narrative wise, this new jaunt sees Wilson in a state of depression and in a situation where he finds himself trying to protect Hunt for the Wilderpeople star Julian Dennisen's mutant teenager from time travelling super-soldier Cable but it's all an excuse to give audiences more of what they came to love in the first outing.<br/><br/>Along with the to be expected there are some truly funny and standout scenes in play in Deadpool 2, such as an imaginative sequence demonstrating new mutant Domino's luck (played fantastically by newcomer to the series Zazie Beetz) and the first mission for Wilson and his new X-Force squad that includes standouts Peter and Vanisher, while the introduction of Josh Brolin as Cable is the films biggest win, with Brolin rolling on with that good Thanos form.<br/><br/>So good is Cable that you wish the film would've allowed more room for growth with his inclusion into the story and while he plays a key role in proceedings, you still can't escape the feeling that the film would've grown as a whole had Brolin been allowed more spotlight, ditto for Dennisen and Reynolds budding mateship, that despite forming the core of the narrative thrust is never properly built up, making Wilson's mission as a whole less engaging than it could've been.<br/><br/>These misses narratively combined with other elements of Deadpool 2 make it feel like a backwards step or at the very least of a stalling of the series from the first, there's a sense here that everything's a little auto-pilot, the action too taking a backwards step from the imaginative sequences of the first film and while perfectly entertaining, this is an experience filled with nothing that would suggest Deadpool 2 is going to be a film you'll be going back to anytime soon.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>Serving up more of the same but without the surprise element of the first, Deadpool 2 is going to be another box-office smash and introduces us to one of the Marvel universes most exciting new characters in the form of Cable but there's the feeling that this franchise as a standalone entity has already spent a fair portion of its blood-soaked and pop-culture infused fuel tickets.<br/><br/>3 Green Lantern scripts out of 5"
"ferguson-6","7","1","5","16 May 2018"," snarky and irreverent redux
","Greetings again from the darkness. We couldn't help but ask ""why?"" when the sequel was announced, even though we knew the answer was money. There was little hope in improving on the first DEADPOOL (2016), and since that film's director, Tim Miller, was tied up with upcoming projects for X-Men and Terminator, there was understandable concern that changing the recipe could result in huge disappointment. While it may not be an improvement on the first, only those with unrealistic expectations are likely to be disappointed ... the rest of us will spend most of two hours laughing and enjoying the spectacle.<br/><br/>Director David Leitch exploded onto the scene with last year's surprise action hit ATOMIC BLONDE, and his stuntman experience is once again on display with even more frenzied action and fight sequences this time out. As you might expect, there is no easing into the comedy routine here. The Opening Credits are laugh out loud funny and the only thing better may be the closing credits sequence, which is an instant classic.<br/><br/>No punchlines will be spoiled here, and it's an obvious statement, but clearly no topic or subject, or at least very few, are off-limits. Targets of barbs include LinkedIn, YENTL, FROZEN, Fox & Friends, and well, the list goes on and on. You'll likely miss 20 percent of the dialogue whilst laughing. The ""Merc with a Mouth"" breaks the 4th wall in atypical fashion - blurring the line through dialogue incorporated into the story. The self-awareness is comical in its own right.<br/><br/>Some familiar faces are back. Wade's main squeeze Vanessa (Marina Baccarin) kicks off the ""kids"" discussion (Yikes!) and the couple seems to have settled into cohabitant bliss - never a good sign in a superhero movie. TJ Miller (despite his recent headlines) is back running Sister Margaret's Bar, though his minimal presence is noted. Also back is Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic), and his expanded role finds him turning Deadpool into an X-Men trainee at Professor Xavier's School for the gifted. This occurs after tragedy strikes and we are introduced to some new players. Julian Dennison (so good in HUNT FOR THE WILDERBEAST) plays FireFist, and of course, the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin) shows us what happens when a time-travelling Terminator type is out for revenge. <br/><br/>Snarking, mocking and irreverence remain in full force throughout, but if you happen to pay attention to the story, you'll notice a (not-so) subtle transition taking place. The renegade superhero shifts from loner to team player, and even picks up some life lessons along the way - mostly related to loss and collaboration. Deadpool even forms his own team called X-Force, and one of the more interesting members is Domino (Zazie Beetz), whose superpower is luck (yep). We do get a surprise cameo, and there's even a shot of Deadpool with no pants ... and it's markedly unsexy. The music selections are inspired, however, if you are unsure whether this movie is for you ... it probably isn't."

","I already pre-ordered my tickets and would have backed out had I realized who was directing this movie. David Leitch is on my blacklist because he is, plain and simple, a hack director. I know Chad Stahelski co-directed John Wick with him, but given that 2 was better without Leitch and Atomic Blonde was terrible with just him, I'm going to guess he's the guy to blame.<br/><br/>The word was this movie was a mess when shown to test audiences and subjected to reshoots. I can see how it was a lot worse before the reshoots. Deadpool is a shadow of his former self. He's way too serious, the plot is way too serious, he actually cares about people. Some scenes go on way too long to the point where you're just like, ok, we get it, move on. <br/><br/>Worst of all, Deadpool is simply upstaged by everyone in the film. Zazie Beatz and Josh Brolin were fantastic, as was the New Zealand kid playing Russell. Juggernaut was amazing and left me wanting more, definitely did the character justice. It definitely made the movie worth it just to see him.<br/><br/>Hopefully the movie gets a better director next time and recovers from this mistake."

"TheHonestCritic","4","0","2","22 May 2020"," Here we have a sequel to one of my top 10 all-time favorite superhero films. Can it possibly be as good as the first one? Well.....
","""Deadpool 2"" (2018), after the unexpected pleasant surprise of the first movie, I thought: ""how can they possibly top it with a sequel?"" When I heard that a sequel was being made, naturally, I was skeptical. I went into the theater with with very high expectations, and much to my shock, I was very disappointed. There is a ""professional"" critic, I don't want to say his name and call him out. Although, some of you may know who he is. But, in his review, he said that this ""film"" is, and I quote: ""the best movie sequel since 'The Godfather Part II' (1974)"". That was back before I lost trust in ""professional"" critics. When he said that, I was really excited to see it. Can you fathom the anger in me to see such a piece of garbage movie at the end of the day? I don't know what this critic was smoking, but he better stop. It's affecting his brain! What's left of it..... That just goes to show that you can't trust ""professional"" critics. They're afraid to be honest! Any way, back to my review of this ""movie"". It has a dull and cliched story, subpar acting, and a generic, boring and predictable soundtrack. The story is all over the place, and it sounds like the script was written at the last second. For a ""film"" just less than two hours long, it dragged on forever! I honestly felt like I was watching it for days. The acting is a joke, for the most part. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool couldn't even save this ""movie"", and he's perfect for the character! He just stuck to his roots from the first one, and mirrored that performance. Now, don't get me wrong, if you find a formula that works, you can stick with it. However, if it's only good the first time it's used, and you do it again, then it's just simply formulaic. Nothing fresh about it! Josh Brolin was decent as the main villain, Cable. To be honest, he was the only interesting character in this ""film""! There is one thing I don't understand though, how did they convince him to play this role, while he was also playing Thanos in the Avengers films? Talk about confusing! Right? As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are just dull and boring. They all give lackluster performances! Finally, the soundtrack is generic and predictable. Just the same old superhero adventure music we've heard for years. Come up with something fresh, music composers! there are surprisingly two good elements here in this ""movie"", are the sets/locations and the special effects. The sets/locations are nice, and do give the ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. As for the special effects, they are all perfect. Being a ""movie"" made in 2018, that doesn't surprise me. ""Deadpool 2"" is one of the most disappointing sequels I've ever seen. It's a shame, because I really was looking forward to this being a good film. But, unfortunately, it left me asking: ""why did they bother if they weren't even going to try?"" I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. Do yourselves a favor and skip this train wreck. Trust me, I'm sparing you two hours of your life! Just watch the first movie instead."

","DEADPOOL 2 is the sequel to the surprisingly funny superhero spoof starring Ryan Reynolds. Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed. The X-Men parallels are fun and the plot keeps you guessing, with a string of quirky supporting characters proving a match for our hero. Hardly a ground-breaking movie, but it does entertain and that's what matters."

"robobobotic","3","0","3","1 December 2019"," Breaking the 4th wall about lazy writing, while still including lazy writing
","This is without a doubt a lost potential. I feel as though if this movie was made in a different time with the same technology, It would in reality deserve the rating which it has. However in this reality - It doesn't. In fact It's a fun but unfunny mess filled with unnecessary social justice self-critique, while still filled with social justice elements like multiculturalism, girl with a short hair which is a lesbian for the sake of being a lesbian and a strong independent woman who just happens that she survives the parachute fall of the X-Force just because it happens that her super power is that. A talentless actor fat kid who stutters and mispronounces, is the main plot of show, but who somehow makes Deadpool want to save him for no apparent reason, while being an anti-hero who for the most part, who doesn't give a crap about anyone except his wife who died. Does Deadpool cared about the people who killed his wife? About their families and kids? Yet he wants to save the fat kid with generic powers, who kills Cable's wife and daughter in the future. And for what reason? Simply to show he helps kids who are discriminated. Good job guys. It's not like this message hasn't been shoved in our face hundreds to thousands of times already.
Not only that, but despite the plot being so ironically lazy, that doesn't excuse it for being lazy.
""That's just lazy writing"" - says Deadpool, by breaking the 4th wall when Cable explains why he couldn't have gotten further in the past to save his wife and daughter.
Yeah Reynolds, we get it. How is that going to change the fact that It's lazy writing?<br/><br/>Now I know humor is subjective, but this was just filled with jokes that are outdated and cringey."

And the whole adopted family theme, really. It was so hypocritical to talk about family when the movie destroyed the families at hand just to give make us believe that some dysfunctional people make a family, as if this ever happens in real life.

","There is one thing about a Deadpool movie, the story leaves no doubts once the movie is over. Like, ""so what happened to this or that?, what happens next etc?"". There is no confusion in the air. It's just simple action and comedy. But I gotta say, it's not as interesting as the first one. Much crowd was laughing over scenes that weren't funny at all. Maybe because they thought, ""hey, we are watching a Deadpool movie, it's funny by default"". Story needed much fine tuning. Josh Brolin is a much better Thanos than Cable.

The action scenes safe Deadpool 2 from being a crappy film so that's always great I think. I also have to say that the post credit scene is so hilariously goofy that I just couldn't stop laughing so that's always a plus.

","Warning: Be Advised Deadpool 2 is really sweet!<br/><br/>#Deadpool - super badass, super cool, super sweet, super beloved, super well played by Ryan! Reynolds is the epitome of Deadpool, as a matter of fact, he is Deadpool. Just like Michael Keaton is Batman. And Val Kilmer. Deadpool is the best superhero ever I love everything about him. He regenerates. He'd throw down in fisticuffs in a heartbeat to save your back. And he's deadly accurate, funny, and highly skilled with weapons as well as pretty dang quick! I love how he's good at heart yet lethal and now apart of the X-Force super mutant team forever! Deadpool is up there with the best, most powerful mutants always has been always will be! Kinda like Wolverine! They both heal and fight in close quarters combat with blades and knives and are always getting the living hell beat out of them! But Deadpool's way cooler than Wolverine is! Logan's a lameoid assclown! There I said it. I wouldn't say this to Wolverine's face but I don't care for his beard much. I love Deadpool.<br/><br/>#Domino - One of the coolest, most badass, strongest, most likeable mutants in all the X-Men universe and extended Marvel world, always has been always will be. I love Domino! Domino's excellent in D2! She sure knows how to stay out of harm's way! Zazie Beetz is the best Domino ever! Well, considering she's the only Domino ever! She really is so cool! I love Zazie Beetz! Domino, turns out, is more than just lucky, the girl's got mad skills!<br/><br/>#Colossus - Always metal, all the time, he's never not metal, I love it. I love metal Colossus. I wish always metal all the time Colossus would show up in every X-Men movie plus Marvel movie too considering he loves his metal form so much he just never transforms back into human form so who cares! Who needs to pay actors just hire metal Colossus he'll do it, he's so strong!<br/><br/>#Cable - Real good, real strong, real nice though not very true to the original Cable who's a weapon specialist and super marksman, like Deadpool, with an ability to connect to and use advanced technology with his cybernetic arm plus he's very durable. Cable is way stronger than Deadpool is really but whatever. He DOES travel through time and Josh Brolin is NOT the worst Cable. I love Josh Brolin! Cable's awesome in this movie!<br/><br/>#Negasonic Teenage Warhead - Most underrated mutant ever! She generates an atomic blast ray that she can project or something like that plus she can do like way more! I love Teenage Warhead! I love Brianna Hildebrand!<br/><br/>#Firefist - Not cool, never heard of him. He shoots fireballs from his fists! Good villain though he's got a mad temper!<br/><br/>#Juggernaut - Spoiler, Juggernaut's in D2, I don't know if Juggernaut can rip Deadpool in half or not he is really strong and everything but his main power's like building momentum and bull rushing people charging through walls and being indestructible and stuff and even though he couldn't rip Deadpool in half like that like Deadpool's a marshmallow or cotton or whatever I still love it! This is the Juggernaut done right! Unlike Last Stand!<br/><br/>#Bedlem - Nice, he can make people feel nauseous! I love Terry Crews!<br/><br/>#Zeitgeist - Cool, that's Pennywise. From It! He spits poison.<br/><br/>#The Vanisher - Easily Brad Pitt's most relevant performance edging out Seven, Seven Years in Tibet, Twelve Monkeys, Ocean's Thirteen and Ocean's Eleven, whoa, if you don't include Fight Club, all of Brad Pitt's best movies have numbers in them! Astonishing!<br/><br/>#Shatterstar - The best!<br/><br/>The action in Deadpool 2 is great I love it! Conceptually speaking, Ryan Reynolds has the Midas touch. I want more X-Force!"

","This was great. In fact, I liked this more than the first one. Deadpool 2 , since it doesn't have to do the whole origin story thing, can focus more on action and, most importantly, characters. That's actually something that makes this film different than it's predecessor: it focuses more on the characters, their struggles, motivations, and arcs. This makes it more than just another action movie.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds has continued to prove that he was destined for this role. He absolutely nails it again, but this time, showing more of the merc's emotional side, and allowing him to take a break from making one-liners and have some actual character development. And my, there's a lot of that here.<br/><br/>There are lots of new characters here. My favorite of them has to be Cable, played by the always intimidating Josh Brolin. His character comes in almost out of nowhere and instantly declares himself to be a badass on a mission. And despite the advertising and the first third of the film, he actually isn't the main antagonist. That doesn't mean we don't get cool fight scenes of him against Deadpool. Thank goodness for those. If he's going to be in the upcoming X-force movie, I'll be one happy camper.<br/><br/>Domino, the other new character, is a perfect middle ground between Deadpool's jokiness and cynicism, and Cable's stoicism and seriousness. The most surprising thing about this character is her 'schtick'. She is extremely lucky, meaning very improbably things always turn out in her favor. Props to the makers of this movie for putting in a useful and unique female character, and not a Black Widow clone. I would love to see her again in a future movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an R rated superhero movie that stars a trigger-happy Canadian, a grumpy dude with a robot arm, and a very lucky black woman, all the while dealing with themes of loss and family. If you told me this a few years ago, I would have laughed in your face.<br/><br/>We are here and now, ladies and gents."

","The first film did more than enough to make me look forward to the sequel, even if the film itself was not as good as the promotional work ahead of it. So it is again here, as very funny adverts and promos got me excited but at the same time meant that the film didn't quite deliver in the same way. To be fair, this is because it is a two-hour film, so not easy to do the same as a few minute spot or bit. This can be seen in a few bumps along the way of the film - plot points which need to be delivered but do take the film away from joking or doing action, which is really where it works best.<br/><br/>Outside of these bumps though, the film gets the mood right, with irreverent humor and solid action sequences. It is pretty polished and professional, which does take away from its attempts to appear to have rough edges, but it works nonetheless. The comedy is broad and knowing; mostly this is at a level which is amusing but it does periodically have plenty of good laughs or clever moments. Likewise the action sequences are rarely thrilling, but they do have enough about them to inject energy and plenty of noise.<br/><br/>All told, a pretty consistent and enjoyable film which steps up from the first film while still keeping what made it work."

","DEADPOOL 2 is a spoof of MARVEL comic book characters, directed with panache by David Leitch, rich in one-liners written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and surpirise! Ryan Reynolds! It is apparently based on the Marvel Comics character by the same name (Deadpool is a fictional antihero Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. He is known as the ""Merc with a Mouth"" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags). Even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious Marvel Comic films that flood the market (making billions of dollars), This film is funny, not only due to the comedic writing of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds, but also due to star Ryan Reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork. <br/><br/>Very briefly (because there isn't much story), After losing the love of his life, 4th wall-breaking mercenary Wade Wilson aka Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) must protect Russel (Julian Dennison) must assemble a team of mutants and protect Russel from Cable (Josh Brolin), a no-nonsense, dangerous cyborg from the future and Deadpool must learn the most important lesson of all, to be part of a family again.<br/><br/>Much of the success of this film is due to the cast - Ryan Reynolds of course, but also a fine role for Josh Brolin as Cable, T.J. Miller, the every glamorous Morena Baccarin (of Homeland fame), as Vanessa, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, Karan Soni, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, etc.<br/><br/>The film does go overboard in noisy destruction and massive killings and foul language, but hey, this is a Marvel Comics outing - so you expect something different?

"scottshak_111","Null","0","2","10 August 2018"," Belittles Cable, Humorous Nevertheless
","Everything you expect it to be! Deadpool 2 movie is high voltage humour, witty comebacks with excruciating gore. The only problem being, in achieving its Marvel-ous targets, it ends up condescending one of the most badass Marvel characters that was ever created by comics - Cable.
You put anything serious against Deadpool and he lances it with his humor sword. That's how it is! The reason why the Deadpool 2 movie feels unjust to the character even though Josh Brolin does Cable apt justice with his looks. All that seriousness that he had implanted in our heads with a ravishing performance as Thanos in Infinity Wars, unfortunately, ends up getting belittled here. It is disparaging to a hero we were looking forward to watching.
There's trouble brewing in its editing department too which speeds up the movie unnecessarily prancing towards an act. Then there is that impoverished CGI of Juggernaut which makes you question why didn't we go with an actual human being like we did in X2? Or at least upped it a bit so it looked more badass like Thanos or even Hulk for that to matter.
If you are fine with such apparent issues and wish to watch DP make fun of everybody, you will not be let down. He will make sure you have a blast. Humour is simply outrageous!
Plot of Deadpool 2 Movie (Spoilers)
To form its plot we find Deadpool failing to kill a mercenary who ends up shooting his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). The whole world loses its meaning for him as he is rendered without a purpose. DP wishes to not live in it. But unfortunately, he can't die! He tries it several times but it's like a curse that compels him to keep on surviving without her.
After being blown up to pieces, he visits Vanessa in the afterlife for a short time before he is brought back to life. He is rejoined by Colossus as he wakes up in the X-mansion. The only thing he has with him from her is a Skee-Ball token to remember her by.
Listen to the pain. It's both history teacher and fortune teller. Pain teaches us who we are, Wade. Sometimes it's so bad we feel like we are dying, but we can't really live until we die a little, can we?
Considering it as a part of his healing, he joins the X-men only to be summoned on his first mission that he ends up messing up. Meet Firefist a.k.a. Russell Collins (Julian Dennison) who is yet another mutant kid being tortured by science experiments. This time the torturer is a Headmaster (Eddie Marsan) of Mutant Reeducation Center. On realizing that the Headmaster has been abusing lil Rusty boy, Deadpool shoots one of their staff members.
Owing to his actions both Deadpool and Rusty are immediately apprehended and taken to a prison after being put on a collar that suppresses mutant powers.
With this collar on, my superpower is just unbridled cancer. Give me a bow and arrow and I am basically Hawkeye.
Cable
Incoming Cable! A cybernetic soldier from future travels back in time to kill Rusty up young before he ever becomes a killer, for an older version of Rusty had killed Cable's family in the future. Wade Wilson tries to save Rusty intervening and manages to. Rusty overhears Deadpool's claim that he doesn't care for him as Cable takes Vanessa's token.
You are so dark. Are you sure you are not from the DC universe?
Afterlife revisited, Wade comes across Vanessa who asks him to save Collins. All those conversations are more like Wade talking with his own subconsciousness, doing the right thing, finding himself a purpose and the will to go on.
In a world where teaming up is a primal necessity, Deadpool decides to form his own team.
You know what we need to do? We need to build a team. We need 'em tough, morally flexible, and young enough so they can carry this franchise 10-12 years.
Thus X-Force is created with a team of unusual superheroes. The big joke lies in the fact that nobody makes it except Domino.
 Zip it, Thanos!
As DP and Domino try to save the kid from Cable's wrath, little did they know that Rusty had already teamed up with *drum rolls* the Juggernaut. He literally splits Deadpool in half as Rusty takes him with him to get revenge on the Headmaster.
Yet Another Team
Growing his legs and chilling at his house, Deadpool is visited by Cable who explains his situation to him, that he wishes to kill Rusty before his first murder. DP volunteers for a chance to be able to stop him from going to the dark side before murdering a poor confused child.
Cable: I use a device to slide through time. The longer I travel, the harder it is to control. I got two charges: One to get me here, one to get me home.
Deadpool: Well, that's just lazy writing!
Back at the orphanage the team goes to war with the Juggernaut, as Rusty closes in on the Headmaster. Before Cable is about to kill Rusty, Deadpool takes the shot instead, wearing the collar that takes all his mutant powers away"

"siderite","7","0","1","9 August 2018"," The slow death of R
","Deadpool 2 is fun. Ryan Reynolds is fun. There are jokes aplenty. There is a lot of nice CGI, too. What the movie lacked was a story. I mean, stuff happens, but not for any particular reason other than comic relief. Yet you have to have something to be relieved from, first. And it's not like the ideas didn't have potential: a hero losing his will to live, a bunch of other superheros from which Domino has the superpower of luck, the origin story of a hero or a supervillain, depending on the choices of the characters in the movie, time travel, Cable, Juggernaut... Yukio? Anyway, none of these ideas get developed after a quick exposition. Domino is pretty cool, but her superpower is just ... too super. Cable was cool, but as a character he is pretty much, just like Juggernaut, another version of the straight face man, just another Colossus.<br/><br/>And yes, Brad Pitt is the Vanisher and Matt Damon is a redneck and there are probably other cameos of note, and yes, there are a lot of sex jokes and foul mouthed dialogue, but the violence is now more subdued, with less blood, less gore, less pain, less impact. There is no substitute for the sex scene with Morena Baccarin from the first movie and the only nudity that counts is probably Jugernaut's ass. So while the movie starts with swearing at Wolverine for doing a hard R Logan, the rest of the film is mild. Rather than a competition for Logan, Deadpool 2 is more a counterpart for Tucker and Dale vs Evil.<br/><br/>Bottom line: mindless fun. I kind of liked the first one better because there was a better story and way better characterization."

","The first Deadpool was great. It was not the first superhero film rated R, despite what people claimed, but it was a breath of fresh air nonetheless. It was foulmouthed, uncompromising, gory beyond belief and aimed purely at adults. Immature adults, admittedly, but still adults.<br/><br/>So, does the sequel hold up? Well, yes and no. It has several good things going for it, but at the same time it feels a lot safer, a lot more meticulous, a lot less pure in its approach.<br/><br/>The good things first. Ryan Reynolds is still living his dream with this character and it shows. Deadpool might not be as unleashed as he was in the first film, but he's still a blast to be around and a constant source of laughs. In fact, the cast in general is very good in my opinion. Josh Brolin as Cable, especially. Intimidating, scary and a total badass, yet fitting in perfectly with the rest of the characters, who for the most part are more about quips and body part jokes.<br/><br/>Though I will say that the movie did not have enough Domino (Zazie Beetz) in it. Huge missed opportunity. Hopefully she will return in the next film.<br/><br/>The action scenes were also good, although lacking that flair seen in the original. The humour worked, the dialogues were fun and the plot was not bad.<br/><br/>And yet it is the plot, or rather the story, that's the biggest problem. Mainly the fact that there's too much of it. And that's not usually something to complain about. But let's be honest here. We go into a Deadpool movie for the gore, for the fourth-wall breaking, for the adult humour, for the utter disregard for cinema conventions. And this thing has all of those, but nowhere near as much as the original. Instead it actually tries to make us care, to get emotionally invested. It succeeds, funnily enough, but it's still questionable that it even tried in the first place.<br/><br/>So, is the film worth a watch? Sure, if you liked the first one. This will give you your fix, no problems. And who knows, perhaps you'll even like the fact that the Merc with the Mouth makes you have the feels."

I think I just wasn't prepared for how raunchy it was... well that and it wasn't all that funny. Part two is definitely as raunchy, but <br/><br/>1.) It isn't as sex heavy. I didn't watch Deadpool for frequent sex scenes or sex references.
2.) It is funnier. They added some more visual humor which had me laughing-out-loud a lot more than the Ryan Reynolds' quips. 
3.) It has better action. By adding some other super powered characters we go to see some better action. 
4.) The story is so much better. Deadpool finds himself having to be selfless to save someone and it's not the bland save-the-girlfriend bit.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this movie and I like the direction Deadpool is moving. It is trending upward."

","For anybody that doesn't know Deadpool 2 is the sequel to the successful first film released a couple of years ago. Ryan Reynolds returns to the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool in a role that seems made for him.<br/><br/>As with the first film the plot plays a secondary role to the set piece comedy one liners. Fans of the X-men franchise will be pleased to see a bunch of characters who they will know. In some ways the movie reminds me of the Austin Powers movies in terms of the unrelenting movie references and comedy. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie it will not live very long in the memory. Any fans of the first film are sure to love it."

","Deadpool is back and teams up with Cable and a few X-Men, in order to stop a young mutant who becomes a threat in the future. While doing so, the movie provides us with various cameos and jokes.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 is a funny movie with more jokes than you ask for and they keep coming, but it lacks the witty charm of part 1. Reynolds is always fun and the timing is near perfect. Unfortunately it's also too much and over the top, which makes the movie less coherent and feel more like a collection of clips, with characters that are downgraded to glorified cameos. Except for Cable, who brings a welcome seriousness and has good chemistry with Reynolds.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean DP2 is not enjoyable. Although it lacks the charm and surprise element of part 1, we went in with the right expectations and some beers and we had a great evening full of laughs.

Its a good movie but the jokes get sort of boring after a time. 
Some of them seem forced. <br/><br/>There is no strong story-line. Both Ryan Reynolds and Josh Brolin nail their roles ... but there's just no meat in the story-line (which is too narrow with nothing big really happening except a kid who'll possibly become a whacko in the future being hunted down).<br/><br/>The two post credit scenes are giggle-worthy."

","Deadpool 2 was an enjoyable experience at the movies. <br/><br/>It could be fun to watch but cannot be regarded as a great film. The overall humour, story and action scenes worked well. Cable was a great villain. There were some funny moments that were crazy enough to be pulled off. Often I felt there just too many jokes being thrown at you so it was hard to fully get what each scene/character was saying. A good set up with fewer jokes to deliver the message would have been better. In this way Deadpool tried too hard to be funny and it was a bit hit and miss. <br/><br/>This was better than the first film and served the purpose for why people go to the movies to enjoy the film experience<br/><br/>7/10"

","Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, this time he also shares a screenwriting credit and yet again he does a brilliant job. Stealing every scene he's in Reynolds really carries the film with his quips, constant forth wall breaking and snarling sense of humour. Like the first film, he commentates throughout to great effect. It's really hard to imagine anyone else in the role as he completely nails it. Josh Brolin plays Cable, a half mutant/half robot who comes from the future - fully equipped with gadgets and one liners. Brolin like everyone else is clearly having a good time. He is overly serious with some great nods to the Terminator films. Child actor Julian Dennison from Hunt From the Wilderpeople plays foul mouthed Russell who shoots fire from his hands. He has a messed up backstory that gives him some much needed depth. He's basically the John Connor of the film as he is chased down by Cable throughout. <br/><br/>The opening credits are a brilliant throw back to the Bond series accompanied by a Celine Dion song. There is a team recruitment scene similar to the X-Men films which goes horribly (yet hilariously) wrong. Also the constant jokes about last years Logan will have you bursting out laughing. The list is endless and its jam packed with so much of everything. It even makes room for some interesting narrative changing and on top of that has some emotional heft. All of the original characters return from Colossus, taxi driver Dopinder, Weasel and Negasonic Teenage War Head. Initially they don't get much to do, but they turn up again for the extremely over the top climax. With an already bloated cast there was no need to introduce Domino or Yukio as like the others, never really get much to do. <br/><br/>John Wick and Atomic Blonde director David Leitch does a fine job making the action scenes very stylised and brutal. He also handles the comedy well too, the many gags and references mostly hit the mark. They poke fun at near enough every comic film of the last decade including themselves. The film is so self aware of its flaws and imperfections that it would be stupid to over analyse it. Deadpool 2 does what any great sequel does, it builds upon the first film and results in being much better. 20th Century Fox may be going downhill with the X-Men franchise but they have struck gold with the Deadpool series. Deadpool 2 is a forth wall breaking exciting thrill ride best seen on the biggest loudest screen."

","I really enjoyed the first Deadpool flick and gave it an 8/10 after two viewings of it. The action was great and the tongue in cheek humor really helped to make it stand out. I have always been fascinated with metafiction and its application in comics and had been writing one myself so when Deadpool came out I was hooked on that style of humor. Alan Moore also toyed with the meta in a lot of his work (Watchmen, Promethea, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). The style just fit.<br/><br/>What I'm about to say is really contradictory... but Deadpool 2 relies too much on the style of the first and it's strengths to hook me in enough to care. Cool visuals, great action/gore and hilarious yet cheap metafictional pops aside, this sequel is far from perfect in many ways.<br/><br/>Spoilers from here on out -- if you haven't seen it jump to the end of this review to see the final score.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Ryan Reynolds snark is on point when it needs to be, but any attempt at seriousness (the death of Vanessa - DP's girlfriend) falls flat. The X-force (Deadpools team of discount-store mutants) felt rushed together and the characters like Cable and Domino (no relation to the kick-ass Keira Knightly flick from 2005) had little to no backstory presented. It felt pretty obvious that a Cable or X-force movie may be in the works, and that's the biggest takeaway of importance I left the theatre with. While an X-Force movie has been cited as ""in the works"", the cast is still up the air as half of the team didn't make it out of Deadpool 2 alive.<br/><br/>Cable never felt like a threat due to his short and lackluster introduction and backstory, I'm not sure if Yukio ever showcased her abilities (turns out she did, and it was so fast I missed it in my first viewing), and the casting of Terry Crews and cameo of Ben Affleck (as well as the short-lived feature of Shatterstar) felt like such a waste. I grew to appreciate Domino's ""luck"" ability by the end and appreciated the cinematography used in the scenes where we saw her power at work. Russell ""Firefist"" was also one of the shining parts of the film, as Julian Denison (Hunt For the Wilderpeople) did a great job portraying the hurt and angst his character endured at the hands of those who tortured him.<br/><br/>While the two new characters of Domino and Firefist hit their strides, the rest of the supporting characters fell flat with a lack of direction. The action was great, but the writing was not there to get me to actually care about the characters or what may happen in the next film. I'm hoping Deadpool 3 or X-Force can put some actual emotional connection and appeal into Wade Wilson again, as the Merc with a mouth has great cinematic potential still to be tapped and there is still time to right the ship. This can be so much more than a cheap-superhero cash in...<br/><br/>
TLDR: Action, fun, and laughs are here. Substance, a story with consequences, characters you actually care about? Not so much. Maybe I was expecting more because my last superhero experience was the impeccable Black Panther, but Deadpool 2 didn't quite get the job done for me.

","The world's most famous-or infamous-foulmouthed mercenary returns for this inevitable sequel to the subversive hit. Wade Wilson has spent the past few years successfully ""cleaning up"" the world from really bad guys, but his greatest challenge lies ahead when he finds himself becoming the unofficial protector of a young mutant boy with an unusual gift. Realizing the full extent of the danger that awaits him, Wilson attempts to rally a team to his cause. Flip, amusing, and well-cast with an assortment of colorful new characters (especially Brolin who takes no prisoners as the nomadic Cable), this is a pretty good second helping for fans of the original, but with the exception of some clever in-jokes aimed squarely at lead actor Reynolds, it's never as shocking or as hilariously self-referential as the first one, though dedicated fans will likely overlook any shortcomings. **"

This Deadpool 2 sequel did just that! Tim Miller did such a great job of directing the first one, the 2nd Deadpool which was NOT directed by him, once again received mixed reviews. There is a saying that goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! But the producers and Ryan Reynolds did not take heed to this saying, and we end up having a movie that lost Tim Millers magic touch! Most of the jokes fell flat, action was all over the place and most of action did not excite me because the story was weak this time around, and Deadpool to me, became more annoying than cool. I was however happy to see Cable come to life as he was one of my favorite comic book characters when I was a kid. But that was it. Domino was disappointing and so was Juggernaut.

The plot seemed mostly like an excuse for fun music, cool action sequences, and a ton of sarcasm. I knew that going in, so no complaints. But this formula is gonna run out of steam fairly soon.

","Deadpool 2 was widely expected and audiences had high expectations regarding the movie, especially since Deadpool was such a blast. I understand all the hype and cult following of Reynolds' over the top crazy and adorable persona, but a movie should be much more than one character thrown into several different situations... Unfortunately, Deadpool 2 was exactly that - several (extremely) funny combined sequences that do not even slightly resemble a functional movie.<br/><br/>So, braking this lunacy (in lack of a better word) into several segments seems like the only logical way to review this movie since the movie itself has no logical structure whatsoever. <br/><br/>The acting is, by all means, top notch! Reynolds was born to play Deadpool, Brolin created a formidable foe (considering the amount of time he had), Beetz was superb etc. Since the movie itself is structured around characters and their personalities, it is not a surprise they all did a magnificent job. But, that also carries a problem. There is an overabundance of characters that have absolutely no place in this movie. The entire X-force sequence feels like it was a leftover from one of the rewrites. The way it dispenses the characters of the X-force is hilarious, but shows that the screenwriters had no actual idea what to do with all of them. A shame, especially since the whole concept is a generally good idea (can you imagine a team led by Deadpool?). On the other hand, giving Brolin, an actor of the highest caliber (the almighty Thanos) several lines and just a few sequences is a waste of acting. Simply no one believed him to be THAT threatening and mean. Unfortunately, the main villain is underwritten, underused and created a hole in the movie where the bad guy should have stood. Using someone as Dennison to fill that role was a good idea, but he just couldn't perform in the way needed to fill that big of a hole. So, even though the movie doesn't care (at all about anything), the general lack of care at this specific instant created a flaw that was just unnecessary. All in all, regarding the story and characters - NO coherent story, underwritten and underused overabundance of character, and a screw you attitude about it all. Risky, didn't pay of, created flaws.<br/><br/>Considering the movies upside - the humor. Even though the movie brings you to tears with laughter, at certain points it feels recycled. There are several instances that killed the joke and/or pun simply because it was already seen in Deadpool. Making it more gory or more explicit or violent is just not doing the joke much good if it feels already seen. In its defense, there are not a lot of these segments, but they are EXTREMELY noticeable. <br/><br/>The music was generic not even interesting. Bland and forgettable. Nothing special with a recycled Deadpool rap song.<br/><br/>The editing was done as best as it could have been done. Considering the lack of a coherent story or narrative line to hold onto (even though Leitch does quite a good job handling the chaotic narrative) it's a miracle that a coherent movie was even produced. So, congratulations on that.<br/><br/>The thing we all must confess is that Deadpool timed it's release PERFECTLY. We are all still in shock and awe with the monumental Infinity war and its sorrow and dark filled ending, so Deadpool simply had a job to make us laugh. It succeeded in that with triumph. But, understanding it had only one job, it left almost every other aspect to wonder on its own, and that may have been a mistake.<br/><br/>A decent sequel with a bunch of laughs but... all in all, we really expected more. Not a movie..."

A crowded cast of secondary characters pop up, but it is on Deadpool that this vehicle depends. And he delivers.<br/><br/>Not as great as the original, but then what could be? #2 is still irresistible eye candy for Marvel fans, and casual thrill seekers in search of something fresh. <br/><br/>This is not grand movie making, various plot lines exist solely for the punch lines, but who can complain when they are this good?

","In the years Ryan Reynolds spent trying to persuade 20th Century Fox to greenlight a Deadpool movie since the abomination that was the character's first big-screen appearance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009, nobody quite expected the reception it would eventually receive once the 'Merc with a Mouth' was finally unleashed onto unsuspecting audiences. Least of all Fox executives, who only gave it the go-ahead when footage was leaked onto the internet and fans went crazy. When 2016's Deadpool raked in over $700 million and became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, the suits were soon rubbing their hands together and dreaming up a sequel. Creative differences led to original director Tim Miller departing, and in stepped John Wick co-director David Leitch, with Reynolds also receiving a writing credit for the follow-up.<br/><br/>After a marketing campaign that was even more meta than before and teases of comic-book favourites gracing the big-screen for the first time, Deadpool 2 arrives with high expectations, not only to deliver on the comedy side, but to further subvert a genre that now seems to dominate the big release dates each year, with Marvel alone delivering three features a year. So does the sequel improve on the first? Not really. Although Deadpool 2 increases the violence, cursing and fourth-wall breaks, there's a slight whiff of corporate tampering to the final product. The Merc's first solo outfit loosely hung itself around the faintest of plots, with time jumps switching between Wade Wilson's journey from simple mercenary to cancer-ridden super anti-hero, and his quest for revenge against the man who took pleasure in torturing him over a lengthy period of time. The low-budget, guerrilla-esque approach was all part of its charm, and the role fit Reynolds' smirking sense of humour like a glove.<br/><br/>Deadpool 2 received a much higher budget and allowed for even more creative freedom for the writers, but in doing so has lost some of what made the original so refreshing and punkish. The story involves time-travelling cyborg Cable (John Brolin), who journeys back to our time to assassinate a young mutant (played by Julian Dennison) before he can grow up to become the monster responsible for murdering his family. Deadpool, who is still being courted by the X-Men and recovering from his own personal tragedy, takes it upon himself to protect the boy, who he feels can be saved and turned away from his fate. Along with old pals Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), Weasel (T.J. Miller) and Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), Deadpool puts together a team he dubs 'X-Force' to help him take down such a formidable foe. Can our hero overcome this seemingly unstoppable man-machine with a gun whose power turns all the way up to 11? And more importantly, is dubstep still a thing in the future?<br/><br/>There is far more story to sink your teeth into this time around, and there are unexpected emotional beats for a character who is essentially a pop culture joke machine. But as it goes with most sequels, bigger rarely means better, and Deadpool 2 ends up becoming the type of film it's supposed to be making fun of. There is plenty of action but there is a weightlessness to it, which wouldn't be a problem if the director wasn't at least half responsible for the crunching physicality of John Wick. That said, Reynolds and fellow writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick keep the laughs coming thick and fast, whether it be Reynolds' wink-winking at the camera or the gross-out physical comedy, with Brolin proving to be the perfect straight-man to Reynolds' blabbermouth. One particularly memorable scene had me crying, despite it ultimately being a rip-off of another movie I won't mention for fear of spoilers. Movie-goers may be divided but comic enthusiasts will appreciate the service they receive, with countless Easter Eggs and in-jokes to spot, as well as the inclusion of the likes of Shatterstar (Lewis Tan), a rather goofy hero that nobody ever believed would make it onto the big screen. Reynolds can rest on his nest egg for at least another film."
"jdesando","Null","0","1","26 May 2018"," It's irreverant and fun just like the original.
","""You're so dark. Are you sure you're not from the DC universe?"" Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds)<br/><br/>Deadpool 2, another Marvel marvel, has no problem referring to its rival DC universe, taking self-referential quipping to the referential and making a pretty good joke at the same time. Typically, Reynolds, as Deadpool/Wade and one of the writers, is foul-mouthed, irreverent, and downright rude, or exactly the opposite of the socially-upright superheroes we've grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>
That's the point. To satirize the super-hero convention is what Deadpool 2 and its original do, and they do it well. No trope is safe: from proper, laconic speech to selfless heroism; all are fodder for the foul. As X-Men trainee, Deadpool still has to prove himself worthy of a spot like Wolverine's, a rival about whom Deadpool is obsessed.<br/><br/>Saving a young boy (Julian Dennison), who has revenge on his mind because of abuse in an orphanage, from becoming a murderer like the rest of the ""X Force,"" Deadpool gets involved with hunter-from-the future Cable (Josh Brolin, in his second badass Marvel character this year-the other being Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War). These two rival the humorous connections in Butch Cassidy and Die Hard and countless ""buddy"" films.<br/><br/>Deadpool is not all explosions and wisecracks, for topics such as racism and sexism crop up without hitting the audience heavily. Perhaps the most prevalent motif is the need for family, by now a staple of super-hero flicks, along with the need for love.<br/><br/>Clean as that sounds, this is not a family film any more than Bad Santa. Yet, for adults it's a needed antidote to the dark DC universe and a comic upgrade from regular family-friendly summer sci-fi adventures. Funny and self-referential it is:<br/><br/> ""You know what we need to do? We need to build a f*****g team. We need 'em tough, morally flexible, and young enough so they can carry this franchise 10-12 years."" Deadpool"

","Deadpool Has a Soft Side
I'm a huge fan of the first Deadpool and thought the hilarity of it could not be topped. Deadpool 2 came close. I was also glad to see that Deadpool had a soft side we saw a glimpse of in the first movie but full fledged in the second film.<br/><br/>The Plot
Deadpool hunts down bad guys as usual but screws up a little by missing his chance to kill one he's been hunting down. The bad guys follow him back home to where his girlfriend, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is and ends up shooting her in the heart before Deadpool could save her.<br/><br/>Distraught, Deadpool nearly kills himself after killing his girlfriend's killer. He turns the gas on in his apartment then lies on a bunch of barrels of gas igniting it with his lit cigarette blowing up his whole body. It doesn't work. Colossus ends up bringing all of Deadpool's body parts to Xavier's School where he tries yet again to convince him to join the X-Men.<br/><br/>It seems like Deadpool has a change of heart. After his girlfriend got murdered he feels like he needs to set his life on a different path. He puts effort into trying to be an X-Men but just doesn't really fit in. Nonetheless Colossus takes Deadpool along with Negasonic and her lesbian girlfriend Yukio on a training mission.<br/><br/>This is when we meet Russell (AKA Firefist), a troubled teen who has the ability to incinerate anyone with fire that comes out of his fists who happens to be the target of a cyborg called Cable (Josh Brolin, Thanos haha) from the future sent back in time to kill Russell before the kid can do any damage. Sound familiar? Like Terminator? Only in the slightest.<br/><br/>Cable has his reasons but Deadpool will do anything in his power to keep this kid safe from Cable. It's part of his new found path. He feels he owes it to his girlfriend. Somehow he sees the good in Russell. <br/><br/>The question is how will Deadpool reach this kid's heart?<br/><br/>Three Other Aspects 
1. In my opinion the humor was a bit forced. It just did not have the same gut-hurt-laughing-moments as the first film. There wasn't anything new there. <br/><br/>The best line, however, was when Deadpool called Cable Thanos! That got me going.<br/><br/>2. The X-Force was introduced then most of the members were killed off (Brad Pitt cameo) with exception for brilliantly played Domino (Zazie Beetz). I felt like introducing these characters was useless, a bit funny in the way they died, but nonetheless useless. Unless they're bringing them back for the third movie?<br/><br/>3. I loved the fact that Juggernaut (Also played by Ryan Reynolds!) made a pretty big showing in this movie. Him and Colossus have the best showdown of the film!<br/><br/>As a kid, I loved watching the X-Men cartoon. Juggernaut happens to be one of my favorite villains in the X-Men universe so it was awesome for me to see him in action.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts 
The only reason why I knocked the score of Deadpool 2 down to three and a half stars is its lack in original humor. I was grateful to see Deadpool grow as a character with actual heart. He set aside his selfishness and did what he thought was right. Deadpool's heart is the heart of this movie.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and hope you enjoyed the movie as much if not more than I did."
"matthewssilverhammer","6","0","3","25 May 2018"," Better in some ways, but ultimately more of the same.
","Deadpool 2 is basically what you expect. Gleefully bloody scifi action. Incessant jokes about other superhero franchises. Reynolds inspired turn as the ""Merc with a Mouth"". Hilarious credit scenes on both ends that nearly outshine everything else in the film. It's not necessarily worse than the original film; in fact, in some ways it may be a bit better, funnier and weirder. However, the sheer lack of sufficient originality makes it taste more like a microwaved chimichanga than a fresh one.
In this X-Men spinoff, wisecracking Wade Wilson befriends a young, troubled mutant who finds himself being hunted by time-traveling villain Cable. Anybody familiar with time-traveling fiction, or have taken a theoretical ethics course, won't be terribly surprised by any of the later reveals or moral complexities. The film's real strength is in it's less ""important"" features. Clearly working to connect it more directly with the larger X-Men universe, the side characters are given ampler screen-time, including super-cool newcomer Domino, who's mutant-ability of ""just being lucky"", makes her the most powerful hero since of Superman. Director Leitch (John Wick) uses his flair for shooting action to solid comedic effect, including a standout parachuting scene that had me in stitches.
But, of course, the star is still Reynolds' Deadpool, who's most interesting power is probably his unique ability to see himself as a fictional character in a movie, constantly winking while everyone around him works in expected sincerity. But like I said, none of this is new anymore. Where the first felt like a subversive spin on the superhero genre, this is more like an Austin Powers' film: a pop-culture-citing-machine that's pleasantly diverting, but nothing to rave about."

I do not feel too bad as I got a free ticket to see it, but wish it could have been for another movie. <br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, I enjoy DP and how he was brought to the screen by Ryan and Co. But this episode fell really short of its mark. Unless its mark was to just ride the tails of the first movie. The hype did not meet the expectations put out there, and I for 1, and probably not the last, was bummed about the story."

","The Terminator, James Bond, Thanos, Batman, Wolverine - you can find so many legendary characters in Deadpool 2. The movie is a huge parody, I had good experience during these two hours. I didn't laugh that much, some of the jokes were very stupid, but there are several characters who saved the day. Domino, Peter and the Vanisher were the fresh and funniest new characters in the movie - I wanted to see more from the X-Force in Deadpool 2. In addition, I needed to see more from Colossus, whose connection to Deadpool is so special for both movies. I didn't like how Cable was introduced and he was just one of the many in the mix. The beginning was so slow and the plot didn't really need Cable. That's why I think Colossus could have been the second main character in a movie with a different villain. The soundtrack wasn't special and the effects weren't good enough. I think 6/10 is fair!"
"gcsman","7","0","1","22 May 2018"," All that you expected, and more besides
","Deadpool (2016) carved out a new sub-genre in superhero movies: satirical, post-modern, subversive, self-referential, and (incidentally) R-rated for over-the-top violence. And of course, style and flair to burn or else it wouldn't have worked. And of course neither Deadpool 1 or 2 would work without being able to build on a legacy of 'mainstream' superhero films; they would just be too bizarre to stand on their own. Both Deadpools are easier to follow if you already know a fair bit about the X-Men universe that they draw from. But even so the script plays fast and loose with a number of the characters including Cable, Yukio, Juggernaut, and Deadpool himself, none of whom exactly resemble their comic book sources or backstory. Nevertheless this feels like the role that Ryan Reynolds has been looking for his whole career -- a likable and talented guy who just hadn't had much luck before this.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, walks quite a tightrope between an actual serious storyline on one hand, and hyperviolent/satirical/absurdist comedy on the other, simultaneously taking itself seriously and just the opposite. Somehow this works, thanks to the smart, snappy dialog and constantly motoring action so that you never get a chance to stop and think -- you're just reacting to the next clever gag, setup, or action scene. Great thing about the human brain is that it can keep at least two contradictory viewpoints going at the same time, and this movie takes full advantage of that. One reviewer remarked that it's like Deadpool (the hero) exists both inside and outside the film at the same time.<br/><br/>Compared with the first Deadpool, this one takes everything further. The violence is so over-the-top that it's cartoonishly absurd -- think Quentin Tarantino but more so, and without the slow buildups. Wonderfully stylish: as an example, spectacular collisions happens, bodies fly in slo-mo, and all to the strains of an Enya song. It works. The first Deadpool routinely ""broke the fourth wall""; this one somehow manages to break the third, second, and first walls at times -- not sure how to put it but that's what it felt like. <br/><br/>And about the mid-credits scene sequence, which in some sense the whole movie acted as a setup for -- it's incredible and beyond absurd. How to describe it? surreal? solipsistic? words fail me but absolutely don't leave the theater before you see it.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles: too much use of Colossus and not enough of the perversely charming Teenage Warhead. They overused Deadpool's impossible-to-kill powers -- it was used only as necessary in #1 but here it kind of becomes a running joke. He's blown to bits (literally!), riddled with bullets, snapped in half, torn in half, and a bunch of other things almost as gruesome. And Cable wasn't developed enough despite a lot of screen time. But I really enjoyed Zazie Beetz as Domino, who clearly demonstrates that luck is indeed a superpower, but hand-to-hand combat expertise also gives it a boost.<br/><br/>I wonder what the inevitable Deadpool 3 will be like. Where can they go from here?"

","Deadpool 2 was another much awaited movie of 2018 and it fall a lot short of what the expectations really were. The movie lack a good story, good fiction and a real good cinematography as well. First drawback was it was released in a 2D version that is never acceptable for fans. Then, dialogues, comedy and punches were not that funny or hilarious like the first part.
The actions sequences were not that eye catching or jaw dropping like the prequel and disappoints very much. The movie went to a double standards oriented rather as compared to the first part. Deadpool was a big hit but it sequel was not that easy to digest."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","1","21 May 2018"," The Merc with a... heart?
","Plot; Mercenary Wade Wilson (AKA Deadpool) attempts to form a team to counter a threat that may not be exactly what it appears. <br/><br/>Like many, I went into the original Deadpool w/little to no history w/the character, but that was the least of the reasons the film felt fresh to me. In the often cookie cutter PG-13 world of the modern comic book movie, Deadpool was an R-rated action/comedy (emphasis on, well, both) that didn't pull any punches. Coming out in the vacuum that is February, it was a surprise smash hit, raking in big bucks and getting praise from audiences and critics alike. W/o that element of surprise, could a sequel equal or surpass the original? Kinda. Maybe. I'm not sure. <br/><br/>Sitting here in the afterglow, it's tough for me to say whether or not I feel DP2 is better than first film. I'm more confident in my feeling that it least matches the original, though it's not a beat for beat match. In some areas I think it nudges ahead. Others it lags a bit. But the sum totals are roughly the same. I think. Again, afterglow. The cast all do a nice job, w/newcomers Zazie Beets, Julian Dennison and Josh Brolin each bringing w/them a key to the film's success. The MVP is of course Ryan Reynolds, who once again holds court as the ""Merc w/a mouth"". <br/><br/>Humor aside--and the film has a lot of it--what helps DP2 really stick the landing is that beneath the off-color humor and graphic violence beats a heart. The central theme here is family, and it manages to weave that in w/o ever becoming maudlin. <br/><br/>I don't know that I'd call it a better film, but in terms of pure entertainment, I'd rank DP2 ahead of the Summer's other big comic book film, Infinity War."
"DirectorSam","4","0","3","21 May 2018"," Quick Deadpool 2 review
","Deadpool 2 is the sequel to the not very well known indie film Deadpool, and it's pretty much on the same level as the first. For every thing this movie does better, it also does something worse than the original. The action, story, and music are better. But the humor, editing, and overall impact was less. It's just more of the same. So if you like Deadpool, go see it."
"zzztigr","7","0","1","21 May 2018"," Some good laughs, story plays second bannana
","There is plenty of action in this movie, but the intent was the dialogue, and the actual story is almost wedged in at places as not to cut one zinger. The first Dead Pool found a much better balance between personality and action than this sequel. The plot is pretty simplistic and sort of reminds me of a simpler version of Looper. I thought James Brolin was really good as Cable, much more personality than Thanos. The real reason I only gave it 7 out of 10, is that the movie tries so hard to go over the top, it was in danger of jumping the shark. Even the opening credits are all about the comedy only. So if you liked Dead Pool, you'll like this movie, but leave the theater wondering how they could do a 3rd film without beginning to either start revamping the same jokes or becoming a parody of itself."
"prathikofficial","6","0","2","21 May 2018"," Wade Wilson, the not-so wise-as$, nut-cracking merc anymore
","There is one line in the movie that summarizes everything: <br/><br/>""Well, that's just lazy writing."" - Wade Wilson AKA The friendly, red-spandex-wearing, neighborhood mercenary.<br/><br/>There's a lot of expectations we, as audience members, would carry while walking into the theaters to watch this movie. For example, the first movie was a successful parody of the superhero origin movies, and it nailed that particular aspect beautifully. This feels like the painful sequels that FOX is generally known for. I have a feeling that Ryan knew what he was getting into with this movie, given the multiple quips about it being a ""family-movie"". For the majority of the run-time, we were treated to the equivalent of a Woody Allen movie explaining the innocence of Winnie the Pooh.<br/><br/>There are four characters in the entire movie (Deadpool, Domino, Cable and Russell). Everything else is just a glorified cameo, from Morena Baccarin as the Ghost of Girlfriend Dead to Alan Tudyk as a redneck.<br/><br/>We can't walk into this movie expecting it to have its characters make a ton of logical decisions, but what we can expect is to watch Deadpool mind-numbingly break the fourth wall. I agree that it is amazing and we all wish we were Deadpool (Radioactive Shar Pei bite included).<br/><br/>The one thing we would take away from this movie is that they basically invalidated the entire movie in the end. As a Doctor Who/Back To The Future/Flashpoint/Harry Potter(?) fan, I understand the issue with paradoxes. But, DP basically sticks where it shouldn't be by killing himself and himself (seriously, you have to watch the movie to get that). <br/><br/>If you're a comic-book reader (or lover), you will love the fact that they've finally done Juggernaut justice. It doesn't even sound like Ryan Reynolds. Cable and Domino were absolutely beautiful, and we need to see them in another movie and soon. Hopefully, by then, Wade would've seen the actual Star Wars (I wonder which version he did watch though). <br/><br/>I, for one, left the theater chuckling at the many, many easter eggs peppered throughout the movie, including the Logan death (oops, spoilers) theme and the clearly James Bond-inspired opening credits.<br/><br/>P.S. How long will it be before they write off the stereotypical, Indian taxi-driver? Come on, Ryan, that bit's evident. Maybe sit with Stan or Rob and come up with an Indian superhero (who doesn't s*ck)?"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","0","2","21 May 2018"," Feels kind of like a kids' film, despite its killing and cursing.
","Deadpool's musings that his second outing is a ""family film"" are closer to the truth than he might perhaps think, but not in the way he would hopefully expect. 'Deadpool 2 (2018)' is much closer to a kid's flick than anything remotely 'adult', never mind 'mature' or 'nuanced', and it never uses its 'R-rating' to tell a truly adult tale - that is, one that doesn't pander, talk down or constantly remind you it is aiming at those with an incredibly short attention span. Nor does it use its status to tell a joke that's ever anything other than a reference or a vulgarity that's aimed at the youngest in its limited crowd, whether that be of body or mind. The piece also tends to throw all semblance of canon or continuity into the wind for the sake of being 'funny and random'. This is all to say that the flaws in the humour break down to the fact that a torrid of references and curse-words can't class as comedy, neither should they be held as more important than a persistent world even if the fourth-wall is consistently considered a suggestion, especially when they lack any of the set-up or payoff typically associated with 'joke' construction. Yet, this picture repeatedly falls into this trap while hanging a lantern on its every flaw, including the blatant - and not so blatant - lazy-writing, which doesn't excuse the issues so much as shine more light on them. It also only subverts things in the most expected of ways and doesn't even have the balls to stick to its decisions. It never surprised me even in its most 'surprising' of moments, with heavy build-up heading in the most 'obvious' direction making the twists - either of plot or, more usually, individual scenes - incredibly easily to see coming. This telegraphing is understandable to an extent, as it is often meant to make the typically humorous reveals even more so, but it ultimately ruins the effect of the scenes and becomes grating after a while, essentially being a repeated gag - which this flick additionally has no shortage of. Those who know the character will expect everything he says and does, despite inconsistent characterisation, and those who don't won't understand most of the referential humour that this 'subversion' plays to anyway. The overall movie is very messy and unfocused, barely about anything until it suddenly is and, for all the hype surrounding its admittedly somewhat charismatic and 'cool' villain, it's still victim to the 'bad-guy problem'. All the best moments were in the trailer, for sure, including several alternate ad-libbed lines and a few set-pieces committed to montage in the final result, but there are moments where our central character, and those behind the scenes not related to anything visual, shut up and get out of their own way to allow for some decently enjoyable action sequences. It's when leaning into the anti-hero's anti-death abilities that the picture finds its purchase, with some inventively painful moments playing with a forced elasticity and a new level of bodily harm. Though some of these moments dip a little deep into the CG budget and, as mentioned, the most tangible are reduced to blink-and-you'll-miss-it montage segments, the clashes with Cable and a late second-act chase are rather thrilling. Domino's character is the best in the entire film, even if she is a walking contrivance by design, and I thought her performance was the most enjoyable as well. The finale becomes a little over-wrought, though, despite some entertaining moments, and the ending is an elongated sour note, to say the least. However, there are some nice moments buried beneath its outer layer and it isn't totally tone-deaf. On the whole, this piece is certainly not as good as its predecessor. Even that film doesn't have too much re-watch value, though it remains an enjoyable watch for what it is, so I can't imagine what this will be like on a second go. There are entertaining moments but much of the flick is kind of bland and most of it just isn't funny. The piece is basic, too, despite all the praise it is getting for being a subversive 'antidote'. It takes from other films and amalgamates them in an almost check-list fashion, in a similar way to Deadpool's own rattle-off references, and while it isn't anywhere near as bad as it could've been, it simply isn't anywhere near as good as it should've been, either. 6/10"

","I loved the trailers and got me going for the movie but alas I found myself getting a bit bored and not as engaged as I hoped I'd be. My girlfriend who loved the first one hated this, I could tell.
The cinema wasn't as laughing out load as I thought it would be not like Ragnarok or Infinity Wars. There was some moments that got a few chuckles and I liked some of the gags but most of it felt forced and we'd seen it all before especially the intro albeit more of a James Bond theme this time round.
The Indian taxi driver was just dead weight and really didn't want to see his part expanded, there was no need really.
Sorry but I didn't feel the same way as I did with the first film, totally blew me away, couldn't wait to see it again. Maybe I've been spoiled with Thor and Infinity war"

"alanaji","7","0","1","19 May 2018"," ""DEADPOOL 2""- My Review
","HE IS BACK!!! And this time he isn't alone. Back in 2016, we saw the rise of an anti - hero, Deadpool, who was foul mouthed but at the same time witty and adorable. So fortunately, the expectations for DP2 will be higher. So how's the film? Let's take a look. But before that the plot...
Wade Wilson a.k.a Deadpool is a now a well know mercenary. After the murder of his wife Vanessa, he decides to commit suicide, but is saved in time by Colossus, who in turn asks him to join the X - men. Meanwhile, DP takes the responsibility of protecting a mutant child, Russelles a.k.a Firefist from a time travelling soldier Cable. 
That's all I can tell u about the plot. 
The film is however slightly better than the first part. Anyway, that doesn't , mean that it's devoid of R rated violence . There r cuss words, body being teared apart, wire plugged into a#@ and so on.
Anyway this is the best superhero movie this year along with Infinity war. 
The technical parts of the film were all good. Be it the useage of the background score during action scenes or the visual effects, all were done neatly. Dialogues were witty and has a lot of references to the old and latest released films. Action scenes were slick and not overdone. Editing was good , but there was some dragging felt towards the climax.
Now to the performances. Ryan Reynolds just rocked as deadpool. His performance is sure to be appreciated. Josh Brolin as Cable was at par with Reynolds. Also the reference to his character, THANOS, was also funny. Another memorable performance was that of Zazie Beetz as Domino. Stefan Kapicic as Colossus had a small role but his scenes with DP are sure to bring in laugh out loud moments. Rest of the supporting cast were good.
So all in all, DP 2 is a treat this summer. Go in and have a BLAST.....
My rating- 3.5/5"

","DEADPOOL 2 REVIEW :
Have you seen Stand up comedy shows where rehearsed, intentional skits and performer do anything to make you laugh without caring about whether the jokes are relevant or not, without caring about logic but still manages to put a smile on your face, Deadpool 2 is that sort of film. I hate watching hollywood films in dubbed version but sometimes less appealing and adult films don't get enough showtimes so i had to adjust and compromise this time, and this film proved me right that why i hated watching dubbed versions. So many non-sense and irrelevant jokes, PJs and trolls does make you laugh but that makes Deadpool 2 to look a Stand up comedy skit more than a Film.
I have to add spoilers in the review because then only you will understand why i called it irrelevant and non-sense. Firstly, Deadpool's Girlfriend is killed and to see her again in soul's world he also tries to kill himself but then his girlfriend tells him to keep heart at the right place and DP decides to help a mutant boy from other mutant who has came from future. DP builds a team in 2 minutes and then entire crew is dead within next 2 minutes excluding DP and that Lucky woman. How foolish is this to attend all this team X force stuff just for 5 minutes screenplay? Film keeps going on with such non-sense jokes and fortunately succeeds to entertain, DP trolls everyone like DC Universe, Avengers, X Men to make you laugh especially in Hindi dubbed version when DP mouths Dangal, Bahubali, Partner PJs but after some time this looks so intentional and purposed stuff. How long can you bear it? And then predictable time spinning and over dramatic climax ends this entertaining ride in style and i felt like Deadpool 2 entertained but failed as a film.
Overall, Deadpool 2 is Good one time watch but doesn't have that simple flow which it's predecessor had. Everything looks so over dramatic, so over-laughable that it's completely foolish to call Deadpool 2 better or even as good as it's Prequel. Watch it once if possible but No repeat value at all. I give 6/10* which is less than Deadpool 7/10*"
