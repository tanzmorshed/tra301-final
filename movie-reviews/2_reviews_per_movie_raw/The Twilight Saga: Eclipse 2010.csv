"MR_Heraclius","6","40","43","20 February 2020"," Eclipse
","Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good."
"xenomorph_uk","2","441","605","15 July 2010"," The wife owes me big time!
","It took my wife nearly a week of constant begging to take her to see Eclipse. After having endured the first two movies and the subsequent years of self therapy to erase the memory, it took a lot of persuasion to guilt trip me into seeing this one as well.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I entered the movie theatre mentally preparing myself for two hours of torture. Frankly, Eclipse was just as bad as I had expected despite reassurances from female co-workers that ""It is much better than the last one... honest."" I've never read the books nor do I plan to. I know nothing of the author however, I'm guessing she started writing this stuff when she was a twelve year old girl with delusions of what love should be.<br/><br/>This entire movie is nothing more than a very poorly written romantic dilemma, wrapped in a weak premise of vampire and werewolves in an attempt to lure extra interest. So far as stories go this one has no vigour or power what-so-ever. Depth? I've stepped in deeper puddles.<br/><br/>Approximately 80% of this movie is dedicated to examining the lead female's conflicting emotions. Does she want the vampire or the werewolf? Does she understand the lifestyle choice that comes with that decision? Is she willing to accept the risks? Does she understand the impact it will have on those around her? And finally... does anyone at all actually care? Yup, for two whole hours. (Six if you include the first two).<br/><br/>So surely this movie has some redeeming features? Perhaps the acting? Wrong. Stewart's (Bella), emotions range from mildly irritated to slightly concerned whilst trying to maintain an air of vulnerability that irritates instead of earning sympathy. For Pattinson (Edward), it's all about just looking pretty and his acting skills are reduced to nothing more bowing his head slightly so that he always appears to be gazing upwards in an attempt at looking intense. As for Lautner (Jabob), well we all know he can't act so he is reduced to a shameless and topless eye-candy prop.<br/><br/>In summary? Women are from Venus and men are from Mars. If you're a guy, you'll hate this. If you're a woman... you might like it. I'm not trying to belittle the sexes, it's just that type of movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, the wife can beg all she wants... there ain't no way I'm taking her to see the fourth one!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","51","68","30 June 2010"," Eclipse: The Army of Sparkles!
","Ah, great, I can't believe I'm writing this kind of a review. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I went into Eclipse expecting a really bad movie like New Moon and it turned out to be much better than I expected. It's the best of the trilogy, even though that's not saying too much. New Moon was very possibly one of the worst movies I had ever seen, it was very poorly written and had God awful characters that are not likable in any way. Twilight, the first film, was so small for what it was trying to do and just wasn't very strong. However, working with a much better director like David Slade who did Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night, he knew not to take the film so seriously and it actually matured quite a bit.<br/><br/>As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob, knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has so many decisions to make: if she will marry Edward, if she will become apart of the vampire clan, if she will choose Jacob instead, if she will abandon her family and life. As this is happening, Victoria is still seeking her revenge on Bella by creating an army of new born vampires who crave nothing more in the world than blood and will do anything for it. Having to decide if Bella's life is worth it, Jacob and Edward must come to peace with each other if they want to save Bella's life.<br/><br/>The actions sequences are a lot better and actually makes the film a lot more entertaining. As we see in the first two films, when the vampires run, it's a long shot so it looks very CGI and in this one we have more close up's making it look a lot more realistic. Even the werewolves looked a lot better than in New Moon. I'm betting David Slade called the computer company that did New Moon and said ""OK, you guys have got to be kidding with what you gave me; work on the image!"". Also the characters even go a little more in depth, Edward and Jacob are a little more interesting in this story. Honestly, if it were not for Bella, this would have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>See, this is where the downfall is with this series, besides the story, our main character Bella. She is very possibly one of the most flat characters ever written, she's so beyond boring. I can't honestly feel anything for her because she's just honestly a horrible person, she pits these guys against each other who are fighting for her and I can't even understand why they would fight for her. She's not that pretty, she's one tracked in thinking and she's a manipulator. When we finally are getting a little more interested in Jacob and Edward, Bella interrupts it. She's going from kissing Edward to kissing Jacob to kissing Edward and not even apologizing for it. I'm also convinced that Edward is gay, I'm not saying this as an insult, but there's a scene that reminded me of Will and Grace. Bella wants to sleep with Edward, but he wants to wait until they're married, he gets nervous when he kisses her and doesn't even want her undressed, in Will and Grace when we find out how they met, that's the exact same situation, only Will tells Grace after he proposes to her that he's gay. It's not insulting the character, I'm just having a very hard time believing that he loves her as he tells Jacob when asked him if Bella chose him instead, Edward says ""I'd let her"", what is that? Are you kidding me? That's Bella's great love? Wow.<br/><br/>With better direction though, this film does a lot better that I expected, even if it's not saying too much. It's just the story that is really bad, the dialog and characters. David Slade did the best he could and he even made it enjoyable when Edward and Jacob actually talked, Jacob even says when he has to warm up Bella in a blizzard ""I'm hotter than you"", I couldn't stop laughing at that. I think that line was added last minute, also same with when Edward sees Jacob and asks ""does this guy have any shirts?"", they actually had fun with the script and that's what picked up the film as well as better action scenes. But to sum this up, Eclipse is better than I expected, but it's a rental for me, but I'm sure the fans will like this one a lot better.<br/><br/>6/10"
"thesar-2","2","55","77","26 September 2010"," The Top Thirty Things I Learned from Eclipse
","1. Native Americans fear ""Cold Ones"" as if they're attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Oh, wait<br/><br/>2. ""Jake! Stay!"" is probably considered an insult to someone that changes into a dog.<br/><br/>3. Mormon writer, Stephenie Meyer, should be proud of acknowledging there are other races out there, though portraying Native Americans as savage beasts and Blacks as murderers should put her right back in the good light with the Latter-day Saints.<br/><br/>4. Brokeback Mountain tent love can happen between any two males, even the hairy and undead ones.<br/><br/>5. Terrible acting, hilariously bad dialogue, faux-pas Goths and unnecessary flashbacks can equate $300 million in revenues. Thanks, America.<br/><br/>6. Quickly moving someone with a broken back is first on the list of any medical student drop-out.<br/><br/>7. Pending Don Knotts was still with us, he surely would've been frontrunner for Bella's dad, Charlie.<br/><br/>8. There are more shirtless boys in the forests of Washington than all ballparks of the U.S.<br/><br/>9. Shift-changing Native Americans wear little clothing and have little regard to what happens when they change back. Do they store those shorts in the same place prisoners sneak contraband?<br/><br/>10. There are more forest battles in Washington than all of Planet Endor.<br/><br/>11. Bleak Bella is the most wanted girl in the world. Reasons of why are still unknown.<br/><br/>12. Using six tons of blush doesn't make you a vampire. It makes you Cher.<br/><br/>13. Turning into a six-ton wolf doesn't make you a werewolf. It makes you Beethoven.<br/><br/>14. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!<br/><br/>15. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!<br/><br/>16. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!<br/><br/>17. Eclipse is as much a vampire and werewolf movie as The Exorcist is a feel-good and romantic comedy.<br/><br/>18. Eclipse is as much a teen romance as Speed 2: Cruise Control is about speeding.<br/><br/>19. Eclipse is as much of an epic adventure as Aliens is about Joe Arpaio's plight.<br/><br/>20. Eclipse is as much as about good parenting as The Stepfather is.<br/><br/>21. Bella is an incredible dead weight to anyone who is protecting her. Her best defense is to stay out of the way, cut herself like an emo and allow boys (and girls) fight over her. <br/><br/>22. ""Waiting for marriage"" is just as acceptable as taking your spouse's life on her wedding night.<br/><br/>23. Surprisingly good cinematography and a decent score does not equate a quality movie. Unless you want to watch a PBS special on the rainforests. <br/><br/>24. Who needs a spoof like Vampires Suck when you can laugh your ass off during the real movie? <br/><br/>25. The title is truly misleading; it would be far more entertaining to watch 30-seconds of an eclipse that you don't see in the movie, as it would the entire two hour film, itself. <br/><br/>26. High School graduates actually want to ""make mistakes"" so they can be all they can be. These filmmakers followed suit. <br/><br/>27. Bella is the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created next tonext tono one. She is, in fact, the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created. <br/><br/>28. Eclipse has the least exciting climax next to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. <br/><br/>29. This movie should NOT be considered for Best Costume Design. I've heard Lady Gaga actually rejected these outfits for her own act.<br/><br/>30. The un-dead fear ""Newborns"" just as much as Lindsey Lohan fears sobriety."
"Medacakathareal","1","281","442","6 July 2010"," Tedious boring and meaningless
","As bad as the first Twilight was this is a whole new level. The bland and tedious characters lack chemistry, life, personality which sort of makes sense because most of them are undead.<br/><br/>The film continues Bella's meaningless coin flip decision between Jacob the skin-walker (I refuse to refer to these as werewolves) and Edward the fairy. Every sentence out each character's mouth, particularly the main characters, is stilted and stale. They can't even articulate their lines let alone deliver them with any depth - not that there is any depth to the script or story here, there isn't.<br/><br/>Even the fights are bland with vampires getting snapped apart like they were porcelain dolls and the only main threat of the movie - an army of New Born vampires - ending up being overcome with GREAT EASE. Also the division of the skin-walkers and ""vampires"" is suddenly bridged, there's no exploration of the issues between their kind or how to resolve them, just a randomly quick decision to work together despite the fact they hated each other a moment ago.<br/><br/>The film's focus, instead of the parts that might have proved interesting, is in the emotionless and empty romance between two obscenely pale individuals and the muscular third wheel. Any attraction I could have had to Kristen Stewart is erased by her terrible delivery, empty eyed stare and general lack of emotion.<br/><br/>Bland from start to finish and painful to anyone who genuinely likes good films. If you are brave enough to see it I recommend drinking something that will erase the memory and numb the pain afterward."
"nikki-folwell","1","151","235","1 July 2010"," I have never craved a bullet in my head so much in my life
","OK, my experience in seeing this movie was particularly excruciating because I was stuck in a theatre of people who kept either groaning, cooing, or yelling advice to the characters on screen at the top of their lungs. But even with that aside, what few other people will be likely to say still deserves to be said: this movie sucked big hairy werewolf balls. Unfortunately, trying to explain why would take up a lot more words than I've managed to cram in, so I can only focus on the main issues. For starters, Bella has become increasingly unlikeable since we saw her last, and as she's the central protagonist around whom all the ensuing events revolve, that's going to be a problem. Originally a great character in the first two films, her appeal here takes such a massive nosedive that, no joke, it actually becomes hard to fathom why exactly everybody around her is risking their lives for her safety. Her constant lack of consideration for certain people (particularly her long-suffering dad) is getting exceedingly grating. There were a number of moments in which I wanted to bite her neck myself just to shut her up. The scene (spoiler) in which she punches Jacob because he kissed her was the last straw for me - I hardly think that that warrants a punch considering that he can't help being in love with her, especially since, deep down, she loves him as well. The little trout deserved to get her hand sprained. But no, he still apologises, and not just for the kiss but for the fact that punching him sprained her hand. How predictable and how pathetic.<br/><br/>Bella's love affair with Edward - previously of the ""I would die for you"" calibre - is now peppered with so many inconsistencies that it's losing its enjoyment value. For example, as we've learned in movies 1 and 2, Bella is so in love with Edward that she's a) willing to overlook the fact that he's not human; b) willing to overlook the fact that he's killed people; and c) give her own life to save his as she did at the end of New Moon, but when he finally proposes marriage to her she's hesitant? And the reason? Well apparently because she's still young, being only 18. Funny, 'cause I would've thought that 18 is also a young age to contemplate relinquishing your mortality in favour of becoming a vampire for all eternity. But it's OK, because (another spoiler) she eventually accepts; and in doing so, says, ""I will bind myself to you in every way humanly possible"" - but when he addresses her as Mrs. Cullen she suddenly tells him that she wants to keep her own name? She'll sacrifice life and limb for him but not do THAT?<br/><br/>The cheesiness of this film was also a step up - everything is cheapened to the level of a corny soap opera. They ALL deserve Razzis. CONSTANT long silences, hard stares, and stupid dialogue. My sister actually turned to me at one point during the movie and said, ""Shades of Wuthering Heights"" because everything about this plot is so exasperating. Why doesn't Edward stay mad at Bella after she kisses Jacob? They have ONE discussion about it (actually it's not even a discussion, just a series of comments) and then by the end of the movie they're happily reunited without a single cross word. I would think that kissing Jacob would put Edward's nose out of joint just a LITTLE, considering that she's supposed to be his reason for living and future bride!<br/><br/>You should also be prepared for the fact that, as is typical in most of these cases, they try to shove far too much into the storyline. Simplify, guys: if you're going to take a few minutes to explain Rosalie's backstory to us to give us some more insight as to why she is the way that she is, then leave James' backstory until the next movie. The need to stop every once in a while to explain another supporting character's history is exceedingly disruptive, and doesn't really bring anything integral to the plot anyway (for example I found that I still didn't give a rat's ass about Rosalie even after finding out what happened to her). It just makes it longer, more tedious, and prone to losing your attention.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just not this movie's core demographic. It IS for tweenies after all. But there's another problem: considering that this film is supposed to be for tweenies, the violence is sometimes surprisingly full-on. There's a scene involving a decapitation which I won't go into the gruesome details of, but let's just say that it could easily qualify as the ""Holey s**t!"" moment of the year. So even the movie itself seems to forget who it's for. The special effects are impressive of course, the visuals are creative and the direction is fine; but scratch beneath this glossy surface and there's just too much frustration at the hands of the script, the characters and their actions to make this movie tolerable to sit through. And, because the characters and their actions are the primary crux of this story, you never get a minute's peace.<br/><br/>Quite simply, I am so OVER Twilight man. I'm done. That's it. Up until this point I'd actually been quite enjoying the franchise, but the abomination of this third installment has soured my interest so much that...you know what? I'm going to go watch Little Ashes, because the sight of Robert Pattinson making out with a guy is just what I need to shoot dead anything that reminds me of this idiotic movie. Awful."
"jluppek","2","591","990","27 June 2010"," I Don't Get It And I Never Will
","It's just a plain awful movie and there is nothing good about it. The acting is weak, the visual effects are poor (the second one had better production value but the fact still remains that surely that is not a decisive factor in generating an audience), and the story itself is so mild. I'm not even going to harp on the issue that it holds completely untrue to all vampire rulings. There is nothing dark, enchanting, sad, nor even eternally romantic (mostly for femme auds granted) about this telling. Even the chemistry between Edward, Bella, and Jacob is so unapparent. Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson in no way sell that they are eternal arch enemies and Kristen Stewart is so uncharismatic and unable to connect to the character of Bella (I have read the books and they are far better). It's just a weak update on Romeo & Juliet aimed at generating teen female obsession. Anyone who is not a die-hard tween fan, that I've ever spoken too, concurs that they just don't get it."
"psokhadze","1","109","173","6 July 2010"," Rubbish
","Let's be honest - It's RUBBISH! All this saga was calculated on 12-15 years old teenager girls, which love to watch Crap like this. ,,OH what a Lovely screenplay, oh my god"" - No, you are wrong, screenplay sucks, it's another romantic movie with special effects and billions of dollars. Like once David Duchovny said in ,,Californicatin"" it's another ,,Twilight Boolsheet""! There are no Vampires, and no such awful Love stories between girl and vampire. if you want to watch movies exactly about Vampires watch ,,From Dusk Till Dawn"", which is billion times better than this crap.<br/><br/>Acting - sucks, screenplay - sucks, story - sucks, music - sucks, effects- nice. I enjoyed only special effects in those moving pictures (somebody calls twilight movie :D ). So I must say, that if we give money which was spent to make this rubbish, to homeless people world will be good enough."
"nguyencs2","5","149","242","30 June 2010"," better but still lacking
","Eclipse was by far my favorite book in the saga. As a guy, I felt it had the perfect blend of action, romance, drama, and suspense. The movie did try to stay true to the book as much as possible but I feel it still lacked what made the book great.<br/><br/>The acting is definitely better over the last two. I still feel a little awkward watching Bella. Edward definitely has gotten better. I've gotten several good laughs out of the movie. Got some nice flashbacks of other characters. But it still lacked overall magic for me.<br/><br/>The things I feel is missing from the movie is suspense and chemistry. The love triangle is back and was a bit more entertaining now that all three of them are interacting more. But I still find the lack of chemistry between the characters glaringly obvious. I often had to think about my feelings back when I was reading the book to fortify what I saw on screen. In my opinion, they used too many words(and dialogue from the book) to describe what's going on instead of SHOWING(acting) us what's going on.<br/><br/>The climax in the book was what made Eclipse my favorite of the saga, however, I can't say the same for the movie. The climax was disappointing and anti-climatic. Such dramatics for a walk in the park.<br/><br/>I still feel the movie deserve the theater experience but I won't say boo to waiting for DVD release."
"FatmanReviewing","4","106","170","4 July 2010"," Twilight Eclipse: An Improvement
","When ""Twilight"" came out back in 2008 I became immensely curious in the franchise (even though I'd never read the books) due to the overwhelming hype from the fans. After the viewing I felt that the film was left very hollow and weighed down by the sub-standard acting, iffy directing, sloppy editing and overall adolescent melodrama. It felt incomplete but as though it wanted its creators to try harder and become a developed rendition of the books. Regardless, I saw the possibility of potential and found myself interested in seeing where the series would go in the future. ""New Moon"" was released last year and I had actually bubbled up a sense of excitement from watching the trailers. It came off as a new and improved version of the original with a much more interesting story; I couldn't have hit further from the mark if I tried. Completely immersed underneath terrible acting, absolutely sloppy editing, gut-wrenching writing, mediocre directing, god awful story development, empty CGI and a go-nowhere-at-all story only meant to tug at the heart strings of pre-teens, ""New Moon"" was instantly put on the list of worst films I had ever seen in my life. I had become completely turned off by the idea of seeing this franchise grow any further. Alas, my OCD personality refuses to let me start a film series and walk away from it so it was inevitable that I hesitantly saw ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"".<br/><br/>Almost immediately I realized that this film's atmosphere is a barricaded roundabout of re-hashed dialogue and one-track character directory. Nothing intellectual or invitingly new is dropped into this pot of love triangles, cardboard characters, and afterthought plot development. It's one of the largest problems with the film; nothing is unique. The seemingly ""main story"" is introduced slowly over the course of almost two hours through five to ten minute segments that feel like nothing more than meaningless bursts to keep people on their toes. These sporadic bursts of story come at you in between the same drivel we've heard in ""New Moon"". Bella (Kirsten Stewart) to Edward (Robert Pattinson) to Jacob (Taylor Lautner) back to Bella and Edward and Edward to Jacob and Jacob to Bella and Edward and Jacob and Bella to Edward. Continuously talking about fighting for their love and no sex before marriage and preparing for battle but really doing nothing and ""She loves me but she's too afraid to admit it"" and ""She loves me more but I'm not sure about myself."" It's this childlike, empty conversation between characters with similarly empty, childlike personalities that makes the entire movie feel like a giant fantasy advertisement; an enormous, over dramatic, pre-teen wet dream.<br/><br/>The characters are the second biggest issue with this film and even though in second place, it's by far the most irritating problem. I cannot recall the last time I cared for characters so little in a series of any sort. This movie has a running time of an hour and fifty-five minutes, minus the credits and not once do any of the characters deviate from the one-tone personalities that are painted for them. The same over the top emotions that cause the same loop-de-loop interactions that actually get so bad that you feel as though you're watching the same scene over and over and over and over again. It's cursed by a formula that should have been dropped after the first film because there was potential to create characters an audience would be interested in but that ship sailed and crashed; no survivors.<br/><br/>Alongside cookie cutter personalities and what tries to pass off as an in-depth story of revenge, love and redemption, is a near beautiful but one dimensional environment. I was really confused by this film's physical appearance and the tone it was attempting to create. The scenery is something to behold but is masked by too much use of blue tones, bloom lights and green washing. The werewolves have got some excellent CGI going for them and at first glance you wouldn't be able to guess that they aren't real. As the film progresses though, you begin to lose the feeling of reality with these creatures. It's almost as if they aren't there and there's no physical depth or strength to them. This weightlessness become very apparent during the overwhelmingly dull, cliché and emotionless fight scenes. Everything about the atmosphere contradicts itself and this became very frustrating to watch. I do have to give credit to the film makers for putting enough effort into making the environment look much more attractive than the previous installments.<br/><br/>Overall most of what made ""New Moon"" a total catastrophe has been worked on in ""Eclipse"" and it is indeed a better film than its predecessors. The problem with this analysis is you're comparing one personal experience with a train wreck to another; in the end it's still covered in smoke, fire, dismay and you're hoping to get out alive. The acting has improved but the delivery of almost the entirety of the film's dialogue is rubbish or cringe worthy. The editing has gotten better and the pacing feels more cinematic but the story itself completely veils this upgrade, making it nearly unnoticeable. Changing the directors was possibly the best choice made here because the film feels much more professional and mature; again though, we're talking train wrecks here. If you're a fan of the series thus far, I'm sure you'll enjoy this installment. If you're a fan of the books, maybe you will too. If you're anybody else I would highly suggest, at this point, steering clear of this series entirely and maybe picking up the books."
"chucknorrisfacts","1","47","71","10 July 2010"," Simply dreadful!
","All right, I'm going to make this short and sweet. ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen A LOT of movies.<br/><br/>I knew this movie would be terrible. After all, ""Twilight"" was terrible and so was its sequel, ""New Moon"". I didn't expect anything less from this installment.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner need to enroll in some acting classes, pronto! I don't know how they convinced anyone they could ""carry"" a movie. Their melodramatic line delivery is almost unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>The writing is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so unbelievably cheesy it's embarrassing. The only people that could possibly derive any sort of enjoyment from this insult to celluloid are pre-teen girls. So if you're not a pre-teen girl, or ridiculously immature, you're not going to like this.<br/><br/>I think it should be obvious that ""Twilight"" is a passing fad. Give it a few more years and it'll end up just like the Macarena. It was popular once upon a time but now people are embarrassed to admit they ever had anything to do with it. Mark my words, ""Twilight"" will be no different.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" carries on the tradition of its predecessors ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"", it sucks. I would strongly advise anyone that values their brain cells to stay away from this horrible movie at all costs."

The same expression on Robert's face throughout the entire movie, lame attempts from Kristen to act..<br/><br/>At least they did a bit better with the make-up this time around. And the wigs looked OK.<br/><br/>oh yeah, I love Dakota Fanning's acting, she is awesome. And Billy Burke is a God. Charlie is my favourite character.

"xomaelicaox","10","28","42","5 July 2010"," Very similar to the book
","Let's admit it, Twilight Saga has been weaved into our POP culture and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Whether you're a big fan or just a trash talker, it's here to stay just like the boy bands of the early 90's. And it still puzzles me every time I read a negative review from someone who has seen the previous movies, really??? were you hoping that this time Eclipse detoured it's way from the teenage love triangle to a mature well developed flick? I hope those people like disappointments...<br/><br/>I was disappointed in New Moon, so I was a little apprehensive to watch Eclipse. But I was wrong, David Slade did an amazing job regardless of what others say. I thought New Moon dragged on for most of the movie and peaked towards the end. Eclipse had me at the edge of my seat, 2 hrs went by quick and left me wanting more. The writers stayed really close to the book which I really appreciated. Taylor's acting got better and looked more natural, I can see that he has morphed into Jacob's character. Kristen Stewart still needs a little bit more emotion, I still don't think she has quite captured Bella's character yet. Bella is complex, emotional and dramatic; and I don't get that from Kristen. She brings a lot of her own into Bella, very black and white. I hope to see some improvement in Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>So far, Eclipse is my favorite out of the 3. They incorporated most of the important scenes from the book into the film. I enjoyed the battle scene with the Newborns specially the porcelain sound effects every time they were dismembered. It's the little details in the movie that makes it my favorite so far."
"mkirkpatrick02","10","213","379","30 June 2010"," Way better than New Moon
","It's one thing if you don't like the storyline to begin with. Teen supernatural romances with love triangles aren't for everyone, so why people who went to see it who don't like that sort of movie and then decide to give it a crappy review, I don't know. After reading all the book, I'll admit I was worried for the movies, in my opinion Twilight was OK, New Moon was a disappointment so I was apprehensive about Eclipse.<br/><br/>The irony of this situation is a horror film director, David Slade, got it right. From the beginning one of the first things I noticed was the fact that the acting had drastically improved. Jacob's lines were much less cheesy or at least Taylor delivered them in such a way that they didn't come across that way. Bella's maturity also was apparent in this film. The darker parts of the movie were as dark as they could be while keeping the PG-13 rating. Charlie was the comic relief and always has been that way, but this time I was legitimately in stitches.<br/><br/>As far as some reviewers who are annoyed by the love triangle and say nothing changed with that in the movie are clearly missing a few marbles. Bella even explains why she hadn't chosen up until the end of movie to Edward. She was choosing between who she should be and who she is. Jacob obviously who she should be and what she should do and Edward is who she is and where she feels most herself. Plus Jacob and Edward have a moment of understanding in this film which never happened in Twilight or New Moon, and I don't understand how some people on here didn't notice that. Also I can tell you that things really change in Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>Yes there is a lot of dialog in the film, but I don't really think that's a bad thing unless you wanted an interpretive dance. You're dealing with a very large and detailed book that's being squeezed into a two hour movie, something has to give and dialog is a huge part of keeping the viewer aware of what's going on and moving the story along and I really don't think there is too much of it.<br/><br/>Also the movie flew by for me and as always leaves it's own ""cliffhanger"" to be addressed in the next film.<br/><br/>The main point is you either love, like, or hate the Twilight Saga, if you hate it, don't see the movie, if you love it I can tell you you'll like (probably love) Eclipse."

","""I know the consequences of the choices you're making."" Edward to Isabella<br/><br/>Although more fight action is apparent in the change from the last sequel (New Moon, 2009), to the new Twilight Saga: Eclipse, it is a film in eclipse—the story is so slow as to make you feel drained of blood, Kristen Stewart (Bella) has even fewer expressions than in previous Twilights, Taylor Lautner (Jacob) seems to have gone from a six pack to a four, and Robert Pattinson (Edward) is less James Dean than when he never had a chance to be like him anyway.<br/><br/>In other words, this slow tale of teenage vampires and werewolves in heat has too little heat, but rather is in its own twilight. The close-ups of the brooding teens have proliferated, to the extent that I have memorized Edward's mouth (or lack thereof), Bella's drooping eyes, and Jacob's overly-white teeth. All my memorization occurs because I needed to stay awake during the dullest scenarios since, well, Twilight. Actually I called that one ""enjoyably overcooked."" This one is underdone.<br/><br/>Eclipse has an increased emphasis on teenage uncertainty: Bella must decide who she wants to be, human or vampire (a variation of the film's existential subtext), whether or not to marry Edward, and how much she loves Jacob, more specifically, can she love two boys at once. It's authentic teen dilemma centered on fitting in with the crowd and the opposite sex. To the film's credit, she and Edward postpone sex until after marriage because Edward is ""old school"" about those matters (as opposed to killing piles of animals each night to sustain his 100 year-old body). <br/><br/>When Edward proclaims to Bella, ""Isabella Swan, I promise to love you every moment of forever,"" I have the feeling it's a warning to me that at least two more sequels are being planned. I guess that's why the vampires and their movies seem to last so long—the undead and the Twilight continue to suck blood out of pop culture."

","There are two types of reviews: those by people who don't know the books and just judge on it from an outsider's point of view and those, who actually know and like the books and have certain expectations. There's a huge difference between going to the theater and not expecting nothing, maybe even expecting the worst and going to see a movie you've been actually anticipating. I'm the second type and here's a review from someone who used to be optimistic about the Twilight saga.<br/><br/>I read the books and Eclipse was my favorite so I went in not expecting the best but at least a halfway acceptable compromise since there's no way to squeeze a detailed book into 120 minutes of screen time. But never would I have thought that they would somehow manage to ruin the storyline in such a way that even a fan like me would turn their back on it. I've known Kristen Stewart's non-existent acting from the previous movies and still it shocked me how she made Bella look like a emotionless robot with exactly 2 1/2 facial expressions and a talent to make meaningful lines sound like an instruction to knit a pair of socks. Her expression when facing the possible loss of her best friend is the same as when being proposed. And if the main character isn't working, not even a good soundtrack, impressive scenery or good co-actors can save the movie. Robert Pattinson's performance didn't do much for me either but at least he has the excuse of playing a dead guy. That famous Robsten chemistry? I didn't see it. The mating habits of sea cucumbers seems more exciting. Jacob and the wolves were ridiculously under-represented and instead of investing screen time in that friendship the director/editor chose to waste time on comparatively insignificant side stories. I didn't believe the whole love triangle because there wasn't enough time to establish the relationships in a credible way. In this movie Bella neither loved Edward nor Jacob, and the vampire didn't really hate the werewolf or vise versa, the whole thing was wishy washy from beginning to end and the hand full of good moments like the garage scene with Jacob or brilliant performances by the ""humans"" were unfortunately drowned by a rushed storyline and some hideous looking wigs. Some scenes seemed endless and made me want to take a nap in between (what's up with those meadow scenes?!) while others were too short and rash. David Slade does have an eye for great scenery and big pictures, the colors were vibrant and the action scenes dynamic with fantastic visual effects. But that is not what the movie was supposed to be about and the actual plot, just like Bella, seemed as deep as a puddle. It would have been so easy to make this book a fantastic movie - it had the suspense, the action, the love, the angst, an emotional roller-coaster. How in the world they managed to ruin so much potential is a mystery to me. I suggest Summit invests money in acting classes and a capable wig maker for their final chance to make the Twilight Saga look like something else than all show and no go."
"michelle-779-962059","10","134","251","30 June 2010"," The best movie out of all three Twilight movies
","I know there is a broad range of people that watched Eclipse already, but having read the books and having watched the two previous movies, I believe this is the best out of all of them. A movie is never going to be as good as reading the original book, so if that is what you're looking for, than don't watch the movie! David Slade did an excellent job of making the movie more dramatic and less cheesy compared to the previous two films that made me want to gag in certain scenes.<br/><br/>I believe his technique of meeting with each actor individually before scenes to discuss lines and what he was looking for in each scene really helped each main character and improved their overall performance in Eclipse. We all have to remember that these are young actors and most of them have found fame through the Twilight movies, but this movie has really shown a lot of growth both in their acting abilities and how they've added more depth to their characters. Actors are only as great as the directors that direct them and I think David Slade has worked wonders with this cast and has shown us that a teenage love story can be turned into a movie where the characters will be praised and loved for not just their looks but for their talents to capture an audience and to walk away wanting more.<br/><br/>This movie played more on the serious side of young vampires, werewolves and The Cullens than the cheesy love story and over dramatic lines in the previous movies. Moviegoers get more insight into Jasper and Rosalie, even though I have to admit that Jasper was a little cheesy in this film, but his hair looked a lot more natural than the second film. There is so much going on in this book, but David Slade directed this movie in such a way that we are able to see the different aspects of what this book has to offer.. Vengeance and deceit through the eyes of Victoria and her young vampire army, a love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob, and the more human side of the vampires and werewolves through scenes that touch on the past. All these theatrical elements bring the book to life and allow viewers to relive this most important book in the series on the big screen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and I believe if you go into the movie theater and not expect that it should be just like the book, you will be pleasantly surprised that the screenwriter and the director have produced a very well made film that takes the most important parts of one of the most compelling books in the series and creates a film that is both dramatic with a little humor. You will walk out of the theater knowing that this third film has done the franchise justice and will get you pumped up for Breaking Dawn!"

"adam_uk09","6","69","124","4 July 2010"," It doesn't have enough bite!!
","It's been billed as the biggest film of the year and perhaps it will be, but it has some stiff competition from the likes of Harry Potter coming this winter, so let's see if Eclipse really deserves that prestigious title.<br/><br/>The vampire and werewolf love saga has been bitterly disappointing so far with a dull first instalment and a hideously depressing second. Add to this some excruciatingly painful running times of over two hours and you have death by celluloid.<br/><br/>But perhaps I'm being a little unfair; this third instalment has been based on perhaps the most exciting book of the four in the series so it already has a good starting point and some convincing performances from the actors really do make this film a huge leap ahead of what preceded it.<br/><br/>The storyline to this film is pretty much non-existent but director David Slade does a good job of turning zilch into another depressing, but well made two hour love fest. Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen), Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Taylor Lautner (Jacob) return as the three main leads and their love triangle becomes even more confusing this time around, with frowning faces and awkward kisses galore. Add to this an army of newborn vampires ready to rip the very flesh of Bella Swan's bones and it's getting pretty tense down in Forks.<br/><br/>Sadly, even with a whole army of vampires and werewolves fighting in the finale, this small increase in action doesn't take away from the fact that the film drags in more than one place with blocks of dialogue that feel as if they're going to last a lifetime. It's unfortunate as the action pieces look excellent and the CGI, especially in the werewolves has improved leaps and bounds between New Moon and Eclipse. This shamefully vain dialogue with unnecessary close-ups of Robert Pattinson's face, Kristen Stewart's eyelashes and Taylor Lautner's chest are surely there just to appeal to the female fans and do nothing to progress the story.<br/><br/>It is these main three characters that hinder the film; their stilted dialogue and mediocre acting overshadow the rest of the cast who are all superb. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard playing red head vampire Victoria is seriously underused along with the whole Cullen flock who are not given enough room to breathe between the heavy central dialogue. Their acting is fantastic, why not use them more? Thankfully, it isn't all tears before bedtime with some well-timed comic humour from Bella's dad, Charlie. Played by Billy Burke, he is the only character of the used variety that leaps off the screen and he does so well, playing to his strengths as an actor.<br/><br/>Overall, Eclipse moves the game on but only very slowly. David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces; but it still remains dull as ditch water because of bland performances from the lead cast and chunky dialogue. It's bound to please fans but biggest film of the year? I think we'll be seeing a certain boy wizard holding that honour for 2010."

"colinrgeorge","4","7","9","14 July 2010"," Eclipse By the Numbers
","Hold on a second, what happened? Where am I? Suddenly, I've seen not one but two ""Twilight"" films, and what's more, I actually have something positive to say about this one. Ahem —""Eclipse"" is 100% better than ""New Moon,"" a film I initially scored one star. Make of that what you will, mathematicians.<br/><br/>Like many males, I'm an outsider on the Stephanie Meyer phenomenon. I haven't read her books, and I laugh derisively at the cardboard Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner chilling outside the local record store (though maybe I'm just jealous no one will pay $29.99 for a life sized stand-up of me). Regardless, last November I decided to give the series a chance to win me over. It did not.<br/><br/>However, the improvements this third installment wields over its predecessor are immediately apparent. For starters, Chris Weiz, who directed ""New Moon,"" along with the equally contemptible adaptation of Philip Pullman's ""The Golden Compass,"" abdicated the director's chair to David Slade, helmer of ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night."" Slade seems an unusual choice, and one, I can only assume, was made with the intention of casting the ""Twilight"" net clear across the gender gap, coaxing more teenage menfolk into the seats by way of grittier, more competent action. Also, more of it.<br/><br/>Still, ""Eclipse"" is anything but action-packed, and most of the time it feels as if the script is working against that goal. Slade can class up the werewolf on vampire (on vampire) scuffles till the bats come home, but nothing can change the fact that his film is founded on one of the most unnecessarily redundant screenplays in cinematic history. In fact, so little happens in either of the latter two ""Twilight"" films that most of ""New Moon"" could be stricken from the series, and would be better for it.<br/><br/>But instead, we've got star-crossed lovers Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) picking up precisely where they left off, or maybe even earlier. To summarize: Bella wants to be a vampire; Edwards wants to be married—You'd think they'd reach common ground at the 'eternity' part. But while their apparently passionate relationship is at loggerheads, Jacob T. Wolf (Lautner) is determined to thwart the union and win over Bella, who seems more uncertain than ever which monster man she's more interested in.<br/><br/>And that's the big problem with Bella Swan. She's portrayed as supremely desirable—Despite her conspicuous lack of personality. She's billed as a hero, but is largely incapable of enacting change on her surroundings. She is disingenuous with both of her would-be supernatural suitors, and is childish, arrogant, and hypocritical. Edward, Jacob, listen carefully... YOU'RE BOTH TOO GOOD FOR HER.<br/><br/>But in the escalating farce of their one-upsmanship for her love (with feats that range everywhere from charming to psychopathic), Jacob literally carries her into one of the worst romantic plot devices of all time:<br/><br/>You see, there are these other vampires. Bad ones, like the kind from every other vampire book. They want to kill Bella for something or something, so she must be spirited away to the safety of a mountain cliff (????). The vampires can, I guess, smell other vampires but not werewolves, but they can also smell Bella. So she can't go to the top of the mountain alone, which again, is the most logical place to hide (????), and Edward is powerless to help Obviously, the only viable option is for her to be carried there—By none other than an extremely shirtless Jacob. Let me tell ya, Washington state's never been so hot!<br/><br/>Plus, once there, Bella, Jake, and Eddie all spend the night in a tent together (even though we're led to believe she only needs to be hidden for the duration of a battle that won't occur until the following morning). Despite the fact that everyone knew they would be camping on the peak of a snow-covered mountain, Bella is under-insulated and freezing in the middle the night. What can Edward, with his cold vampire's blood, possibly do except allow the hot- blooded Jacob to cuddle his fiancé back to warmth?<br/><br/>The transparency of every motive is proof that no matter how far the film-making in the franchise comes, the quality of the stories remains along a single horizontal plane with a whole lot of headroom. Slade brings the series another step closer to credibility, but based solely on the adaptations (which I know some of the novels' fans have shunned), ""Twilight"" is adolescent drivel, a projected paperback romance lost at a costume party—And this brainless two hour third attempt is too much mash, not enough monster.<br/><br/>Never mind the mathematics. The numbers are in, and any way you spin them, ""Eclipse"" is an improvement—Pity it's still a net loss."

","First and foremost, what I don't think most of the critics understand, is that this movie was designed for 1 population - Twilight Fans. This movie was not designed to be a cinematic masterpiece that would appeal to the Hollywood Foreign Press, The Academy, or these ""hard-core"" movie critics. Frankly, I'm not sure why they bother going to the Twilight films, when they already know they're going to trash it.<br/><br/>This movie was designed for 1 purpose - to translate our favorite modern love story onto the silver screen; to visually fulfill our Twilight fantastical indulgent desires. So with that in mind, there's a few simple answers/reviews without spoiling the movie.<br/><br/>Do we get to see lots of Jacob and Edward: YES! (and the tent scene) Do we get the passion and the love story: YES! Do we get Jasper's & Rosalie's awesome back-stories: YES! (though brief) Do we get the back story of the Quileute Tribe?: YES! (though brief) Do we get to see the big ""fight"" scenes (Edward & The Meadow): YES YES!!! (I actually think the movie did a better job with this than the book did, I love Stephanie Meyer, by writing action sequences is not her forte) Does the movie do Eclipse's plot (the book) justice: YES! Granted some things get simplified or left out for the sake of running time.<br/><br/>Overall, I LOVED Eclipse, it was by far my favorite movie of the series (and book). My only complaint was that it was only 2 hours."

You failed to show how ALL of the Cullens feel about Bella, which is also important to the next part of the story.

","I have watched all the movies and browsed through the books because I wanted to understand what it was all about before I said anything about this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Twilight was so bad, it was funny (""like diamonds!"" - wow.) New Moon was extremely boring. Both were so flat, bad direction, bad acting, REALLY bad dialog. Along comes New Moon with slightly better acting, slightly better action but still unbelievably bad dialog. I guess that's impossible to avoid though, considering the abominable, cheesy books. Oh yes, Stephenie Meyer cannot write! Every single cliché expression is there.<br/><br/>So -- Eclipse. It all revolves around the girl's choice, which is about the most common situation teenagers find themselves in. The difference is that your average girl will not encounter the choice werewolf vs. vampire too often... Bella STILL can't make her mind up whether she loves E or J so she messes with their minds a little more. Which in teenage speak means: keep 'em in suspense 'cause they'll both love you more.<br/><br/>Actually, the entire saga has Bella at its center, which is artificial to say the least. Two amazing creatures competing for the affection of a dull teenage girl - but it doesn't stop here: every single awesome creature jumps in to save her life, while the bad guys form an entire army of vampires to get vengeance for something She, ""the beautiful swan"", triggered. Wow, talk about your implausible plot - even in the world of mythological creatures. Oh, and she helps in the fight by cutting her finger.<br/><br/>The army of newborn vampires is disappointing, they're supposed to be very strong but they can't take a hit. They can't smell the wolves either, which contradicts the whole strategy of ""carry Bella so that your stench covers her scent."" However the scenes in the city, when they attack and destroy, are almost cool.<br/><br/>Bella and Edward's conversations in the meadow are so boring. There's no chemistry, no voice modulation, no face expressions which are usually more than necessary in the heart- felt scenes.<br/><br/>The acting! yes, the acting:<br/><br/>It seems like everybody in the movies has a fair performance - Dakota Fanning is stunning, Charlie is nice and funny, papa Cullen and newborn Riley (hope I got the names right) are actually likable. Everybody except the main characters!!<br/><br/>Edward is supposed to be this unbelievably sexy, can't-keep-your-hands-off-him perfect hunk. Instead, Pattinson really looks terrible - and speaking of terrible, let's not forget his acting. He should be intriguing and mysterious but he just looks awkward and stiff, which leaves you wondering what you should find so irresistible about him. The make-up does not help, especially the lipstick, which is redder than Bella's.<br/><br/>Bella. Now, no matter how hard I try, I cannot like Kristen Stewart. In the immortal (ha) words of Lisa Simpson - she's wooden and unpleasant. That 'puzzled' look she keeps giving defines her as an actress, which is not a good sign. Also, she never closes her mouth. Who ever thought she could hold a leading role was probably drunk.<br/><br/>Jacob. His purpose in the movie is to keep his shirt off, period. Nothing else matters here - the bust, the pecks and the attempts to kiss Bella.<br/><br/>So what's so captivating about the Twilight series? The fact that any girl can think she's the center of the world, that she can have everyone at her feet, complying with her every whim - yeah, that's pretty appealing. It also ""raises"" egocentric and unbelievably exigent women. Let us not forget the kids who want to become vampires (which of course implies their believing such beings actually exist.)<br/><br/>Yes, Eclipse was bad, but not as bad as the previous two. I wonder whether I'll have the patience to see the other two coming our way..."

The movies have the same story so obviously I began to chuckle when I saw these movies the second time, because its simply too unrealistic and ridiculous. Bella gets to live with Edward forever in the end, and no matter how much a couple is in love they will never love only each other for ETERNITY. Human minds don't work that way, especially when you're young. We get sick of our partners easily and cheat on each other at least once in our lives, because there are plenty of men and women out there other than our partners. It's not good to be madly in love, because you create unbalance in all your other life styles. If all the girls and twihard thought that the relationship between bella and edward has any depth, reality or is in any way healthy, then your understanding of the basics of human nature are truly at a low. It's very unhealthy to depend your life on someone else entirely, because you lose your own identity, expression and thought and that is a terrible price.

"themikeivens","10","50","92","30 June 2010"," what movie did these people see?
","I was pretty confused last night when I got home from a midnight premiere of this film to see many comments on it from people who very obviously hadn't actually seen the movie. People calling it a romantic comedy? Either they're just trying to find a 'totally hilarious' way to be condescending towards a twilight movie, or they obviously didn't see the correct movie.<br/><br/>I thought Eclipse was easily the best installment in the saga so far. I've read the books, and seen all the movies, and this movie definitely had it's differences from the book, but David Slade's portrayal of everything in the book was magnificent. This book, the darkest in the series, was easily seen in Slade's dark direction and great usage of Riley as a more intriguing character.<br/><br/>I also don't understand everyone's hatred for Robert Pattinson. He does amazing work as Edward. His facial expressions to his body movements compliment the character from the book very well. Kristen Stewart does a great job as Bella, better in this one than the rest. In New Moon she had a lot of makeup, which I didn't agree with, and luckily they fixed that in this one.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film was incredible and I'm glad to see they did away with the dreary soap opera piano from New Moon.<br/><br/>Another thing people keep crying about is Taylor Lautner, and one commenter said that he didn't like how angry he was every time. I understand watching the movie without reading the book, but I thought the story itself would help a viewer understand that Jacob's character should be angry. One, he's doing something against his will (stated in New Moon and in this film) and he's dealing with Bella being with Edward and not him. It's pretty obvious to me this character would be conflicted, and Taylor does a great job showing it. And that guy is definitely still working out because it looked like he added another half-inch to his arms. Bravo to that guy.<br/><br/>This movie was great, 10/10 for direction, acting, soundtrack, and even the cinematography. It was all great and I enjoyed every second of this film.<br/><br/>-also, Taylor and Robert's anger towards each other in the movie is incredible. They did a great job working with each other in this one. Much better than New Moon's."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","10","36","64","30 June 2010"," It's all about choice...
","While Twilight was devoted to Bella & Edward, then New Moon was all about Bella & Jacob, Eclipse explores the bizarre love triangle that is Edward/Bella/Jacob. Having only shared a few scenes together in the previous films, Edward and Jacob get to share a good amount of screen time together in this one - much of which is spent up in each other's faces (apparently they're both close talkers).<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart continues to embody sullenness as Bella Swan. She's a perfect fit. Though at least she's not all death-wishy as she was in New Moon (and she smiles!). Jacob hits the nail on the head, though, when he tells Edward that Bella's not sure WHAT she wants. Girl cannot make up her mind, it seems, half the time. Edward himself goes to rather extreme lengths to keep Bella from seeing Jacob, while Jacob invades her personal space and takes ""no"" to mean ""yes"" in one instance (she tries to teach him a lesson, but instead she just ends up learning why you don't punch werewolves). In the tent scene, though, Edward and Jacob come to an understanding of sorts...albeit short-lived. None of the characters are saints. Each one has their faults, but at the same time, they also have their redeeming qualities. Bella, Edward and Jacob are well portrayed by Stewart, Pattinson and Lautner.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the characters go...well...some actually get moments to shine in this film. Like two members of the Cullens, for example. Those Nikki Reed naysayers will hopefully be silenced by the performance she turns in as Rosalie this time around. We get her back story, and it's given as much feeling and heartbreak (and slight hints of dark humour) as it deserves. Jasper gets his origin revealed also (and at least this time he gets to do more than just look like he's perpetually holding in a fart). Both flashbacks were very well done/performed, I thought. Meanwhile, the other Cullens aren't given a lot of screen time, but what they do get will have to suffice (I'm still bitter we haven't gotten to explore Alice's background on screen. Ashley Greene is too awesome as Alice to not get her individual moment. She displays said awesomeness in the scene with Jasper showing how to fight newborns - which was enjoyable).<br/><br/>I was surprised by how much screen time newborn vampire Riley got. There were several cut aways to what he was up to with the vamp army - the most important one being where his relationship with Victoria was established. I never had a problem with Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria, and while it's a shame she got replaced, Bryce Dallas Howard more than makes up for it. She actually gives the role some much-needed depth (which is quite the feat, considering how briefly she appears) and shows off Victoria's manipulative side. The climactic battle between her and Edward is pretty tense, and nicely done.<br/><br/>The new members of Sam's cult of shirtlessness (Leah and Seth) are given very little time on screen, but the actors who play them show promise and will hopefully get more sufficient screen time in the next two films. The rest of the wolf pack get a line here and there. Jacob's dad, Billy, gets the most dialogue of all of them (courtesy of him telling an ancient Quileute legend - which becomes important towards the end of the film).<br/><br/>Don't feel too bad for the wolf pack, though - they get more time spent on them than Bella's human ""friends"" (though, as always, Anna Kendrick is the standout as Jessica). Of the four Volturi members that we see again, Dakota Fanning is the most memorable, in the role of Jane. She's at her best when enjoying the pain she inflicts on others.<br/><br/>Bella's mum reappears in this film, to spend some quality time with her daughter, but it's Billy Burke who continues to shine as Bella's dad, Charlie. His disapproval of Edward, favouritism towards Jacob and just general awesomeness is what makes him so great. Sadly, his equally awesome dynamic with Alice is only briefly visited (though at least we got them on screen together this time! More Charlie/Alice interaction next time, please!).<br/><br/>The film itself looks great. Just from the gloomy/rainy opening, you can tell this is going to be a very different from the last two. Those who need action to keep them awake should be pleased, as there's plenty of fighting/skull smashing/limb tearing going on. David Slade gives Eclipse its own unique visual style and 'feeling' that sets it apart from the previous two films. The chase scene between the Cullens and Victoria, the Cullens vs. newborns and especially the fight scene in the snow are all marvelous to watch. I also enjoyed the movie's soundtrack. Songs were very appropriately used throughout.<br/><br/>Eclipse might seem a bit 'slow-moving' for some people, as it spends a lot of time exploring the dynamics of the characters and delving into what makes them tick/their relationships, but at least it has heart (and humour). Bottom line is, if you hate anything to do with Twilight...then, no, this film probably isn't going to change your opinion. Do yourself a favour and go focus on something you *do* actually like instead maybe? For those of us who have read the books/enjoy the films, this is a pretty decent adaptation of the third book. Though Jacob fans might feel a bit cheated by the ending of the film. Despite that, this series continues to do a great job of managing to keep most of the important parts/elements/lines of dialogue from the books (while also filling in/expanding on other parts of the books that weren't described in as much detail). If you're a Twilight fan, and you don't go in expecting a perfect adaption, you should hopefully enjoy it. I did, and I'm choosing to remain cautiously optimistic for Breaking Dawn Parts 1 & 2."

","I had the chance to the the first screening in Perth and I didn't help 'ECLIPSE' when I came out with the sad look on my face wanting to be sick. I loved 'NEW MOON' so much that it had a magical power to make me go out and purchase every related book and soundtrack to the saga.<br/><br/>'ECLIPSE' was empty. It crossed over between the 'ECLIPSE' novella and 'ECLIPSE' the novel. Slade had a lot of issues to deal with and you can't just make a summary and basically film what we already know! Directors are supposed to make it 'theirs' and engage the audience! First, Summit. They don't allow enough production time which is a major turn off for decent directors. They discovered a gold mine and just pushed their way through to get the movies into cinemas. SPREAD IT OUT! Take your time. If they stuff it, give us about 10 or so years before someone remakes them all! My heart breaks for Stephanie Meyer who has to watch the tears from fans.<br/><br/>Secondly, Rosenberg. You wrote the screenplay, did you get tired third time around? It was lazy! I want to know why Summit didn't get Meyer to direct or co-direct and assist with writing. She would have known the important elements to concentrate on. The romance was lost and quite frankly I think the 'BUNNIES' who do film summaries will adapt 'ECLIPSE' better! The dialog was common, washed out responses and conversations were kept brief and boring. If 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA' is a romantic series which the romance being the draw-card for millions of fans, then they REALLY have to consider this film that they have just green lit. By the way what happened to the fact that Edward believes Bella to be fearful of him during this one, that was something worth keeping! Finally, Slade. THIS IS NOT A HORROR, or did you not get the memo? Poor sound effects for a start. Why did you steer so far from the previous two movies? The breaking of the bodies as stupid. It's the only word I can think of right now through all these emotions of disappointment. The fake sets were a major turn off and too far fetched where you should be making this as believable as possible. The scene with the bed was supposed to be a big deal! That's when I knew I was going to cry. I was actually asking my husband to film me burn my Eclipse stuff and post it on YOUTUBE in protest! Then I think of Stephanie Meyer and I could never do it.<br/><br/>For all you out there that give crap to the books, the movies were the chance and some sort of literary redemption through translation but it's been wasted. We love the story... that's it. We love the story. Thank you Charlie for being the only character allowing me to rate it 1."
"zulus88","2","57","107","3 July 2010"," Millions of fans can be wrong.
","Third instalment in The Twilight Saga manages to suck dry what was left of the potential for a good movie after the New Moon fiasco and also any interest left in the casual audience, in how the story will conclude in the next, final chapter of the franchise.<br/><br/>Nothing has changed since the previous film and the opening brings a sense of a deja vu. Bella's love affair continues in almost idyllic manner. But it all quickly fades away as the army of newborn vampires ravages Seattle and Victoria, set on revenge, reappears. The only chance for Bella's safety lies in the unlikely alliance of Edward's family and Jacob and his werewolf clan.<br/><br/>With a new director and a plot that finally seems to stumble upon the promise of an excitement , some real thrilling action and first resolutions, things could only be better for Eclipse. As it turns out, weight of the layering romantic dilemmas can kill quicker than fangs or claws.<br/><br/>Film drags, with the inevitable conflict with Victoria looming somewhere on the horizon but ultimately being postponed time and time again. Film is forced, by the nature of the source material into never-ending conversations about the nature of Bella's choice to, for eternity, be with Edward. But neither the consequences of losing her soul or, finally, emerging triangle with Jacob, push forward enough emotional value to make it all engaging. After third or so lengthy dialogue, it's difficult to shake the feeling that we've been listening to the same neurotic note in Stewart's voice since the opening of the Twilight. Frankly, it seems that for all the emotional anxiety in Twilight's characters Woody Allen would make a great director for the next film. By this time however, boring mannerisms of the entire cast are forgettable and foremost forgivable, considering the lines they have to pronounce. It is sad though that five minutes given to Dakota Fanning's on-screen presence pretty much demolish the rest of the performances, with truly frightening intensity that is not only matched by Sheen's appearance in the New Moon. With words not really pushing the story forward, but rather circling around the obvious, you'd at least hope for some CGI supported action. Well...<br/><br/>David Slade attempts grittier and bloodier mood but any hope that the director of atmospheric 30 Days of Night can sustain it, is buried after the first few opening scenes. And it is not until the last 20 minutes that the film moves into less familiar territory. But even then it's let down by the editing that either tries to hide poor special effects or just proves that someone was actually working in the dark. Action sequences are roughly cut and brief- for all the attempt on the tension, they carry too little punch.<br/><br/>Verdict: As it stands, Twilight is a dead man of a cinematic franchise with a personality of a teenage soap opera and a quality of a total bore. Brief moments of self referential humour and quick glimpses of, what supposedly was meant to be an epic, brutal confrontation towards the end is hardly a redeeming value. If there is one fault that dominates over the others it would be that after 2 hours we learn nothing and move in no direction whatsoever. No promises are made and frankly, I couldn't care less if someone will even attempt to improve, with inevitably upcoming Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>1.5/5"
"Quietb-1","2","19","31","9 July 2010"," Abs vs. Drabs
","The Abs or the Drabs... pick one Bella.<br/><br/>The problem is there is not enough story to go the distance. To stretch things out we get repetition and back story way late. We get a graduation speech that says Bella is too young to make a career decision, but she wrestles with the forever decision.<br/><br/>Talk to dad. Visit with mom and sit and talk. Do a lot of walk and talk. Be carried and talk. So much conversation, so quick epic battle.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson plays his role with all the emotion of a dead vampire. With the exception of Ashley Greene, the perky vampire, everyone is depressed. It's no fun to be human, depressing to be a wolf and sucks to be a vampire. A total eclipse of a positive movie experience."
"roemorg","3","12","18","29 July 2010"," The only good thing I have to say is it was better then the first one
","It was better then twilight, in my opinion. Since I was team Jacob, I found new moon better (even if my other review didn't show it)because there was less of the sparkly vamps. I'm also not a romance loving/ chick flick loving type of girl. I like comedies and science fiction movies, and thats why I put up with this mess you call a world wide phenomenon. Its too sappy for me to put up with. New moon was also better, I think, because it had more of the science fiction aspect of the series. And minimum kissing scenes (that I could handle) but thats beside the point.<br/><br/>The point is, eclipse does have more action than the first two combined. But I personally think it has more sappy romance than the first two combined. It also mentions some confusing scenes that you might only understand if you read the short second life of Bree tanner. It made you say to yourself ""I don't remember this in the book"" Bella Swan, just the character, is a train wreck. How can two men fall in love with an emotionless slob like herself. Kristen Sterwt didn't do much better to liven her character up. She just went along with it. And, after sleeping through the second half of the movie, I am officially changing to team Charlie. He's a good actor, and isn't involved in all the sparkly vampire, crazed werewolf, Edward or Jacob stuff. If anyone else is team Charlie, please say this review was useful, so I know if I'm not the only one out there. :)"

","So Bella, was still in love with the vampire Edward, but Jacob the wolfboy kept turning up shirtless to confuse her. And then, vengeful Victoria flitted back into town with the intention of sinking her teeth into Bella, so the feuding vampire and werewolf clans teamed up to protect her and wipe out Victoria's band of bloodthirsty fledglings... The fans may have loved it, wish I could have. Not that I didn't find everything very entertaining and enjoyable, but that's all it really did, entertain. I need to be profoundly or emotionally moved at least once, and to care about the characters just a little, before I can start to consider a movie good. There was all the usual tripe involving Bella's boring normal school friends, and the tacked-on father was still buzzing around, although they managed to get one good humorous scene with him. A frickin' miracle. Oh dear god, all those dopey monologues between Pattinson and Stewart! ""You'll always be my Bella."" Gah. That nonsense always just seems so dumb. I actually thought they cooled off on that a lot compared to before. I was frankly bored with both characters by this point. Their personalities just come and go, and neither is ever too deep or interesting. They're merely okay, like the series itself. I don't like how she wants to be a vampire. That's not technically a good thing, is it? It shouldn't be. That corrupts her somehow. Aww, it was so darling how Edward didn't wanna do it until they were married! Good on for you, Ed! That slimy piece of crotch-rot Lautner was of course around as well. Oh wow, Jacob is now jealous! Never saw that coming... He's so ugly, whenever it showed his face in closeup all I could focus on were the gigantic chompers! Well, to his credit he did seem more relaxed and confident with his role. A highly unusual situation to say the least, sharing a tent with the two monsters vying for your heart, and then huddling up to the one that can never have you for warmth, while things are complicated further by the fact that one of them can read all the other's dirty thoughts! You can't make that up, What a Priceless scene! And I love the self-parodying line from Lautner: ""I am hotter than you."" He wishes! Seriously, it ain't even a question. That's something I really liked that was new, a bit of a sense of humour. There were several snappy tongue-in-cheek lines that really made me laugh. The computer-generated wolves were a little more tolerable. They kept them shadowed and out of the extremely harsh light of day. A wise move. They still just looked daft, though. Much too false for me to feel anything but awkwardness at their presence. The story finally focused on Victoria, and it disappointed. I really loved her in the first two episodes, but I didn't find the character as impressive this time around, and I know why. Bryce Dallas Howard didn't play her anyway near as good as the original actress, she just didn't have that same special fire. Although I had no idea it wasn't the same woman till I looked it up! I thought they kinda squandered her by making her a full-blown villainess. She was much more appealing as a gypsy/rogue or whatever she was supposed to be before. Hmm. Oh well. One of the few genuine bum notes, I thought, was that Xavier whoevier guy as Victoria's little sidekick. I thought he made for one god awful boring baddie, and I could tell she was just playing him right away. It was great fun to see Dakota Fanning return in a more substantial capacity than the mere cameo she had in part 2. Pretty much she alone now represented the awesome wrath of the ancient council of vampires. She was a real back-breaker. Loved that-""PAIN power!"" wouldn't mind trying that out on a few folk myself! So Cameron Bright was supposed to be her brother, I thought they were alike. Cameron didn't get more than a bit part...no big loss there. Although I thought she was great, I still didn't buy her as the type of threatening authoritative figure she was portraying. She was too damn petite to take seriously! What an evil little witch. Poor little Jodelle Ferland. I recognised her from the excellent Masters of Horror episode ""The V- Word."" What I loved best about this film was three stories told in flashback that reveal how the werewolf clan first encountered the vampires, and the origins of two of the Cullens. I thought it gave them both some depth. In Jasper's story, the triad of vampire ladies brought to my mind the three Gorgon sisters of Greek mythology. It was history repeating, the way Victoria was using Riley, the way Jasper had been manipulated. And I thought Rosalie's tale of shame and justified revenge was also excellent. I thought what happened to her was quite nasty, for this. That's one of the problems, although people die and everything, it's like it's always kept at a PG level and family friendly. Despite these very impressive sequences I thought the main plot wasn't all that gripping, and the pacing floundered toward the end. The build up was good, but the big climactic fight was a little too brief for me. Everything is topped off with a highly-unsatisfying and flimsy final scene with Edward and Bella in some bright floral setting, looking forward to their wedding... I was ultimately left with a flat type of a feeling as the credits rolled. I thought this third helping of Twilight was better than the second. They cranked up the impressive cinematic action and wit, and kept the meaningless monologues and some of the goofier effects down. It got more right than it did wrong. An admirable effort."
"terry-vogelaar","5","5","6","14 January 2012"," Poor adaptation
","The book Eclipse for me is much more interesting than the previous 2 books in the Twilight saga. But unfortunately this film adaptation doesn't present this story well. For example: in the book, the collaboration of the Werewolf pack and the Vampires is unlikely for a fair part of the book, and then it happens. But in this movie, this plot is given away much too early, ruining the storytelling.<br/><br/>And then there are those little things that just shouldn't be in any movie. I mean the camera shake in the simplest of all shots. There is nothing wrong with the action-shots; they did the effort there. But a simple shot of a conversation? Camera is shaking like the Blair Witch Project. Why?"

","This film was a little better than New Moon, but that isn't saying much. It's still rather boring and is just silly. What is it with Victoria running crazy fast through the woods? I mean that makes her really bad. Why can the guy vampire get into Bella's house to look around but she can't. And why didn't he just wait in the house for Bella. And Kristen Stewart just looks silly with these ridiculous facial expressions, do I choose a vampire or werewolf. You would think a vampire army would be a little exciting, but I sure didn't think so. The werewolf CGI is really bad.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Only watch it if you can see it for free."

","Trust me, watching this film was not my choice. My friend watched it and she enjoyed it and thought it would be something that I enjoyed. Unfortunately, she was wrong. I never had any interest in the Twilight series, but I thought I'd give this movie a chance just for the heck of it.<br/><br/>First off, I felt that this film was quite pointless. It was also all over the place and sometimes it was difficult to understand what was going on. I guess that the main plot was a war between the vampires and the werewolves, but as far as I remember, it was never explained too well.<br/><br/>Another thing is the cast. While watching this movie, I did not get the impression that Bella was 'whiny' like some people have said. Although, I wasn't particularly impressed with the other cast members either.<br/><br/>Even with that said, there were two performances that I did moderately enjoy. I liked the acting of Xavier Samuel (Riley) and Jodelle Ferland (Bree). From this movie, I can tell that both of them have great potential as actors, and they should be in films that prove that greater than this one.<br/><br/>Overall, this was not a great film. I wouldn't recommend this movie."
"mg3-926-816857","4","5","6","19 December 2010"," Jacob, can you just put a shirt on?
","Eclipse is the third installment of the twilight saga books. This is worse than New Moon, and even worser than Twilight. The effects used in the vampires are seriously horrible. The contacts, hair, makeup, and the speed/strength look really really fake. The werewolves are the same as the last movie, but when they are human, they are fake with the same bad makeup. My next topic is Jacob. The guy that almost every girl loves and wishes Bella would stay in the end. But throughout this whole film, 90% of the time he is shirtless. The director most likely did this in purpose so girls would go see the movie and want to go see Breaking Dawn. Then the scene where Bella and Edward are about to have sex could be really embarrassing if someone goes see the movie with their parents or relatives.So it is proved that the rumors that Twilight is all about sex and relationships prove to be true. Another thing is that in comparison to the book, the movie is really bad. The Volturi are barely at all in this movie when they should be for more time. And what is up with Bree? The newborn character that shows barely of her. If they were going to show her, they should have shown more of her or not at all. Lastly the movie does not make me want to go see Breaking Dawn. Even though the book is awesome, if the saga continues like this many people including myself will not go see it. In conclusion the movie was bad, and not as great as the actors bragged it would be."

I don't mean the wimpy stuff, but there was some action, definitely more than the last one, and it kept me periodically from falling into sickening convulsions. Oh, yeah, by the way, I did nod offtwice I kid you not I fell asleep twice in the same movie, during the middle of the afternoon and I wasn't tired when I went in. But worth the price of admission was that my girlfriend admitted during the movie that it was a 'little slower than she had expected'. But the bad news is that on the way out she said that she was sure that the NEXT one would be better (for sure). Oh, noooooooo.

Here things go on and it's not all about talking and blah blah like in the first part. Again, Bella Swan can't decide who to choose, the vampire or the werewolf. If i had to met a girl who can't choose after all that time then she isn't worth waiting for. Anyhow, she even cheat on Edward Cullen by kissing Jacob Black just in front of him. Some parts were really enjoying but again the best parts are without the two leads. Still, for me the use of CGI wolfs is the let down of the movie, and they are bigger than a human...Like many have written, if you are into Twilight you will like it otherwise leave it as it is. Some nostalgia was in the picture for me, the lead singer of old school goth band Bauhaus has a appearance of maybe 30 seconds, but what a great performance.

I am actually one of those who enjoyed both Twilight and New Moon, so I guess you could say I'm a ""fan"". Why is it bad you ask? It's incredibly slow, dull, and most of all sloppy. To the huge Twilight fans: you get to see Edward and Bella make out the entire movie and even Jacob with his shirt off sporting his spray-on abs. <br/><br/>Jacob's (Taylor Lautner's)acting is about the same as the Twilight movies: it gets incredibly worse as the series moves along. He is about as bad as Channing Tatum and thats being nice.<br/><br/>The only decent part of this movie is the fight scenes, which are really short-lived. Please, don't waste your time on this movie just read the book. If you want a summary of Eclipse, here it is: Jacob confesses his love or Bella and kisses her only to have her punch him in the face; on the other hand, Edward proposes to Bella with her of course replying ""yes"". The vampires and ware wolves also team up to defeat the ""new born"" vampires, which ends up being a relatively easy task.

I understand this isn't the way women think. Really to me, Eclipse was just repeating the love triangle of the trio adding in some action which was just *YAWN*. The fact still remains about movies like these. I expected this movie to just be a big fat let-down and it was. Clearly, to all the fairs who get hyper-excited are clearly gonna love this movie. It's really the way you think. Negative to Negative and Positive to Positive. And I 100% disagree with some people that they mention that they hated the first two films of the saga.

All the plot and all the action takes place around Bella once more (the main female character) and everything seems to be made for the female crowd to feel in love with Edward and to get impressed from Jacob (the two ""lovers"" of Bella). The script is poor, the director isn't exactly that interested to tell a story but to impress the females by showing highly emotional scenes between Bella and her ""lovers"" and finally, the actors are doing a great job in not doing anything at all. Kristen Stewart (Bella) changes only two types of faces (just the same as before)and Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner (Edward and Jacob) are just being over reacting to play the ""perfect guy"", for the ladies watching this movie.

","The first one was better and that was just a 3 or 4. This one is weak. The SFX are not done right. The second one had better production. The story is just whatever, really mild and uninteresting. Edward Bella and Jacob have no chemistry. There is no romance that I could tell. Edward and Jacob don't seem like arch enemies. I didn't buy it. Kristen Stewart was way better in the first Twilight. In Eclipse she's is way bland. It's totally forgettable performance. The books had her personality better done. My girlfriend liked it more than me. However even she liked the first two far better. I hope the next ones will be an improvement. Maybe die hard fans will say it's okay, but overall it didn't match the first one or even the second. It sucked. 2/10"

AND THEN....... the only time its mention is when she says... ""yeh but... i love you more""...<br/><br/>i mean COME ON!.... you'd expect the boyfriend to flip and say something... throw a punch.... but no..... its all brushed under the carpet by the end of the film and everything is la de dah.

"chrisjcousens","2","10","15","25 July 2010"," Like it's vampires, Twilight: Eclipse has no soul.
","I will not provide extended comment upon the twisted morality that drives the Twilight Saga, its degrading treatment of female characters and racial difference, but will instead review the film, not the messages that is sends to its generally impressionable audience.<br/><br/>While the back of the DVD case will likely say that the plot consists of Bella (Human) struggling with her conflicting feelings for Jacob (Werewolf) and Edward (Vampire), a love triangle complicating a sinister plot to kill her, this is somewhat misleading. Firstly, because there doesn't seem to be any conflict in Bella's feelings – she seems totally dedicated to Edward, never giving a hint of inner turmoil. This means that when she does decide that she likes Jacob too, the moment is meaningless, given the total lack of believable emotional build-up. Secondly, any sense of menace or drama from the bad guys is undermined by how little trouble they actually cause. A posse of supposedly extra-strong Newborn vampires attack Bella's smaller troupe of vampire and werewolf friends. The climactic battle sees a total of zero casualties on the good guy side, and the duel between Edward and Victoria, the 'mastermind' behind the miserable excuse for an evil scheme, likewise is almost entirely bloodless.<br/><br/>All of this is to say that Twilight: Eclipse presents a kind of soulless emotional vacuum – none of the romantic leads seem to have any feeling, or any expression beyond an occasional wince, and the sense of fear or suspense needed to add tension in the void of emotional involvement is absent. The young actors manage to make Keanu Reeves appear talented, and while they are not served well by the wafer-thin plot, they seem to be reading teleprompters, complete with stage directions.<br/><br/>The direction continues to rely on blue gels to create 'atmosphere', the effect achieved is one of dreariness that reflects the audience reaction. Unfortunately for David Slade, there is more to making a good film than pointing a camera at some stuff and putting 'Twilight' on the case.<br/><br/>Twilight: Eclipse is listless and emotionless, lacking tension and drama, humour and excitement, without redemption from the actors, director or effects. The general competence of the production is all that saves this from being completely laughable, as any film with this much money behind it will look and sound professionally made, but while the film may be justified financially, artistically it is inexcusable."

","I saw Twilight on television. See my review of it on this site. That movie was enough. I skipped the second movie. There was absolutely nothing to see around here, so I reluctantly saw this crap last evening. My friend and I were going to leave after about one half hour, but because the admission price of a ticket was so costly, we stayed. Oh, torture. A real teen movie with a 25 year old Pattinson who simply, to me, is not all that, and an 18 year old buffed bodied kid with such a bulbous and wide nose, well, that is all you see of Taylor Lautner the minute he appears on screen--that big, wide nose. And this, the result of a nose job, too. I do not see the appeal of him or for him. Sure, he has a nice physique, but even with his nose job, he needs another. His nose is all over his face. I read there was not much they could have done. Some noses are like that, especially with thick nose skin. I repeat: a teen movie and with horrible acting encased in a juvenile plot, that is fantasy come to life. Teens made this saga a hot money maker, and now a third one is coming. Awful. Complete garbage. And the wigs in this movie were so obvious, it bordered on the absurd. Stay home."
"NicOldert","1","35","66","2 July 2010"," Avoid this movie unless you're a teenage girl in love with Edward
","The hype surrounding the Twilight saga ensures that movie houses are filled to capacity for this third installment, but the truth is that this film is so bad it should be shredded. The plot is so weak that if it wasn't for the endless (and boring) conversation between Bella and Edward about whether she should become a vampire there would be no plot at all. The rationale for the attack of the newborns is feeble and Bella's familial relationships vacuous. If the characters were one-dimensional they would gain a full dimension in weight. The absurd inconsistencies are, in fact, the only source of entertainment -- like the fact that Bella struggles with hypothermia while in her big thick sleeping bag but, the next morning, stands outside in the snow in a light fleece without so much as a shiver. The movie, obviously, targets teenage girls in love with Pattinson and Lautner; everyone else should avoid it."

","Okay let me start out by saying this installment along wth the other two fails. I read the books and I was never particularly fond of them... I'm a Harry Potter shipper. The books have always lacked the dimension and depth that really makes a book, or series. A standout. There was none of complexity in the books that I love about HP. Twilight Saga is completely one sided and easily forgettable in my eyes. And the movies.. Oh my they are HORRENDOUS! The acting is well, one sided. Once again no complexity or even chemistry. The actors aren't believable. At all. And these movies WOULD NOT be the success they are if it weren't for crazed Tweens and teens. Being a teen female myself, I just don't see it. I can't stand Lautner's, Pattinson's, or Stewarts acting. Oh and to some of the reviewers mentioning how haters don't understand the deeper story line or whatever that bull is.... There is NO deeper story line, the plot is weak and it's all just one sided fluff.<br/><br/>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME...

"wricketts","4","12","19","5 July 2010"," Not a new moon: just the same old, moralizing moon as before.
","By far the best of the three to date, which isn't necessarily saying much. At least Eclipse has a plot that makes some actual, coherent sense, and events are set up and fully explained rather than just being dumped on the viewer without preparation. There's a new director in town (each chapter has had a different director; Chris Weitz of Twilight II was truly a hack), and this one appears to understand things like pacing. The moralistic propaganda continues to spew forth at high volume, and what's interesting is that Bella emerges here as the little slut: she's leading two men on, passionately throwing herself at both of them; she's the one who wants to become a vampire, and she's the one who tries to seduce Edward, despite the risk to her (he declines not because he might, in the heat of passion, eat her, but because he's an old-fashioned guy who doesn't believe in sex before marriage). What's so addictive about the series, which could perhaps also be said of all High Romances, is that it posits the ""loved one"" as the absolute center of the entire universe: no one worries about his job or because his boss is a jerk or, for that matter, about being unemployed; no one needs money; no one suffers from depression, anxiety, or loneliness; no one wonders about the purpose of her or his life; no one has any problems whatsoever except those caused by love; the human characters rarely eat, sleep, study, read, or participate in other normal activities. When the couple relationship is life's only issue, life becomes extremely simple. Of course, given the nature of the story, it is a highly dramatic and unstable life, but that's also par for the adolescent course: jealousies are invented; problems appear in the relationship out of thin air (maybe I'm not right for you; you love me, but you don't love me enough; no, I must leave you forever, it's the only way!); the tenor, color, and direction of Bella's entire existence shifts 180 degrees on the basis of a single conversation; and the extended cast is swept into the innumerable conflicts that are born in the effort to preserve the couple at all costs (indeed, Bella and Edward's friends and family barely have existences of their own and have no function other than to provide support for the tribulations and ordeals of the couple). The acting, on the whole, never rises above mediocre: Taylor Lautner's Valley Boy demeanor and Keanu Reeves-like blankness makes him Hollywood's most unconvincing Indian (though it was an excellent move when, halfway through Twilight II, he lost his dreadful long-hair wig and went back to his military cut). He's beautiful-ugly: the over-pumped, muscular body that threatens to consume his head, his bizarrely developed trapezius muscles, the world's tiniest nipples (I'm not the only one who noticed: they were Photoshopped for his shirtless movie posters), and a nose that spreads from ear to ear. His face is substantially without expression, though he's terrifying when he smiles. Still there are moments, most often when he's filmed in the middle distance, when his statuesque presence is affecting indeed. Robert Pattinson has a hard time forcing any genuine emotion through that pancake makeup, which is, to a greater or lesser extent, a problem that afflicts the entire cast of vampires; Kristen Stewart's Bella, meanwhile, mostly leaves you not understanding why Edward and Jacob are ready to rip each other to shreds over her; Bella is a stubborn, demanding, bourgeois princess with all the depth and personality of Formica. What do they see in her? Maybe it'll be revealed in the next ten installments. One thing is for sure: Despite the relentless hype about the way the Twilight series is a demonstration of ""girrlpower,"" Bella is no Buffy. She's pushy and willful but not strong, impulsive but not thoughtful, imperative but committed to nothing and no one beyond her own desires. Most important of all, she has made her man the entire purpose and fulcrum of her existence, ready to abandon everything (including her parents) in order to Be With Him. That makes her a relic, not a role model."

They try but I think there is a thin veil of hatred for the characters and to them it is just a franchise and money on the side.<br/><br/>What I mean is I saw The Runaways with Kristen Stewart and Daktoa Fanning and both actors have far more emotions, expressions and seem to really get into character as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. While on Eclipse their skills are so wooden, Kristen as Bella is still a blank canvas only slightly going ""Oh no Jacob don't fight Edward"" with a stunned fish expression.<br/><br/>Robert tries to capture Edward but as I said they seem sick of the character.<br/><br/>The fight scene was the only worth while scene. Sorry this isn't going to be in my DVD collection."
"devilsadvocatered6","2","6","8","27 February 2014"," Say what?
","Maybe it's time I stopped reviewing these movies. They're very obviously bad, critically panned and only appeal to a niche market that may have already moved on to greener pastures. More seriously than that, my insomnia is getting worse with each passing film. I can even see ghostly brunettes doused with body glitter in my peripheral vision when I lose my concentration, which happens more often than I'd like.<br/><br/>But that's not important. What is important is getting my thoughts down before my short term memory deletes itself in a rather effective and welcome fit of self-defense again. Honestly, I don't remember the events leading up to this film even though I just saw them a few days ago. Where do I even begin with this one? Just the opening sequence was laughably terrible even though I have forgotten how to laugh since witnessing that second movie. In fact, I can't even force myself to smile anymore. The muscles responsible for that seem to be numb and I can't restore feeling to them. Is that normal?<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie opens with Bella and Edward laying in an uncharacteristically colorful scene of a field full of flowers taking part in their favorite pastime: vapidly staring each other in the face. Just as I'm wondering if they ever do anything else, Edward randomly proposes marriage even though he has known Bella for a grand total of a a few months to a year at this point in the 'story'. This series is kind of funny about the passage of time. What I do know is that graduation is coming up for Bella and her cast of ancillary characters, but that's not even a plot point. No, their idea of a plot point is having Edward become even creepier. Stalking her and watching her sleep wasn't enough, he has to go and disable her truck in this one to dictate to her where she can go and who she can talk to. In this case it's Jacob, who indicates he has become a slightly darker character than before by greasing up his hair a little. Nothing says unstoppable badass like mousse right, Spider-Man 3?<br/><br/>A lot of problems arise with the storytelling here, especially if you're a person that likes to use their brain. Apparently the antagonist here is the redhead from the first movie who is still after Bella even though she is continuously chased away by the wolves or the Cullens. Seriously? She has no reason to go after Bella. As I recall, even though my memory is admittedly hazy, it was her dumbass boyfriend who decided to go after Bella in the first place and paid the price for it. Bella wasn't even able to defend herself, so what's the big deal? And then aliens landed and probed the vampires, who liked it a little too much. Orwait, I might have been watching CineMax late again and dreamt that part.<br/><br/>Jacob insists that Bella is in love with him and Edward tries to frown but fails miserably. Get used to that because that's the bulk of the movie. Except for one part where Jacob sexually assaults Bella, who punches him in the face so hard that she breaks her hand without making him flinch in the slightest. Her father is oddly okay with this and the very obvious bite scar on her wrist from...somewhere. I'm trying to remember where that came from, but it's like static in my brain. <br/><br/>The storytelling will really grate on the nerves when some of the side characters share their stories and they turn out to be infinitely more interesting than the movie's plot! Like Rose who was gang raped, turned into a vampire then pursued revenge on her attackers, saving the main one for last like a snack to prolong his suffering. Hey, redhead still poorly chasing after Bella! THAT is how you revenge! Or, hey, what about the one vampire who was a high ranking officer for the Confederacy in the Civil War before he was changed into a vampire? Nope, these awesome stories take about 5 minutes of run time because we still have to endure more of Bella and Edward staring at each other. Isn't that fun?<br/><br/>Anyway, the redhead decides her best shot at killing Bella is to create an army of vampires who are, by all accounts, much stronger in their first months than seasoned vampires who have been around for centuries. Guess what? When the climax of the film rolls around, the Cullens and the wolves win the battle without a single casualty save for Jacob, who gets some broken bones but will be up and around for the next movie. By the way, that whole confrontation between Edward and the redhead? Stupid. There's no menace or suspense here, he's fighting someone half his size! Guess who wins. Seriously, take a wild guess. I'll go get a sandwich and wait.<br/><br/>you ready for this? Sit down, this will completely blow you away: EDWARD EMERGES VICTORIOUS! Wow, that was awesome the way you easily beat up that poor girl and ripped her head off! Yeah! And what do we get at the end for putting up with this? Another scene in a field of flowers where Edward and Bella set the date for their wedding. Yup. That was what the movie was leading up to. I don't think fist fighting a bear will save my testosterone this time. I'm going to need two bears with chainsaws for hands, so excuse me. I have some surgery to perform."
"soph-94","3","6","8","23 October 2013"," Probably the worst of the Twilight Saga movies
","If Twilight 1 was a rather good adaptation of the book, Twilight 2 - New Moon already started to wander off. But there is almost no way this comes from the Twilight book 'Eclipse' alone. I read all four of them after the first movie came out, and I liked it, even though you have to admit there is not much action going on - but that's what I liked, being in Bella's head and feeling as she did. When the second movie came out I was eager to see it, and a bit disappointed afterwards. But this time, it's worse than ""a tad off script"". There are so many ways this movie is not good that I never watched it again, even though as I said I liked the original story.<br/><br/>Firstly, but that came in the second movie too, the eyes are really bad. That doesn't even look like contact lenses, it's almost like they photoshoped them badly after the vampire scenes were shot.<br/><br/>Secondly, someone will have to explain to me why they put together the 'Eclipse' book and the ""The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner"" book. The whole point of Eclipse was that they didn't know, and therefore YOU didn't know, why so many people were dying in Seattle. If you show immediately in the movie that a bunch of new and wild vampires are playing hide and seek with the entire population and eating whoever they find, that aspect is completely ruined. Furthermore, you're not supposed to know that the Volturi know about any of this mayhem, but again they show it in the movie as if it was no big deal. Yes, all of this brings a bit of action in the movie, but if you didn't want an actionless movie you shouldn't have decided to adapt an actionless book. They did the same with that ridiculous fight scene at the end of Breaking Dawn Part II, which does not exist in the book, just so that there would be a bit of interesting stuff. Hello people, if they're watching the fifth movie it's because they already saw the first four and wanted to end it, no need to put crap in the last ten minutes of the movie as if it was going to change anything.<br/><br/>Anyway, my advice would be: Twilight one if okay, two if you must, and if you want to know what happens next, read book three, don't watch the movie, and move on to movies 4 and 5 who stick more to the books, if not for that final scene. If you are not a girl, and don't have a girlfriend pushing you, do none of the above, you'll just waste a lot of hours because there are very slim chances of you enjoying it."
"MaximumMadness","6","6","8","4 February 2012"," The Best Entry in the ""Twilight"" Franchise... Still a sloppy, boring film, but a BIG step up after the abysmal second film...
","People who have read my reviews for ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"" know I'm not a fan of the series. But at the same time, I'm not a hater. I'm basically indifferent, and am only watching them as they become available for free to see what the fuss is all about.<br/><br/>I found the first film to be halfway decent (nowhere near as bad as the reputation), but it did suffer from sloppy direction (courtesy Catherine Hardwicke, whom has never impressed me) and a boring storyline that didn't take advantage of the material. The second film was much more competently made, and had top notch direction, but suffered from a painfully boring script and hollow characters, and ended up being one of my most hated films of recent memory as a result.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find that this entry was actually the best of the series thus far. Directed by the talented David Slade, this film delivers a suitable tone and style, and actually has a sense of completion. It didn't feel as vapid and lifeless as the first two entries.<br/><br/>When the evil Victoria (the gorgeous Bryce Dallas Howard) begins creating an army of vicious ""newborn"" vampires to get revenge against Bella and the Cullens, Edward (Robert Pattinson) is forced to team up with his rival Jacob the werewolf (Taylor Laughtner), in order to protect his love Bella (Kristen Stewart). That's basically the important plot line. They do try to add tension to the relationship of Bella and Edward, and make you guess more if Bella should be with Jacob, but it isn't important.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a well made film, courtesy of Slade's direction. It feels more confident and more secure with itself. The visuals are actually quite remarkable, and the battle sequences are well done, although still too brief. It is simply the best-made film in the series, and this is what makes it the best.<br/><br/>However, it still has a large share of problems.<br/><br/>For one, the characters are still infuriating. Bella still comes off as a complete jerk, Jacob is tedious and unlikable, Edward is still too much of a ""wuss"" at times. The main characters just aren't compelling, and I found myself worried more for the secondary characters (particularly the sweethearted vampire Alice, played by Ashley Greene, who is one of the only truly likable characters in the franchise). Also, the villainess, though played well, is underdeveloped beyond belief. Howard tries her hardest, but Victoria has always been uninteresting since her introduction- she's simply evil for the sake of being evil.<br/><br/>Also, the film wastes too much time on the romance, which was basically ""completed"" in the second film. Dragging out the ""Who will Bella be with?"" storyline is pointless, and even though the script was written by a woman, the film feels very misogynistic at times.<br/><br/>The writing is as corny and cringe-inducing as always. The film is still very boring, the acting is still a mixed bag. It's all very mediocre.<br/><br/>But as I said, this is easily the best-made film in the series, and is arguably the first entry to actually accomplish something of a plot. It was very watchable, even though the series feels like a Hallmark TV movie, with lame production values and bad writing. And for that, it gets credit, and I will say I kind of enjoyed it in a way.<br/><br/>I give it a just-slightly-above average 6 out of 10. This series still does not deserve all of the attention it gets, but it's OK."
"Nywildcat1","4","6","8","3 January 2012"," I really don't understand what all the fuss is about
","I've really tried to understand why these movies and books are so popular. I read the first book, and though it was a somewhat fun read, I didn't' see what all the hoopla was about and didn't bother reading all the others.<br/><br/>The first Twilight I found to be entertaining, New Moon was a snoozefest, and now Eclipse found me straining to keep my eyes open. In all honesty, it just seems like nothing ever really happens. Yes, there are some short action sequences, and it was interesting to get some background information on some of the Cullens, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I've really tried to understand why Edward and Jake are so into Bella, and I really don't get it. She's not that interesting of a person and she's always walking around in what seems to me to be a gloomy state. Really, guys, just move on! Also, (just as a sidebar), if the werewolves shorts can magically reappear after they turn back into a human, why do they run around without shirts? Shouldn't they reappear too? Just a thought.<br/><br/>It also seems to me as if the actors are bored in this film too. Especially Kristen Stewart. She seems as though she would rather be anywhere than making another Twilight movie.<br/><br/>But I think the overall problem is that there are really no surprises, no twist and turns in any of the movies. It's all pretty straightforward and predictable. Quite honestly, I find the TV show ""The Vampire Diaries"" to be far superior to Twilight in almost every way. It has the same premise, more or less (mortal girl torn between her love for two supernatural beings), except that you need a score card to keep up with what's going on. Every week is a roller-coaster ride, which is really enjoyable, and you completely understand why everyone is into the lead girl. And that's what I thought Twilight should have been like.<br/><br/>I guess at the end of the day, you can never underestimate the power of marketing, both for the books and the movies, or the buying power of the average teenage girl."
"kimsebastian_keski","4","6","8","5 July 2011"," There is no point in writing a summary since the movie lacks a real plot.
","Honestly I didn't think this movie would be such a disappointment considering ""Bella"", ""Edward"" and ""Jakob"" has had two attempts already in the previous movies to learn how to act. Considering the hype revolving this movie I really thought it would differ more from the first and second one, but to me it only feels like one prolonged version of the first. Besides lacking in plot, the movie also has to much romance without anything leading up to it. It's like Edward and Bella are attached to each others lips to the extent of being unable to communicate with oneanother. It's not that I don't like romance quite the contrary, It's just hard for me to believe in them being In love, since they never seem to connect in any way. Also I really don't like the cop-father what's his face, he reminds me of Deputy Doofy from scary movie.<br/><br/>Im not even going to mention all the incorrect facts ""Stephanie Meyer"" writes about vampires, but it is tedious work to try to ignore while watching the movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I urge everyone who's not a twelve-year old girl on acid, not to waste you precious time watching this movie. It doesn't matter how many awards it has received or records it has broken, people who enjoy this and consider it to be a movie of the vampire genre are (no offense) retarded.<br/><br/>Still it get's a 4 because I'm in generous mood and despite the fact that ""Bella"" looks like a junky she's kind of cute in a cancer kind of way:)"

","I'm neither a fan nor a hater of Meyer's Twillight books. There might have been a way of making a good film adaption of the books-with a decent script and good actors. <br/><br/>But Eclipse failed on both. It was truly painful and embarrassing to watch. The dialogue consisted mostly of stilted superficial one liners-there wasn't any depth or credibility to the whole love story at all. <br/><br/>Which brings up the point of bad acting. The main characters were extremely tedious and lacked personality and credibility. Which is partly due of the poor script and dialogue but also due to bad acting of the lead actors. They can't bring their characters to life or deliver their lines-Stewart looks emotionless and wooden-so does Pattinson (at least he has the excuse that he is supposed to be dead).<br/><br/>The film's focus is on the romance between Bella, Edward (the vampire) and Jakob (the werewolf)-due to the poor script and bad acting the whole thing comes across as emotionless and superficial.

The love triangle which can be subtley told in a book doesn't transcend well onto screen, scene after scene of bad young actors attempting to express emotion was tedious and frustrating. (i watched this on its DVD release and had to fast forward some of the bella/edward scenes) <br/><br/>the only saving factor was the side story scenes of the newborn army buildup, and the writers do attempt to have Bella give an explanation for wanting to be a vamp at the end after it becomes so clear to anyone with brains that its the wrong choice - meyer fails to rectify this point in the book.<br/><br/>I watched this third installment out of curiosity but i wont bother with the fourth.

","I'm not one of those die-hard, Twilight-crazed fans, but I did really enjoy reading the novels and own the first movie on DVD. There was an excitement & buzz with the first Twilight movie and its young up- and-coming cast. This was a great story of sacrifice & forbidden love...<br/><br/>However, by Eclipse, all the momentum & excitement built in the previous movies was GONE. I mean, as cold & dead as Edward Cullen's heart! The movie tries to carry the complicated, lovey-dovey relationship between Edward & Bella right from the opening scene -- but something is amiss. The lighting is fake, the vampire makeup way too pale & dramatic, and too many of the main characters have completely FAKE & distracting hair pieces (including Kristen Stewart wearing a terrible, oddly colored brown wig!).<br/><br/>Bella's character & her dialogue had lost its pessimistic & sarcastic edge. All continuity from the previous movies was gone. I believe Stewart was also filming The Runaways, but ALL the actors were just going through the motions, I felt. They were more concerned with their hair, makeup, clothes & action shots than the edgy & dark story line. The dialogue too, particularly with Jacob, is laugh-out-loud cheesy. No wonder they just keep him on camera shirtless. Taylor Laudner will be lucky to ever land another real ""acting"" gig again! He's eye candy, and not even that good looking when you actually study his face.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but roll my eyes during much of this movie. I felt almost embarrassed for the cast! It was just cheesy around every turn. When there was supposed to be high drama & tension (Victoria is here! Or Jacob & the pack show up at Alice's graduation party! OMG!) -- nothing, nada, BORING! This movie just lacked the ups-and-downs & drama it had before. I can only hope that the final installments will get better, not worse."

","There are legions of ardent fans of this Twilight Saga - this third installment is ECLIPSE - and they obviously have their reasons for loving both the books and the movies. That's good news, especially for Stephenie Meyer who is probably only second to JK Rowling (Harry Potter series) in skyrocketing income from the transformation of book to screen adventure. The scenery in Vancouver,BC is pretty and the music and lyrics for the film by Howard Shore is meant to add to the story line. <br/><br/>The script by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done some fine work on the television series 'Dexter') is written in staccato phrases - one-liners that don't really allow the actors to express much real emotion under such confines. For this viewer this is one of the main reasons the film doesn't fly. Even if one can buy into the fairytale atmosphere of flatline normal human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) falling for rather stiff and distant and oh so proper vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson, who has proved in his other films 'Remember Me' and 'Little Ashes' that he actually CAN act) while at the same time falling in love with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner, ever more buff and using his physique to great advantage in almost every scene), there are problems with the story for the casual viewer who hasn't read the Twilight Saga or followed the previous films. Despite the film's building to the altercation and confrontation between Seattle vampires versus the small town Cullen vampires now supported by the town's werewolves courtesy of Jacob et al the story feels static. No emotion: script versus acting - it is a toss up. Once again Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick (so fine in 'Up in the Air') add to the quality. The werewolves are huge and cuddly, and the blue meadow flowers serving as background for Edward and Bella that open and close the film are nice. <br/><br/>And we have two more episodes to go - or more... Definitely an acquired taste. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Now, saying that I think the movies are better than the books and Kristen Stewart is trying too hard to bring angst to the roll and cannot pull it off. I've seen her other movies and she played the same type of character i.e. quiet, sullen. So she phones it in. The storyline takes adult material (death, procreation, marriage, sex, love) then puts spoiled kids for our kids to relate to. It doesn't work! Why is Bella so damaged? Was she mistreated, abandoned, there has to be a reason for her attitude! Read critic's reviews, these are educated people who have seen thousands of movies and panned it across the board! I do have to say, I really like how the adults in the movie did, Carlisle, Billy, and Charlie. They had depth, history, and a purpose!"

","On the whole, the movie was well made. Fair production values, photography, and special effects. The actors and actresses all rendered acceptable performances. But the essence of the movie almost made me choke. (Note: I have an unusually strong stomach.) What it was is that it was pervasively infested with ""relationship"" conflicts, confused emotionalism, laughable protestations of undying ""love"" not based on anything substantive, and incredibly shallow dialog that sounded hauntingly as if it came straight out of any daytime soap opera – in short: it was like sawing off the top of a 12 year old girl's head and getting a naked look into her mind. Not pretty. (By way of further explanation, the 12 year old girls I have seen coming out of ""Twilight"" movies are generally starry-eyed and smiling widely, whereas the 18 year old girls were often disappointed and disbelieving that any guy would NOT do the heroine at the drop of a hat.) That is the difference a little life experience/realism makes.<br/><br/>There was one quite funny line in the movie worth mentioning. That was when Edward (the main vampire) looks at the perpetually shirtless Jacob (who put on about 50 pounds of muscle for his role in the ""Twilight"" series) and said, ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" Bwahahaha!"

","In typical Twilight Saga fashion, they have yet again taken what would have been a very good 20 minute movie and extended it out to a couple hours by adding in a bunch of mind-numbing, nails on a chalkboard, high school drama. This movie did have a few fairly exciting parts, but nowhere near enough to redeem the incessant bickering between the Bella, Jacob, and Edward triangle. I love you, I don't love you, kiss me, I mean stay away, I mean I love you, blah, blah, blah, Ad infinium. It is pretty sad that I spent the money to go see this just to spend the entire time praying for some stray claw or fang to accidentally decapitate the indecisive, annoying Bella. Poor acting, and terrible dialog make this one a 3 star."

","Personally, i am a Twihard, but I also enjoy a GOOD movie. And finally there is a good Twilight movie. The first movie, if you has read the book as i have, sucked. New Moon was a bit better. It stuck to the book more but the acting still sucked. Eclipse..... best one yet. The acting of the major actors/actresses has improved dramatically. There is a bit more comedy, more to laugh at. The movie starts with intense drama, passion, and comedy all developing into more and more till your on the edge of your seat. The story line is stronger this time around and sticks so much to the book that it is the book, just on the screen. Any Twilight fans who are skeptical about how this movie will turn out will be surprised once they see it because it IS the best one yet and i am looking forward greatly to see how they do on the last book, both parts.

","I am not a typical Twilight fan.... I'm not in the age group, I'm not the right gender, but I love film and shockingly thought that the original Twilight was, well, great.<br/><br/>TOT (the original Twilight) directed by Catherine Hardwicke was full of subtlety, inspirirng cinematography, the unwinding of the mystery of the Cullens and how the introduction of Bella into that world and in reality opening her eyes to the entire world. TOT branded the story as being smoky, mysterious, and filled with connections for anybody who watched it.<br/><br/>Then they got rid of Hardwicke.... and now that Eclipse and New Moon are out, it's clear that the creative identity of the films IS, without a doubt, her.<br/><br/>Eclipse takes the premise of a vampire skirmish and stretches that alone to a 2hr 4min stretch of poorly directed intimacies, snappy one liners, and.... well I just saw the movie and I don't remember anything else other than the anticlimatically filmed primary scene of the movie which I won't identify here to save people the serious spoiler.<br/><br/>You should wait for DVD so you can have something else to do while you are watching, because this poorly directed and written portion of the story is insulting to TOT.<br/><br/>I don't know why Hardwicke isn't directing these, but it will go down as the stupidest creative decision of this decade in film for sure. I'd be willing to bet that some egotistical moron at Summit was thinking greedy and that Hardwicke wasn't gonna be able to helm something with so much more money riding on it.... insert headslap here.<br/><br/>very very disappointing...

From that point on, I just played with my phone while the story ground to a sludgy conclusion.<br/><br/>The plot is enough for maybe 30 mins. The rest of the film is padded with ridiculously wooden actors supposedly wrestling with intense emotions. We know this because they say so, in flat, deadpan voices, and kiss occasionally. They certainly don't display any convincing emotional realism!<br/><br/>Actually the only character who showed anything like watchable acting was the evil Victoria. The contrast with the others was amazing. I've seen the heroine and Pattison in other things where they were better, so can only assume that the directing was the problem, not the actors.<br/><br/>The thing that held my interest most was the ridiculousness of the vampire myth in this film. They move around in daylight, but can't go out in the sun (so the hero spends a weekend in Florida, hiding from the rays. Stupid, eh?). They have absurd colour changing contact lenses (sorry, eyes), but no one notices - or thinks that an adoptive family maybe shouldn't have so many resemblances? They all wear wigs, or spend so much time and money on their hair that it must swallow half their lives (sorry, deaths).<br/><br/>I'm struggling to think of another film that was this bad.

Kristen Stewart can't act, we all know that, every time she's on the screen in this sequel, it looks like she doesn't want to be there. All the characters/actors bore me to tears. Billy Burke (Charlie Swan) is probably the only one I enjoy in any of the films. His humor is funny. The rest of the actors had poor performances, showing no real emotion as they do in the books. Why can't the plot be straight out of the book.

Eclipse is about the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob plus Victoria still after vengeance. I don't think there was one good scene in the whole thing, which showed how underdone this movie was. Bella looked as though she didn't even have more than the two expressions.

""Well well"", the sceptics say, ""you hate this movie because you hate the Twilight-phenomenon in general"". No, I don't. I don't hate Twilight just because it is cool to do so, I hate it because it is so mind-numbingly bad! I can't for the love of God understand why anybody would find the ""love"" drama contained in this sclockfest interesting and captivating. The first movie (Twilight) and the second (New Moon) was pure crap, but THIS, this takes the ****** cake! The poor characters (or ""talking cardboard cut-outs"") pukes out one melodramatic line after another, never giving any reason for the audience to relate to them in any way. The ""development"" of the characters are non-existent, they are as uninteresting when the movie begins as they are when it ends; Edward is an emo-creep, Jacob is his usual stiff self and Bella still uses her eternally open mouth as an insect catcher. Just close your damned mouth, will ya?!<br/><br/>The story is basically the same as the previous movies, only with new dull characters thrown in and some small changes made to the script. Not only is the writing bad, but the execution and build-up to the final climactic fight scenes in the movie is constructed in the completely wrong way! There is never any suspense and the viewer is never uncertain over what will happen to the characters, because the viewer already knows which side will win due to the fact that the vampires forges an alliance with the monster dogs and says something like ""We will win this easily"" and outnumbers their enemies two-to-one. Hurrah for crappy script! It is a bit more suspenseful when Edward and that red haired chick fights but seriously, who cares about any of the characters at this point?<br/><br/>In my mind, the Twilight movies are fantasy movies (containing magic and supernatural stuff, you know), but unlike other fantasy movies for teens (""Harry Potter"" comes to mind) Twilight doesn't really give the impression of containing any MAGIC, ADVENTURE and SUSPENSE that STIRS THE IMAGINATION. Instead the series are more like the real-world-equivalent of cleaning toilets for a living, a high-school drama with toothless vampires and shabby monster dogs that probably smells like that dead bird your cat dragged in last week. It is that bad. Vampires are really over-saturated in the entertainment business right now, can't we just dump them all in a giant mouldy coffin and send them back to Transylvania?"

Unfortunately anything good about Twiligt got lost in the screen adaption. Twiligt gets a solid 5/10, New Moon 4/10 and Ecplipse reaches a new low, scoring 3/10.<br/><br/>The acting is beyond bad and the dialogue is dull. Bella and Edward are supposed to have this ""great love"" but there's nothing but angst that's unbearable and awkward to witness for the viewer. Then there's Taylor Lautner who's mostly brooding and shirtless as the werewolf Jacob. I can't remember what actually went down in this movie because it lacked any sort of memorable outlining óf a plot.<br/><br/>The Volturi came for Bella and they put her on a mountain, then Bella, Jacob and Edward share a tent and Bella is freezing so she has to stay close to Jacob for warmth and....this whole movie is a mess.

To be honest, I watched this (and read the first three books) out of a sense of pop culture obligation—I do need to stay abreast of the popular trends in YA literature and culture. Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special?

","It is indeed a pleasure for all the twilight fans to rush into the theaters when the next chapter of the saga is released. But this one is definitely not worth the wait..... It does not thrill every teenage girl out there. And of course I knew that it is not worth it...' cause I read the story. I watched just because of a lot of persuasions and I did not want to be the only person who did not see this movie among my gang of twilight maniacs. I never spend so much time writing negative reviews about a movie. Twilight was a great movie with a great concept. I just vampire-human love story, that concept. The following series bought up a new vampire-human-werewolf triangle love story. Which was terrible and ugly. I always thought that Stephenie Meyer spoiled it all. As far as I am concerned there is no thrill in it. Many loves this movie cause they love Edward and Jacob. Probably due to their glamor. And definitely there is nothing great about Bella for them both to love.<br/><br/>Performances were very poor. This movie has Kristen Stewart's worst performance. She behaves as if she has dual personality. Either she very calm and talks in her monotonous deep toned voice. Or she is too jumpy and just shouts at everyone around her. Many people in the theater laughed after seeing the way she says 'Dad, I am a virgin'. I completely take back my opinion about he being a very natural actress.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say about Pattinson's performance except that he was better compared to his performance in new moon. But in a way, he made me feel sorry for Edward whenever Bella turns her back on him.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner was annoying. There is absolutely nothing wrong with him as far as his acting is concerned.. I loved his performance and character Jacob in twilight and half of new moon. Since the second half of new moon and eclipse he seems to loose control. Problem is either the direction or the script.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick, Ashley greene, Billy Burke and others managed to keep up their steadfastness. Movie was worse than the book. Some scenes looked more like stage drama. Which includes the scene where Jacob actually begs her to choose him instead of Edward and the scene where Bella prevents Edward from following Jacob in the mountains. I actually felt like running out the theater. <br/><br/>I just the way Jacob's character was changed. The idea of him begging Bella actually made me puke. I would have considered him great if he was just like a brother for Bella, giving her good advices then it would have been okay. <br/><br/>Even in the technical aspects one wouldn't feel like watching it. Everything about this movie is predictable. When Billy Black tells Bella the story of how a woman rescued her lover, i knew that she would do something like that to rescue Edward/Jacob. And of course the bet between Edward and Jacob. Which I knew will definitely happen. It is the worst... and the ruined everything about the series.<br/><br/>Still people finds some thrill in this. And every one need not see the movie like I saw. Some can definitely see it as just an entertainer, or some can just it and ignore it. Mainly it is curiosity that leads people to see the next part of the saga. There is absolutely nothing funny or thrilling to see Bella or a girl like that to see between two guys. Definitely not in a movie that once had a beautiful concept. I watched it just once and I have had it.<br/><br/>P.S i am a teenage girl and i hate this movie.<br/><br/>just 1/10"

Now to the action....it was pretty lame...you couldn't actually get stuck into it, it was half-hearted to not get a 15+ rating. Jacob, Edward and Bella's relationship was the worst part, Bella acted like an 8 year old brat, Edward acted like a pedophile and Jacob was just plain stupid, I'm not surprised why people like it, they like it because its the perfect love story because in the end of book they all live happily ever after, like no-one dies NO-ONE, I mean what the hell was the point in writing a book that nothing happened in it, it didn't need to last for four books, two at the most, for once the movies are better than the books in this case, and that's not saying much at all."

","I watched the movie last night and was thoroughly impressed, I got what I wanted. It did not have much of a good plot, but what it lacked in plot was made up by the terrible dialogue, acting, cinematography, and visual effects which all together made a pretty funny movie. I must say New Moon was my favorite for comedic value but this one is a close second. To go along with the cheesy lines was the bad music played all to loud at certain scenes which made it even more corny and funny. I must give Kristen Stewart credit, she did not bite her lip as much but she is still not believable as an actress. You would think that since she and Robert Pattinson are dating that she could muster up some emotion in her face when he asked her to marry him, but of course she failed at that too. So my conclusion is that if you want to watch a quality movie with plot and acting don't watch the Twilight series; but if you want B quality movies and some good humor and fun times to make fun of your friends this movie is made for that. So take this advice or leave it but you have been warned."
"lucky_a41","4","7","10","2 October 2010"," Awful
","This movie is simply awful and painful to watch honestly. I read all the books and although the writing is not that good in the books either the movie is worse. Bella's acting is completely annoying, she can't give a convincing line, no chemistry between her and Edward either. She has the same facial movements throughout the entire movie (unfortunately not more than 3). Edward is in this movie only to remind the teens of how gorgeous he is and that's it. In each one of his lines he looks like he's in pain or he's gonna throw up (same thing I noticed about Pattinson in 'Remember me'). Not to mention the fact he's wearing some kind of lipstick which is wrong on so many levels. Jacob's performance isn't worth mentioning because I am convinced he wasn't designed to act. His sole reason for being in this movie is given by the amount of muscles he grew. Not once in this horrendous 2 hours movie have I felt that he's genuinely in love with Bella. The rest of the characters are simply props because they don't give any cohesion whatsoever in the plot, they are just killing time until the sequences with Bella and Edward appear. I put my hopes and dreams that at least the famous 'blanket scene' will capture something of the books essence but it failed dramatically. It seems that the actors are just repeating the lines, they have no feeling, no empathy, anyone from the street could have done this scene better. The details about the Cullen members' transformation into vampires should have been stretched into a second part of the movie. There are too many things that are included in this movie to make it look like the book, that ruin the movie for good. It's like a soup inflated with too many ingredients. The impression I got after watching both 'New Moon'and 'Eclipse' is that they were made without any intent of creating a decent movie. They relied only on the success of the books and on the cravings of the teenage girls for seeing Pattinson over and over again. The first part of the series was different at least it offered a closer look at Bella's feelings somewhat similar to the book. In conclusion the worst spent 2hours of my life.I'm really sorry I paid for the ticket I could have used the money on popcorn and it still would have been a better investment"

","I'm sure Stephenie Meyer had pure motives to do Twilight books: she wanted to create romantic, clean Love never dies story, with thrill of danger, but without jumping to the sewers. Unfortunately, these films are quite awful: there is nothing romantic, lush and otherwordly in them, so unlike in the mistitled but brilliant Bram Stoker's Dracula. Characters, plot and settings are boring - I'm sure Bella is sweet person, but I just can't care about her love life - and there is no visual style. Actually, one thing I really hate in these modern films is ugly photography. Who hid the lighting lamp? Atmospheric lighting is not same thing than BAD lighting and this ugly, muddy colour scheme. However, I hope that those who still ídiotically whine about changed vampire rules, would stop.

","Bella Swan has her work cut out for her. To an outsider, her struggle would seem both fascinating and difficult; choosing between a suave, gentlemanly vampire and an aggressive, handsome werewolf would be hard for any high school student, right? Well, in the case of the ""Twilight"" series, this potentially compelling decision holds no suspense whatsoever. Bella becomes smitten with teen vamp Edward Cullen's icy complexion and awe-inspiring eyebrows the moment she meets him. While she sometimes gets frustrated with his Victorian ideals and his grand gestures, she always crawls back to him, begging for more.<br/><br/>On the other end, Bella has Jacob Black, her childhood friend, who has recently become a werewolf (just how this happened is beyond me). Jacob grows sick of being Bella's pal, so he throws a series of hissy fits to try and win her affection. The audience, of course, knows that Bella will never choose Jacob (this isn't a spoiler; I have yet to even read the final installment of the series). In fact, it seems to me that Jacob exists in the films for the sole purpose of flexing his muscles, and that seems to be more than good enough cause in the eyes of the primarily female audience that the films command.<br/><br/>I realize that these comments could've just as well been tied to the last Twilight film, ""New Moon,"" but that's kind of the point. Not much happens in this supposed ""saga."" For the past two films, Bella has simply sat around and tried to make a decision. As far as I'm concerned, she made this decision back in the first film, so there isn't much suspense to watching her ponder over it now. Some would argue that Bella is a type of Hamlet figure, and that her indecision, while frustrating, is intriguing enough to embrace fully. Unfortunately, the stakes of Bella's decision never seem all that high in the films, and not much happens as she ponders. ""Eclipse"" seems to think it has an epic plot in the form of an approaching ragtag vamp army, but even this excursion offers little aside from more opportunities for Bella, Edward, and Jacob to bicker, and for Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard to grab a few minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Very little happens in ""Eclipse,"" and Bella's indecision seems both unwarranted and uninteresting. That being said, the film succeeds on a technical level. The visuals have a real sense of scale to them, despite the fact that some seem too big for the moments they showcase. The visual effects are also fairly impressive, and the music is terrific as usual. While Kristen Stewart resorts to constantly playing with her hair and Taylor Lautner's voice is grating, most of the performances are solid. On the whole, ""Eclipse"" makes for a beautiful, yet hollow, shell of a movie. Hopefully, the next installment will fill that empty space."

","Let's face the fact, this movie is lame and unconvincing. The acting, although has improved, somehow it is still immature. The triangle love story among Bella, Edward and Jacob was not depicted well. Although the director used so many episodes trying to connect Bella and Jacob, however, the kiss at last seems so abrupt and unreasonable. No sufficient facts could lead to Bella and Jacob's chemistry, and Bella's love for Jacob was not convincing at all. Besides, Jacob seemed cheesy and even annoying by hitting on Bella again and again, especially in the episode when he tried to warm up Bella in front of Edward. And the Bella's explanation for her choices was pretty lame. We could just say, Bella's feelings for Jacob was faked and forced by the director to make the plot more attracting while actually it did seem nothing but dumb.<br/><br/>The bright side is, the movie did seem much better than its predecessors. The acting, especially Edward, has been much better. And vision and picture, although was not artistic, was better than New Moon.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just about teen's obsessions. And no wonder Twilight fans are mostly high school teenagers."

","I wanted to try to like this movie, but it was so slow, and boring. My wife is a huge fan of this series and dragged me to see it. I wanted to give it a chance, but even she wanted her money back. She even said it was awful and was wildly disappointed.. And it was. I could barely watch the awful acting and even the teen girls who sat next to us and cheered the opening were half asleep and booing at the end. Everyone was lulled into a zombie sleep watching this trash. Bad script, bad acting, slow editing, bad music. All around 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>Giving credit where it was do, some of the visual effects were watchable, although you could tell that the wolves were not real. The director of photography did a good job with the color and composition, but the acting was so bad it and the pacing was so slow that the pretty pictures were just covering the crap. <br/><br/>Sorry fans, but you will be disappointed.

","Even compared with the previous two, which were rubbish, this one is disappointing. There were many young girls in the cinema watching it yet even they found reasons to giggle and snare at some stupidity and bloated-ness of the script and the entire premise. This is one stupid, ridiculous film which in addition takes itself seriously. The main actress is pretty attractive, but she does not act well, comes across as wooden. Her vampire partner is downright ridiculous and the wolf admirer is unintentionally funny too, sporting a naked torso for the girl audience even when snow is falling. The action scenes are unconvincingly mellow, the script is rubbish and soundtrack poor. I do not know what Dakota F. is doing here, her role is just a few lines recited standing, without acting skills necessary. How sad that this stupid and poor film-making takes the box office in a stride."
"rivendir","Null","24","45","1 July 2010"," Highly enjoyable
","Firstly, I've read through a number of reviews for this movie, and suffice it to say, the majority of them are blatantly anti-Twilight. Unreasonable bigotry is the main cause of the one-star reviews here. There's a difference between distaste for a franchise and a movie itself, so please recognize that.<br/><br/>Eclipse was much funnier than I thought it would be. There was a lot of Team Edward/Team Jacob jokes, like the, ""I'm hotter,"" line that Jake says when the trio is in the tent, before he lays down beside Bella. Small comedic relief was given through primarily Charlie, Bella and Jacob. I laughed more than I thought I would have.<br/><br/>Jacob's script felt a bit repetitive, saying, ""I KNOW you love me,"" four times or so... Also, did Edward repetitively ask Bella to marry him throughout the book? It felt somewhat annoying, I would get angry if my boyfriend was like, ""Marry me? No... Okay. But hey, marry me? Oh, that's fine, it's your decision... Here's a giant ring, so marry me?"" Edward seemed fairly pushy, but then again, Jacob was far pushier.<br/><br/>Rosalie's history's scene seemed cut short. I know they wanted to keep it kid-friendly, but the briefness of Rosalie's past made me feel as if people who didn't read the books wouldn't understand what misery she went through. She was brutally violated and nearly murdered, yet all they showed was a small inkling of yes, they're drunk men suggesting she take off her clothes. And then she explains she was left for dead... I don't know, they didn't need any graphic detail, but I think a little more suggestion as to what exactly occurred would've helped slightly. Perhaps that is just me.<br/><br/>I was sort of put-off by Jasper's suddenly strawberry-blonde long hair, but he pulled it off okay. I wish they had kept continuity throughout the movies, so you can watch them back-to-back without mourning over their abruptly changing appearances. The cast didn't look too bad once they were on the big screen, though, and I didn't have any big problems with it. Jasper probably looked truer to the books in Eclipse, but Nikki Reed's (Rosalie's) make-up looked far better in New Moon. The directors of New Moon and Eclipse did a half-decent job of making a blonde white woman out of a Hispanic one.<br/><br/>Alice's hair seemed butchered, albeit more like the books, due to Alice's pre-vampire life of residing in a mental asylum when she was a human. I still preferred the neater wig featured in New Moon. One scene in Eclipse, I could've sworn, had Esme's hair black? Um... The whole Volturi scenes felt stiff and somewhat emotionless. And did Demetri say anything at all? <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard pulled off Victoria well (in replace of Rachelle Lefevre), and Xavier Samuel made a great Riley. Boo Boo Stewart could have made a better Seth -- his short scene felt awkward as well. Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria) was an okay actor, from what I noticed, but I wasn't able to focus much on her -- Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) utterly stole the spotlight during those scenes.<br/><br/>The added characterization of the minor characters, primarily Jasper, made me feel extremely satisfied. The flashback of Maria and Jasper in the Southern Vamp Wars was decent, though brief. They successfully developed Jasper into a key character in the film, unlike his much smaller roles in the previous two films. Jackson Rathbone's (Jasper's) interaction with Ashley Greene (Alice) during the sparring scene left me wanting more. They definitely enhanced the two's characters by showing them interact as a couple.<br/><br/>Over all, YES! Good job, David Slade! Definitely my favorite Twilight movie so far. The fight scenes and deaths were stunning. I believe it was a good choice choosing Slade to direct this, due to the more mature themes. The wolves' animation wasn't as great as in New Moon, it seemed, but it still looked great. The lighting of the fur was especially flawless.<br/><br/>Great movie, highly recommended to those who can stand the Twilight Saga. If you didn't like the previous movies, don't watch this one -- simple as that. It left me leaving the theater feeling great. Well worth watching."

","I thought New Moon was bad but this is 1000x worse! I watched Eclipse the day I finished reading the book and I just have to say I was absolutely shocked at how bad it was. I was so disappointed, but this movie is terrible! Basically, all it is, is a bunch of scenes thrown together with no meaning! The scene when Bella says ""I'm Switzerland"" I was just like ""What?!"" If you had not read the book you probably would not have had any idea what she meant. It was crazy. Others may disagree but I was really annoyed when they were on the mountain especially when Jacob kissed Bella. It looked extremely fake. Please don't watch this movie unless you are super bored and want to entertain yourself by making fun of this crap! So bad."

","I'm really surprised with all the good reviews for this movie. It doesn't even deserve 5 out of 10. In fact it's shocking for me how can someone make such an idiotic piece of work. I don't care what was in the Book. All I know is that when I watched this movie, I wanted it to end as soon as possible. Many times I hold myself from turning down this boring movie. There were only Blah... blah... blahs. Not much action. We all know since the second movie that this is about a Vampire and a Human Girl's love story, with a Werewolf getting in between them to make it a love triangle. Now what? Nothing New? There is not much in the storyline. Same Victoria, and same 'No Turning into Vampire' Ending. Damn! Sorry to you if you liked this movie, but I really felt like lost. Time Wasting!"
"OnlineMovieReview","4","8","12","29 July 2010"," Not for Everyone
","The Twilight movie series takes a beating from males over the age of 15 and anyone that turns their nose up at this kind of movie entertainment. But I can kind of see what they are trying to do, and these movies are just another way for teens to escape from the world for a little while and forget how difficult it is to be a teenager. Not being a teenager anymore I have a hard time seeing the attraction but, like I said, I can understand why these movies and books are so popular.<br/><br/>After seeing The Twilight Saga: Eclipse and what Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has done to himself, it is not difficult to understand why these movies are popular with mature women all over the world as well. Not to say that all mature women chase much younger men in movies, but Robert Pattinson does tell some interesting stories about being approached by older women in ways that would embarrass a lady of the evening.<br/><br/>But fan activity towards actors and actresses is not really anything new. I am sure Harry Potter gets his fair share of older women making embarrassing offers to him. The thing here is the movie, and this movie is OK.<br/><br/>I look at these Twilight movies from the perspective of someone just looking for a good story. Sometimes you find it here, sometimes you do not. The obvious focus on the young teenage girl audience creates elements that make this movie really hard to watch for me at times.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's performance could have been done by a store mannequin. She shows no emotion, and her allegiance to Jacob and Edward flips constantly. It can actually get quite frustrating.<br/><br/>The teenage-focused love scenes, and the at-length discussions between Jacob and Edward about who gets Bella (like she is some sort of mannequin for sale at a store), really make the movie drag. You get glimpses of some very cool action, and some really great drama as well, but it gets watered down in the teenage girl angle. It is too bad because, as vampire and werewolf stories go, this one is not bad. But in order for this to work for the average viewer, there needs to be substance that is augmented by sappy love scenes and mindless dialogue. This movie is sappy love scenes and mindless dialogue augmented, a little, by some very good action and drama scenes.<br/><br/>If you like the books, then you will like the movies. The movies do not stray very far from the books at all. If you are not a fan of those kinds of books, then this film does not offer you a whole lot to look forward to."
"Leparsdon","3","8","12","14 July 2010"," An exercise in tedium
","After suffering through the last two Twilight's I only figured it made sense to follow through with the rest of the series, having never read the books and never wanting to suffer through that as well. Eclipse seems to follow the same tones and moods of it predecessors. It doesn't improve upon anything and seems to be entirely built around vacant expressions, bland dialogue and Kristen Stewart walking around looking ""worried"" (I guess thats her range, emo and worried) I still don't see this epic love between Edward and Bella, they seem to go around each other like they still don't know quite how to act and are very awkward and lack chemistry. Everything else is about boring as a Twilight film can be, not really really adding any level of dimension to the characters.<br/><br/>In short, good for the tweens (at least it gets them reading) but bad for anyone who expects anything resembling vampire lore"

","Okay,so I didn't read all the books, I'm not obsessive fan, but I really liked the first movie, cause it' a love story with vampires. The New moon was nothing like that, it was something between really bad drama, bad action movie, etc. Cause I liked Twilight, I gave it a chance for a third movie. And I liked it. The story wasn't lame, it wasn't slow, it was OK. So yes, all that loving scenes, it made me go eh, but I'm not 15 anymore, I don't believe in love like that, but I can see why people want to believe and why they love Twilight saga. It's positive, it's like you can escape from a bad dream, where bad dream is reality. Yeah, when I was 15 i wanted love like that, what Bella and Edward have it's amazing, but that's just a story. So yeah, movie is what it must be. A beautiful fairytale."
"alienworlds","Null","15","26","11 July 2010"," Sort of pretentious
","It was predictable that they would make this movie, but it probably will not go down in horror film history as anything special because it is a fairly run of the mill horror film. It was watchable but not all that interesting to me. I think I have a good open mind for new film experiences but I think this saga is sort of pretentious. Like a copy of the Underworld saga but more easy on the eyes, it doesn't really add anything interesting to the genre of werewolf films or the genre of vampire films. Kind of a ho hum movie to me, oh well, there are other things to watch. One of the problems that I can see with this series is that they have to many young characters in an area that would not be so dominated by young people-as in the area of the occult. There would be visibly older people as much as there would be visibly younger people. Maybe it is like saying 'we were left out by you and now we are leaving you out' type of thing, in terms of the film being a reaction against so little acting work often being given to younger actors in general for serious parts. Maybe. It is sort of like a Peanuts cartoon where adults are portrayed as fuzzy indistinct nuisances."
"kwfnewyork","4","14","24","3 July 2010"," Very Disappointing!
","First off let me say, I am a TwiHard! I have read every book, purchased every soundtrack, and watched every film. I love the series and I think Stephanie Meyer is a genius! That is why I am so disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the director didn't care anything about following the storyline in the books at all! This movie jumps from scene to scene as if it was a freight train barreling through. No time to develop any plot; just get to the next scene so we can get this over with.<br/><br/>There were THREE main points in the book that were vital to the story and to the next installment of Breaking Dawn: <br/><br/>One; Rosalie's background story and her wish to have a baby of her own.<br/><br/>Two; Jasper's background story and his ties to the Southern Vampire Clans.<br/><br/>Three; the bonding between Jacob and Edward on the mountainside when they were trying to protect Bella from freezing to death.<br/><br/>The director rushed through all of these as though they were nothing more than side stories instead of intricate parts of the bigger picture. <br/><br/>It seems that the only thing this director was shooting for was the fight scene between the Cullens, werewolves, and the newborns and he didn't even get THAT right! What's up with the breaking heads off like pieces of rock? Stephanie made it clear that the vampires were ""hard as granite"" NOT MADE OF GRANITE!!!! If it wasn't so sad it would be laughable. <br/><br/>In the book the fight between Edward and Victoria was a really big deal and she was much more difficult to kill but in the movie, she lasts about 2 minutes (if that long) before Edward breaks her head off! Ridiculous! <br/><br/>My favorite book of the series is Breaking Dawn. I only hope that they get a director and screenwriter who have actually READ THE BOOKS and understand the relationship between the characters before they ruin that one too! It is so sad..."
"Lilithdemilo24","4","9","14","10 August 2010"," Failure of the Leads...
","Having seen all three movies before they were officially released now and having read all four of the books, I believe I am qualified to offer an opinion on this, the latest tragedy to come out of Meyer's small time dream.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me just say that the two main actors must take a significant amount of blame here for why this film and the next one will mark the failure of vampire films for the next few years. It's called PASSION, people! Kristen Stewart, who at first seemed so perfect to play Bella Swan (an inferior character to begin with) has now become notoriously renowned for her 'Constipated Fish Face' and it really does detract quite painfully from whatever it is she's supposed to be portraying. She is gravely monotonous, plain faced and exerts as little as possible effort to give the admittedly dull character any life at all. And then there's Rob Pattinson - who I ADORED, just let it be known - who needs to GET OVER the fact that he'll be type-casted as Edward Cullen for the rest of his life and stop moping and sulking! What began as pleasant modesty has escalated to the point where his own markedly irritating personality is bleeding into one of literature's most charismatic, enchanting and all around breathtaking characters ever written. Edward Cullen is, lets face facts, why we read Twilight...and in this film, I found myself cringing away from him. Eclipse is supposed to represent the pull of choices, the difficulties Bella must overcome in choosing between those she loves. Only, in this, you'd have to be insane, deaf and blind to chose Edward over Jacob (who I previously hated). Rob and Kristen were most of what went wrong in this film and it makes me sad to remember how passionate, intimate and stunningly open they were in the original Twilight film. Both seem openly displeased with having to act or participate at all in the film; impatient to get to other, more well respected roles perhaps, and it showed greatly.<br/><br/>So, onto some other issues. Everyone has already shouted and screamed about Riley's character, demanding to know why he was given so much air time and such background. I agree with this point, though there is a more pressing issue and that's the changes that the director made in the beginning or the film. I don't know if it was screen writers, the director or Meyer herself who decided to go against canon grain in the first quarter of the movie but it was a bad decision. The film lost momentum too early, the dialogue was almost monosyllabic and extremely poor. Bad idea.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst thing about these films is how they try to become action movies. There is little to no action in these books, no matter what Meyer attempts in the Breaking Dawn or the latter of Eclipse. It is a strange, intimate love story made interesting and explosive because of the vampiric aspect. Trying to make this similar to the Narnia Movies or even The Golden Compass is a mistake. The first movie is the only one to correctly interpret the chemistry and the others have failed as a result.<br/><br/>However, the reason I give this movie a 4/10 is that there were redeeming points. The soundtrack was excellent. One thing this franchise does well is select it's music. Also, the other Cullens succeeded greatly in adding flavour and variety to the otherwise dull recipe of Edward/Bella. Rosalie's back-story was excellent portrayed as was Jasper's. Meyer should think long and hard about writing a prequel. It's amusing how every other actor in this film was, in my opinion, excellent. Taylor Lautnor, Nikki Reed and of course the ever mesmeric Bryce Dallas Howard in particular shone through the drudgery of Stewart and Pattinson's loveless love story.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointment for the last glimmer of hope before the horror of Breaking Dawn is splattered across screens worldwide. Twice."
"reecegraham","2","9","14","17 July 2010"," ugh..
","Personally I have never been a fan of movies based on books with the exception of Harry Potter. The reason is that movies obviously can't fit all the content of a book into a hour and a half and there ends up being large gaps in the plot and unexplained events. If the audience has not read the books, they will most likely be confused. (With the exception of HP) I am a GUY, I HAVE READ the Twilight Saga, and I am PROUD of it. Personally, I enjoy the books, not because I am really interested in the Bella, Edward, Jacob love triangle...but the books took me to a world of fantasy and adventure that I could have never imagined. I read the books in Middle School (Im now in High School) and I am still a fan. The first movie to me was good, it seemed to set the tone for the rest of the movie series. New Moon was a huge step back, but this review isn't about those movies. Eclipse is personally my favorite book in the entire series, so I was really excited to see if they could finally get it right. Of coarse, I was wrong to hope for that. In the book, much more of the story is focused on the problem with the newborns in Seattle and Victoria and Riley's army. When I arrived at my local Cinaplex, I looked at the poster and I already knew it was going to suck...""It all begins...with a choice."" is the movie's tag line. The movie starts and the first thing we see is Edward and Bella during a make out session. Apparently, kissing was the only thing the director could get the actors in the movie to do with passion, because he put it in almost EVERY scene! Yes, in the book, Bella and Edward show their love for each other...but not constantly! Its disgusting! The whole thing with Jacob is a mess too! Jacob shows frustration in the book that Bella wont recognize his feelings for her, but he gets way to physical with her in this movie. I can understand that he loves her, but he needs to calm down. In the book, it is easy to see why these boys are crazy for her...Because it EXPLAINS IT! In the movie, you really cant tell why they love her so much....Jacob and Edward fight over her like 2 children. Way to much of this movie is focused on the love triangle, if you've read the books...you know what Im talking about. What happened to the epic battle, the vicious Victoria, the back story of Jasper and Ros-a-who? (Yes, it was in the movie..but it was presented in such a way where it didn't affect the plot.) I mean Eclipse is the most action packed book in the series...and they made it BORING! Obviously, the makers of these movies are going for the tween audience only, because they only show kissing and awkward duologue...yes, I said DUOlouge. Personally, I didn't really think the movie was Awful, but it drags to the point where even the fight scene (no matter the size) couldn't even pick the tempo up. I saw the movie with my mom, (Dont Hate) she has never seen the movies or read the books...and she was not impressed. We left the Cinaplex confused, bewildered, frustrated, annoyed...the list goes on and on.... The only thing redeeming about this movie is that you can laugh at it, thats how pathetic it is. Robert doesn't do a bad job, he mumbles to much and need to show more passion. Lautner doesn't do a bad job either, every time he comes on the screen the girls scream...and I can breath, he is the only one in this movie that has a personality. Stewert is just dreadful....bottom line! I've thought about what she does wrong, and I just cant put my finger on it...Shes just bad. Overall, the movie could have and should have been better. Its movies like these that ruin the reputations of authors. All I can say is that Eclipse is the best movie in the series to date, and if you want to waste 9 bucks and 2 hours of your life, this movie is perfect for you... But I would suggest that if you see or have seen the movies, that you travel to your local Wal-Mart and spend 7 bucks on a paper back copy of the book or just read the entire series, because they are definitely worth your time..."

","I have seen all three of these, and no, I did not read the books. I have seen movies in the past where I have read the book, and I have learned that they both must be taken upon their own merits.<br/><br/>I found the first twilight movie interesting. It held my attention with mystery and impending danger. Yo were trying to figure out what the Cullen's were about, and if Bella would get in over her head to the point of her life being in danger. The father was also an important figure in both the first and second movie.<br/><br/>The second movie was more action packed, the plot moved along quicker, and introducing Jacob as a viable interest to Bella and rival to the Cullens held my interest. Overall an unpredictable and intriguing movie.<br/><br/>The third movie enters as predictable, slow moving, and much more a movie about Bella, who comes across even more as a child than the first two, not being able to make up her mind. Her wishy-washy-ness is tiring (what happened to strong-willed Bella?), and the actions of the other two is highly predictable. You can see what's going to happen throughout this movie way before it happens. I found myself looking at my watch several times. Decisions for all the Cullens and all the wolf pack are made off the cuff by Edward and Jacob; without even consulting the others. It's as if the other members of the clan and pack are filler, with virtually no input or providing any tension as they did in the other two movies in the series. They just follow whatever Edward and Jacob decide at the spur of the moment, even if they're not present. And Bella's father is also now just a wimp. He doesn't even need to be present in the plot. He contributes nothing. It's a movie (soap) about Jacob, Bella, and Edward, with all the rest of the cast acting as cardboard fillers.<br/><br/>If you really want to see what happens in the third chapter of this saga, save your money and rent it. It has about as much big screen appeal as a slow-moving soap opera."

It's a reason I cannot explain, but I can only explain by means of other examples. The fact that I really honestly believe that the Twilight movies are horrible and Will Hung cannot sing, can only be explained by this example: If I had a Noah- like epiphany of requiring to take a zillion things to put in a ship for protection, I would still not pick the twilight movies, its casts, Will Hung and so on.

If the first half hour did not bore you, then the ending is guaranteed to. I refuse to believe that teenagers are so mindless.

The action scenes are well done, but there are few surprises in the very linear plot.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the acting has gotten better from all parties involved, especially Kristen Stewart when you compare this to her first Twilight performance.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film, is the problem that I've had with the saga as a whole is that two characters pining over each other, (or even a love triangle) has no impact when there is no conflict.<br/><br/>Also, this is the most bloodless vampire movie I have ever seen. It's sad that Stephanie Myers was able to take a concept as cool as the Vampire, and make them seem so lame.<br/><br/>**Spoiler**<br/><br/>Bella heads straight down the path that she has chosen, she shows no true conflict, which could have added more tension. You get the two guys who are competing for her, getting along, then you have taken anything that was interesting out of the plot, considering there was very little to start with, this is very disappointing.<br/><br/>In my opinion much of New Moon, and Eclipse could have been condensed into one film, and the plot would have been tighter, and probably create a much more impactful film."

The movies, however, are about ten times worse than the already mediocre books. Taylor Lautner's performance is particularly bad. The way he delivers the ridiculously cheesy ""I'm gonna fight for you"" line is terrible. Kristen Stewart is also pretty bad. When she punches Taylor in the face and breaks her hand, her reaction is very odd and unnatural. As for Robert Pattinson... He's like a wooden plank; emotionless. The plot is dull, high school-like drama. It isn't even worth talking about because it's basically the same plot from New Moon with a few other elements thrown in."

","So i'm going to be truthful and say that I didn't spend money on watching the movie- don't get me wrong i'm a fan of the BOOKS but the first movie that they came out I thought that they did a very sucky job at picking some of the actors they messed a lot and left out very important information that the people were supposed to be told before the second movie came, and even then the second movie people were supposed to be shown some things and they were not, and as for the third....well twenty minutes into the movie I fell asleep! The movie was so boring, I couldn't believe that I was able to even sit thru the second movie, and now i know why. The people did a every bad sucky job at making the movies that this newest one...was so much sucker then before- lmao I'm not kidding I fell asleep sitting at my friends house, i wasn't tired so don't tell me it was because I was over tired. In fact my friend who was watching it with me didn't even last forty-five minutes into the movie. She shut off it, so i'm sorry to say, that the whole twenty minutes that I did watch the movie....<br/><br/>I give it twenty thumbs down- & I fear for the next movie Breaking dawn"
"emeraldgirl1","1","11","18","18 July 2010"," went from bad to worse!!!!!
","well what can i say about this movie except i fell asleep twice, the acting was really bad and the entire story was so one dimensional. apart from that it was GREAT. Kristen Stewart's face never changed from one scene to the next, she had the dead pan look going on. Robert pattinsons acting went from bad to worse oh and the volteri looked as intimidating as watching an episode of the teletubbies. I read tom cruise was afraid that rpattz would steal the limelight from him but i really think he doesn't need to worry, robs not even in his league of acting.<br/><br/>Can anyone tell me what the point of the story was because if it was about two love sick teenagers ( with no on screen chemistry whatsoever ) Bella trying to choose between the dog and the vamp, a vampire trying to avenge her mate and Bella begging Edward endlessly to ""change"" her every 5 minutes, then we got that in the last two movies, been there done that and got the t-shirt to prove it.<br/><br/>The story line is so slow i don't think i could bear to watch the next 2 movies, i would probably lose the will to live, if the breaking dawn book is anything to go by, with its weird sex scenes, really uncomfortable imprinting on a baby and that painful sickening birth scene, there's gonna be a lot of kids in therapy for a really long time. <br/><br/>The question still remains why the hell didn't he just bite her and have done with it?"

","Having been converted to the Twilight series by my brother (of all people) who insisted that the first film was good, I was only left bitterly disappointed by the second movie (which I booked early screening tickets for) and now also by the third.<br/><br/>Whilst Twilight was not a film of epic proportion, it was at least watchable thanks to a storyline that actually moved and was stitched together coherently and entertainingly. Unfortunately, the rather optimistic predictions of the Twilight series being the 'next Harry Potter' were frightfully over-enthusiastic.<br/><br/>Whilst watching Eclipse, I was once again subjected to unconvincing and poor acting, awful line delivery, far too cheesily written lines, a slow-moving plot and scenes that were so terribly executed that I just wanted to curl up and die from cringing. At very few points did the film have my full attention and I often strayed to things such as food, my pre-booked holiday and cleaning out my fat hamster when I got home. I even found time to answer a few questions on Yahoo on my phone.<br/><br/>Credit where credit is due however, Kristen Stewart's acting, whilst still littered with her trademark 'I have constipation' facial expression and devoid-of-emotion line delivery did manage to throw in a few variations on the constipation face. Robert Pattinson's acting however, seems to have further dissipated and he has now been rendered incapable of speaking in a tone that is not 100% monotonous. <br/><br/>Highlight of the film? Jacob's line, ""Let's face it - I am hotter than you"" and ""it'll be faster if you took your clothes off"" and the entire tent scene in general contained good laughs at the expense of Edward, who as a character is insufferable as well as being an emotionally abusive boyfriend. The end fight scene was also visually well executed, but unless a good film is now based on its ending rather than the smoothness and presentation of the entire film itself, this was a waste of money.<br/><br/>Unless you're a die-hard fan, a middle-aged woman who has lost all interest in her now obese husband or a pre-pubescent teen who likes seeing half-naked men on-screen, don't pay to watch this - just find some link to a cam online.<br/><br/>In any case, if you want a total bore of a movie in which absolutely nothing of any significance happens up until the last 30 minutes of the film, see Eclipse!"
"y_irene","2","11","18","4 July 2010"," You guys are lucky to watch it without translation
","Can't believe they ruined it. The third book could have resulted in the most intriguing of the Twilight movies, but instead I got a strong impression that Eclipse was directed by David Yates, the director of ""Harry Potter and What-Does-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Have-to-do-with-that- Story?"". Poor plot, poor play (i don't blame actors for this part, it was director's responsibility to register insincerity), poor choice of perspectives (guess, I'm not the only one who noticed that 80% are close-ups of Bella's, Edward's and Jacob's faces). Comparing Twilight to New Moon and Eclipse, you naturally come to conclusion that screening such kind of stories must not be entrusted to male directors... The Bella-Jacob line isn't delivered at all. Was it so difficult to picture what Bella had seen while kissing Jacob? Just insert a small scene where their common possible future would be visualized. It could have at least revealed WHAT Bella'd realized and also why she looked so downcast when she returned to the clearing where Edward'd been waiting for her listening to Jacob's thoughts. It wasn't only shame, for crying out loud!<br/><br/>But however pathetic and awkward the movie could seem if you watched it with original sound, you can't even imagine how hideous the translation into different countries' languages was. All the seriousness gone, phrasing is mockingly absurd as if on purpose...<br/><br/>Considering such a negative reaction of the audience, I would not be surprised if Patts refused to star in Breaking Dawn. I just hope the overall opinion about Eclipse will not affect him that much. It's not his fault that the third movie happened to be a total failure, it's just the role of a too-noble old-fashioned way-too-soft die-away vampire. And Lautner... well, too bad he's not 6 feet 7 inches high, as Jacob's in the book. When Jacob-wolf stands by Bella, his height from his front paws up to the top of his head is just the same as Jacob-human. Then where does the mass for his body and hind paws come from? Does he gain mass while shifting shapes? :)"

","I read up to the first 4 chapters in the original Twilight book before I sat it down and decided it was trash. My sisters said otherwise and I have taken them to Twilight and New Moon at the midnight premiers, so I held to the tradition and brought them to Eclipse.<br/><br/>Not having much faith in the movie as I had seen the first two and was not impressed at ALL, I got ready to take a nap. Instead after the first few boring scenes it kicked up (unlike in the other two) and we actually got more than 2 minutes of action.<br/><br/>The acting was better, but Bella and Edward both returned to their comatose state on screen while Jacob and the wolf tribe keep the life in the movie. I have to hand it to Rathbone for another good performance and wondered why he couldn't have played Edward, instead of listening to the wooden voice of Pattinson.<br/><br/>It had its good moments, ridiculous moments, points where the script sounded as if it were written for a nickelodeon kid's show, and scenes where you just want to scream at the characters. I would have liked to see Alice do more than just stand and have a premonition, and what happened with Esme? She was on screen for 10 seconds.<br/><br/>It was enjoyable, to say the least and probably the best of the series (so far). But then again, that's not saying very much. 5/10"
"aaronjbong","5","28","56","30 June 2010"," The Twilight Saga - Eclipse: It's All Love Triangles
","Keep it in mind when you're watching this, the main thing in this movie is all about the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob. So, that's already eaten much of the movie itself.<br/><br/>First things first, ""Eclipse"" (in almost every scene) relates to the love triangle. Even the battle parts still have a connection between the love triangle. Everything (except scenes not in her perspective).<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" is also a kind of slow movie because of too many dramatic scenes which were pretty boring. Even though they had a brutal killing villain, tension wasn't even there as drama overthrew it on the screen.<br/><br/>There were some laughable moments too (and they were related to the love triangle). They were just not-so-funny moments but still can entertain you.<br/><br/>Another thing you have to remember watching this movie is to remember that ""Eclipse"" has tons of kissing scenes (and they are so long e.g. 10 minutes). It was so boring. It's just like watching some person watering the plants while whistling. And, when I saw it, I feel like it's going to be a very boring film which deserves a one-star rating.<br/><br/>The acting was bad. There were almost no emotions even for Bella. I say Robert Pattinson's acting on Edward was the worst of all. Bryce Dallas Howard on Victoria was not bad. Xavier Samuel on Riley was the best of all. But, the three main characters' acting were almost emotionless. Of the three leads, Taylor Lautner was the best.<br/><br/>The action scenes were not satisfying. It was short and kind of brutal. Speaking of brutal, I say ""Eclipse"" has the deadliest, most brutal scenes in ""The Twilight Saga"".<br/><br/>By the way, a contributing factor to this movie is that it has many flashbacks or memories of the characters that also skip the fighting parts of it. The flashbacks were too long that it made me sleepy when I watched it.<br/><br/>I'm kind of shocked with the vampires in this movie. They look like crystals or something as there were scenes showing hands or heads decapitated and they look like shiny crystals.<br/><br/>""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is another slow movie which always and always focuses on that love triangle. There were no really exciting moments in the movie and if they had shortened the kissing scenes, this film would have been shorter than two hours. I think this film just deserves a 5-star rating. But, believe it or not, it's currently the best Twilight film."
"northofcb","6","20","39","1 July 2010"," The Best in All Respects, for Whatever That's Worth
","This is perhaps the only Twilight movie for which I had any expectation of quality, as it was the only novel that I enjoyed from the series. I am wondering what Bill will do for Breaking Dawn but having any hope for that book is along the lines of watching The Princess and the Frog as a biography. Anyway, this movie was disappointing, as I expected. It failed to capture much of the magic that made the book the only tolerable entry in the series. Much of the problem goes to the screenwriter; Melissa is 3/3 (shouldn't someone call her out?) in ruining these films. Also, the leads are impossibly boring, and after watching Adventureland, I have decided that brooding is the only emotion that Kristen Stewart is capable of conveying on screen, which is becoming less and less enduring as time goes on. The male leads are just as atrocious, and it's sad when you find yourself searching for supporting cast members (Fanning, Howard, etc.) to fulfill the need to see acting. All this being said, this was the best of the three. The pacing is much better and that goes far towards keeping things interesting. It never quite becomes involving, but it's not nearly as draining as Twilight and New Moon. What else can I say? Read the book or don't. Watch the movie or don't. Your life won't be depleted or enriched either way it goes. It's two hours of your life; is it worth the numbingly casual entertainment this film has to offer? Blah"
"WHYeat","5","16","30","2 July 2010"," best so far
","You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another  dimension - a dimension of vampires, a dimension of wolves, a dimension  of interspecies love . You're moving into a land of both awe and  awfulness, of fantasy and romance. You've just crossed over into the  Twilight Zone! In New Moon, the story left off with Bella and Edward  having averted danger. Eclipse continues the saga with a completely new  and fresh idea. Bella is still in danger! I know right? It blew my  mind. This time around the danger comes from an unknown source. It  could be Victoria, who seeks revenge on Edward for killing her love,  James, in the first movie. Or it could be the Volturi, who have a  distinct interest in Edward, Alice, and Bella. Their enemy is stronger  than the Cullen clan can handle on their own, but luckily they have an  ace in the hole - an unlikely alliance with the wolves. The result is  the most beautifully filmed fight sequence so far in The Twilight Saga.  But what really makes this movie better than the previous two  (especially for those who aren't already fans of the books) is the  dialogue and the high school drama. Not because they're good, but  because they're entertaining. My compliments to Stephenie Meyer. She  has the uncanny ability to create the most epic of awkward situations  whose silence is broken only by the most ludicrous dialogue. My  favorite scene in the movie is when Bella, Edward and Jacob are in a  tent in a snowstorm. Awkward - check. Bella is freezing cold and  Edward's lifeless body can't do a thing. The shirtless Jacob steps in  saying,  Face it, I'm hotter than you.  and gets under the covers and Bella snuggles up against his warm chest.  Edward can only watch. Epic - check. Good only gets better when Jacob  then suggests,  It'd be faster if you took your clothes off... survival 101 Ludicrous -  check. I stood up, applauded, and walked out.  With the relationships between Bella, Edward and Jacob established by  the first two movies, Eclipse is chock-full of one-liners that are  entertaining. And watching the 3 interact and bump heads can be quite  funny because as an adult you are reminded of how ""love"" is so  simplistic and idealistic in the minds of teenagers. What consumes more  of my mental energy than deserved is how Bella is so irrationally  attracted to Edward and Jacob, and the two to her. From her  perspective, she could probably do better than an undead boyfriend  whose instinct is to drink her blood and a wolf boy who's so angry all  the time. And what happen to women's equality? Does she really need two  unnatural male protectors? From Edward's and Jacob's perspectives,  they're fighting over a girl who can't seem to make up her mind about  who she wants more. It might even appear that she's playing them both  for fools. Guys do wait - but not forever. But I'm letting the my  rational side prevent me from enjoying the movie. So if you're headed  out to watch Eclipse with your girlfriend or little sister, lighten up  and you might enjoy the movie.  Thus ends review #3. Bella loves Edward. Edward loves Bella. Jacob  loves Bella. Bella loves Edward. Perhaps Breaking Dawn will take it  from epic to classic when Edward and Jacob love each other. Til next  time."
"lady_nymphadora","7","10","17","3 July 2010"," Not the Worst Movie Some Would Have You Believe
","(Non-spoiler part of review will be in the first four paragraphs) My advice is this: if you don't like the Twilight franchise (books, movies, actors, Twihards, or anything associated with Twilight), then don't watch the movie. You already know beforehand you'll hate it, so why waste your life? You'll only have yourself to blame if you expected this movie was going to be about a human girl's choice between a vampire and a ""werewolf"", and SURPRISE - it is.<br/><br/>None of the Twilight movies are going to get good ratings. With the flak the books and fans receive, it's no wonder so many people who have ""watched"" it have rated it so poorly (1 star, really? Have you NOT seen The Hottie and the Nottie?).<br/><br/>In truth, Eclipse was an entertaining movie. Sure, there were some awkward moments, some under- and overacting, and maybe some scenes that could have been improved, but if you like Twilight, and have read the books, then Eclipse is a good movie for you. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's definitely not as bad as some of the haters have been saying.<br/><br/>I feel that David Slade has definitely improved the acting of all the cast from previous movies, and he's (and/or Melissa Rosenberg have) incorporated some scenes not in the book that I thought were added for the better (more on that later). Many Twilight fans will not be left wanting as they may have been from the two previous films.<br/><br/>*********** SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT ************ The cast did a good job on screen for the most part. Kristen Stewart didn't have as many awkward acting moments as in the past. In fact, I thought she was good overall. Her chemistry with Robert Pattinson has definitely improved. Pattinson's acting, I would say, was good 2/3 of the time. There were definitely some cringe-worthy moments that I wasn't sure how they let pass. And I wish someone could've trimmed his sideburns! They were ridiculously long! Very distracting indeed. Taylor Lautner did a good job as well, overall. Like Stewart and Pattinson, he also had some ""... ... ..."" moments. These three are definitely not going to be winning Oscars for their performances in this movie, but they didn't fail to provide screen presence.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was also entertaining. Billy Burke, as always, steals the scene in ones he's in. Ashley Greene did a better job in this movie than in the previous one. Her clothing has also improved. Kellen Lutz, Peter Facinelli, and Elizabeth Reaser had more dialogue this time around, and they were great. The flashbacks of Nikki Reed and Jackson Rathbone were done very well. Rosalie's flashback was sad, and was finished way too soon in my opinion. Jasper's flashback was definitely interesting, and there was a nice tender Alice/Jasper moment associated with it.<br/><br/>Xavier Samuel played Riley well. Was impressed with what he did with his role. Bryce Dallas Howard was a better Victoria than Rachelle Lefevre ever was. She brought this fierce, fiery aura to Victoria, and it just worked.<br/><br/>Watching the Volturi was quite comical sometimes. They stopped being menacing when they all pulled off their hoods at the same time. For some reason, I laughed out loud at how ridiculous I thought they looked.<br/><br/>The other wolves and other Quileute tribe members were alright. I never felt that they had a strong enough screen presence, though.<br/><br/>One of the great additions to the script that wasn't in the (main) books was the scene between Victoria and Riley. It was very interesting to see the relationship between the two characters, and it definitely added to the story.<br/><br/>All that being said, I thought the scenes where they had Bella yell at or scold Edward was a bit unnecessary, and was way too much drama. It also seems that they sometimes reversed the personalities of Edward and Jacob, where Edward is the petty, immature, jealous type, and Jacob is the composed, wise, and considerate type. It's unfortunate that it was forgotten that Edward is over 100 years old. A century should be ample time to develop more maturity, wisdom, and poise than a 16-year-old, no? This is a long movie, and stays fairly true to the book. David Slade has definitely improved many aspects of the third installment of Twilight, and I think he's the best director so far to have handled the franchise. But if you don't like Twilight, don't waste your time."

","Plot = OK Acting = Poor Direction = Bad Effects = Terrible<br/><br/>Really, is this the best they could do, knowing the the franchise was massive. Very bad movie and such a waste - could have been excellent. The main gripe is that it may as well be an episode of Buffy - it's as if they have made it for TV rather than being a full blown movie experience. It could be laziness knowing that it would do well anyway but feel it has let the series down and will always be known as the crap twilight - a bit like Superman II all those years ago. So you have to watch it if you are watching the series but you also could do yourself a very big favour by watching anything else at all instead. Sometimes books do not need to be made into movies or do what Harry Potter does and split it over a couple of releases. HP does it very very well, Twilight very very badly. HP will still be watched 20 years from now I fear that this series will be forgotten and rightly so."
"koojaho13","5","5","7","27 September 2010"," Suffers from what the previous movies had left for them to work with
","More action and fantasy is put into this installment than the previous ones and it helps the series go towards it's right direction however again, the romance outweighs the fantasy elements. It's not the romance that's the problem but the fantasy is uncreative and there are so many one-liners that I can nitpick.<br/><br/>The story vaguely progressed since the last film. It's plot is actually a combination of the first film's plot and the second film's plot. Jacob and Edward are still fighting over Bella and a vampire is after Bella again. To make it more interesting though, Victoria creates an army of new born vampires to eliminate Bella while Edward and Jacob form an alliance to protect Bella.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. The actors can't be criticized when they aren't given a lot to work with in the first place. The worst character in this film is undoubtedly Jasper. His character is supposed to be the veteran warrior who teaches other vampires to fight but he comes off so cheesy, I found to dislike him. Dialogue is the main problem here.<br/><br/>This film tries to make things overly dramatic all the time. There are too many unnecessary kissing scenes. It's probably more than Twilight and New Moon combined. Also this movie stretches scenes to take up screen time when it could be done quicker.<br/><br/>The action is definitely better. While the previous movies lacked a hell lot of action, this one doesn't. This one lacks just a bit. The action scale increased because it's actually a battle rather than a combat this time. However the fight between Edward and Victoria ends so abruptly and the battle is in favor of Edward most of the time and even when it's not, it's not that suspenseful. Overall it is an improvement so hats off to the director.<br/><br/>Now about the creativity. It's a shame how an uncreative book has to bring down the movie based upon it but it happens. Eclipse is a primary example. Hell, the whole Twilight series is an example. None of the creatures in the Twilight series offer fantasy elements. All their powers are randomly put together without explanation. There's no explanation to why the Vampires have special powers. They're just there to fulfill the genre of fantasy. Which I guess it does but it's so uncreative.<br/><br/>The CG for the werewolves are terrible once again. They look like they're from video games. The rest are good. I liked how this film depicts Vampires' death. They break apart into ice and that was cool to look at.<br/><br/>Eclipse improved since the last two but there are so many problems in the previous entries that the movie is still a bunch of flaws.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>★★☆☆☆ Insufficient"

I haven't seen the second one but i was filled in on what i've missed. Eclipse wasn't very good. It was what i was expecting and to be honest i really did give this one a go since my girlfriend really wanted me to like it. I don't like the authors conception of Vampires and Werewolfs. Werewolfs are like in American Werewolf in London but in this its just really soppy and not scary. And vampires are like From Dusk till Dawn but once again in this are really soppy and tamed. They could of made the villain vampires a lot more fearsome. I'll give this film one thing though, it had some great action scenes! The big fight was thoroughly enjoyable and did make me say 'Yeah!

"woinaroschy_1979","5","5","7","22 July 2010"," It does not raise up to the expectations
","I was very disappointed by two major things in the movie: the action and the chemistry.<br/><br/>After preparing us for the ""epic"" battle with the newborns through the entire movie, the actual fight lasts only about 5 minutes. You barely start enjoying all the action and it's over!! David Slade made such a fuss about this for absolutely NOTHING. Plus his camera is sometimes shaky and blurred like an amateur Youtube clip (scene with Bella and Jacob in his garage and even worse the scene where Riley bends over Charlie).<br/><br/>The chemistry is also non existent, and it's mainly due to Bella. I could feel that Edward and Jacob love her, but I never felt anything from her. It just looks like she only wants sex with Edward, and that she's physically attracted to Jacob (since Edward won't comply to her advances). The bubbling tension from Twilight is all but spent, and Edward's proposal throwing in chaperoned walks, ice tea on the porch and stolen kisses literally made me cringe and cover my eyes. It is a good lesson for teenagers not to have sex on the first date and maybe feel something for the person you share your bed with besides lust, but from that to ""don't have sex before marriage"" is utterly absurd and unwise. Marriage is pretty serious stuff, you won't go into that without being sure of ALL the aspects of your relationship. But the Mormon beliefs of Stephanie Meyer get here the upper hand, so like it or not you get a taste of her convictions. Poor Robert Pattinson must have had a hard time getting those lines out! <br/><br/>Acting...well, I will confess I'm not watching the Twilight movies for the fine acting. I thought Taylor Lautner the best of the trio. Surprisingly good performances from Jackson Rathbone and especially Nicki Reed. Best acting was without a doubt Billy Burke. <br/><br/>The music is really A+, too bad the quality of the movie is not rising up to the quality of the music! Howard Shore composed an epic score, and the soundtrack is amazing, with all songs fitting the scenes to perfection.<br/><br/>Best kiss: Jacob/Bella. Not emotional, but sexy. Best couple: Alice/Jasper. Sweet, funny, warm. All that Edward and Bella should be and aren't. Best scene: tent scene. One of the few scenes where Pattinson nails it. For the rest he looks pretty and not much else, but hey, I am not complaining. Best emotion the movie captures from the book: the Edward/Jacob rivalry. Well acted, very authentic. <br/><br/>Overall I am disappointed by this movie. I loved Twilight (ah, the chemistry..guess it was there because Robert and Kristen were not yet together or just at the beginning of their relationship, which fits to what the movie describes), I liked about 40 minutes of New Moon (I'm a sucker for tragic love stories), and I was humoured by the rivalry scenes in Eclipse (tent scene, ""doesn't he own a shirt?""...probably because Taylor and Robert are in competition in real life too).<br/><br/>Definitely will not watch it over and over or buy the DVD."

","I was so excited about this movie, just wanted to judge for myself how great the movie was and to my surprise it was a disappointment. I'm a Big Twilight saga fan and for once, ""WHY CAN'T ONE OF THESE MOVIES BE AT LEAST, ALMOST BE LIKE THE BOOK?"" In the books, Stephenie Meyer's details are there and why can't they put it in the movie or close to it? I can understand the first movie with the budget and all, but New Moon and Eclipse? Really...a budget shouldn't have been an issue. Eclipse was the best book out of the 3 so far. I hope they read all the reviews and listen to what the fans hope to see in Breaking Dawn, if you haven't read this book or any...you really don't know what you're missing. When you read the books you can feel the emotions and picture every detail the way it is described. They could have done better with Eclipse. If Lord of the Ring movies can be 3 hours long I hope that the first & second part of Breaking Dawn is 3 hours each. In the movies why can't they capture the characters as they are in the books and not just doom and gloom, the characters in the books have a sense of humor. And why is Edward looking more off, the change in his make-up, hair(and his silver Volvo), he is suppose to be beautiful, but New Moon and Eclipse did not do him justice. Get rid of the hatchback!!!!

","After seeing ""Twilight: Eclipse"" I had to watch a whole block of ""Tru Blood"" episodes just to remind myself that vampires are sexy, dark and bloody. I am going to leave you with just a couple of thoughts about why I am saddened by the decision to see this one in the theater, a mistake I assure I will not make for the fourth. Robert Pattinson would rightly be said to carry the burden of male vampire sex appeal in this series. With that in mind, perhaps someone should have pointed out that a scrunched up ""I small something nasty"" face is not sexy especially for two hours. I recently saw him in ""Remember Me"" which exceeded expectations and I must say he played the dark, brooding but always earnest bad boy very well. While were on this subject we might as well go ahead and say that Taylor Lautner's shirtless, ""well defined"" (bad pun, sorry) acting style in ""Eclipse"" tipped over into cheesiness of the worst sort. In a moment of self referencing humor, Edward even quips, ""Does he own a shirt?"". ""Eclipse"" does offer up more action but undercuts itself with some not so special effects not to mention the fact that Twilight vampires when killed look like nothing more than empty mannequins. Maybe this is in line with the books, I don't know, but it was bloodless (even for PG13) and cold. The villain we have been waiting on in the form of Victoria once again has scant screen time and (spoiler!!) dies one of the cold, bloodless deaths. Can someone also explain Bryce Dallas Howard's bad choice of wigs? I did say just a couple of thoughts so I will leave you with my last complaint. Bella's fragile nature is played up to the point of absurdity. She really needs to be made into a vampire before she dies in some horrible toe stubbing accident."

","well, i've expected much worse after seeing new moon, but it turned out not to be that bad. the actors had more facial expressions, the directing was WAY better than in the previous movies and the CGI worked pretty well. but i think they used too much quotations from the book (don't know if it was so because the screen writer wanted to keep it as close to the book as possible or just because she was too lazy to come up with something on her own) and sometimes i got the impression that the storyline was jumping from one picture to another without any deeper intention... you can't make something from nothing, though, so i'm thinking i had quite a good time watching it even if about zillion ways of how differently spend two hours occure to me:)"

","I saw this with my friends earlier, and we constantly made jokes throughout the entire film. At least it had a little more action than New Moon did, where Bella just cried the whole time. This time, Bella just can't decide who she wants; Edward or Jacob. She is always asking Edward to make her into a vampire. It still has plenty of lovey dovey moments. Victoria still wants revenge and creates an army of newborn vampires who are reckless and don't play by the rules. She plans to kill Bella. The vampires and the werewolves reluctantly decide to work together and fight Victoria and her army. If you are crazy over Twilight, I'm sure you'll love ECLIPSE!!!"
"sablize","2","25","51","2 July 2010"," 'Eclipse'? More like Boring.
","First, let me clarify: I hate Twilight. I could give you a million reasons why I hate the books and the movies, but I won't. I only went to the movie a) to see if it would be any good, and b) to poke fun at it. Even after I started hating the series, Eclipse was still my favorite. So, of course, I thought that maybe the movie wouldn't be too bad. But was I wrong.<br/><br/>I mean, even from an unbiased point of view, it still stands that the movie was just downright boring. I felt myself wishing for scenes where no one was talking. The script was, in my opinion, poorly written and very predictable, just like in the two previous movies. The characters were flat and the acting horrible. I'm starting to wonder if the actors are being bad on purpose. The ending felt as if they were just brushing it all away, like, ""Well, that was our little adventure. Let's go back to our normal lives and forget all this, shall we?"" There was no big cliffhanger ending, no sudden, gripping desire for me to see Breaking Dawn. In short, it was a complete and utter waste of two hours.<br/><br/>On a last, more positive note, the movie did have a few redeeming points. The action scenes were great (especially the first one with Victoria) and well-executed. I also liked Charlie and Bella's 'talk'; it was nice to see Kristen Stewart actually showing some emotion for once. But one of the top moments was when Riley and his little army were emerging from the water (I was practically squealing at the epicness). Also, the movie seemed well directed.<br/><br/>But overall, it was boring, it was predictable, and by the end of it, I wanted my money back. Twilight fan or not, you probably won't like it."

","Unfortunately I was roped into taking my sisters to this and New Moon (and saw the first movie as they watched the DVD over and over.) After the first two movies I was actually a little surprised by this one; sure there is still the terrible acting, the average special effects and the sappy ""love"" story (seriously, when is Edward going to fess up to Bella that he's really gay and that's why he won't 'seal the deal'?).<br/><br/>I was able to get past what I knew was coming and find some enjoyment in the slightly dark tinge this movie added with Victoria and her army. I've always thought DB Howard was a pretty boring actor but she definitely brought something to this movie.<br/><br/>I still thought it was pretty darn bad but at least I didn't spend the whole 2 hours actively hating everyone on the screen and looking at my watch."
"chaaa","3","9","15","12 July 2010"," Nonsense, but a little less boring than the previous two
","I'm sorry to report that this third installation in the infernal Twilight franchise is disappointingly similar to its predecessors. I had been hoping that director David Slade who is responsible for the fang-tastic 30 Days of Night might have injected the franchise with the dose of blood that it so desperately needs. Unfortunately, it seems he is as sanitised as the others. It is very clear that these film are so desperately in need of the tween audience that the filmmakers refuse to allow any glimpse of gore; even going so far as a focus pull when the villainous Victoria bites someone's neck and making it so vampires heads smash like glass when they die! No blood n guts here, no sir! This instalment follows Victoria planning vengeance for her boyfriend's death at the hands of Edward (way back in the first movie) by trying to kill Bella. Of course this sparks a war between the evil vamps and the veggie vamps. As the evil vamps recruit an army of newborns the veggie's join forces with the werewolves in a truce formed with Bella's best interest at heart. Meanwhile, Bella must choose between the very lovely Jacob who will love and protect her forever and ever and Edward who will make her a vampire and she can fend for herself. Bella's decision to become a vampire, thus losing her soul, for the love of a boy is made even more troubling by the fact that she seems hardly distressed by the thought of ending her life. Despite pretty much everyone telling her it is a bad decision, she is staunch in her determination to do it. I dread to imagine the suicide tallies in a few years time if this is the stuff that is feeding our young teenagers imaginations. Although this is certainly the least boring of the three films so far, it is as still almost completely devoid of humour, and the story structure is bafflingly tedious. The problem is that every dramatic setup is merely a way for the audience to gain insight into how much Edward and Jacob love Bella. There's never a sense of danger, because we know that none of them die and despite the beautifully desolate cinematography (by Javier Aguirresrobe, fast becoming my favourite), there is not enough darkness to ever really thrill the audience. Eclipse tricks the audience into thinking that there is a dark, fearsome story going on but really it is just sanitised nonsense with no bite to it whatsoever. I cried for sex, blood and rock n roll after the first two films and hoped this film might give us some of that but unfortunately it has become clear that this franchise just doesn't have the balls! If you're a Twi-hard you know not to bother reading reviews anyway, but this is definitely the best of the bunch. For those of you who haven't been seduced, this probably won't be the one to do it. That being said, Eclipse is shot beautifully, there are topless werewolves aplenty and it is far less boring than the last two films."

","Yesterday, as we huddled down with our shared popcorn bucket in Row C, there was one question on mine and Chloe's minds- how the Hell did we end up here? As many of you will know by now, me and Chloe hate the Twilight Saga and everything it advocates- domestic violence, teenage suicide and Mormonism amongst the worst of it. And yet every time a new film is churned out, we always end up going to see it. I think that says a lot about the almost magnetic pull of this franchise- it becomes compulsive viewing for even those who solemnly hate it. Yet, obviously, the third film in the series (out of five, joy of joys) suffers from the same pitfalls as its predecessors. A shoddily-written source text, pitted full of narrative holes (for instance- how does Edward just 'get over' the fact he wants to drain his lover's blood?), some pretty awful acting at times, and the cheesiest chat up lines I have ever heard. So how does this film differ from the others? Well, there's more action, a few extra pieces of guy candy and a few more back stories for the bit parts. But yet for me, this is still overshadowed by the fact that countless tweens will look upon Edward's emotional blackmail, lies, and coercion into marriage as true love. And for that, Miss Meyer has a lot to answer for.<br/><br/>See more at: http://atthesinema.blogspot.com/2010/07/june-memoir.html"
"teeleigh417","3","32","68","30 June 2010"," When will they realize they just shouldn't bother?
","After being obligated to see Eclipse with my friends for a birthday party, I sat down thinking it won't be so bad. There will be hot guys at the very least, so I can survive. It took me only ten minutes to discover that this is yet another cheesy movie with bad acting and bad storytelling--which distracted me from the eye candy that sells so many tickets. There were so many cringe-worthy moments, from the first scene in the meadow to the proposal scene to the goodbye between Jacob and Bella at the very end. The supposed ""love triangle"" did not have me on the edge of my seat. The characters remained as self-loathing as ever. I started thinking, ""why do these Twilight movies suck so badly?"" And then I realized, it's not the fault of the actors, directors, and writers for the movies. They aren't the root of the matter.<br/><br/>It's impossible to translate Stephenie Meyer's books into movies without making them slow, uneventful, lacking chemistry, and full of bad dialogue. There is no mystery as to why these adaptations end up this way--it's because the books are that way. The books are slow and lack an involving plot, and so the movies reflect these characteristics. I could go on and on about the flaws of the Twilight series, but this is the most simple explanation.<br/><br/>And from these preliminary ratings averaging less than 4 stars now, it seems to me that satisfaction with the movies are going to go down further and further as the movies go on. There are apparently two to go. I hesitate to wonder what ways they could possibly flesh out a nonexistent plot and develop unsavory and boring characters. This left me with the conclusion that if they want to save this franchise, stop trying to make the movies interesting, because they aren't. In fact, just don't make the movies at all and do the film industry a big favor.<br/><br/>Three out of ten. (It would be lower if vampires weren't beheaded.)"

I understand there are fans of this franchise and novel, but we are entitled to our own opinion.<br/><br/>The only one I have regrets of is Taylor Lautner. He probably the only good thing, but sadly I have regrets over his past and future career when he does Stretch Armstrong. He was even Sharkboy for the love of peace.

"porkchop101","2","6","9","20 March 2011"," A step up from previous titles, but still utterly awful.
","Oh how to put into words my stance on the controversial Twilight franchise...first and foremost, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was a definite step up from its prequels. At least it did not have the feel of a shoe-string budgeted film made by high-schoolers as did the first movie. There was an improvement in film quality, and acting quality even from the most dry of the actors, though I did spend most of this film trying to avoid smothering myself with a nearby pillow. The main points here are: 1-the actors, 2-the screenplay, 3-what to expect. <br/><br/>In this review I will avoid any slamming against the general plot as that was purely the workings of Stephenie Meyer, the author of the books, and should not pertain to the acting and screenplay.<br/><br/>**The actors** The main three actors involved in the inevitable love triangle (Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner) belted out their best acting performances I have ever seen....and they were pitiful. In no way, shape, or form should they be recognized for any talent in acting. I was impressed that Kristen Stewart added another emotion to her list of two: dull, and duller. Robert Pattinson still appeared constipated (though that could be his character wanting to drain Bella), but from observing photographs of him and his other acting jobs, I think that is just his face (how unfortunate). Taylor Lautner strikes me as childish in this movie and barely pulls off a convincing job, though he rises above his costars. The supporting actors (Charlie, the Cullen Family, and even Jessica, Mike, etc.) FAR outshine the three mains. They are the only true redemption here. <br/><br/>**The Screenplay** Stepping outside of the Twilight Franchise and into the world of Harry Potter, it seemed like the only people who could understand every name, line, and character were the people who were intimate with the books and the plot. If I hadn't read the Twilight books a few years ago, everything said would have been lost on me. My sympathies to the poor saps who were drug to the theater by their girlfriends/wives. You were probably very lost. The screenwriters make NO EFFORT to help ignorant viewers understand the plot by having any narration that explains as was done in the first movie. At times, I was even lost myself. Some of the lines in this were funny, such as ""Doesn't this guy own a shirt?"" (or something to that effect). But, as in the first movies, there was no chemistry between the characters with their lines or any clever dialogue to capture the attention. <br/><br/>**What to expect** Very sad attempts at acting, mainly done by the main trio, wasted acting talents by the supporting characters, foul screenplay and NO CHARACTER CHEMISTRY. Terrible special effects, Kristen Stewart's newest facial expression, holes in the plot, and a slight improvement from the past. <br/><br/>All in all, if you are a fan of the franchise, have a nice life. But here were two hours of my life I will never get back."

So, of course, I had to see the movie. I have previously seen only ""Twilight"", and didn't really like it. So I made my parents go with me (big mistake), and they didn't understand what was going on the whole time. I did, because I've read the books and all, and I really didn't like it. Apart from the amazing landscapes, there is really nothing to it. You might get the feeling you've seen a great movie a few days after you've seen it, but after some time passes, you'll realize it's quite bad and forgettable. Really, nothing happens during the whole film. It's just boring dialogs and scenes of the forest and the mountains, and close ups of the actors and then some more boring dialogs and then there's the big fight scene. I have expected it to be mind-blowing, but it was so not! Really?! And with all that, the acting was pretty poor.

","Loved 'New Moon' but felt like they put a special delivery rush order on 'Eclipse'. For the life of me still trying to figure out what the big rush was. Sorry, silly me, the answer is money. I know the studios must love to cash in on the frenzy, but slow down and think about the next one, and the one that follows. I know we're silly little girls, but that doesn't mean you have to treat us like silly little girls that can't tell a good movie (New Moon) from a rush job (Eclipse). The love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob played better in my mind than on screen. Maybe it was the acting. Maybe I'm getting old and realize that the soppy stuff a lot of women need is made up in their own minds and our interpretation and imagination of it is much stronger than what's put on the screen. Maybe, just maybe, it was not so great acting. I love the concept of the love triangle, thought it played nicely in New Moon. Thought it wasn't played so well in Eclipse. Also, I believe that they got off the track. This may be what bothered me most. It seems like they wanted to make a stab at horror and action in Eclipse. That wasn't the author's intention. It's not supposed to be an action-horror movie. Are there not enough of those already out there?"

This one I HAVE to leave a review...<br/><br/>After 3, count them 3 movies made so far and a 4th and 5th on the way, I have to ask ""When will the torture end""? The visual of the movies are getting better, I no longer feel like I am sitting in a fog machine BUT please for the love of all that is HOLY, send Kristin and Robert to acting classes before we go on to any other movies. A box of clear tape needs to be put in Kristin's trailer to tape her gaping mouth shut. I am so tired of every time I see her she has this retarded open mouth stare and I feel like I should give her a tissue to wipe up the drool. The plaster like makeup they put on Robert must make his face so hard that he can't form any other expression but a scowl. Using the two of them as the face of 'Twilight' was a HUGE mistake because they have completely ruined this series. Thank you to whoever brought in Dakota because she is the ONLY reason this movie has anything to offer.<br/><br/>With that said (just a few peeves I have been carrying for a while) here's a note to whoever is in charge of scenery....the snow scene at the end looks like a decorated stage and not the top of a mountain. It is very apparent and extremely irritating, and honestly an insult that you would like us to believe they are any where but in front of a green screen or a stage. A note to the director....STOP rushing important scenes that are outlined and told in detail in the book. You are missing the point of the story and rushing it makes the viewer feel unsatisfied. And don't forget to send your lead actors to summer school before they finish destroying this franchise.<br/><br/>Now that the first 3 are out of the way and destroyed, I plan to see what kind of disaster they come up with for 'Breaking Dawn'. Should be interesting since it is the longest book of the series with many characters and is covered over a great distance of time. I'm hoping in about 5 to 10 years for remakes to see if someone else can do better with this series that had so much potential to start with. So far it has been nothing but a great disappointment and a let down of the high hopes I had for it."
"kogyaru_uk","5","6","9","17 September 2010"," Not bad acting
","This film is not let down by bad acting as some people would have you believe. If you think the acting is bad then please re-read the books. Kristen Stewart captures Bella's lacklustre teenage angst perfect and this is probably the only film in which Edward is actually like Edward in the books. Personally, I found the wigs awful - especially Kristen's wig which is really obvious. However the film is really let down simply by how the vampires die and if you want to know how bad that is then you are going to have to watch the film. Someone responsible for the making of the film has played this far too cautious in trying to keep the rating down for children. The final battle scene is what turns this from a teenage movie into a children's movie and as such this is a big let down."
"doctorsmoothlove","3","6","9","30 August 2010"," Bad Moon Rising
","New Moon is the unnecessary follow up to Twilight that Stephanie Meyer never intended to write. It's a writer's block novel that even its fans do not enjoy. The film version is likewise too long and languid. Still, the screenplay is peppered with such bad-movie dialog I was able chuckle my way through it. I was unfortunately not as lucky with the third film.<br/><br/>Eclipse unravels as the unnecessary cinematic rendition of Meyer's fantasy series. The film feels like a bunch of scattered events that are drawn out for the purpose of milking the franchise until the presumably much better conclusion simply must happen. Take note that the second film ends with Bella having agreed to become a vampire if Edward will not expose himself to the world. The vampire council Volturi agrees and permits them to return to Forks. This plot point remains to be resolved for the fourth and fifth films. It is referenced in Eclipse, but only in passing. Meyer either wrote the novel this way for reasons I wouldn't know as a movie reviewer or she's as poor a writer as her detractors claim she is.<br/><br/>After returning from Italy, Bella and Edward go home and fawn over each other while Jacob watches in dismay and occasional disgust. Bella won't admit that she is in love with him too and he agonizes over her refusal to be honest with herself. This dullness is only occasionally spliced with self-aware dialog that is actually funny. Edward admits that Jacob ""never wears a shirt"". The screenplay is more sophisticated as most of the corny jokes have been removed, but this works against the film. It makes obvious the melodramatic nothingness that we must endure. The camp hid it in the last movie.<br/><br/>A subplot from the first film becomes the primary plot of the third one. Victoria, the lover of the first film baddie, James, has decided to create a vampire army to attack the Cullens. Edward and Jacob's families form a temporary truce to defeat the army of newborns, while the two love interests protect Bella. Edward rebukes his ongoing criticism as a girly guy and kills Victoria with his own hands. The Volturi arrive to investigate and inquire why Bella is still human. They will kill her and destroy the Cullens unless she becomes a vampire. The latter half of the film also provides a description of the supporting characters in the series that have little significance to the story. David Slade has added a good amount of violence to the picture that will make it less insufferable for non-target audiences.<br/><br/>If Eclipse had to exist as a separate film, then it should have been produced before New Moon. The Victoria subplot should have been resolved directly after the Twilight. The Volturi should have been introduced in this film and then summoned Edward to question his relationship with Bella in the appropriate third film. And if that wasn't enough, non-fans have had to wait three films to find out more about the other characters. Why did we have to wait so long? After watching Stewart in two previous (and better) films, I feel sorry for her being forced into a conservative role that doesn't allow her to act to her strengths. Near the end of this film there is a bedroom scene where Bella asks Edward for sex. He refuses until they are wed. Now I cannot see Joan Jett, Georgia, or any of the roles she has played with aplomb attracted to a guy as unworldly as Edward.<br/><br/>Not Recommended"
"wildwansteadcat","5","6","9","26 July 2010"," Eclipse disappointing
","I eagerly awaited Eclipse only to be very disappointed. It has lost the essence of the book and vampires. The love between Bella and Edward is watered down. She chooses Edward over Jacob because she loves him more and can't live without him. Thats why she wants to become a vampire. This does not come across in the film. We get the impression she wants to marry Edward so she can become a vampire. Kristen Stewart does not seem able to portray the emotional journey of Bella. The new Vctoria looks like a refugee from 'Bewitched' with a bad wig. The fight scenes are bloodless and gutless (vampires breaking like marble figures). This might just as well have been a Disney film it was so 'child friendly'! The only things worth watching were Robert Pattinson, the CGI wolves, and the scenery! I hope the next film in the series does better."
"hmsgroop","5","6","9","24 July 2010"," Much Ado about Nothing
","So much ado in the world mass media about ""Eclipse""! And - much ado about nothing. <br/><br/>""Summit Entertainment"", please call back either Catherine Hardwicke or at least Chris Weitz! The franchise is getting from bad to worse. You're in danger of losing millions of viewers for ""Breaking Dawn"" if the trend begun by David Slade continues! If you don't care about quality movies, care at least about your profits. ""Eclipse"" is a cheap hack-work whose only aim is to make some easy money. It won't work twice.<br/><br/>David Slade has done the impossible - he managed to butcher the ""Eclipse"" novel altogether! Instead of the most dynamic book of the saga, which – though possessing no literary qualities of big literature - is at least a page-turner, he produced an incredibly cheesy hash-dish of disconnected episodes, none of which is charged and coherent enough for the viewer to evaluate its meaning for the plot and character development. The film has no magic of Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" which concentrated on the phenomenon of first love with all shades of emotion, its tenderness and blunders. The colour gamut of ""Twilight"", the dialogues, the motivation of the characters, the pacing varying from slow to lightning speed – everything was there to contribute to the magic. Chris Weitz, on the other hand, concentrated on the character of Jacob and on the film gathering momentum in the very end, when Bella goes to Italy. This break from the slow pacing of the time tedious for Bella to break-neck speed of the Italian part does the film credit. Though in comparison with ""Twilight"", Chris Weitz almost botches up Edward's character to save it at the last moment in the episode with the Volturi, both films have an atmosphere of their own. Not so the ""Eclipse"".<br/><br/>Slade and Rosenberg seem to have been intensely hating the book while filming it. How otherwise could they have created this  this product (euphemism)? No coherent and consistent dialogue, no dialogue meaningful enough to give the actors at least SOME room for displaying their acting skills, no character motivation, no chemistry between the characters. The flashbacks with Rosalie and Jasper held some promise, but no, David Slade was very consistent in destroying their appeal, too. Both the stories lack some essential parts absolutely necessary for understanding the characters. On the whole, all the actors have to mumble through some nonsense lines which have to pass for dialogue. ALL of them seem to be there just because the franchise must plod on. Edward's repeated bleating about Bella marrying him obviously gets even on his own nerves. Action? Don't make my cat laugh. If this tiny part of vampires' training and a tiny fragment of real fighting lacking any gusto can be called action, then I'll eat my hat. I bet people expected much more than that bit of morning exercise, waving hands and raising legs. The only credits in this field go to Jasper and Emmett.<br/><br/>Acting? Godawful. It seems the main characters are suffering from various diseases and need medication real quick.<br/><br/>Edward is hanging about with the facial expression of one having chronic dyspepsia. It seems that each and every Bella's appearance on the set is nauseating for him and he's manly fighting this emotion to conceal it. Motilium and sickness medications, quick! It's not a progress in acting, but a step back. Edward was best in ""Twilight"", in ""New Moon"" it was slow deterioration, now it's a catastrophe. Edward must be changing, but - so? Edward seems to be turning into a willing slave of Bella and effacing himself completely. It's obvious that, on the one hand, the actor was left with no choices of his own and with not much of a role to play, on the other hand, he's tired of the franchise whatever he may be saying in public (and anyone would be tired of this film 'very DIFFERENT from the previous two'). By the way, we should do Mr. Pattinson credit, for he's honest – he said that he feared nobody would come to see the film. He has definitely seen the pre-release copy. Next time I'll be more attentive to the messages he sends.<br/><br/>Bella. She's lost all the appeal of a young inexperienced girl caring for everybody, eager not to hurt, to bring together, a heart bleeding for everyone. Now we see an egoistic scheming wench not caring a fig about anybody, her only aim, as we learn in the end, was to sift through her motives and to make the RIGHT choice, and that's becoming a vampire, love is secondary here. Is she doing it for her shrink? Next time fetch your pocket calculator to draw up the balance, Bella. Bella's attempt to seduce Edward looks nauseating, so pre-planned it is. Where's love, where's sincerity, where's youthful impetuousness? Gone to the dogs. On the whole, judging by Bella's facial expression it's evident that the girl was dropped head down more than once in her infancy and now has difficulty comprehending what is being said around her. Acetazolamide may have helped, had it been taken earlier. Bella's also obviously a mouth-breather. Remove your adenoids, Bells. Before it's too late and you're too far gone.<br/><br/>Jacob. No progress in comparison with ""New Moon"", too few and too bad lines given, too little screen time.<br/><br/>Victoria. Rachelle Lefevre was voluptuous, lascivious, dangerous. Bryce Dallas Howard is emaciated, pitiful, heavily painted and timid. She can't touch Rachelle Lefevre. A very bad choice. The wig alone doesn't make the character. A bad mistake of ""Summit"".<br/><br/>Was there ANYTHING good? My thumbs up to Jasper, Alice, Emmett, Carlisle, Charlie, Riley (though Riley's part could have been made more dramatic and consistent, but not with the current wonder script, alas). Oh, yes, the landscapes were impressive."

","Basically, the summary says it all. The book is interesting, read the book. If you are really bored and there is nothing to rent one day, have a twilight movie marathon, but don't expect to come away from it dazzled. Eclipse, the 3rd in the series, blows through the scenes without any clear junction between them. The audience has no time to process what has just happened when they have yet another THING happening. Bella and Edward make out. Cut to vampires ravaging people. Cut to Jacob declaring his love. Cut to Bella confused. And is it just me, or is everyone just a little too calm and controlled?? Bella is hardly able to muster a smile most of the time, let alone any true emotion. Even from the very first movie, it was like they were TRAGICALLY in love, like they don't WANT to be in love, they HAVE to be in love and damn are they depressed about it. The books were great, the movies, just awful, and although they stuck many nuggets in Eclipse for the fans- scenes we just couldn't live without- there was no flow to them. Just a bunch of scenes thrown together and poof! its a movie. Im really disappointed."
"Nyx_Selene","3","7","11","29 October 2010"," ONE good movie in this saga, is that too much to ask?
","This is by far the best of the three Twilight-movies yet released. It's more amusing and nicer shot than it's prequels. But is it good? Nah. The Twilight movies are actually something as unusual as book adaptions so bad, they've made me dislike the books. And I used to LIKE the books.<br/><br/>But regarding ""Eclipse"": It depicts Victoria's attempt at getting revenge on the Cullens, by creating her own personal vampire army (or at least platoon), but the main focus is on Jacob and Edward, trying to out-do and outplay each other like hormonal little teenagers, all in the quest for Bella's love. Don't ask me why, 'cause I honestly can't fathom why anyone would like this girl. It's funny, but fact is, Jacob acts like a brat, and don't expect movie-Edward to be anything like novel-Edward. This is not the strong, secure 100+-year-old vampire from the books, but a mopey, uncertain tween, that has me wondering just what about him is supposed to be attracting to us. I can't help thinking that a guy who still hasn't gotten over the self-consciousness issues at 100+ years, probably won't ever. He's supposedly telepathic and very fast, but has now managed to get his ass somewhat to completely handed to him in 3 out of 3 movies, so this guy is clearly not fit to protect anyone either. If he was all standing between me and danger, I'd arm myself to my teeth or run like hell.<br/><br/>Our female protagonist (also my main issue with this franchise) – though she does a better job in this movie than in the prequels - is still pretty much a hollow, emotionless shell, with less of a personality than my laptop. I can't see ""Bella"" anywhere, just Kristen Stewart failing to act. This is an ""actress"" with a range of 2-3 facial expressions; I prefer to describe them as bored and vacant, while my male friends consider her to look perpetually stupid and horny. Maybe that's why they like her...<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do a decent enough job, we're given some new insights to some of the Cullen family members, but the action is quite boring, and the decision to make the vampires fully mobile while whole, but made of stone when broken, is rather incomprehensible, and makes them seem like porcelain dolls; fragile and very, very breakable. The first movie states that the only way to kill them is to rip them apart and burn the pieces, but in this movie, they just break into a heap of stone shards. How they manage to burn is beyond me. Heck, how they manage to MOVE is beyond me.<br/><br/>As a tween sort of high school-comedy, Eclipse works. It'll even have you laughing at some points. But it doesn't really work as anything else."
"simonparker1990","4","7","11","3 August 2010"," Not for me, but why is it actually for anyone?
","Let's get this out of the way first, the Twilight saga is not my cup of tea. Sure I like vampire movies, but this is not a vampire series, nor a werewolf one. Its a series full of long, tedious pauses padding off as ""sexual tension"", and actors whom hormonal teenage girls can pander over. With that in mind I question why I still continue to see this dross. I have now seen all three currently released on the cinemas, the first being a complete and utter waste of my time, the second being mildly diverting in the final half hour, and then now there is this one. This one bemuses perhaps the most of the series as I had gone in after reading quite decent reviews. While I didn't expect miracles I at least hoped to see some improvement. Sadly I'd argue this was just as bad as the first one, all the mild improvement made in the first one now being put behind us. The three leads do their roles with some decency, Taylor Lautner by far being the best of the mediocre bunch. But the story is still where I get frustrated. I swear in this movies absolutely nothing happens, the promise of a wedding at the second one does not even come close to being fulfilled here. And the action comes in such short supply most male minds will have switched off far earlier.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is still the weak link for me in this series, quite why he's screamed at over is beyond me. His scenes are just painful, he pouts, he acts far too emotional and he has long pauses. It is a terribly written role for a terrible character. Kristen Stewart at least has got over the whiny stage of the second movie, and here she has livened up, but still she gets the bulk of the horrific lines involving souls and whatnot that make your eyes role. So like the sequel it is left to Taylor Lautner to add some energy into the movie. Sure once again he is the eye candy, I mean does he really need to be shirtless that often? But at least he's got a spark of charisma, something I can see coming out when he has much better roles. The rest of the cast are the usual cardboard cutouts. The vamps and werewolves so underwritten you wonder why they're there. And as for the recasting of Bryce Dallas Howard, why bother?<br/><br/>Story wise this feels like a short story at best painfully dragged to feature length movie. Once again the pace is slow, the action few and far between and special effects ranging from average to downright awful, I still despise the vampire running sequences. I will be fair and say for fans of the Twilight saga this will no doubt be a hoot for them. I don;t understand why that is at all, but I have just chosen to accept it for now. Sadly we have another two parts still to come, and as cliffhangers go, well its not exactly something that makes me want to go running back to the theatre when Breaking Dawn arrives. The final action scene is admittedly fairly decent, not too keen on the vampire death effect though. But its the closest the series has come to even trying to entertain the male audience, so for that it has my slightest gratitude. But without the gravitas of Michael Sheen like its predecessor, this movie sadly is just another overlong piece of tripe pandering to fans who seem almost blinded at how terrible this series truly is. So strictly for fans, or for those like me that have got this far ans in a sick way just go to see if it can possibly get any worse."
"mskdm20","5","7","11","14 July 2010"," The book is far better
","I'm going to agree with several of the reviews on this one, the book is far better. The script was bland, the acting was terrible, (""Bella, you love me!"" ""Well, I am the hot one!""), the special effects sucked, and Dakota Fanning as one of the head vampires? Bad move. Kristen Stewart cannot act, and neither can Rob Patterson. Sorry, and I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of negative comments from the teenage crowd from writing this.<br/><br/>Maybe, it's the fact that I prefer dark, and mysterious vampire movies? This movie was like a Disney movie, cute & fluffy. Even the scene where the good vampires fight the bad vampires was ridiculous! <br/><br/>The only two characters I liked were Jasper, and Alice. The actors who played them actually brought the characters to life! Kristen couldn't bring Bella to life, nor Rob on Edward. It was just terrible, terrible acting!"
"Quinoa1984","5","7","11","6 July 2010"," too decently directed to be bad, too ham-fisted and stupid and vapid to be any good. an uncomfortable middle
","Twilight: Eclispe, the third in the series, this time gets David Slade, formerly of flawed but still impressive outings Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night, at the helm of the vampire-werewolf-insipid-romance ""saga"" everyone loves to hate (or just hates to love I guess). And it turns out to be one of those rare cases where you watch a good director working a bad script. To face facts, all of the scripts- via the Meyer books- are terrible, hackneyed, trashy. The results this time are the ""best"" of the series, however technically- some decent action and a couple of well-acted and (perhaps from the director's input) well-written scenes. But the more it tries, the more it draws attention to how vapid and s*** the main characters are. I'm reminded of that scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen goes up to the couple on the street and asks what they do to keep their relationship going: ""Well, I'm shallow, and he's shallow, and we have nothing interesting to say."" ""Ah, so you've found something that works for you."" <br/><br/>Why should anyone care about Bella? Perhaps cause she breathes, and has some thoughts, but what are her interests? What does she care about, aside from precious old-high-schooler Edward, or maybe 2nd-tier bare-shirted Jacob, or at the bottom of the rung her limp noodle father? If you had to ask what she was to someone who saw this movie, one might say indecisive, manipulative (or manipulated by proxy), and sees nothing ahead of the future. Perhaps she missed out on extra-curricular activities after school. But again, I kept trying to find something, anything, to latch on to to make me care what would happen to her, or what would happen with her and these two guys, who don't give her any great shakes either. That Kristen Stewart isn't a terrible actress (just, in general here, dull or annoying), makes more apparent how screwed up she is. But being screwed up doesn't always make one interesting.<br/><br/>Perhaps more interesting are the men in her life, but of course those are ""Team"" Edward and ""Team"" Jacob. This time the filmmakers do try to throw some in-jokes our way as it goes with them (""Where's his shirt?"" asked by Edward is maybe too knowing, especially before more shirt-less happenings go on in the runtime), and there's actually a halfway nice scene (not great, just nice) where Eddie and Jakey have a heart to heart about how they really feel, what things might be like without what's-her-name screwing with them and them screwing her metaphorically back. But really, it's just more of the same, with a plot in the story that makes things all the more obnoxious on Bella's end. So many people end up dying, or turning into vampires and then dying or being killed, and all because Bella has to have her man. Looking at them, they're a little *too* Ossie and Harriet. The kind you can't stand.<br/><br/>Again, unlike with New Moon especially, Slade knows how to direct actors.... sometimes (Jackson Rathbone a MAJOR exception, being creepy like an incestuous love-spawn of Harpo Marx). And he knows how to even get some cool action going on, once or twice at least, such as in the big climax where the wolves, looking less ridiculous than the last film, attacking the 'bad' vampires out to get Bella. And he gets a fascinating flashback with one of the female Cullen vamps. But at the end of it all, is it worth it? Still, not really. If you're looking for a technically proficient and competent film that only some of the time has dialog making one laugh to oneself (or guffaw or belly laugh or LOL), then be my guest. But if you happen to be more like me, looking for the unintentional hilarity of teenage romance gone idiotic and morally questionable for young women in the guise of crappy vampires, you may be disappointed. The more Slade and company try, the more I just wish it were something else, like, for example, not this."
"seti1","8","7","11","4 July 2010"," Straight to Video?
","I like the Twilight series, both the films and books. Of course the books are better - since my imagination is better than most of the directors.<br/><br/>So far the films have all been disappointments, even the first - which has been the best to date. Meyers is no Tolkien, Goodkind or Marion Zimmer Bradley, but one would have expected better of the films.<br/><br/>Having seen all the films, I am wondering if it might not be better for Breaking Dawn, the next in the series to go straight to video, especially if it's being broken into two. Die hard fans will certainly purchase the DVDs/BluRays in spite of poor acting, stilted dialogue, cheesiness, etc. however, since it appears to be mostly about the money...<br/><br/>Billy Burke, who plays Charlie, is awesome as is Ashley Greene. The rest of the cast was so-so. Hard to believe that the three main characters stand to make 25 mil for the next installment.<br/><br/>The original Victoria was better than the new one, but I guess we don't need to worry about that. She was only in about four minutes of the film, and I understand that they expanded it for the big name actress, but they needn't have bothered. <br/><br/>The entire fight scene was short and poorly done, but probably the highlight of this film. Still, I am a fan, so I enjoyed it, especially after the dismal failure of the second."
"ptwillis727","1","20","40","1 July 2010"," Just an awful film
","I went into this movie open minded hoping that i would enjoy the third installment much more than the second. I really enjoyed the first film and was highly disappointed in New Moon. Eclipse in a nut shell is New Moon all freaking over again plus a new terrible ""villian"". I was shocked by the story and acting in this garbage of a film. The whole story is a never ending cycle of, does she love Edward? Or does she love Jacob? and it gets VERY OLD! I really wanted to just take a nap in the theater so i could at least get a bit of enjoyment out of this awful experience. Now for the acting... I could have had my 5 year old sister play a better Vultari leader than Dakota Fanning, I seriously had to laugh at every scene the Vultari were in because it was that bad, and I don't even wanna get started on Taylor Lautner because if i do i will be writing for days. He is by far the worst actor in a big budget movie i have ever seen, period. For your own good please do not waste your 10 dollars and see this in theaters! Don't even rent in when its out on DVD. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 at best."
"amy-rio09","4","13","24","30 June 2010"," For This Series, It Was... Good.
","In writing this review I'm going to disregard the painful ethical problems that come along with this series because in my opinion, they are plentiful. The Twilight Saga has come to be the home run at Yankee Stadium for tween girl entertainment, it's become iconic but not for any good reason, and it's become a joke and a disappointment to modern American cinema. However, it - unfortunately - has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>I'm going to start with the bad parts here. I sat there entranced by what I saw in front of me. No, it wasn't Taylor Lautner's abs or Robert Pattinson's jawline but I was trying to figure out where in the world Davide Slade or his DP went to film school. I wondered who taught him, who told him that it was okay to shoot an entire 2 hour movie in a close up. Forget about the fact that he made Taylor Lautner actually look unattractive with unflattering angles and the worst lighting configurations ever recorded on film, think about the action sequences when you could hardly tell what was happening. I guess I kind of get that maybe he was attempting to make it look like they were moving in super speed but it came off in a very different way. Flashing a bunch of quick images in front of my face that almost don't have a purpose isn't good technique... it makes the movie look like a music video. I prefer, when I'm watching a movie, to know where I am. I like to see backgrounds and sets and atmosphere. I don't, however, like to come extremely close to being able to count the nose hairs under Robert Pattinson's face.<br/><br/>The writing is just a tad off in this series. It's bumpy. Of course, a lot of book adaptations can feel that way especially when you have to fit in the content and make sure to schedule Taylor Lautner to take his shirt off at least 15 times. I hate the re-work with the Riley and Bree characters, it's 100% unnecessary. We have enough characters to focus on as it is especially as we learn the daunting pasts of two more of the Cullen clan, Jasper and Rosalie.<br/><br/>The acting has ""improved."" Rob, Taylor, and Kristen definitely aren't up for any Oscars but their probably shoe-ins for some more moon men. With that said, I was as impressed as you can be with the acting in this series. Rob didn't seem to resemble a rock anymore, he's moved on to something more like molasses. Taylor has kind of grown into himself and doesn't seem afraid anymore. And Kristen, she finally has gotten rid of the grunting she does. She suddenly doesn't stumble over every word anymore though there was an awful lot of mumbling. Nikki Reed, did a great job with her monologue I thought. That impressed me. Jackson Rathbone on the other hand, not so much. Jasper comes out of his shell a little bit in the story and apparently also adapts a southern accent that he didn't have before. Anna Kendrick was perfect as Jessica, the graduation speech was genuine and brilliantly delivered. But Billy Burke, oh, what a life saver he is. He is the white knight of this series but I'm not sure anyone else has noticed yet. Congrats, pops.<br/><br/>Overall, taking into account all of the things I love and hate about this series it was good. I enjoyed it. You have to look at it in a glass of half full kind of way. If this is the best we're gonna get then, okay, it's not so bad. Right? Those of us who aren't 12 and ask a little more from a film can tolerate it finally. Critics can rejoice? No, that's still a bit of a stretch but hey... all we can do now if hope for the best for the final two chapters and Bill Condon will hopefully try to save us all."

And really it sends a bad message to all young females. Bella loves Edward then she loves Jacob then its back to Edward and then who knows, it could jasper next. Sending a message to be in love with more then one person is wrong. If you are in love someone then there should not be someone else. I rate it a five because of the sarcastic and funny things Jacob would say throughout the movie. He kept it real!!! Now Jacob you know all the girls love you, you don't need Bella I seen plenty of other fine girls in the Twilight movies, Holla at one of them.

Most of it, this proves the best how to alienate teenagers so early, making 12 y.o. kids going out of the theaters with the books under their arms like a bible thinking about sex symbols and perfect bodies and with no sense at all of what's good or what's bad for them, because if you tell just one of them that this is the worst movie series ever they can spit right in your face and call you a sh*t. This is one of the reasons that makes me think that this is the end of days. At my teenage times (almos 15 years ago), my parents would never accept me going watch this piece of crap. Never! That's why my senses today are so better than a lot of what will be in the future when this kids have exactly my age now. That's sad. There's no good movie for teenagers.

Some of the love stuff can be gagging. I hate Jacob. Let me say that again I HATE JACOB, and I'm not too big of a fan of Bella, though I'm sorry, but I do think Kristen plays a good Bella. Rob's performance I could give or take. Taylor plays Jacob well. I just don't know if people are going in with too high expectations or what. I thought that I really wasn't going to enjoy them switching Victoria, but to be honest I don't think the original actress could have pulled this one off. Over all it's a good movie and I would normally rate it 8, but because I think the rating is very unbalanced I gave it 10."

","To me, this is the worst book in the series and therefore I didn't expect much. Yes, the movie is well-directed and the acting is good if not better but the whole movie feels to me like a filler.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the franchise, just not of trying to stretch something beyond its reach.<br/><br/>The first movie is all about how they meet and still my favorite ever. The second one is the inevitable tease of what if Bella and Edward did not live happy ever after. The third movie is simple stuffing to stretch out the franchise. Its only when we get to the forth movie that things start happening again.<br/><br/>We get more of that 'perhaps Bella loves Jacob' nonsense and more vampire drama but, in essence, nothing is added and no one would have noticed if this movie was left out and simply went from New Moon to rising dawn.<br/><br/>I think rising dawn will be the best movie ever if they don't split it in two. Finally there is enough material to carry a film and now they want to cut it in half? Please try to stick to quality rather than quantity.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the Twilight series earlier this year when I spent two weeks in bed with a serious bout of flu and nothing to keep me busy except stacks of movies and books.<br/><br/>Favorite parts? Robert Pattinson is yummy as ever with his velvety voice and the soundtrack still rocks. I really look forward to seeing him in future roles once he had time to develop as an actor.<br/><br/>Being a writer, I must admit that I probably wouldn't have liked the books so much if I wasn't running a high fever. You see, the concept is brilliant but the writer is still very green. This is what happens when your first book/series ever turns gold. The dialog is often clumsy and I get the sense that the movies are stretched too much.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next installment."

","First off, the only reason i gave it a 10, is to counter balance the negative votes this movie received, which il get into later.<br/><br/>On the second day of this movies showing (Thursday) i decided to go see Eclipse with my family, as i had done for the past two. i was a fan of the books prior to the movie series, and was unhappy to see that both twilight, and new moon cut out major parts of the books. When going to see eclipse.i had low expectations. The ratings were low, and my because prior experience to the movie saga, i had doubts this film would be any better. The only reason i decided to whip out $10 for probably ""B"" movie, was because i heard there was a new director who wanted to capture the ""male"" audience with more action. He did not succeed. If you look at the votes, 90% of males votes this film 4 and below. When watching the movie, i couldn't help but noticing the directors promise for a less-chick flick eclipse was a load of crap..what really surprised me, was how good this movie was despite that fact. I can't say either Robert Patinsonn or Kristian steward are great actors, but they're both certainly improved. The awkwardness between the two actors( Edward and Bella) was apparent in both twilight and new moon. Their chemistry surprised me in eclipse, the romantic scenes between the two characters were more..natural i guess you'd say. Another MAJOR thing that surprised me, was how accurate this film was too the book. A few details were left out of course, but most parts were true to the book, and the extra hour to do this, was totally worth it. <br/><br/>I know i don't represent the typical male-audience member..Most wont even give the films a chance. My advice to anyone seeing this movie..if your a guy, and don't like the twilight books, or past movies..Don't SEE IT, your not going to like it, and even if it was really good, you'd probably hate it anyway because, lets face it, most people hate twilight just for the sake of hating it. Most girls, will probably like this. its a good love story, with good action scenes to back it up. IMO a good watch.<br/><br/>Go check out the votes for this movie..most males may have voted the movie 4 and under..females generally gave it a score of 6 or more. Why? its a chick-flick, and thats all i have to say about that.<br/><br/>see the movie<br/><br/>actual rating: <br/><br/>Acting: 6/10 Robert Pattinson and Kristain Stewart may not have been great, but Taylor Lautner made up for them<br/><br/>Effects/CGI: 6/10 Other then the fail-CGI wolves..all's good<br/><br/>Plot: 8/10 A great plot strait from Stephanie Meyer's popular book series, very accurate to the book.<br/><br/>Sound: 9/10 Great music soundtrack, really fit the mood of the movie.

","I was so excited for this moving and left feeling less than satisfied. After a great deal of thought, I've realized why: Generally, I thought this particular movie lacked passion and intensity. I felt NOTHING. In the book, Bella was truly conflicted when she discovered her feelings for Jacob...I felt her pain. I didn't feel that in the movie. Also as adorable as I think Taylor Lautner is, I just didn't feel the sincerity of his feelings for Bella. His feelings have grown more intense with every movie but while his feelings have matured, Lautner as an actor has not. Kristen Stewart also has not grown as an actress enough to convey the feelings of a tortured Bella. Robert Pattinson is a more mature actor and it showed.<br/><br/>A few more picky details...Eclipse had a different director and it was really obvious. They definitely should have stuck with the first director. Also, it was definitely a mistake to replace the first Victoria with Ron Howard's daughter. I didn't believe her as this evil, blood-thirsty vampire. She's a cute girl but that's it...cute"

The movie's plot was fast but so slow at the same time it was just weird everything jumped, details from the book was missing like why Rosalie changed Emmett, including baby henry or anything, not needed but would of been nice, jaspers retelling of the newborns felt off, it was crazy. I know the movies/books are different but geez this was just totally off new moon and twilight I can at least identify with this was just really weird and hopefully breaking dawn does it justice and i hope that they can all step up their game because the conclusion is dramatic and deep. Im not look forward to two parts."

","I saw new moon and twilight and i have to admit i feel ashamed to admit it but i like some scenes of these movies (love scenes, i am a girl after all). But Eclipse is by far the worst of the saga. I spent the entire movie clicking fast forward, i couldn't' resist the dialogs; far more stupid than the other two movies (hard to believe). The hole movie was pointless and boring...i understand that the target of these movies are teens so it doesn't have to make sense, but does it have to be That boring??. The hole movie is about the love triangle (the vampire, the shirtless wolf and the dull girl)and the pointless dialogs between them. I think i am done with these movies and i would protect my neurons from it."
"antoniotierno","6","8","14","3 July 2010"," not awful but poorly acted and overlong
","Eclipse isn't excellent but neither terrible. This adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's book falls somewhere in the middle, between the 2008's Twilight and the emotional oasis of 2009's New Moon. The Twilight series is often too much melodramatic but gets usually to arouse amorous emotions and thrills. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg and new series director David Slade (Hard Candy) try to use the whole teenage material into a coherent shape, with decent results. The inconsistency comes from tone results that end up being even lethargic at a point, so the forth installment will really have to be different otherwise fans will start getting tired of it."
"jedainz","3","16","33","4 July 2010"," Better than New Moon but still not good enough.
","While New moon's story sequence was pretty bad, it actually improved in Eclipse. Sad thing is, the scenes were too cheesy and fake to look at. The CGI for the background is also very lame. It was like they were just place in the setting like how cartoons are. The musical scoring was hideous too. They don't go together most of the time.<br/><br/>We can't deny the fact that The Twilight Saga was originally written as a love story, but the director selected all of the cheesy lines of the book and fitted it all in 2 hours. As a result, the movie looked cheap and corny. It wasn't romantic anymore because of this. <br/><br/>Twilight's musical scoring was very impressive. New moon was also good. Here in Eclipse, i felt like I was watching an old epic flick. Though they tried to make it better by inserting some emo-rock song, it was still very bad. Most of them were very classical and it didn't fit into the teen chick flick movie it's suppose to be.<br/><br/>The action scenes were pretty impressive. But they looked as if they were just placed in the feature. I don't know if they lack the budget or what. Judging from the outcome, seems like they did. To add to everything, they styro-slash-mannequin for the dead zombies was too much. Too much cheapness I mean. Why can't they use a better representation? <br/><br/>If you ask me if I would still watch Eclipse had I known all these, the answer would still be yes. Not because I liked the movie or the book. But just for the heck of it. Next year, I hope it'll be better."

","I've never been fan of the Twilight saga movies nor the books, I've only watched them because of the popular choice me and my friends take when we've been to the theater. OK so basically the main plot remains the same,there is this big event coming up and the the tension builts around it, introduce some couple of new characters here and there and you are good to take off, in the Twilight saga universe things can get a little too dramatic, well that's not the exception here. A big part of the movie is spent of preparing for the big event/climax of the movie and manages to include the love triangle between the leads, the storyline is not crappy for what it is, but may not fulfill die hard fans' expectations <br/><br/>On the acting department, we still have that all weird behavior from Kristen, Pattinson as the same, And Taylor a little too much angry through the movie, The supp cast gets also the job done for what the movie aloud them to play(overall one can say there is talent among the cast, but not so much in this flick). This is as bad or as good as the previous entries, depends of how much you like to put it, if you liked the first two you'll probably like this one, If you hated the first two you'll probably hate this one too.

She enjoys both, she just can't make up her mind as to what to stick to. If you have as sick a mind as this girl, you might as well do both, because I honestly don't know what is worse, screwing dead people or animals.<br/><br/>If your children watches this, I feel sorry for you.

"cornyflakes","5","7","12","4 July 2010"," Love just ain't enough
","Much better Twilight number three story compared to the disastrous second installment, The New Moon. Story concentrates to describe the newly found love between wolf boy Jacob (Lautner) and human girl Bella (Stewart), her old love to vampire boy Edward (Pattinson), and dealings with vengeful vampire Victoria (Howard) and her new army, together with the all the matters vampires leave behind when crossing over.<br/><br/>Story is much more fluent and active, dialogs slightly improved, acting more or less same. The inserts of new born vampire army together with the back-stories of Cullen vampires Jasper (Rathbone) and Rosalie (Reed) were refreshing reliefs from continuous Bella/Jacob affair. The fighting scene, apparently THE last fight there will be, was well made, albeit short. The vampires were suddenly moving much slower. Editing works and the cinematography is really breath taking. The new wolf pack members had improved CGI bodies, they actually started to look like wolfs; someone has been finally studying animal anatomy. There were still problems with the scaling; the distance and the wolf size didn't change accordingly. Was this why close up of Jacob's hairy tail shows no balls? <br/><br/>It is obvious that Rosenberg tried to update Bella to be more appealing to modern women. In the fight scene, she takes an active role saving Edward from decapitation distracting Victoria and Riley with her blood, in the end of the film she is really not choosing between boys but who she is as a person (they fooled me for awhile), she is the one who figures out who is behind the army, she does not do cooking/laundry to her father anymore, instead Charlie (Burke) is asking if she wants to have a sandwich, she complains Edward being old fashioned (he is from Victorian era) not having sex with her before marriage and she tells Edward she wants to keep her own name when married. Unfortunately, together with the hassling between Jacob/Edward it made the story contradicting itself and left a desperate aftertaste. Too much effort was made to play in all camps.<br/><br/>If you think this story has been about love, in the end of this movie you are told otherwise. A lot of effort is put to bring Jacob forward as a worthy suitor; long stares and dialogs, love confessions, choose me moments and a neon highlighting to underline the fact that it is possible to love more than one person at the time. On the way he tries to prove this by forcing himself on her and wishing Bella really would better dead than one of the vampires, and finally joining forces with Cullens to protect her. Eventually all culminates to a long-long-long ultimate kiss at the top of the snowy mountain, camera rolling around them in different angles. The fact that the recent fiancé Edward, to whom Bella is engaged to be married, is watching this all is not allowed to bring any consequences, the concepts of infidelity and betrayal are not even mentioned. Bella is actively seeking Jacob's company throughout the movie and hiding the engagement ring, pointing out her feelings for him; every character in the movie is made to play a role to emphasize this. Even the scene where Jacob is crushed by a new born is moved later in the story so that Bella can go to him, and even though the Cullen's are standing right beside they are still last to arrive to his rescue.<br/><br/>Jacobs's value as a right choice is like secretly added by showing scenes throughout the movie of what Bella would be leaving behind as a vampire. Bella's mother (Clarke) is giving a trip-T-shirt blanket hoping future and children for her, Jessica's (Kendrick) graduation speech of value of mistakes and possibilities to change one's mind, father Charlie telling he would look for her forever if she ever goes missing, Rosalie's story and her wish of still having a possibility to grow old and being surrounded by grandchildren, and Edward's pain of condemning her to go through all that sacrifice because of him.<br/><br/>Explanation/s why Jacob would be just a right for Bella is actually quite well done, too well in the end. After all this one has to wonder why the vampire boy is still around? This is explained in two last scenes, in case viewer is confused. In the dialogs between Jacob and Bella, Jacob complains how difficult it was to make Bella confess her feelings for him. Bella answers she only fought against it because it wouldn't change anything (so why she led him on all two movies if she knew this all along?). Laconically Jacob states ""if love would only be enough"" (= if it would be enough Bella would have chosen Jacob) and hints he would be waiting for her even after her heart stops beating. Was this leaving the door open to be continued? In the last scene Bella is making a monologue to verbalize the point of all this to Edward: ""This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. It was a choice who I should be and who I am"". After this is explanation how she feels outsider as a human/body and how she is more herself in a world of vampires. To this Edward asks ""so this wasn't about me"", and Bella ""sorry, no"". So, Bella wants to be a vampire, therefore she will be with Edward, and Edward is to be her trophy husband. In the end Bella has all the choices, and a right to love multiple persons. Edward is left alone with Bella, and Jacob is doomed to imprint. <br/><br/>Love really ain't enough, not even in the world of fantasy. Girl has to eat, and sometimes girl wants to eat some blood."
"rivertam26","8","20","44","30 June 2010"," David Slade finally nails the material!!!!
","Twilight the book series area guilty pleasure written in such a way that makes it very easy to connect with it's characters and story lines. twilight the original film was a big time guilty pleasure. Quality wise it wasn't very good, uneven performances, uneven direction accompanied by some slick cinematography, a great soundtrack and an entrancing chemistry from Pattinson and Stewart. It's sequel fared much better. Although critically trashed the film was made for the fans. Anyone whose read New Moon knows how extremely close it is to the book. All the good and all the bad that film was accompanied by a solid lead performance from Stewart, some truly inspiring cinematography, a giant helping of wonderful creative and confident direction. This installment Twilight Saga Eclipse is a merging of the formula that both those films so successful and add it's own touch of pizazz with Director David Slade who just absolutely nails the material. Fans will love, the regular movie going audience will love it, critics seems to be loving it for te most part it's just a great movie. The performances are so solid in this film and the chemistry between the main threesome of main characters is so enthralling and believably complex in this installment. the effects seem to have been cleaned up and refined, the cinematography is once again beautifully striking although not as creative last time around, the score is breathtaking and the film just feels fresh, like nothing you've ever seen before. The film is just so entertaining and involving on so many levels but almost flawless with the exception of two things why change Victoria from Levre to Howard. I mean Howard didn't have a big enough role to merit that change. If it was performance they were looking for I could understand Howard being a better actress. But it just seemed to be a wasted change. And the one thing I hated was Bella's wig it just looked awkward and weird in so many scenes besides that the new editions to the story line fill it out nicely if only for a brief period of time and at the center of this truly brilliant film is just a theme of graduation, self discovery and decisions and not in the way you would be led to believe something we've all experienced. It was just wonderful without a doubt the best of the series, the best of the summer, the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I just can't see them topping this one."

"Hellmant","4","5","8","14 September 2010"," Contributing to the raping of the imagination?
","'THE TWILIGHT SAGE: ECLIPSE': Two Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>I've never been one to jump on the band wagon and hate something just because it's popular to hate; I disliked the first 'TWILIGHT' movie the first time I saw it on opening weekend even before I had any idea it would be so infamously loathed by so many (and yet loved by an equal number, which is always the case). I was actually expecting a good movie since it was directed by a good director (Catherine Hardwick, who helm-ed such well respected movies as 'THIRTEEN', which she also co-wrote, and 'LORDS OF DOGTOWN') and starring the very talented Kristen Stewart, not to mention the fact that it was based on an immensely popular book about vampires and werewolves (but popular books can be just as trashy and poorly made as popular movies and I've heard from people that have read the books, as well, that they're just as bad as the movies based on them). So I was somewhat surprised to find out how awful the movie actually was and then later learned that many others agreed. I thought the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, was about the worst actor I had ever seen in a major motion picture and the dialog and drama was so cheesy and ridiculous that it wasn't even so bad it was good, it was just nauseating. The sequels have gotten a little better with each one though through well executed business tactics. Experts take note on everything that doesn't work about a film and attempt to somewhat fix it with the next installment.<br/><br/>With this chapter they've really tried to draw in at-least a small number of males with their almost solely female audience by making it slightly more of an action / horror film. To do this they hired yet another impressive director David Slade (the man who brought us '30 DAYS OF NIGHT' and 'HARD CANDY'). He does manage to deliver some somewhat impressive thrilling and horrendous action scenes but they're few and far between. What he also does well is attempt to cut all the boring crap down; he only lets Pattinson speak as long as he needs to for plot development and edits camera shots of him to make his acting appear not quite as atrocious. There are a few good scenes between Stewart and the only other good actor in the series Billy Burke, playing her father, but then Slade also allows Taylor Lautner to yap for way too long which is a fatal mistake. The only actor that should be allowed to speak at any extended amount of time in this series is Kristen Stewart. Lautner managed to suck so badly that in this installment he made himself look like a worse actor than Pattinson! <br/><br/>The film tells of the continuing romance between Bella (Stewart) and the vampire 'like' creature known as Edward (played by Pattinson, and he's not really a vampire considering the fact that he can survive in the sunlight but the movies still shits on the vampire mythology by calling him one) and her struggle to fight off the sexual advances of her werewolf stalker buddy Jacob (played by Lautner). This time around there's a female blood sucking creature (now played by Bryce Dallas Howard) building an army of freshly born blood suckers in order to kill Bella and get revenge for the death of her brother (from film one). The only way this series could possibly come to a somewhat satisfying conclusion is if it's revealed that Bella is actually a more deadly and vicious creature than them all and is manipulating everyone to her will. That would be pretty cool.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at the drive-in which is probably the best way to see it considering it's really just a glorified 'B' monster movie and trashy 'B' romance. If you really respect film you have to acknowledge what's good about a movie even if parts of it are repulsive. A movie like this isn't all bad; you can't just say it's a zero star movie because parts of it are atrocious. The director and crew pretty effectively deliver exactly what it's core fan following wants to see. You can argue that that's contributing to the raping of their imagination though. I know the books were intended for ten to thirteen year old girls which it does make sense why they would like them but it doesn't make sense why anyone older than that would actually enjoy these movies and consider them well made in any way. I think the only reason grown women like these movies is because they think the two lead guys are hot which proves that women are generally more superficial than men. You don't see guys becoming obsessed with movies that some hot actress like Megan Fox is in just because she looks good in it and actually trick themselves into thinking they're well made movies. Women act like they're less superficial than they are and men act like they're more superficial than they are but things are actually reversed; women are a lot less likely to settle in the looks department than men on average, they're obsessed with appearance as these movies show.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8"

","I am a fan of the first Twilight film and the books, but this film let me down badly. They rushed through scenes that needed more explanation and lingered on parts that could have been done in one short scene. It darts from one scene to another in a very clunky way. This was the best book in the Twilight series, it was a really lovely story, very emotional and there was some suspense, the film doesn't illustrate this at all. I don't believe it will make the Twilight fans happy as it misses out too much and the people who haven;t read the books won't be happy because it doesn't cover what it should and leaves them confused. I was seriously looking forward to this film, I love Twilight, but I feel like I'm being scammed by the film makers, they clearly don't care, all they want is to make money! I honestly can't imagine what they will do with Breaking Dawn which is the weakest of all the books and they want to make it into two films.

","Things are simple with this movie. When I watched the first twilight I was like ""meh"", when I watched the second movie, New Moon, I was like ""this is one of the worst movie I have ever seen"" but after I watched ""Eclipse"" I was like ""at least it's not worse than Killers... I think the best twilight movie"". And yes it was. Eclipse is the best Twilight movie thanks to David Slade who managed to get the best of this, in my humble order, lame story.<br/><br/>The story in eclipse it's pretty much the same like in New Moon but now with a little bit more action and cool stuff. It was executed much better. If it was like an hour shorter maybe it would have been better since I almost fainted out while waiting for the obvious ending. The same bullsh*t occurred on the screen, the same love triangle, the same lines, the same weak development, the same bad acting, the same conflicts but not the same action scenes. Those action scenes saved the film for me along with the better cinematography. It was really well edited even if it was long and dull but still, it managed to at least entertain for couple of minutes even a guy like me which does not embrace the series.<br/><br/>Besides the better execution everything else lacked in sense of MAKING SENSE. The soundtrack was again boring. Everything about the story was predictable and the lines were so repetitive. I can't believe they wasted almost 7 total hours on a story that could have been told in like 2 hours and a half (at most). It's just too long and thinking that they are making another 2 movies preparing the grand finale gives me a big headache. I'm not trying to be a douchebag and bash the movie senseless but even if this is the best Twilight movie it's still a bad movie. Nothing great about it. The only good thing were the action sequences and I think this is the fourth time I'm saying it. I'm tired of Jacob showing he's abs, tired of Bella's confusion or Edward's pathetic reminiscent of love. Like the movie says, he is just too old-school.<br/><br/>Eclipse delivers at the end of the day, the best movie for the emo generation since they are pretty much the biggest fans of the series. Not stereotyping but ... Did I felt I wasted my money? No, because this is what I do: review movies. I'm a movie addict but still, for me, Twilight will remain the series that have no sense whatsoever. I'm sorry kids."
"Likes_Ninjas90","4","5","8","7 July 2010"," Gives us very few reasons to be excited for the fourth instalment Breaking Dawn
","In the small town of Forks a series of strange murders has sparked tensions. It becomes apparent that there is a plot to transform ordinary people into newborn vampires, who are unable to think for themselves. At the hands of this scheme is the vampire Victoria who is forging a small army so that she can destroy the Cullen family. The Cullen's seek to form an uneasy alliance with the werewolves, believing that they can only win the battle with their help. This means that Edward (Robert Pattinson) has to learn to work with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), even though they are caught in an awkward love triangle for Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her affection. Edward isn't willing to change Bella into a vampire until they get married and she is not willing to make this kind of commitment as her true feelings for Jacob remain unresolved.<br/><br/>The third film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's vampire novels gives us very few reasons to be excited for the fourth instalment Breaking Dawn. After the disastrous New Moon, director Chris Weitz has been replaced by David Slade who previously made the thriller Hard Candy. His efforts here as a director do not provide this sequel with the drastic leap in quality that some have spoken of. If anything this film is a step-down from the first instalment, which was filmed by Catherine Hardwicke on a modest budget and at least had a rich romantic atmosphere. Eclipse will mean little to those who have not read the books. This is because the story between each of the films has become increasingly banal. Much of the film is devoted to the love triangle but both the dialogue and the performances fail to spark any reason why we should care. Whereas in the first film characters like Bella and Edward were awkward in the uncertainty on each other, and rather ironically human, here the actors are left with schmaltzy and uninteresting conversations about how much they love each and how they are never going to give up. There are also several flashbacks, detailing the origins of the conflict between the werewolves and the vampires, just in case anyone was actually curious. The material is dreary and further compounded by the monotone performances of Stewart and Lautner. Pattinson has a slightly cooler, more charismatic presence here than the others at least. The boring scenes of dialogue and exposition are interspersed with more lively action scenes that are chaotically handled, with many of the vampires being smashed into pieces as though they are made from blocks of ice. Why this is happening and who is being attacked other than the trio are things that the film is not particularly interested in. These issues will mean little to fans of the books who have probably already seen the film on its opening day and are now preparing for Breaking Dawn. There will be one extra seat vacant for them."

The entire movie I found myself asking ""Why should we care about this tripod of a relationship between Bella, Jacob and Edward""......<br/><br/>IF YOU'D LIKE THE REST OF THE REVIEW, PLEASE CLICK BELOW FOR AN AWESOME REVIEW WEBSITE!!<br/><br/>http://thebodycount.com/2010/07/06/review-twilight-eclipse-2010/"
"Chris Knipp","6","14","30","30 June 2010"," Fire and ice -- but not much really happening
","The extremely successful romantic franchise mostly if not entirely for teenage girls has reached a midpoint, with this the third in the series and two more to come. How is it doing? Well, the strategy is good, this time: some violent, if blurred, battle scenes; some out and out sensual attraction -- and physical contact -- between Bella and her two boyfriends, the delicate vampire and fiery werewolf. They come face to face with each other and with the object of their affections, still with no thought of becoming sexual, following the series pattern, with Bella exchanging some warm kisses with both boys, nothing more. The movie begins with Bella and Edward (Kirsten Stweart and Robert Pattinson) in a dim but flowery meadow, making out, while Bella reads Robert Frost's poem ""Fire and Ice,"" whose proffered dual choice as to how the world will end reflects her oscillation between the chilly but sweet and pretty Edward Cullen, the vampire beau, and his rival, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a fiery werewolf, a hotblooded mammal.<br/><br/>""Some say the world will end in fire,/Some say in ice./From what I've tasted of desire/I hold with those who favor fire./But if it had to perish twice,/I think I know enough of hate/To say that for destruction ice/Is also great/And would suffice.""<br/><br/>(Bella's reading this is the one allusion to the fact that she actually has subjects to study in high school, including English.) Twilight: Eclipse does not rise to the disturbing apocalyptic level of Frost's poem, but it does hint at the radical dilemma Bella faces in choosing between the tow boys. Edward is her first love. But he offers no warmth. ""Face it, I'm much hotter than you,"" Jacob gets to say to Edward up on a mountain, when Bella is freezing in a tent and needs a cuddle to avoid hypothermia.<br/><br/>It may not really matter to devotes, but it's more obvious than ever that of the series principals, only Kiristen Steweart as Bella is much of an actor. Robert Pattinson as the romantic vampire seems only barely possessed of any kind of reality. As the Indian-werewolf clan boyfriend Taylor Lautner at least, as required, is lusty, angry, and alive and is speaking in his own accent, unlike the London-born Pattinson. Unfortunately Lautner has a whiny childish intonation unworthy of his torso, Bella, or being a semi-mythical creature. <br/><br/>Bella has bargained to marry Edward if they can consummate their love, after high school graduation, and she can join him in eternal vampire-hood, a fate he has always wanted to spare her, for reasons he has yet to reveal. Old fashioned Edward gives Bella a ring which was his mother's. But graduation still seems far away. She is increasingly tempted by Jacob, or at least he insists she is. But that remains up in the air. It's all about titillation.<br/><br/>In the background other stuff is necessary as temporary distraction from the fact that when this episode is over we're still pretty close to square one. Jacob and Edward and their respective clans team up to deal with an invasion of a sudden horde of vampire ""newborns"" who descend from elsewhere, attracted by Bella, for some reason. We learn that in their first few months of vampire-hood is when vampires are at their most powerful. These freshly-mined and dangerously violent blood-suckers clash with the Cullens and the werewolves in their wild four-legged form for some rapid-fire action. It's all so pumped up with CGI and loud music none of it makes sense, but young people are used to this kind of trickery and don't know what they're missing: it's like a video game, but one that's not interactive.<br/><br/>Apart from being better received critically than Twilight number two, number one one had a big advantage: the whole concept was new then, and the appearance of vampire siblings in a Pacific Northwest high school had a campy novelty about it. I liked the idea that the weather up there was so gray vampires would choose the region to live in, with the Cullens able to inhabit a woodsy modern villa with lots of windows. Edward wasn't even there for most of number two. Now he is back, and the rivalry between the two boy-men livens things up. Trouncing the rival outsider newborn vampires provides action that has little effect except for providing Edward and Jacob a chance to cooperate with each other. Bella talks to Edward, Bella talks to Jacob, and Jacob talks to Edward. All three have zeroed in on each other more than in number one and number two. But has anything changed? Nor really. All this may make more sense in the Stephenie Meyer novels -- but mus be pretty darn silly there too.<br/><br/>None of these Twilight movies makes much sense without filtering them through a teenage girl's viewpoint, according to which, evidently, boys are very attractive but also scary. It feels as though the larger action that takes place is just a metaphor for stuff outside Bella's real understanding, a world of danger and confusion, when her involvement with these two boys, with their opposite-pole natures, is danger and confusion enough. David Spade is good at keeping the action flowing; not much can make up for the shortcomings in the acting category. Striking closeups happen throughout of the wolf clan, the vampires, and Bella. Visually the vampires win out: the images seem sickly and twilight-dim nearly all the time. Natural light and shadow, the essential stuff of real and traditional photography, are not to be found. Maybe the next installment will be in 3-D (the way things are going) and it will all look even more unreal."
"Bunty-at-IMDB","5","8","15","3 July 2010"," It is a reoccurring problem...
","THE FIRST shot of the Eclipse movie is overwhelming. It is dark, violent and perfectly blending with Howard Shore's score. But just after that, the graph falls down, and near the end, your thoughts for the film are as same as other two Twilight films - Bland and boring.<br/><br/>New director David Slade tries too hard to improve the film. He does succeeds in some parts, but the disastrous script of the disaster book never improves. Maybe the screenwriter, Melissa Rosenberg is to be blamed as she is too faithful to the book. The story of the film is the same - Edward wants Bella not to turn into Vampire and constantly telling her cons of becoming a vampire, Jacob insisting Bella to choose him as he is much more human than Edward apart from showing his six packs and Bella, this time, being confused about choosing Edward or Jacob.<br/><br/>The film has prolonged dull and boring dialogs and most of the characters spend most of their time talking, wandering in the forests and kissing.<br/><br/>For sake of story, the film has a one, pretty much about Victoria and her new-born Army of Vampires, which hunt down Bella to avenge her boyfriend. The whole of army and Victoria appear near the end, and gets defeated within five minutes. Then again, talking continues until the final minute of the film.<br/><br/>The reoccurring problem in Twilight series is its weak storyline, and shallow and irritating characters. Bella is most irritating of them. Characters of Edward and Jacob are out of this earth - they fight over a girl who has nothing special.<br/><br/>Anyways, the only good thing about the film is its better pacing then New Moon. New Moon was unwatchable piece of crap, but this one finds better footing. It drags, but comparatively less than its predecessor. Another good thing was decent cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, who made this film watchable. Much anticipated score by Howard Shore was average, and no where near his top scores. I would also like to praise David Slade, who did a lot of hard work on the film, but you really can't do anything if you have the wrong script to work with. Acting has also somewhat improved, and Kirsten Stewart is now bearable. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are on the same level, anyways.<br/><br/>First Twilight film was below average, the second one was bad and the third is exactly the same - bad. It hardly takes the story ahead, and its all about the same thing - Bella willing to become Vampire, Edward doesn't wants Bella to change into Vampire, Jacob arguing with Edward for Bella and Bella telling both of them to stop fighting over her. Hopefully some one tells Summit to either stop, or write good scripts with a lots of changes from the book. Otherwise, the problem will persist for other two parts and the whole saga will be eclipsed forever."
"jkolkemo","10","12","25","1 July 2010"," Fabulous!!!!
","Best movie so far in the franchise. David Slade did an amazing job of keeping the love story alive while giving the gritty fight scene some substance. The tent scene was spot on perfect as well as the proposal, and just about everything else. The make up really stepped it up as well as the hairstyles. Rosalie finally looks like the beautiful babe we know from the books and the CGI hit it out of the ball park with the wolves. During the fight training it was crazy how real Jacob looks as a wolf when Bella is petting him. Twihards are in for a real treat. The only sad part of the movie was that it was over and we have to wait until Nov. 2011 for Breaking Dawn. At least we can keep watching Eclipse over and over again in the theater and video."
"mcs-995-841390","5","4","6","10 March 2011"," Good but not great
","First let me start out by saying I am not a tween, far from a teen and definitely not a Twi-mom but I am a fan, I guess. I read the books some time ago although I never had any interest in Twilight and even less ambition to read four books about sparkling Vampires that call themselves vegetarians although they in deed kill animalsand animals at that, which are close to extinction. But let me not get started on all of that. The story has been dissected by many successfully and yet everyone who had anything to do with the franchise laughs all the way to the bank. I have read quite a few negative reviews here which go on an on about how horrible the storyline is...there are pages and pages which list remarkable conclusions about how obsessive Edward is in some aspects and yet when Bella kisses Jacob, he can't even bring himself to be angry at the girl nor the wolf. It is true, some of it doesn't make any sense and yet no one stops to think that we are watching a film about Vampires and Werewolves living amongst humans in Washington of all places...oh and they attend high school over and over again for the past 100 years or so. None of it makes sense and none of it is real, so by what standards should we criticize here? I find it absolutely incredible that no one mentions how ridiculous it may be that in 'Alice in Wonderland' a girl is every size and then some...she meets talking rabbits and ends up in a teapot and on the rim of a hat right before she yet again towers over everyone and befriends the evil Queen. In the Wizard of Oz, no one said: ""she had to clip t her heels, and that's it?"" No one questions how Dorothy can be so neat looking after surviving a Tornado...must I go on? The story is the story...is the story! I read the books, all of them, twice, and I loved them. I truly admire Stephenie Mayer for her ability to tell a story; although I still have the feeling that not all the books were her sole creationwe will never know for sure ;) The movies however seem to get worse as they multiply, with the first being the best. I rate this in part on my ability to stay interested and focused while watching. I like the love story; the idea of never ending love that's dangerous and yet so appealing. My husband, who was dragged to the theater by me, liked Eclipse better than the other 2 movies. Surely this has something to do with the battle scenes and the fact that there were actually supposed bad Vampires. In his opinion Vampires are demons who live from blood, human blood, -period. And they are supposed to catch on fire or blow up in sunlight. They aren't supposed to have any concern for human lifeand surely not call upon a Werewolf for help. He also asked why Bella and Edward had to hang out in the meadow so much ""doesn't he have super human speed and could take her anywhere,"" he'd asked. But my husband didn't read the books nor would he ever want to. I honestly believe that too many changes have been made to each film, starting with the director and the crew. The hair alone is absolutely hideous and has anyone noticed how much Nikki Reed has changed? I am truly unsure if she had work done or if she just lost so very much weight that she now looks completely different. To rate the movie, I will give it a five, because it is worth watching; more so for the female of our species than the guys but I have seen much worse and because it is a part of a whole, I will watch the next two movies as well."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","4","6","20 February 2011"," The best of the series, but that isn't saying very much
","I don't hate the Twilight movies as much as others do, but I don't care for them either. The first was average, the second was pretty poor and the worst so far and while Eclipse is the best yet that isn't saying much. I haven't read the books the movies are based on, apart from a couple of pages of one which didn't spark my interest in reading the rest, but my sister has and likes the books and movies, though she says she likes the books more.<br/><br/>Eclipse does look good. I think the scenery in general is splendid and the cinematography and editing is much better too. The special effects are also an improvement, they don't feel as rushed here. The score is also very nice, courtesy of Howard Shore it is probably the best score in any of the Twilight movies. David Slade also does an above serviceable job directing, Eclipse is by far the best directed movie of the Twilight saga as of now.<br/><br/>However, Eclipse still has the same major problems as the first two did, but not quite as bad. The dialogue is still very clunky, Pattinson and his family have some pretty good lines but Stewart and Lautner's dialogue are quite awkward and in general the delivery is too. The story is more involving than in New Moon, which was not only sluggish but almost a non-event in terms of story, but there is the odd disjointed part particularly in the middle act and in the more ""romantic"" bits. Stewart and Pattinson have a decent chemistry, but Stewart still looks awkward with Lautner, while the action scenes felt rushed and the pace is still incredibly sluggish especially in the middle.<br/><br/>The acting is very mixed. Pattinson and his family I was fine with this time around, and Bryce Dallas Howard is a welcome addition to the cast as Victoria. Billy Burke while somewhat underused is decent as Charlie as well. Conversely, there are some weak links too. Taylor Lautner does little more than take his shirt off and say some clunky lines, while Kristen Stewart while better than she was in New Moon with a marginally more expressive face gives a rather lacklustre performance as Bella as she does have a whiny delivery here and there are still the awkward pauses between each line.<br/><br/>So overall, it has its strengths but also its weaknesses, but it is watchable and while it could have been a lot better with better scripting and pacing Eclipse is the best so far of the saga. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"bob-rutzel-1","5","4","6","7 December 2010"," It was okay
","Bella (Stewart) has a decision to make and things become complicated with the emergence of new Vampires who want to destroy the Cullens.<br/><br/>Well, here we are again. The last one in the Twilight Saga trilogy. Are we having fun yet? I suppose the answer to the question 'which way will Bella go' is uppermost on most inquiring minds. <br/><br/>So that was one plot, the other was the new Vampires and their plans to defeat the Cullens. <br/><br/>This was more like a soap opera (weren't they all?) and the only action this time we saw was the big battle in the open field between the New Vampires and the Cullens with help from the Wolves. The CGI was again terrific and the battle seemed very real. Hey, I cringed at times.<br/><br/>This was somewhat hard keeping up with the story line in the beginning because of the great length of time between this movie and the last one and I had forgotten what some of the other characters were involved with. But, no matter as I just concentrated on the Bella decision and I knew a battle would be waged between the New Vamps and the Cullens. That is all you really need to know.<br/><br/>There were some good lines in the beginning. Perhaps the best one was when in the Student Union the talk was about the upcoming graduation celebration. One girl said they should make it extremely good as ""how often do we graduate from High School?' The camera then pans to Edward, who has that wry knowing smile on his lips. And, the Valedictorian speech at the graduation ceremony was perhaps one of the best I have ever heard. Very good. Too long to recount here. <br/><br/>This was okay and we now have closure. But, I cannot help thinking that every time I will see Robert Pattinson in future movies I will still think of him as a Vampire and will keep waiting for him to show off those Vampire powers. A long wait, I know. I have to get over it. <br/><br/>As for Ms Stewart, I have seen her in other movies where she actually showed more than two facial expressions. I have to give her more credit in here than I have in the past. To do this one has to believe in Vampires and Werewolves. Her character believes so for her this is a very serious situation and there really isn't much to smile about when you have Vampires and Werewolves running loose. See? Maybe a part of the problem is that many in the audience don't understand her plight. See? Give her a break.<br/><br/>All in all, this was okay. We are done with this now, aren't we?<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"mrcibubur","6","4","6","31 July 2010"," Mildly entertaining Vampire Drama without Vampires
","This the third in the Twilight movie series I found strangely entertaining but it does not mean it is a good movie. It is ONLY a two hour movie (thank God!) but it was noticeable how many people made toilet trips 'during' the movie. It entertained me because I managed to stay awake for the whole two hours in expectation that something interesting would happen.<br/><br/>If I recall from the second movie New Moon, didn't Edward promise to marry Bella at the end of the movie? This latest movie wastes too much time exploring the delinquent emotions of a confused teenage girl called Bella who cant make up her mind whether she wants to spend her life with a vampire called Edward or a werewolf called Jacob, we cant blame her Father for wanting to protect her (he is a police officer after all) and for her Mother wanting to keep a distance (far away in Florida the story would have us believe).<br/><br/>The special effects of Jacob in particular as a werewolf is compelling if only for that but let us then remind ourself that this is not 'chronicles of narnia' or indeed 'incredible hulk' and I was particularly amused with the lack of clothing worn by all when they were all up at the top of a snow-capped mountain, gosh it must have been cold mustn't it? The Voltari offered the only real story to the movie and this was not exploited enough in the movie for an adult audience. An opportunity was missed. Clearly within the story there was 'a vampire outbreak' in Seattle and the Voltari were called upon to settle it - but of course the rivalry between the Vampires and the Werewolfs created a decision conflict with the Voltari which focused around Bella as a woman for revenge because Edward had killed the boyfriend of the 'red haired woman) in the first Twilight movie.<br/><br/>This was just a movie for teenagers to 'woon and swoon' and not more. I concur that the young lady playing Bella and the guy playing Jacob have limited acting ability. I disagree with the negativity about Robert Pattinson whom I feel gave a genuine acting performance. He has definitely improved and you should compare his performance here with that in the delightful 'Remember Me' where the triangle with a mysterious woman and a father who is law enforcement is relative.<br/><br/>Watch it at your peril! Mums and Dads, be prepared with your popcorn and soft drinks and don't miss the 'funny bits' like the snow scene which make this movie even remotely watchable as an adult. Kids, its 'comic entertainment' transferred to the big screen."
"L_Knight_91","4","4","6","9 July 2010"," Twilight Eclipse: in a nutshell
","Gruaduation is fast approaching with Bella's choice still hangs whether to choose between Edward or Jacob, this plot line extends throughout the whole movie with some action in between. seeing this movie made me wonder what's the use of this installment;you can see the hesitation in Bella,you can see the past of certain Cullen family members and i felt hollow after watching this movie. Despite all of it's hype this one stands out in disappointment the acting was a little bit iffy,the plot was slow to improve and the scriptwriting was not done that well. If i were a Twilight fan i might have liked this installment,but this one doesn't cut it i gave it a 4 just because it at least got the plot correct but the other things like acting,scriptwriting,editing...etc was lousy i hope they correct their mistake so we can enjoy the last part."
"Apemangalore","3","11","23","1 July 2010"," A third installment that's ultimately just more of the same
","While it's certainly been the popular thing to criticize the Twilight series, it's not without good reason. As much as I wanted to enjoy the first two installments, the constant intensity on the melodramatic meter, as well as the annoying-beyond-belief lead characters, make the films nothing more than a soap opera with just a higher production budget. But what about Eclipse , the third entry in the saga? Well, I enjoyed it a bit more than the first two <br/><br/>To start off with aspects of the film that I actually liked, the way that Eclipse is shot is done much more competently than in Twilight and New Moon . There are several particular images, in fact, that are still looming in my head. Also, the action sequences have a grander feel to them this time around, and – on the whole – end up being pretty fun to watch. This is due in part by the special effects, which I think are a significant step up from those found previously in the series. The wolves, especially, look much more convincing, despite the occasionally apparent green screen.<br/><br/>The film also pokes a little bit of fun at itself. It's as if director David Slade said ""Okay, there's no way that we can take some of these scenes seriously."" These types of moments don't occur all that often throughout the film, but the ones that are present go a long way.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate, then, that the rest of the film is just what you would come to expect from this series. Edward is still that controlling boyfriend who won't allow Bella to see her friends, Jacob is still that kid who, try as he might, will never exit the ""friend zone,"" and Bella herself is still that two-timing slut who doesn't know what she wants.<br/><br/>To be honest, though, there are characters in this series who I genuinely like – specifically, Bella's dad and Edward's family. They're each 100 times more likable and interesting than either of those three. The problem is, though, that neither of them are part of the main cast, and as a result, we're forced to sit through dialogue that's become so melodramatic to the point where I was laughing in my seat, as well as a love triangle that I don't find myself invested in in the slightest.<br/><br/>While the overall fun factor has been significantly enhanced this time around, I still can't find myself interested in this aforementioned love triangle that's been set up. It's amazing that, after two hours, it feels like so little happened in the way of this story. For those who are already fans of Twilight , I'm sure that they'll enjoy themselves. For the uninitiated, however, more of the same just isn't going to cut it."
"xor003","8","75","216","19 June 2010"," A fun movie to watch for the twilight series fans!!
","I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a series. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.<br/><br/>Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight Series fans. But if you see it in the theater, go during a time when all the little junior high and high school girls are in class; your eardrums will thank you for it. And I swear I lost ten IQ points just listening to them."
"jegharkroeller","7","14","32","30 June 2010"," Epic love
","As a huge fan of the books I have to admit that I've hated the movies. The first was really bad and the second was average. The acting wasn't really the best thing and the story was changed to much. Not to mention the bad make up. With this movie they've stepped up and followed the story while doing a great job acting wise and again the make up part. The combat effects was way over my expectations so I loved every minuet of it. I must admit I was entertained to the fullest and I highly recommend Eclipse. On the other side I would never recommend Twilight. To sum this movie up they finally got the point of this epic love story. There are many ways to love. It's not a stupid drama. It's true love."
"Thistle-3","8","14","32","30 June 2010"," Triangle Intensifies
","The Twilight movies are very divisive. They have a passionate following, and yet there are many Twihards who love the books and don't feel the films do them justice. So full disclosure, I haven't read the books. In fact, I tried to read the first one and found it awful. But, I loved the first movie. The second one was ""meh."" I was really looking forward to checking out The Twilight Saga: Eclipse to see if I wanted to continue following the story. Saw the movie, Monday night, and the answer is, I do. I sort of thought this film would pick up where the second one left off, (spoiler) with Bella answering Edward's proposal. It did not, but the question is still on the table. And, all the same threats to Bella are in play. But, this time, Edward is going to stick around, which is great, because I like to look at him. I like to listen to him speak. And, I love the easy way Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have of capturing that awkward, yet intense, devotion of new love. I'm not ashamed to say I got tear-y and swooned a little again, with Edward's old school romanticism. Jacob and his abs are back, of course. And, what I love about this installment in the Twilight Saga is that we learn the vampire origins of two of the Cullens. Billy Burke is still terrific as Charlie Swan. Ashley Greene is adorable as Alice Cullen. And, despite the freaky eyes, I have a growing attachment to Jackson Rathbone, given more to do here, as Jasper Hale. There are old threats and new threats and alliances made and broken, but the centerpiece of Eclipse is the intensifying triangle of Edward and Bella and Jacob. Whichever Team you're on, as long as you're playing along, I think you'll enjoy more Twilight saga. I give Eclipse an 8 out of 10."
"ritchiee1","3","6","11","6 July 2010"," Teenage Angst Gone Wild
","It is rare that I actually write a review, but this film warranted some sort of posting. This was, without exception, one of the WORST films I have ever seen. I knew there would be a flimsy plot, because I read the book(s). However, the acting in this film is what really made it painful to watch. Pattinson was decent, but unremarkable. A much older looking Stewart maintained her forever-pouting look throughout. Lautner was nice eye candy, but absolutely abysmal to watch in his attempt at acting. As for acting... thank God for the supporting cast. The best scene of the film -- and the one which earned it a ""3"" for my vote -- was the final fight scene. Some night slow motion shots were pulled off quite well. However, a five-minute scene can't save this film from being amazingly shallow and poorly acted throughout."
"Troy_Campbell","5","6","11","1 July 2010"," A slight improvement on New Moon.
","A slight improvement on New Moon, this third instalment still delivers exactly what you would expect. Shameless excuses for Taylor Lautner to have his shirt off, a plethora of chances for R-Pattz to pout and moan like the SNAV – Sensitive New Age Vampire – he is, substandard CGI that should be better and emotional (read: corny) dialogue that female tweens the world over will consider literary genius. Let's not even mention the dodgy wigs and worse make-up.<br/><br/>However, this sequel has an ace up its sleeve: humour. Eclipse has taken the intelligent step of realising that some of the proceedings need to be taken with a tongue-in-cheek approach – Edward's response of ""doesn't he own a t-shirt"" when a topless Jacob is waiting for them is priceless – and to keep on board those audience members that aren't going through puberty it must flex its funny muscles even more. To that extent, Billy Burke offers up plenty of amusement as Bella's concerned, but awkward father; his 'birds and the bees' chat is downright hilarious.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action for those who have been dragged along by their daughters, girlfriends and wives too. Although the computer effects are still fairly poor – which is strange considering the $65m budget – the training sequence partway through and the climactic battle at the end are both exciting and serve well as a reward for sitting through the less thrilling segments of the movie, namely whenever the love triangle rears its ugly head in the form of conversation.<br/><br/>Not having read the book I obviously can't make the comparison, but I get the impression something may have been lost between page and screen. There's essentially zero character or plot development when focussing on the romances of the main trio. What was established at the end of New Moon – Bella has feelings for Jacob but doesn't know what to do about them, Edward realises he couldn't continue his existence without Bella, Jacob seeks to persuade Bella that he can give her the life Edward never can – is what we leave this movie with thanks to half a dozen scenes between the three leads where the same story line is played out over and over again, a resolution never attained.<br/><br/>Nowhere near as good as Twihards would claim, but definitely not as bad as Twihaters would lead you to believe either.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"e-webb-669-130964","3","11","24","1 July 2010"," Please explain?
","What I do not understand about the Twilight furore is that, judging by billboards, the tabloids and 'Women's Magazines' would have us believe Pattinson and Stewert are an 'item', really 'in love', yet most critics comment that they have no on-screen chemistry and their acting together is unconvincing and 'hammy'. I've only seen 'Twilight', as an in-flight movie on the long-haul from HK to London, so not the best ambiance, and I found RP and KS totally unconvincing. RP seems genuinely to be a bad actor. 'Little Ashes' and 'Remember Me' both got terrible reviews. His acting was described as 'wooden'. He was OK as Cedric in HP4, but then it's a tiny part and he really only had to look good and be 'nice'. I've not seen KS in anything else, so cant judge her ability, but she seems to be equally wooden and limited. So, my question is: Can either RP or KS really act and what is all the fuss about? The story is some of the worst tripe I've ever struggled through - only because my students think the books are good and I needed to disillusion them."
"zombiegrl75","8","12","27","30 June 2010"," Great movie if you are a big fan of the books!
","Okay, I am 35 and a huge fan of the books. I agree the acting still isn't the greatest but for anyone wanting the movies to mirror the books, like myself, this was a great film. Kristen Stewart has always bothered me but I think she is getting better and becoming a more believable Bella, especially when she explains to Edward why she really wants to become a vampire. I think the wolves look as real as you can get, and I am a big sci-fi fan, too. From what I have read so far the haters of this movie don't know the deeper story line as they have not read the books. I was really happy how the tent scene and the scene in which Edward buys a bed for Bella's sake both turned out - pretty much as I pictured them. The army of vampires plot and the Volturi visit were a bit skimped on, but this cannot be a 4 hour movie. I went with three younger women and they all loved the movie, too. If you are into the books, you won't be disappointed."

","With Twilight, they played it safe; with New Moon, they stepped it up a notch; with Eclipse, OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!! I have to give props to three people: #1: The author – Stephanie Meyer – your books are so mesmerizing and not romantically challenged; #2: The screenwriter – Melissa Rosenberg – you stuck to the book, you added what you needed, you poured your blood, sweat and tears into the script; #3: The director – David Slade – DUDE YOU ROCK!!!!! This movie defines everything what Stephanie wrote in her 3rd book. I could not be a happy Twihard – this movie met every expectation that I had for the book and the movie. Again – Rob, Taylor, Kristen - OMG you define the epitome of acting. But the acting props has to go to Bryce Dallas Howard – Rachelle was good but you were beyond good. This movie was excellent I can not wait to see what is coming in Breaking Dawn."
"MovieManMenzel","7","14","33","30 June 2010"," "" The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" aka the battle of Edward and Jacob for Bella's love.
","""Eclipse"" picks up right where ""New Moon"" left off. Edward and Bella are hopelessly in love with one another and talks about their marriage begins. In the mix of all this happiness, there is a huge battle brewing between the newborn army lead by the evil Victoria and the Cullen family. On top of all this the love triangle between Edward and Jacob continue as Jacob is still determined to win Bella's heart. Lots of suspense, romance and even some action pursue.<br/><br/>While there are a lot of things going on in this film, the battle for Bella's heart was the primary focus. Robert Pattinson's Edward really becomes passionate about his love for Bella in this film. The relationship becomes truly believable here. Taylor Lautner's Jacob frustration with trying to win Bella's heart is equally believable here. I actually feel bad for him and that's pretty odd. I really liked how in ""Eclipse"" that Edward and Jacob have become comedic with one another. The humor between these characters really worked in the film. Kristen Stewart seems to be fitting into her Bella shoes nicely and you can tell her character is maturing and growing as the series goes on. I really liked how in this film Rosalie's and Jasper's back stories were fleshed out especially Rosalie's, which I felt gave her character more depth. I can't really complain about the acting or the character development in the film because I think they did a good job with it.<br/><br/>David Slade was definitely the best director for the franchise so to speak. Like many other critics have already stated Slade really made this film feel like a blockbuster rather than an independent film. I think his unique work behind the camera really worked for this franchise. When I watched Slade's ""Hard Candy"" a few weeks back I said to myself he is going to be a great director for ""Twilight"" and I am glad that opinion became fact. The film's direction is probably the highlight of the film and the way Slade got the characters to play off one another. I also liked the subtle humor that Slade added to the franchise something that made the other films feel more stiff and this one a little more relaxed. Great job Mr. Slade.<br/><br/>Now as for my complaints: The first is the build up. The build up for the ""battle"" made me very angry with the film. From about 15 minutes into the film, there is this talk about this battle of the newborns lead by Victoria. Throughout the entire film this point keeps being brought up, when the moment finally arrives the result is just disappointing. Without giving anything away, this battle that is being built up from the first 15 minutes requires both the Cullen's and the werewolves to work as a team. This pretty much serves as the subplot of the film and the epic battle lasts at most 10 minutes. This is without a doubt the biggest disappointment in ""Eclipse."" Your waiting and waiting for this excitement and it feels like a slap in the face when it happens. Now I can't say that this is the first film to do this in recent years because ""Alice in Wonderland"" as well as ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" both have done similar things. They build up what is suppose to be an epic battle and instead its this lame ass scene that feels like it's 2 minutes long. <br/><br/>As for the second and third complaint well those go hand in hand. I know this is a teen vampire flick but are the numerous make out sessions necessary? I mean we get the point they love each other so we don't really need one every 15 minutes to reinforce it. Also and this isn't the film's fault but Stephanie Meyer's fault, this series needs some sex. The sexual tension in this film you can cut with a knife it's so thick. I know its trying not to focus on sex but love but if any film needed some sex ""Twilight"" does. I find it funny because ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight"" are very similar as far as story lines go but with one main difference. ""True Blood"" focuses too much on the sexual aspect, which of course makes it more appealing to the male audience, and ""Twilight"" has no focus on it at all. Learn a lesson here make a film or television series that uses both these ideas and equally balance them. I never thought I would ask for a film to contain some sex but man it definitely needs it.<br/><br/>In the end does ""Eclipse"" live up to all the hype? From my perspective it does not but apparently from die-hard ""Twi-hards"" it does. I felt that the film was a good entry in the ""Twilight Saga"" however this franchise from a film lovers perspective does not offer anything ground breaking. The ""Twilight"" films are truly a guilt pleasure for those who like them. I appreciate them for what they are a unique fluffy vampire/werewolf tale from a female perspective. The big thing that makes me favor ""New Moon"" over ""Eclipse"" was the build up for the epic battle that just fell flat. If that was better executed I would say this would have been the best film in the franchise but because that was disappointing I would say ""Eclipse"" is still behind ""New Moon."" For those who loved the book, ""Eclipse"" is the most loyal to the book. David Slade is definitely the best director yet for the franchise and the film overall finishes up nicely. The film itself is a lot darker and definitely more violent than the previous entries. Overall, its a good film that keeps the true fans wanting more, but offers just more of the same for the everyday movie goer.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is a 7 out of 10."
"davidscarvalho","1","21","54","30 June 2010"," Horrible and the worst of them all.
","Im not a hater, I already had read the book in the past and even that I was never a fan of this story I am a fan of cinema and this movies are pure crap. <br/><br/>There's nothing Summit can do, the story itself its just ridiculous the dialogues are meaningless and boring and the acting is awful. <br/><br/>Technically in effects and all that, the movie isn't bad but the story and acting make everything worst in it. And that battle just was too much its like a desperate attempt of trying to do the movie interesting. <br/><br/>Having said that, New Moon is better than this movie and believe me that wasn't good at all. <br/><br/>Summit should stop this madness they are only going to split the next movie in two parts to get more money and imitate an other franchise. <br/><br/>It's worthless."
"rasa06","5","10","22","30 June 2010"," Loved the book... movie not so much
","I devour Twilight books and had to go to the midnight feature opening night of Eclipse. I was so disappointed by this movie. I wanted to love it, but can't even say that I liked it. It just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>The magic of Twilight was missing, as was the suspense and angst of New Moon. Gone were the lingering glances between Bella and Edward. The music that was practically a character in previous movies was absent. Eclipse relied far too much on dialog to tell the story, which with these books, is just not strong enough to completely carry a movie. It's the love story itself that draws us in, not Meyer's actual writing.<br/><br/>The movie itself was bright and clear, which I didn't like; my husband, however, did enjoy this movie better than the others in the saga, with the caveat, ""if it didn't have all that talking."" This is not saying very much; he didn't really like the other movies. He always commented everything was blue in Twilight or in a fog in New Moon. Eclipse was extremely action heavy, which could be why he enjoyed this movie more than the others. <br/><br/>To me, without the hazy dream-like setting, it was obviously fake. The wolves were cartoony looking and my vampires, oh, my beautiful vampires... their haircuts were horrid. I couldn't fall into this story, as I have in the past. Whatever the vision was that they were trying to create, it was a failure. The powdered skin was obvious and distracting. I wasn't left with a magical feeling. <br/><br/>Eclipse was not without high points, however... Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) was a completely different actor...thank you, thank you, thank you! He was smooth and believable in Eclipse, much improvement over his painful-to-watch performances in the previous movies. Jackson's performance was the highlight of this movie. Ashley Green's(Alice) performance was also spot on. She was light and airy, just as I expect of Alice. Jodelle Ferland, who played the fledgling Bree, was amazing in the few minutes that she was on screen. If I purchase this movie, it will be to re-watch these performances again.<br/><br/>The movie has humor and works the comedic timing. That part was well done for me, but remember that I do love the books. As a whole, I felt like I sat through a high school production. If you are in love with the saga, you are going to see this movie no matter what anyone else says. If you aren't a huge Twilight fan, don't waste your time or money. <br/><br/>I so hope they take their time to create a solid movie and go in a different completely different direction with Breaking Dawn. I would be greatly disappointed if that movie turns out like this one."
"mad_mandonna","3","7","14","5 July 2010"," An overly serious and underwhelming installment
","I have to admit that I really did not enjoy the simplistic and shallow narrative of the first twilight book, however I quite enjoyed the first film, I was impressed with direction of the original director. Though I still find the story fairly childish and naive as a form of light entertainment I would 100% recommend the first film. <br/><br/>Moving on to New Moon, which I must admit I have not read, but I watched the film as I wished to see where the film would go after being impressed with the first film. I was unfortunately very disappointed. The direction was uninspired, safe and ugly compared to the original. The special effects were also fairly substandard for such a money making franchise such as this. The story was over dramatic and humourless, and the character of Bella is unrelatable and pathetic. <br/><br/>When Eclipse reared it's ugly head I was excited by the director and the prospect of a far more action orientated installment. But I was once again let down by a film that is much the same as New Moon, stilted and lacklustre action sequences, poor computer generated imagary and Bella once again unrelatable and humourless. The two leading gentleman look good but give stiff performances. One thing in Eclipse's favour is the way it's shot. The scenery is stunning and is shown off in subtle and yet grandeur way, so kudos to the director for this but it really is not enough to lift this film from the badly melodramatic and pretty anti-feminist story. <br/><br/>I will complete the series too see how it all pans out, but I'm praying that things improve. The producers should get Joss Whedon to come and help them out."
"annakatherine6","8","11","25","30 June 2010"," If you liked the book...you will love the movie
","I went to see Eclipse last night at midnight and I was completely and utterly impressed. The acting was much better than the first two movies and the chemistry on screen between Bella/Edward and Bella/Jacob was much better. The action probably wasn't long enough but still was exciting and not a disappointment. I left feeling satisfied and said ""They finally did it right."" Now i feel like i have to get on a soap box. For those who trash the movie, call it predictable and say it's cheesy...probably haven't read the books. At the end Bella will pick Edward, and if you had read the book that wasn't a surprise. A lot of the dialog was from the book and that was something I was glad finally happened. I think that had a lot to do with me liking Eclipse more than New Moon and Twilight. Basically you love it or you hate it. and if you liked the first two, this one will impress you."

","OK after watching the first 2 twilights, although not brilliant but worth watching i thought may asell watch the 3rd one in the pipeline and I've gotta say really disappointed.<br/><br/>In these movies i really like the character edward cullen but in this sequel i cant help but feel sorry for him, i mean come on in the 1st twilight bella claims too be totally in love with edward then in new moon spends all her time with jacob and managing too hold herself for edward then in number 3 after going through all the torture of edward leaving her an eventually coming back she starts then falling inlove with jacob its like 1 minute shes with edward and then for the next 10 minutes shes with jacob what the hell if i was edward i kick this chick too the curb and fro her too the wolves as it were.<br/><br/>but the most disappointing line in this film was by bella when she kisses jacob then says too edward you saw, edward replies you love him, then the cheesy bit comes from bella, but i love you more mmmmmm is that school girl stuff or what bella managed to disappoint me at this stage.<br/><br/>That aside the most interesting part about this film is the last 10 minutes although not great at that.<br/><br/>This 3rd part really ruined the journey off twilight for me but then again im not in too love triangles"
"Priskitteh","5","5","9","10 July 2010"," Well, it's getting worse and worse.
","I can't believe with all the money they are making they keep on choosing bad productions for these movies. Eclipse is worse than New Moon in acting, soundtrack, special effects AND plot! (I didn't think it was gonna be possible, but I actually changed my opinion on New Moon and now I find it MUCH too good compared to this). The movie isn't awful, but it's totally emotionless and saves nothing of the Twilight atmosphere and the characters' personality. The only good scenes are DIRECTLY QUOTED from the book, so it's not even the director doing a good job. The book is my favorite of the saga, thus the movie was a huge disappointment. The plot is fractioned, there are these beautiful scenes from the book, but they aren't connected between each other. All that happens in-between is insignificant or just emptied of its emotional tension or value. The characters' personality is totally bent to fit in the plot less movie, Edward even appears as a villain in some scenes while in the book it's the absolute opposite. He's noble and always thinking of what's best for her, not a tyrant that tries to have it all and make it bad for Jacob. Once again this movie is UNWATCHABLE for one who hasn't read the book. I find the actors great, but the director wasn't even able to direct their performance to be as good as it can get. The only scenes that deserve to be watched are those with actual EMOTIONS in them, like in the tent, in the bedroom and in the meadow. The reason I give 5 to this movie is because it's not really BAD. Nothing is really awful in it. It's just NOT good. Plain and dull at times! What I appreciated was the humor that was finally let in, which didn't happen in the previous movies. In the books of the saga there are multiple jokes but only this time they seem to play a decent role, finally! The acting was inferior than the previous but still I find the cast brilliant, so I can't say it's a bad product overall. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner are simply perfect. But for them, we have to thank the first director, certainly not this one!<br/><br/>I would recommend this only to people who love the books and aren't expecting too much, to all other people, save money and get yourself the books if you really want to give them a shot."
"valoupee","5","5","9","10 July 2010"," Disappointing
","3 bad points: <br/><br/>(1) there are too much details left behind. I expected there would be more specific scenes (especially Edward-Bella-Jacob scenes). unfortunately, they didn't make it as good as the novel. <br/><br/>(2) their acting ain't good at all. it's too bad, they didn't FEEL it (is it possible to re-make the eclipse before releasing breaking dawn???).<br/><br/>(3) Edward is more fat. can a vampire get more fat? aren't they frozen? but I like Jasper, he looks stronger.<br/><br/>I think the novel is much better than the movie, but I love it anyway. the first and the second twilight saga movies are better. hope the next movies (breaking dawn part 1 & 2) are gonna be much better."
"kimdance114","10","22","58","30 June 2010"," AMAZINGG must see
","I'm a die hard twilight fan i have read all 4 books threw 10 time and have spent hundreds on merch. even with the differences between the movie and the book i really like it! the whole story line was there which is the important part though they changed a lot of minor details from the book. i actually thought the acting was much better in this movie then the other 2 films. Robs acting was just as good as usual and i actually feel like Kristens acting actually improved in this movie! Billy burke(charlie) acting in the movie was soooo good. He depict the character perfectly and actually added to the character with his facial expressing!! Hes probably one of my fav actors in the whole movie he was perfect. I was wondering how they were going to manage that ""vampire made of marble"" thing too, and that seemed pretty realistic! The wolves were actually done really well to! so i think overall the special effects were done really well! Director David Slade has added an edge to the film that i think was missing before. It is much more exciting and alittle darker. The movie has an essential good-heartedness that makes it likable. It is funny, has some good fist fights with the great Edward Cullen and is a fun film. It was Hands down the best movie of the Three! So Over all i really enjoyed this movie and i would most definitely recommend this movie!!!"
"Leahrt","7","12","28","30 June 2010"," Credits to the director, for saving this movie
","According to me, all credits should go to David Slade, cause he did a wonderful job with this movie. First of all I would like to say; I don't like Twilight, I used to like the books. I don't like Robert Pattinson or Kristen Stewart. In fact I hate the whole ""I-love-Edward-cullen-twilight-is-the-best!"" But this movie impressed me. And as much as I would like to say: This movie sucked, then I can't, cause it weren't that bad - and that was because I was opened-minded. Today I think there is a lot of Twilight-haters, believe me, I wish I could be one of them, but I can't, and that's why I'm going to defend Eclipse. Many people was really disappointed with Twilight and New Moon, and as a criticizer you then doom the twilight saga (movies) as bullshit, especially because of the bad acting, bad directing and bad screenplay. And then when you go to the cinema to see Eclipse, and all you can think is: This is going to suck? That's when I ask; why are you here then<br/><br/>Of course it could be a job that you had to do or that kind of thing. But already you say to yourself this is going to be a bad movie, like you expect it through the whole damn movie, and when you fear and expect it so much, I think it actually becomes a bad movie. - Okay sorry for my language, but I have to say this. And then I think that there are also just some people out there who really can't stand twilight, you just hate it, no matter if the movie is great or either. They just review 1-3 stars, cause that's the power they have to rate. They hate everything about this up-blown thing, that no matter what; they will hate twilight, and no matter what it deserve a bad rating. - Which is bullshit. Even if I can't stand Kristen Stewart or I hate Robert Pattinson, then it gives me no right to rate this movie a bad grade because of a personal hate to a celebrity or that kind of stuff. Seriously, then you actually becomes worse the all of the hormone disrupting girls who actually likes Robert Pattinson!<br/><br/>The movie starts out with: Riley being transformed into a vampire, which is a really good scene, and it's very obvious that we have a horror-movie-director behind the screen. Xaiver Samuel does a wonderful job in this movie; he was actually one of the only actors who impressed me with really good acting. As much as I hate it when they change actors or actresses, then it didn't really upset me that Bryce Dallas Howard had replaced Rachelle Lefevre in the role of Victoria. Bryce did a wonderful job, even though it would have been nice to see Rachelle in the last movie with Victoria. Back to Bella and Edward I was so relieved that they could actually ""make out"" without any hard breathing, moaning, sighs or any kind of annoying breathing trouble. I hated the Twilight and New Moon for having so many breathings. It was annoying to see them kiss while they moaned so much. The triangle- thing also saved this movie. First time when Jacob kisses her and sort of breaks Bella's hand, it's awesome when Edward jumps out of the car and just go crazy on Jacob: ""If you ever lay a hand on her!"". It's sort of awesome. The Movie is basically about the choice between Edward and Jacob, or that's what we think, but according to Bella it's a choice between who she should be and who she should not be, which I personally liked, since it then weren't all about a wolf and a vampire. Then the movie starts to be about the New Born-Army, we find out that someone is creating an army to attack Forks, because of Bella. That's when I hesitate. Okay, so what if Edward killed James in Twilight - Victoria get over it! All this trouble for just killing Bella. Seriously! But I guess Victoria is deeply revengeful. The movie becomes better and better, cause what I feared the movie would skip happened. Bella learned about Rosalie's story, and why she thinks that Bella should not become a vampire. Rosalie's story is sad, and I wished the movie would have shown more than three backflash-scenes with Rosalie's story. And we also get to learn Jasper's story, which is awesome, not how I imagined, but it was great. And we also got to see backflashes from the Quileute's story, which I actually found boring in the book, but pretty exciting in the movie. Throughout the movie we see several scenes with Riley and his New Born Army that Victoria is really creating. We also get introduced to Bree Tanner. The fight between Vampires, Wolves and New Born finally begins in Forks, and it actually worked out great. There were no slow-motions- scenes which I loved, I hated New Moon for making the fight-scenes in slow-motion, it seemed so unreal. The Cullens and The wolf pack fights against the New borns, while Bella, Edward and Jacob are up in the mountains in a tent. And the last 40 minutes, a lot of things happen. Bella reveals her feelings for Jacob, they share a kiss, sine Jacob threatens to kill himself. Victoria and Riley come to kill Bella and Edward. And of course Riley ends up getting killed by Seth a wolf and Edward kills Victoria. Then The volturi of course come, and Dakota Fanning is really good as Jane, she's silent in a very sadistic way. The movie ends with Bella choosing Edward, which was pretty predictable, and they end up engaged, ready to get married. <br/><br/>xxoo's"
"AngieeeBabayy","5","8","17","30 June 2010"," Was very disappointed with this one.... (coming from a Twilight fan)
","Everything just was so rushed. After the last two (which I happened to really like), I felt this one just was not cared enough about and thrown together. I'm so disappointed with this one and wish that this was more thought out. I'd rather have Eclipse coming out in November like the last two- but better instead of a early Eclipse movie with rushed scenes and a cheesy beginning.<br/><br/>It felt like New Moon set a bar for Eclipse that Eclipse (in the end) didn't reach. I wish I really liked this movie more, but I am having a hard time finding the good in this movie. It felt like Summit and David Slade didn't put enough care into this movie at all. New Moon was so much better, even with it's depressing mood. It felt like some of the Cullens- like Alice, Carlisle, and Esme hardly had any character development in this movie and the wolfpack/Jacobs side was hardly shown after it's in-depth tell-all in New Moon. Everything was just too too rushed.<br/><br/>On the upside I thought the proposal scene, leg hitch scene, and the Cullen/Werewolf/Jasper training scene was well done. Robert Pattinson delivered a few lines a little wooden, but overall he and Taylor Lautner really delivered their lines and characters well. Kristen Stewert didn't do very well at all when it came to her acting and character. She did better in New Moon, however she delivered confusion between the two men very well.<br/><br/>All in all, I rate this a 6. It was a little better than average, but not as moving as New Moon and not as romantic as Twilight."
"nathanceulemans","8","9","20","1 July 2010"," I quite enjoyed this, contrary to expectations.
","Don't get me wrong, I'm normally not even remotely interested in the Twilight series (I only saw the first two movies following the urging of peers), but the newest installment was great.<br/><br/>First off, the first two films were grossly overrated; filled with teenage angst and far too much serious, dreadfully boring romantic drama. As a guy, it was hard to appreciate the movies at all; even despite the attempt at drawing in a little more gratuitous violence in the second movie (which fell flat on its face because it was largely unconvincing and felt unnaturally forced).<br/><br/>Now, with the introduction of Slade as the director, we see the introduction of a little humor to the storyline (""Doesn't he have a shirt?"" ""Let's face it, I am hotter than you.""), convincingly awesome action scenes, and far more interesting plot development on the Bella-Edward-Jacob love triangle.<br/><br/>Literally, things happened in this movie! I was honestly surprised by how much fun Eclipse was, and my friends, both male and female, are all in agreement; I could easily recommend it to guys and gals alike."
"browh23","9","10","23","1 July 2010"," best out of the three movies
","The connection between the three main characters love story/triangle was there. The action was there between vampires and werewolves. The movie stayed true to the book and it added more in depth visualization. It flowed with the other movies reaching a climax. I am a huge twilight fan, I read all the books and saw all of the movies. New characters were introduced very well. The CGI was good. The sound effects of the vampire/werewolf fighting was excellent. I would recommend this movie to all the twilight fans out there! If you don't like twilight don't right a review and don't go see. I LOVED THIS MOVIE and can not wait to see it again!"

","I am a huge Twilight fan. I read all 4 of the books and have both, Twilight and New Moon on DVD. I went to the midnight showing of Eclipse in my town and I absolutely loved it! I think it is the best one so far. I enjoyed everything about it. I thought Eclipse was the best book, and I was excited to see that the movie also is the best (so far). I am very excited to see Eclipse many more times and for the DVD to come out for me to own. I think that the cast has incredible acting skills. Some seem to think that Kristen Stewart is the worst actress of all time because of this movie. But I STRONGLY disagree. Most of the people that think that, have not read the books and have not taken the time to understand Bella and Edward's relationship. I feel that Kristen and Robert portray the awkwardness of the characters relationship wonderfully. They seem to show the chemistry of the love they share, but also the awkwardness of the vampire-human relationship, and even the thirst and pain that Edward feels every time he kisses Bella. I think that everyone involved in Eclipse did an awesome job at making it action packed and interesting. Great Job! :)"
"amandawilcox","8","12","29","30 June 2010"," Cheesy but won't disappoint die hard fans
","I believe that Eclipse definitely lived up to the book. It explored (as much as it could) the choice that Bella has to make between Edward and Jacob. However I think the movie is really lacking the anger that Edward feels towards Bella for wanting to see Jacob. While I understand that you can't put everything from a book into a movie, they should have showed the controlling side of Edward more. In the book he tries very hard to make sure that Bella doesn't see Jacob because he doesn't trust him.<br/><br/>In the movie this wasn't explored as explicitly. There definitely is a cheese factor in this movie as well. It's very lovey-dovey. But that's what the book was all about. Also I think the movie is lacking Bella's ignorance. In the book she had no clue about anything, while in the movie it seemed that she was figuring thing out without help from everyone else.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. I'm am a hard core fan of the books. I just think that there could have been more character development. I know that people are going to make fun of the acting and the way the movie was made. But honestly people this isn't a movie for people that are just discovering the Twilight series, if you aren't a hard core fan you aren't going to like it. I believe that it won't disappoint those who loved the books. It lives up to the book (as much as it could.) I really wish that people that don't like it would stop commenting on this series. It's obvious that you just want to come on here and rip it a new one. Save your time...us fans get enough crap just saying we like it. We get what you're saying, trust me."
"Nick_V37","4","6","12","5 July 2010"," Make up your mind if you want an action or a romance movie
","While plot unfolds and the producers are ""building"" a saga, inherent weaknesses make the third film the worst of all. I can't help to notice that Twilight's director was by far the best for this kind of film. Even the photos are telling the truth; check out which of them are most attractive to the eye. Rough scenes, poor acting (didn't you notice how awkward felt the actors?) less than elemental action and irrelevant music was what I got. A pity, for I did expected something better. Not all of us are expecting endless kisses and constant close ups on the stars' faces, you know. A waste of budget and of a good plot, for Twilight Saga has its own fan- club worldwide. Yes, it surely is a love story. It surely isn't ""Interview with the vampire"". But it has a strong element of action (see the Volturi entering the plot) which shouldn't be left unexploited. Sinserely, I hope that the 4th movie will treat these inherent flaws."
"freemantle_uk","6","4","7","9 April 2011"," A girl's eternal choice between necrophilia and bestiality
","We all know of the battle on the internet between Twihard and Twihaters, both be very vocal opinions and giving the films artificially high and low scores. This is clear when you look at the voting breakdown on the IMDb scores for all three Twilight films so far and since Twihaters are much more likely to use IMDb they have made the scores low. I am a neutral to Twilight so my review for Eclipse will be honest.<br/><br/>Eclipse starts off with a more darker opening, with a young man, Riley Biers (Xavier Samuel) getting attacked by a vampire outside a Seattle bar on a cold rainy night. The film then goes to Forks to see Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) as they prepare for their graduation, but importantly for the date Bella will have to be turned into a vampire. Bella has to say to goodbye to everyone she knows, without them even knowing she is going. But matters are made more complex because of the feud between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) because of Jacob's love for Bella, the feud between the Cullen vampires and the Quileute werewolves and more important, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her army of new born vampires wanting to kill Bella.<br/><br/>The coup for the Twilight franchise was getting David Slade to direct Eclipse. I personally think Slade is not the great new hope some critics making him out to be but he does have a reputation after making Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night. Still he does have a darker edge then Chris Weitz who directed New Moon and he is more confidence with action compared to Catherine Hardwicke. There were interesting moments like the flashbacks showing the origins of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone). In the film it shows that Rosalie was properly gang raped and when she was turned into a vampire she got her bloody revenge (though it cuts away before you got to see the juicy violence). Rosalie is also interesting because she hates being a vampire and tells Bella what her dreams were before she was turned. The action is also the best in the series having a big battle between the Cullen and werewolves against the new born vampires. Many vampires deaths are actually shown this time round. I just wish that the action scenes were longer. The CGI for the wolves is better then it was in New Moon and they did have more of a wolf like look when in New Moon they looked more like huskies.<br/><br/>A problem of the series has been the acting. Stewart is a little stiff but she is not terrible, she is not the whiny then she was in New Moon. Pattinson is decent and he is best of the trio of stars, adding some dramatic weight and I personally believe he will be successful after Twilight. He is at least trying to make more independent projects like Water and Elephants. On the other hand Lautner is a terrible actor, unable to show real emotion and I am sure he was cast because of his body and that he looks a little Native American. Its even joked in the film on whether he has a top on. His performance and character felt forced and he relationships with the characters was empty. Most of the younger members of the tribe looked like they were cast because of their looks. Some of the supporting cast were better, like Reed and Anna Kendrick but they are not given enough screen time.<br/><br/>A problem that I have with all the Twilight films is that they come up with interesting ideas but does not explore them enough. This time round it was the formation of a vampire army: I would have liked to have seen how that was done, how people were targeted, turned and fed a diet of ideas to make them loyal. I wanted to see the violence and chaos they caused in Seattle and more of the public and media panic. I liked the idea that newborn vampires are more powerful but are particularly wild animals with no control. I have not read the books, so I can only judge Eclipse as a film but I do know that the character Bree Tanner (Jodelle Ferland) is teenager who was turned into a vampire was expanded on. I would liked to seen the story through her eyes and how she hates what she has become. But she is barely in the film.<br/><br/>There are some interesting ideas in the film. The main one is Bella who is willing to sacrifice her innocents, life and chance to gain experiences for love, particularly because Bella is only 18 and she if she goes through with the change it would be a mistake she can never rectify. I know that focus was always going to be on Bella and Edward, but some scenes involving those two and Bella's home and social situation could have been shorten and the action/adventure element been heighten up.<br/><br/>On a technically the music score is the best so far. That is thanks to Howard Shore, a great composer who is best know for his work on Lord of the Rings. His music was fitting to the situation, whether it is an important fight or a more personal scene and Slade and Shore rely least on outside music. Javier Aguirresarobe is also a very good cinematography, having worked on New Moon and The Road and he is able to craft some really nice shots of the mountains in the background and foreground, the sunny environment of Bella's mum's home and the field of bluebells.<br/><br/>Eclipse is the best of the Twilight films so far."
"jboothmillard","5","4","7","18 February 2011"," The Twilight Saga: Eclipse
","From Razzie nominated director David Slade (Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night), this third instalment in the highly talked about movie franchise based on the popular books was considered the best by the critics, and seeing the other two naturally I curious. Basically the story has again picked up where it left off, in the town of Forks, Seattle, Isabella 'Bella' Swan (Razzie nominated Kristen Stewart) has been reunited with vampire true love Edward Cullen (Razzie nominated Robert Pattinson), not long after having a romance with werewolf Jacob Black (Razzie nominated Taylor Lautner). She wants to become immortal to be with Edward forever, and he agrees to change her as long as they get married, but she is still surrounded by danger with the threat from other vampires not in the Cullen clan. But the newest dilemma comes from The Newborn Army of vampires, created by the vengeful Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard), who had her friend killed by Edward, but this army is going against not just the Cullens, but the werewolf clan too. Therefore, an unlikely and at first shaky alliance is made between the vampires and werewolves to go against The Newborn Army, and obviously Edward and Jacob try to put their differences aside for the sake of Bella and her protection. The rest of the film sees Edward and Jacob fighting for Bella's affections, for which she is standing by her vampire love, and of course the battle between the new form of vampires army. Also starring Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, Dakota Fanning as Jane, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen, Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale, Razzie winning Jackson Rathbone as Jasper, Kellan Lutz as Emmett Cullen, Elizabeth Reaser as Esme Cullen, Cameron Bright as Alec and Case 39's Jodelle Ferland as Bree. As with the other two films before, the acting and scripting is average, the action scenes are alright, but it is the special affects that are the most impressive thing, and of course it is more the girlie audience that will love it, not a bad romantic horror fantasy. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple / Screen Ensemble for The Entire Cast, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel and Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!"
"gavin6942","5","4","7","6 August 2010"," Best of the Series So Far... But That Doesn't Take Much
","After Edward's proposal to Bella at the end of ""New Moon"", a few loose ends need to be tied up: Bella must confront her feelings for Jacob, and they all must face Victoria, the vengeful vampire who hungers for Bella's death. If they can achieve this, smooth sailing!<br/><br/>Working off a book that my friend Tina cites as the ""least memorable"" of the series, I felt the film did a really good job bringing the story to life. Unfortunately, when you're working with a weak story, there is only so much you can bring to the film. The strongest parts of the book, for me, were the flashbacks, and indeed this was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this story has little plot. I'm pleased to say the romance and sap has been toned down yet again, the action is slightly improved, but overall the film is nothing but a speed bump between ""New Moon"" and ""Breaking Dawn"". You could probably skip this film entirely and not miss an important piece of the story (though you would miss the fleshing out of Jasper and Rosalie).<br/><br/>Sadly, director David Slade does not take the stylistic approach I felt he was capable of. After his ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"", I knew he was comfortable with edgy topics and dark imagery. He does not take that route, instead mimicking the style of the first two films. I respect his adherence to continuity, and I know he had to work in the PG frame, but still... the Harry Potter films took stylistic turns with new directors (most notably in the third film with Alfonso Cuarón), and the producers should not have been afraid to make that choice.<br/><br/>Professional reviews have been largely favorable, for reasons that escape me. The rating sits at 4.8 on IMDb (as of August 2010) and I find that to be much more realistic. The film showed no great writing, directing... and Kristen Stewart's acting is one flat note as it always is. Where is the emotion? Shame on reviewers who caved in and praised this film.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert, bless his heart, gave the film only two stars and two thumbs down (though he loved ""Karate Kid"" around the same time, so he's not flawless). He understands what appeals to the audience: ""A sweet girl is forced to choose between two improbably tall, dark and handsome men who brood and smolder and yearn for her."" (His review is worth reading for his comments about Edward's hairy eyebrows and what he sees as homoerotic tension.)<br/><br/>I take issue with the inclusion of Bree Tanner. She was singled out by the camera, and the promotional clips talked about her, presumably in an effort to help sell the Bree book. But her role is ultimately rather small, and her name is not mentioned once -- if you didn't read the book, you're not going to understand why she is even in this film. In fact, maybe she shouldn't have been.<br/><br/>If you saw the first two films, you're probably going to see this one. If you didn't, why see this one first? In fact, if you can avoid all three you are probably better off. While I enjoyed sitting in the theater heckling on opening day, I have very little desire to ever return to the city of Forks, Washington... though I know, sadly, that I will."
"yamus","5","4","7","6 July 2010"," Here's the pros and cons
","I would like to start with: Imagine the rating of this movie if all those fans didn't give it 10 stars simply because ""omg I love Jacob/Edward"" then again, a lot of people also gave it 1 probably without even watching the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is bad because: <br/><br/>*Fight Scenes: <br/><br/>-The fight scenes are terrible. They build so much up to a really epic fight and the newborn should be much stronger and wilder than the Cullens and even though the Cullens get help from the wolves (which I presume are about as strong as the Cullens) they are greatly outnumbered. But guess what, they beat an entire army of wilder, stronger newborns with no difficulty. The only one who gets harmed is Jacob who ends up with his right side broken. -The wolves who are supposed to hate vampires agrees to fight beside them but yet again against other vampires. That's alright if only they would show their rage against the newborns. Instead of tearing them apart and showing their strength, they bite them in the shoulders and throw them down. You just sit there and wait for their huge mouths to surround the heads of the vampires but noo, just the shoulder - cant hurt them too much, they got feelings too. But okay it's not an action movie.<br/><br/>*The Acting: -Bella isn't near death for loosing her breath every time she talks in this movie but she just fails on the intensity. She cant drag us into it and make us feel what she feels. It's too shallow.<br/><br/>*Edward being as far from a vampire as possible: -I know this is based on a book but I'm reviewing the movie only and no matter where their inspiration / plot came from, this is in the movie: <br/><br/>-I can accept that the vampires are changed a bit. They now sparkle in the light and they can resist their lust of human blood (which is seen a lot lately). But vampires are about aggression, passion, sex and so on. They are not meant to accept that their fiancée make out with their natural enemy. There is a limit of how much you can change the behavior of a vampire and still call it so. The only thing Edward has in common with vampires are his lust for blood, though animal blood works and he's pale. Vamp vs. Fairy?<br/><br/>And I better stop now though there's more :)<br/><br/>The movie is good because: <br/><br/>*Lore: <br/><br/>-Finally we get some lore about the wolf pack. It makes it a little more exciting to watch. We now understand why they hate the vampires so much. Also we hear what happened to Jasper which again just makes it a little more worth watching. Apart from that: -The big fight scene is alright, beside all the stuff I mentioned the wolves looks cool and adds a bunch to it. -I like the idea of Edward and Jacob fighting side by side (well they didn't but their tribes/clan did) -It had its fun moments and the chemistry between Edward and Bella is clear and those scenes might be enjoyed for those who like romance.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think it deserves 5 because the bad parts over shines the good ones so much but I must agree with my girlfriend. It was a little entertaining to watch, the effects were alright, I especially like the human-wolf transforming. Overall it's a 5, I wouldn't recommend you not to watch it, it might be just your cup of tea - just don't cancel other appointments for Eclipse"
"d_a_j_slu","4","7","15","4 July 2010"," It's okay but not great.. nowhere close to first two editions!!
","Twilight 3 is okay but not great. To say the least it is no where close to editions 1 & 2. In fairness may be there were great expectations from the movie (at least I had) after enormous success of the Twilight franchise both in printed and visual versions. The pace of the movie is slow and there are lot of conversations, not the usual romantic ones which are hallmark of this series, just the back and forth ones!! It misses on action for a good part and when action arrives, it's nicely executed but then action disappears before one could blink. One thing which amuses me is that in edition-1 Bella was ""unconditionally and irrevocably in Love with Edward"" and by edition-3 she is 'eternally confused'. Come on Stephenie Meyer don't go the Harry Potter way - you could do better!!"
"cm_anon76","4","7","15","2 July 2010"," Psychological drama
","Twilight: Eclipse is a movie about monsters. It's also a movie about sex. It's also a psychological drama. It's a psychological drama about sex and monsters.<br/><br/>Psychological dramas are very cerebral. Characters are constantly psycho-analyzing every little thing that goes on around them.<br/><br/>This tends to make things very boring. Scenes such as a werewolf transforming in mid-air, or Bella and Edward lying in bed together, or even war between vampire clans, are almost unbearable as the characters constantly psychoanalyze everything in site. Not even Madonna walking onto the set and dropping a load could make this movie interesting.<br/><br/>Why would anyone want to make a movie like this? I guess some teenagers think that it's cool to be blase about everything."
"ronstad26","10","9","21","1 July 2010"," Way better than a 1 out of 10!
","I only voted it 10 out of 10 just to compensate for the haters who voted 1 out of 10. It was actually a good movie and pretty true to the book. It was choppy at times and lacked a good flow. I believe that if one of the last two directors did this film it would be rated much higher. If you're a fan of Twilight than you will love it and if not then you probably won't appreciate it as much. What I did like about this movie is that it did give the audience what it wants ie. more Edward and Bella time and the movie was actually funny at parts. I feel like the characters have grown and the actors as well. Especially Robert, when people were walking out of the movie they all were talking about how they are switching from team Jacob to team Edward, he really looked good in this movie and was convincing as Edward Cullen. Anyway see the movie if you are a fan but don't expect it to be epic and then give it a one because it didn't live up to your critical expectations. It's a fun movie to see with your girlfriends."
"moviexclusive","8","10","24","30 June 2010"," Heartfelt romance, thrilling action and occasional wit make this the best Twilight film
","They say three's the charm, and how true it is for this third  installment of the Twilight saga- it has the tender heartfelt moments  of love in the first movie, the hot-blooded romantic tension too  diffuse in the second movie, and some genuinely thrilling action that  was previously absent from both its predecessors. Indeed, it is no  doubt the best film in the Twilight series so far and the one most  likely to win converts who have always been clueless- or cynical even-  of the unprecedented popularity of the franchise.  Wisely choosing not to follow wholesale the events as they unfold in  the book, director David Slade and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg have  injected a palpable sense of tension throughout the movie. Opting to  begin the movie with a gripping vignette where small-town boy Riley's  (Xavier Samuel) is stalked and then bitten by a vampire, Slade is ever  mindful to bring the threat of the swift, red-haired vampire Victoria  (Bryce Dallas Howard) front and center- even as our favourite  adolescent vampire Edward Cullen and adolescent werewolf Jacob Black  continue to vie for the affections of Bella Swan.  Whether Bella has feelings for Jacob wasn't so clear in ""New Moon"", but  it is in ""Eclipse"" that Bella will get the clarity audiences have been  waiting for. Meanwhile, as Bella turns 18, she pleads with Edward to  ""change"" her into a vampire, fulfilling what the Volturi had mandated  after sparing her life and in the process sealing a covenant of love  with Edward. It is no secret who Bella chooses to be with in the end,  but unlike the ambiguity in the second film that must have left some  audiences even more frustrated, ""Eclipse"" makes it clear why Bella  chooses one over the other- and credit must go to Rosenberg for her  finesse in conveying what author Stephenie Meyer did in her book in  less words than more but without losing any of its essence.  ""New Moon"" too failed to flesh out the dilemma that Bella faced in her  choice between Edward and Jacob- and where Chris Weitz has failed,  director David Slade has adroitly accomplished in ""Eclipse"". Here we  finally get to understand the predicament that Bella faces- not simply  a choice between two people or which one she loves more, but also one  between autonomy and surrender, a decision that ultimately comes with  irreversible ramifications.  Slade also uses the looming threat of Victoria and her army of newborn  vampires led by Riley- apparently more vicious and ferocious than  seasoned suckers- to add another dimension of Bella's love for both  Edward and Jacob. More than just humans with emotions, they are also  creatures - one a vampire with a thirst for blood and the other a  werewolf with a beastly rage- who have fought against their own  impulses to protect someone they love.  So too Edward's insistence at chastity before marriage, a deliberately  old-school notion of romance (as the film itself acknowledges) that is,  together with Edward and Jacob's protective instinct over Bella,  reasons why Twi-fans are so in love with these characters. The first  movie's portrayal of sweet unadulterated puppy-love may have been too  syrupy for some, the second movie's depiction of tangled love too  (well) tangled, but this third film finally hits the right notes in  portraying the very appeal of the Twilight series that could very well  be universal.  Of course, the success of the earlier two movies are not for nothing-  for the franchise has finally felt confident enough to even (gasp) poke  fun at itself. It has taken two movies, but ""Eclipse"" finally develops  a sense of humor that has arguably made the overall experience much  more enjoyable. When Jacob turns up topless waiting for Bella, Edward  asks mockingly ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" And one night up in the snowy  woods when Bella is shivering under the covers, Jacob turns to Edward  and says wryly: ""Face it, I'm hotter than you."" These flashes of  self-mocking wit make ""Eclipse"" seem less daft about its own clichés,  and reveal a franchise that is finally learning not to take every  detail about itself too seriously.  If ""Eclipse"" is refreshingly witty in parts, it is also refreshingly  thrilling for the most part. What action sequences there were in the  first two movies were anaemic at best, but Slade (who directed the  horror movie ""30 Days of Night"") finally makes full use of the  potential within the vampires and werewolves premise to deliver fast  and furious action, complete with an exhilarating climax that though  bloodless (so it can be teen-friendly) will still leave you at the edge  of your seat.  As always, Kristen Stewart is the best performer among the three,  capturing perfectly the anxiety and uncertainty of her character.  Real-life squeeze Robert Pattinson seems more comfortable on screen and  exhibits more range than just the moody, brooding persona he was  before. On the other hand, Taylor Lautner seems to be maturing into a  fine lead actor, his intense emotional performance mirroring the  ferocity of his character's nature.  Not simply in acting, but also in storytelling and direction, ""Eclipse""  is therefore a definite step-up from its predecessors. As it rightly  should, it remains anchored around Bella, Edward and Jacob- but more  than that, it gives reason to the love between Bella and Edward and  between Bella and Jacob, enough reason to put back the bite in the  vampire-human and werewolf-human romance. Sprinkled with wit and  generous dose of pulse-pounding action, this third film most adeptly  encapsulates the appeal of the Twilight franchise and should please  both fans and neophytes alike."
"lbabe29","6","5","10","3 July 2010"," The best in the series, this is a darker, more complex and mature film BUT not for everyone and undoubtedly flawed
","Twilight,Twilight,Twilight.. who would have guessed this story of vampires, werwolf's and teen love would become such a phenomenon. My theatre was packed with giggling girls sighing and gasping every time Jacob appeared topless, clapping at every kiss, every brooding glance between Edward and Bella. I for one am not one of the those girls, i don't buy into this whole twilight mania....i watch this series simply out of curiosity, I'm yet to be gripped, I'm yet to ""understand"" or really ""get it"" but Twilight does have a certain charm and this latest entry is closest I've gotten to ""getting it"". I was entertained, I was moved (in certain scenes) and i was thrilled.....certain times i was also bored, let down and cringing. It's a mixed bag with this one but overall i left impressed: it seems everyone stepped up their game.<br/><br/>Im gonna start with The Actors simply because this is main aspect that for me was weak/sub-par in the first 2: The good news? Everyone has improved The bad news?: It's still often not enough<br/><br/>Main Leads: Kristen Stewart: I've never had any major issues with Stewarts performance it's more her character that annoys me. Here Stewart does a passable job, it's nothing we have not seen before from her and at times i felt she could have pushed herself further or even shown a bit more emotion...much like Pattison her performance is saved by actual, deep chemistry with her ""true-love"" Edward...at least it looks like she wants him.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson: For ONCE he was tolerable. He was less wooden and stiff, there were a few moments where Pattinson showed at least some emotion and believability. However his performance is still dull,wooden and devoid of any real intensity...A tolerable, so-so performance helped by strong chemistry with Stewart.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner: Of the three leads only Lautner has any kind of charm, he is the only one to seem natural and show any kind of emotional conflict. Saying that it's still not a ""good"" performance....Lautner hits the emotions well enough: desire,regret,anger,desperation but he never really goes for it, he never pushes himself to a level where i can say ""ok this kid is a good actor"". The best performance of the leads Lautner has acting potential for sure but at the moment its obvious his chest is taking centre stage.<br/><br/>The best acting/performance: Hands down goes to Jackson Rathbone as ""Jasper"", he steals every scene he appears in, bringing an intensity which most of the other actors lack...for me he is one of those ""i cant look away"" actors..he dominates the screen. Xavier Samuel also deserves a mention as Riley....even though he is only a minor (yet vital) player i put him in the same bracket as Rathbone, there is something going on there that makes you want to keep watching.<br/><br/>The positives: This film is darker, the tone is more menacing and the romance works better because of that. Because the film chooses to play down the romance somewhat and up the action and violence it makes for a more balanced, mature movie. The love triangle is actually pretty entertaining and at times dramatic and even intense. The cheesy,mushy horrible lines/dialogue of the Book are still there but less so than the previous films which is a massive blessing in my mind (i can only take so much cheese). Scenes with Jacob and Bella prove to be the most interesting and natural. There were some funny scenes, ill admit i did laugh...i left impressed that a twilight film could actually be funny in a good way. Some of the romance scenes really worked (Bella and Jacobs scene on the cliff top for example, moments during the ""proposal"" with Edward/Bella) Background on the rest of the Cullen family was maybe the highlight for me, very interesting <br/><br/>The negatives: The score was a big let down, usually the only really impressive thing about twilight is it's choice of music but here it just felt lazy. The usual CRINGE moments, Bella and Edward have some very cringe-Worthy romantic exchanges....i blame the book for this, the film cant help being faithful and it literally lifts these lines from the book's pages. During the ""action chase"" moments the director went over-bored with the shaky cam making it very hard to follow what was happening. The final battle could have been more epic and Bella's final scene with Jacob should have lasted longer. At times it dragged on and ill be honest 2 hours seemed to drag on and on <br/><br/>This film and indeed this series is not the epic, deep romance it claims or trys so hard to be, this is no ""titanic"" or ""gone with the wind"".....here is a film of pure entertainment and it is enjoyable...the love triangle is fun to watch, the romance is at times touching, the action is at times very thrilling. This is not a great film or even that good of a movie But its a great way to waste away a dull evening or a rainy day. Aside from the frustrating fact its PAINFULLY obvious Bella should be with the only half decent character in the film: Jacob....<br/><br/>This is a flawed, forgettable yet enjoyable film...MUCH better than the previous two and a more improved film in nearly all aspects, <br/><br/>I would say give it a chance you may like it...just don't expect anything great."

I'm guessing because they've never had a love like what Bella has in their life.<br/><br/>I too just got out of the movie & no one had a bad thing to say about it NO ONE all I heard was clapping at credits, when out side talk of how good it was!

"moviewizguy","7","10","25","30 June 2010"," It all begins ... With a choice
","Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger as Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob — knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella is confronted with the most important decision of her life. (Summit Entertainment)<br/><br/>Once the opening scene is over and the title appears with Howard Shore's epic soundtrack playing in the background, you know that ECLIPSE is going to be good. Unlike NEW MOON, there's actually SOMETHING happening in here! There are characters DOING things, which is something more I can say for the previous sequel. And because the film has a very interesting plot akin to a horror film, ECLIPSE is easily the most exciting and cinematic film in the series!<br/><br/>But just because there is a body count doesn't rule it out as a romance. Yes, the romance is still here. Yes, there is still the love triangle. Yes, Bella still has to choose between Edward and Jacob. But all of this is not as bad and tedious as you might think mostly due to Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay. This time around, she decides to add clever lines and something called humor into the romance. For example, in one scene, Edward asks Bella about Jacob, ""Doesn't he have a shirt?"" It's little scenes like these that make the love story a lot less cheesy and more welcoming compared to the first two films which everything was so serious they could pass for soap operas.<br/><br/>Like the HARRY POTTER series, it's interesting to see different styles from the many directors that are attached for each film. With David Slade now on the directing chair, the film is improved with a much tighter direction and a faster pace. With experience from the horror genre, Slade knows how to create exciting action sequences. In fact, Slade pulls no punches in the climatic battle scene(s). Honestly, you get your money's worth. Who knew a TWILIGHT film would have the most beheadings in a PG-13 film? Honestly, there were some really brutal scenes.<br/><br/>The cast is still good but more mature in their roles. Kristen Stewart gives a wonderful performance as always. I also liked Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, especially in one scene where they get to spew out clever dialogue at one another about how they're the better man for Bella. Anna Kendrick, who had her rise of fame in UP IN THE AIR last year, doesn't appear much in the film, unfortunately, but it's always great to see her when she does, including one important scene. Billy Burke is still the same great father we saw him in the previous two films.<br/><br/>Most of the Cullen clan have considerably more to do in this sequel, most notably Jackson Rathbone. There are even origin stories on two of them, both of which are very interesting while one of them is eerily similar to Bill Compton's in TRUE BLOOD. Xavier Samuel plays the new villain and he gives a menacing performance. Bryce Dallas Howard replaces Rachelle Lefevre as the new Victoria and she does a good job as well, although she's underused.<br/><br/>Even the visual effects are improved! I didn't know how they did it, but the sparkling skin on Edward is suddenly not laughable anymore. I also liked the look of the CGI wolves and their interactions with the actors. There's one scene with Bella petting Jacob in his transformation and it looked believable. Oh, and it's great to listen to Howard Shore's soundtrack along with seeing the sweeping cinematography.<br/><br/>While it won't bring newcomers to the franchise, ECLIPSE is an improvement over NEW MOON. The romance is less cheesy, the action scenes are a lot bigger, the plot is a lot more interesting, and the film finally has a sense of humor. If you're not a fan of the TWILIGHT saga, you know what to do without me telling you. However, for the fans of the series, you'll be completely satisfied."

"Sidrick7","10","9","22","1 July 2010"," Cease the hate - best film in the Twilight Saga by far.
","Humans are conformists. Why does this film receive such hate and so many unwelcome reviews when it is by far the most efficiently, effectively and excitingly produced addition to the Twilight Saga so far? Because it is thought - stereotyped, even - that a Twilight movie would obviously be poorly constructed and would not adhere to the expectations fans hold of the best-selling novel/film. This ignorance and lack of appreciation for artistic talent is saddening. I must admit that I was displeased with Meyer's poor use of imagery when writing Eclipse, as moments including Charlie and Bella's awkward ""talk"" about her physical intimacy, the Quileutes traditional campfire tales and the ultimate fight between the Newborns and the Vampires/Werewolves were all horribly illustrated in the book, but perfectly depicted in the film, providing action, excitement and gore which had been unfortunately absent in the first two productions - well done David Slade! Eclipse is a quality production, goes hand in hand with the reminiscent, dreamy prose of the novel and offers moments of comic relief to aid the dark plot. The Twilight Phenomenon undoubtedly gains popularity by the hour, and, after viewing Eclipse, I can so clearly understand why. Let's face it, everyone has a soft spot for the films, the books, the addictive, compelling interest that is Twilight - even those of you who critique the series enjoy the prospect of attending the films, reading the books, and to a further extent, posting negative reviews! Don't conform; cease the hate and appreciate the art."

","Okay first I would like to say to the people who hate on Twilight all the time need to move on. Seriously! It's not something that is for everyone. And those of us who are the crazed fans are happy that way so leave it alone. All you do is make people think you secretly love Twilight and are too bitter about it to admit it! :-) Second: Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! The tent scene lacked absolutely nothing! I know a lot of people were worried due to the whole PG thing but it was exactly as it should've been. I think the ""that should've been our first kiss moment"" was epic too! MmMMM! Bryce Dallas Howard was incredible! Looks like Rachelle failed on that one for taking a contract for some lifetime movie! She played the part the way it was meant to be played. Good job out of her at coming in at the eleventh hour and really capturing Victoria.<br/><br/>Seth Clearwater was sooo cute! I wanted to kiss his cute lil face!! Loved the humor in the movie! It added a lot of fun to it that sometimes the original didn't really have.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great movie for the true twilight fans! Two thumbs way way up! Oh and Jasper's scenes...yum!!! More of him in Breaking Dawn please!"
"iheartmelbourne","9","9","22","30 June 2010"," Does Slade Get It? Yes, He Does
","I was apprehensive about seeing The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. I worried that David Slade didn't have much affinity with what is a very female genre piece - a post-feminist meta mythology – plus it appeared as if the producers were actively courting a male audience, dissing (or even spurning) the core demographic. Of course, Eclipse does contain more 'action' and so, in some sense, the narrative demanded a different director to New Moon. Happily, Slade delivered an engrossing – and stunning – film. Slade doesn't have Chris Weitz' poetic sensibility - I especially admired the way he rendered Bella Swan's depression – but, then again, I am not sure Weitz could have directed Eclipse. But what Slade does is balance the different facets of Eclipse - on one side, the rivalry between Jacob Black and Edward Cullen, and Bella's conflicting emotions, and, on the other, the looming menace of the newborns and the ramifications of warfare between the Cullens/Wolves and Victoria's army. It's an awful lot to compress into one movie, but the adaptation didn't feel truncated. I can now appreciate why Riley's role was expanded in the film: Xavier Samuel is a fine actor and his Riley provides a catalyst for much of the drama. Ironically, he eclipsed Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard). As much as I've admired Howard in other films, I am not sure she has the presence required for Victoria - internal politics aside, Rachelle LeFevre manifested her cruelty, hatred and disregard for human values. The diminutive Howard appeared almost meek. Victoria needs to be a vampire Boudica - a flame-haired warrior. Howard didn't exude that. I enjoyed seeing more of the excellent Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Cullen – and, as Bella's pal, Anna Kendrick was given a few extra lines befitting her growing stardom. But the biggest revelation of Eclipse was that, despite their celebrity, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart and the less exposed Taylor Lautner melt into their roles, the characterisation so seamless that you forget who is portraying them. For today's actors, that is an achievement."

","The Twilight Saga [3]: Eclipse (2:04, PG-13, Imax) — Other: Romance; biggie; sequel; OSIT romantics<br/><br/>Suppose you are a young German lad named Riley, and you're returning late one rainy 1937 night from your Hitlerjugend meeting when you're repeatedly bowled over by some unseen entity. You run, but to no avail. Eventually you wake up confronted by a rabbi who informs you that, without even asking you, he's turned you into a Jew and that you're now heir to centuries of tradition. This means that, from now on, you will have to live in a ghetto, you can't go out for a good chunk of the week, your career choices are very limited, you must obey severe dietary restrictions (like no chocolate or dairy products), you'll have to lie to your family and friends about your condition, and you have just acquired a load of obscure obligations. Oh, yeah, and most of your countrymen would regretlessly kill you without a 2nd thot. Your question, Riley, is why you would even think twice about showing this rabbi undying devotion and obedience.<br/><br/>Suppose it's Renaissance Verona and you're a young peasant lass named Bella. You're nice looking but not a raving beauty. You're also possessed of no noticeable smarts, ambition, initiative, talent, wit, passion, athletic ability, sexual desire (let alone skill), connections, wealth, or prospects. You are, however, an acknowledged world-class gold medalist at mooning and pining. You come to the attention of the leading scions of the noble but feuding Houses of Capulet and Montague, and each of them professes to be deeply, truly, eternally in love with you to the point of being willing to die for you and enlist their entire clan in your protection. Your questions, Bella, are (a) why the hell do you want to get mixed up with these obsessive and possibly homicidal maniacs and (b) what in hell do those guys see in YOU?<br/><br/>Suppose you're in a supermarket check-out line and your eyes stray to the ""newspapers"" on display there. YOUR question is whether any of these people have family names or are you simply expected to recognize every reference that uses only a first name?<br/><br/>Well, none of these questions gets answered in the 3rd Twilight movie, but at least the pace picks up from the draggy 2nd installment enuf for me to move it up a couple of notches to the same score I gave the 1st movie.<br/><br/>Bella (Kristen Stewart) finally shows some initiative other than reluctance. The camera gives us the occasional super-close-up but doesn't just park there. There's less of Edward (Robert Pattinson) twinkling (about which one of my friends commented ""that's why they make Clearasil"") despite what seems to be more sunshine. And also less of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) taking off his shirt (since it STAYS off for pretty much the entire picture). There are plenty of werewolves (BIG suckers) but almost no transformation scenes. We depart from the central love triangle long enuf to get some interesting history told as flashbacks by the supporting characters. While there's still too much standing around, posing, and pointless chit-chat, nonetheless tension builds believably toward the big battle at the end between the united occult tribes of Forks, Washington, and a platoon of ""newborns"" — vampires recently created by Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) to avenge herself on Bella for last movie's destruction of her lover James. And, blessedly, there's some humor, such as the double entendre when Jacob informs Edward ""I am hotter than you"" and the fumbling efforts of dad Charlie (Billy Burke) to have a way belated sex talk with Bella.<br/><br/>More to the point, unlike the similar vampires vs. werewolves theme of the parallel Underworld series, the Twilight saga features characters whom we are invited to care about. It's some measure of the saga's success that we are able to suspend our wholly justified disbelief long enuf to actually do so.<br/><br/>For some unknown reason, as of this morning (June 30), with 3,761 user votes tallied on IMDb, this film got only 3.2 out of 10 stars and is pulling a dead mediocre 50% at RottenTomatoes. C'mon, people, it wasn't THAT bad."
"3xHCCH","5","16","45","29 June 2010"," Practically ""New Moon"" All Over Again
","Before going into the movie house tonight, I was so ready not to like this movie. ""Eclipse"" is positively the worst book in the Twilight franchise. It even discouraged me from reading the next book ""Breaking Dawn."" The entire book was an just an over-extended exposition on the indecisive wishi-washiness of one Bella Swan over the vampire Edward and the werewolf Jacob. This very same conflict was already introduced and tackled in ""New Moon."" For me, it did not really reach a new level here in ""Eclipse."" Unfortunately, it is the same way here in the movie version.<br/><br/>The best scene in the book only happens past Chapter 20 already when Bella and her two consorts were caught in a single tent in the mountains during a big storm. Same way here in the movie. It features a most hilariously memorable line when one tells the other ""I'm hotter than you!"" After that though, even the book was better than how Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner monotonously delivered their subsequent cheesy lines.<br/><br/>Director David Slade continues the same character quirks established in the first two movies, like how Bella and Edward love to talk in a field of wildflowers, how Bella's dad Charlie (Billy Burke) provides the comic relief, and others. We got to see the origins of Rosalie and Jasper. We also get to see the history of the Quileuete tribe. The main background conflict was how Victoria was establishing an army of new blood vampires in Seattle in order to kill Bella and avenge her lover's death. These fight scenes were actually quite well shot with good special effects. It was also good to see Anna Kendrick (fresh from her Oscar nomination for ""Up in the Air"") as Jessica delivering the valedictory speech at their graduation rites. <br/><br/>So overall, we did not really see anything new in the love triangle aspect. Things did get more physically intimate for the three main characters, more than the previous one, but the ""romantic"" lines do get more corny. This is a movie that Twihards will love, but I do not think it can stand by itself. I feel this is actually a step down from ""New Moon."" The main limitation is really the book this movie was based on."
"ccgibs3196","6","6","13","6 July 2010"," Unduly ripped apart by haters of the series
","Eclipse, when it comes right down to it, was not that terrible of a movie. It's garnered at 53% rating on rottentomatoes.com, which isn't too shabby (considering the second most popular movie this week, ""The Last Airbender"" only has an 8%). It's just too popular for its own good, and most people out there rip it apart without giving it a chance.<br/><br/>Albeit, it wasn't as good of a movie as it could have been. Kristen Stewart turned practically cold in this movie, and you are lucky if you get a smile or any expression on that girl's face. I found that Lautner and Pattinson's abilities both have improved, and in my opinion the scenes where they interact are some of the best of the film. Constant criticisms are of the two's over-acting, but if you have read the book (I know, I know), Edward is supposed to be fiercely protective and Jacob is supposed to be goofy and a love-sick teenager.<br/><br/>Eclipse finally gave its audiences the action that the other two movies (and books) lacked. The fight between the Cullens, wolves and newborns was well shot and very riveting, if not a little rushed. I'd definitely go as far to say that the fight scene in the movie was far better than the fight scene in the book. It was visually stunning as well as involving.<br/><br/>One major fault I found in the film was its unfortunate lack of a powerful soundtrack. After re-watching New Moon, the music is loud and very apparent and it really moves the story along. In Eclipse, most of the music was used as background noise in the scenes.<br/><br/>There were again solid performances from the supporting actors: almost everyone from the Cullen clan (save the actor who played Jasper, who I found was incredibly stiff with a terrible Texan accent), Billy Burke had fantastic timing, and even Bella's four friends from school shone.<br/><br/>I am an unabashed Twilight fan, and Eclipse was about all I expected to be. What made it so enjoyable was the fantasy was brought to life; that's what has made all the movies enjoyable. Fans don't flock to the theatre to see award-worthy acting, intelligent dialogue or a fantastic plot (the last two aren't apparent in the books, either), but they go to see the Cullen family's amber eyes finally realized, or the dreary town of Forks brought to life. Twilight, both the film and book series, are popular because they tap into the basest of human desires: the want for someone to love you, to care for you enough that they would fight a pack of vampires or die to save you. Love triangles crop up again and again in movies, books, TV shows because they resonant with the audience. Human desire is something that transfixes us.<br/><br/>Eclipse has its highs and lows, and the acting ranges from extraordinary to depressingly stiff, but it does what all good movies do: it offers an escape into a world that could not exist anywhere else. If you allow it, Eclipse can be truly entertaining, it just takes a bit of reading between the lines."
"Dreamer241","2","6","13","5 July 2010"," Oh My Eclipse
","To think I defended this film to people. For them to churn out this absolute piece of rubbish left me paralysed with rage by the middle of the film. Firstly I want to call the main actors, actors. Except what they did on screen was simply read out the lines given to them. It seemed they'd woken up the night before and thought, ""hmmm maybe I should actually read the script."" Robert Pattison shows very little passion when delivering any of his lines. Except the one which goes something like ""It no longer bothers me"" Says it all really. Kristen Stewart must realise by now that stuttering your way through lines does not count as acting. Just because you can pause in the right places just means your good at breathing. Any human can breathe. What are we paying you for? Taylor Launter and Xavier Samuel actors who showed any heart but they were stunted by a useless plot and lack of air time since Bella as a character needs constant attention. Yes she is telling the story, I just find it hard to believe that Vampires and Werewolves would all stop to help Bella through her time of PMSing and generally being a dry individual. A lot of it didn't make any sense. Finding out the director didn't care for the movie made sense. The actors lack of effort shows from the fact they couldn't be bothered to turn up to the London premiere, then they have the nerve to wonder why so many people just download the film. The film gets two points from me, those are for a shirtless Jacob. Other then that, it was poor. Now I'm off to give the script to a year ten class. Their portrayal would probably put these so called 'professional' actors to shame. Do they not realise they could and should be easily replaced. There is plenty of young and attractive talent roaming away just waiting to steal their parts. Sort it owt!!!"
"m-symphony","7","8","19","1 July 2010"," Still not much of a believer
","I will be the first to admit that as the Guy who loves Guy movies, the Twilight Saga caught my attention. Not because I intended to pick up the book and read it but because the wife became a twihard fan and I just had to see what the hype was all about. It didn't take long to realize why this story attracted every teenage girl who has been conditioned to believe they deserve the perfect wedding, that you can indeed train your boyfriend and that if you so wish can even play multiple boys at one time. Hey, it's every girls dream. Again I say, girl, not woman, but girl. So when I was tortured into seeing New Moon trust me when I say I was about to lie to my wife about having to work late when Eclipse rolled out. Well gentlemen, I have to admit I was actually quite entertained. Being that I already know the whole darn story up to this point (without a choice) I went in understanding the role that Bella, Edward, and Jacob all played so when viewing Eclipse the dialog wasn't as painful as it was during New Moon or even the first movie. There was a little comedy, your typical simple dialog between the ""triangle"" and a heck of a lot more detail into the history of other characters. Now first let me be clear here, I come from the Vampire days where Vampires were bad asses and not these sparkling in the sun, falling in love with humans so to watch some of these Vampires battle it out with New Bloods was quite entertaining. Not to mention having the wolf pack team up with the Culligans was not a surprise, but pretty damn cool none the less. I honestly felt it was the part of the story that rewarded Men who had painstakingly struggled through the first two movies. Almost an ode to those Men that love their spouses so much that Eclipse was the action that all us Men longed for as we sacrificed our time and energy laughing our behinds off to that pathetic romance happening between the triangle. I mean for God sakes just do them both Bella and get it over with. Edward doesn't really seem to mind anyways! Oh, there is one scene I will state to all those Men who are going to brave this movie, if I were to go see Broke Back Mountain this scene I swear would have been in it. I never saw Broke Back but let me put it this way, it was pretty damn well  Man lovish  in either event if you see it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I would suggest getting a drink at the snack bar during this scene. So all in all quite surprisingly different from the first two. Oh and I haven't read the books so I will state that for those who did I would agree, that red head Vampire was a wuss and in no way reflected a blood thirsty violent Vampire out for revenge. But she was hot ... I'll give her that."
"drimeu","8","8","19","1 July 2010"," ""What part of forever don't you understand""?
","First there was the Twilight books... and I loved them all. They were juvenile, though there were some questions in the story told by Stephenie Meyer that can relate to readers from all ages. After, we met the movies, and those questions were so left behind the adaptations that it is not a surprise the movies have so low reviews.<br/><br/>There are some important discussions in Twilight: adequacy in a very confusing and world, of so many shallow issues; the need of making choices that can transform us in something we are not sure about; humanity and what that really means in the world today... and, finally, the search of true love (better if it can last forever...)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I saw the first two films - Twilight and New Moon - more than 10 times in the theater. I'm leaving now to see Eclipse for the 3td time in 2 days... I had so much fun with them, and could share it with lots of friends, but in every screening I knew that it could be so much better. If only the prejudice about the story were also left behind...<br/><br/>Because for me that is the biggest problems with the movies and some reviews: lock such a sweet and strong story in a silly box of teen love and indecision. Melissa Rosenberg - the key to the questions, from my point of view - can relate to Dexter in a marvelous way, but Twilight, as she showed us with her writing, she was not able to understand... or like it. It is a guess, but, with the movies, I had the feeling that Rosenberg really dislikes Bella and Edward. With her script, she can give them a big ugh. Maybe because she can't understand the love as Stephenie Meyer described it. The wolves and Charlie, though, she loves... and that's why their characters in the movies are so funny and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Its a shame. The movies could have been so intense and sweet and funny and good as the books are. They could bring millions to the theater and, yet, let them leave the screening with happy faces and heart. Instead, we see the finals credits with a bit sadness and hopeful for the next movie... That again show us how hope can be so illusionary. <br/><br/>Eclipse was that way. I had fun? You bet! Edward and Bella are more natural characters. The make-up is better (Rosalie is finally beautiful). The fight scenes is nice. The songs are great... despite their bad use in Eclipse, like it was in New Moon (aplause to Hardwicke for a smart use of the soundtrack and score). Again a Muse song had a 2 sec appearance... a shame, it could have closed the Eclipse with a strong note. <br/><br/>Well, Eclipse is the theaters now. Lets wait for the Breaking Down movies... another wait, more hope for the better... See you there."

I want to lose it with someone special, with someone I love. It's not like I can lose my virginity twice, Edward. It's not like my virginity can grow back. Unless....no.

"Scrugulus","6","3","5","6 July 2012"," Weakest part of the franchise?
","I'll start (again), by saying that the acting is good to very good throughout. That does exclude Pattinson and Samuel - both very good actors I'm sure - who seem both at a loss as to what their characters' motivations are. For Pattinson, it is evident throughout the franchise that he cannot find access to Edwards weird inner self. But in my opinion it is never more visibly obvious than in this third film. This is usually not really the fault of the actor - writers and/or directors are to blame for that. In Edward's case, I think it is fair to say that he is a rather badly written character. And Samuel seems to be at a similar problem with his character (Riley), though I am tempted to put the blame more on the directing than the writing in this case.<br/><br/>As for the plot, there isn't much. It is all just one long preparation for the final battle scene. And the love triangle subplot is just a continuation from the second film. A judgement which one might extent to the whole film: it does at times seem a bit like an addendum to ""New Moon"".<br/><br/>Although the film contains the most hilarious line of the whole franchise (""Doesn't he own a shirt?""), it also features the infamous ""I'm Switzerland""-line, a line so bad and so incongruous in that very scene that it even seems to throw Stewart of her game, as it is one of the very rare scenes in all of the films in which her acting seems to be sub-par.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'd probably struggle to give this one more that a 5.5 out of 10. However, it does make a difference whether you view it as a stand-alone film, or whether you watch it in close succession with the other films (which is preferable)."

I thought that the acting was better in this one as well. Robert Pattinson has done his best work as Edward in this movie. Edward actually smiled and had fun, not the always moody and brooding vampire that he has been in the other two films. Kristen's acting even improved. She seem to change her acting from only have one emotion, to have a few more. This movie definitely lives up to the book,and was by far the best!

","OK, as of now this film has just under 6,000 votes here on IMDb and nearly half of those are 1 star. What does that tell you? I'm sure you can probably guess that virtually all of these come from those who spend their time hating Twilight and want to rate it bad because.....well I don't know why. They hate everything associated with it, including the actors, and not least of all Twilight fans. Seems a waste of time to me. Why would you spend valuable time with something that you don't like? Wouldn't your time be better spent IMDb'ing movies you actually enjoy? Why some people are so hell bent on ridiculing Twilight fans, I'll never know. Does it somehow hurt their quality of life if people are in love with the Twilight series? I doubt it. They need to get over it and move on.<br/><br/>Anyhow the film: From a technical standpoint it's far superior to the 1st and 2nd installment. But then that's to be expected. The kinks have been worked out by this point, and the mass popularity of the franchise has enabled the creators to get the best crew members. I was delighted to see how the special fx have grown since the first film; like night and day. As far as the storyline I don't think it would be fair to give all the credit to the director and screenwriters and director of cinematography. I mean after all, the Eclipse plot is the most exciting of the 4 so it's almost inevitable that the film will be more entertaining than the others.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, the principle players have gotten marginally better. Kristin Stewarts constipated stuttering leaves a lot to be desired. I've seen her in other films where she's a perfectly decent actress so I'm guessing she interpreted this aspect literally from the book. I don't hold it against her. Robert Pattinson hasn't gotten a lot to work with in any of the films, but after having seen his other film Remember Me, I know that he's got some good acting skills in there; it's just the material at fault here.<br/><br/>I've read all 4 installments of Stephenie Meyers' saga, and I truly enjoyed the books. Compared to them the films are definitely subpar but not altogether unenjoyable. Twilight was pretty good, New Moon wasn't good at all, but then again the book was sort of slow as well. Eclipse is better than both of them.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of either, I predict Eclipse will be your favorite one."

","The Twilight series are just simply not worth ranting about over the net. Sure Taylor Lautner is attractive and sure there is chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson, but the franchise is crap and we all know it. Predictably when they made a successful novel, they will probably turn it into a movie, so there born the Twilight series. Written elegantly by Stephanie Meyers and ruined by Hollywood. Even though in this particular film I admired the CGI effects and the director, it still doesn't make up for the bumpy plot and high school acting. Especially Lautner, all he is good for is pleasing the audience (girls) with his abs and that is not acting (to say the least). Twilight Saga: Eclipse has its goods but there weren't enough to cover its faults."
"stephanie-lineberry-898-517397","8","4","8","15 November 2010"," Much Better Than Previous Movies
","First, I don't understand why some of these reviewers waste our time bashing all of the movies because their girlfriend dragged them to see it and they didn't want to go. If you don't want to see the movie in the first place, of course you're going to think it's terrible! I could write tons of negative reviews for movies I knew I wouldn't enjoy going in but that's not really fair, is it? If you don't like the movies, DON'T GO! I don't like gore, I clearly wouldn't like a gory movie.<br/><br/>Now, on to my review. Eclipse was, by far, the best movie in the saga so far. The books were (as always seems to be the case) far better than the movies and, to be honest, Twilight was pretty terrible. I thought it was slow to pick up and relatively uninteresting. New Moon gave me some faith in the movies - it was much more interesting and the script was better. Eclipse was actually a good movie, so if you're at all interested in the story, I really think you'll enjoy this one."
"kayleigh0804","6","4","8","23 July 2010"," Had the potential to be something special
","I loved the Twilight Saga as soon as I started reading the first few pages of the first book. Eclipse was one of, if not the strongest book in the saga, with plenty of suspense and action to satisfy the reader. I had extremely high hopes for this film.<br/><br/>One thing I can't fault is the special effects. The fight scenes were great, the acting within these scenes was very good. What let this down was the boring first half of the film, and I felt that the ending was quite poor. I felt that there was too much kissing (yes I know it is a love story, I appreciate that, but it was almost every five minutes they we're sucking each other's faces off). <br/><br/>I also feel they focused a bit too much on the novella that was recently released, rather than the actual Eclipse novel. I liked that we managed to see a bit more into the story of Rosalie and of Jasper, which you get in the books also - but I think I'd have liked to have seen a bit more bonding going on with Bella and the rest of the Cullens.<br/><br/>This film had great potential, but wasn't great. I felt that New Moon was a lot stronger than Eclipse, and seeing as it is the weakest book in the saga - that's not a good thing!<br/><br/>I just hope and pray that Breaking Dawn can do better."
"jjnoahjames","6","4","8","6 July 2010"," Worst of the series. This movie was made to make money, save money, and for young children and old adults who like obvious scripts better than clever scripts.
","I'll keep it simple; The acting is worst and better at the same time. Making me dizzy.<br/><br/>They added a sprinkle of comedy, when I thought it's strength was darkness.<br/><br/>To make it worst it's somewhat feels like 3rd party comedy, which means that people in the movie's own world wouldn't get it because it's about this world...boy jokes about Joseph and Edward for example.<br/><br/>This was hyped to have more action when in fact in did not, and when it did it was even more cheesy and artificial than before. Example...the vampires bursting into stone by getting punched? Cartoon anyone? In the trailer I got this idea like it was gonna be a mega blockbuster, since it will prob be the biggest movie of the year, and there was no fighting in the big city like I thought, or any crazy blockbuster stuff.<br/><br/>The Vulturi. They really didn't do anything. I thought their would be a big fight scene with them and everything. I was hoping they would have a big chunk of the movie and they didn't.<br/><br/>And last but not least. She chose Edward....and I noticed some girls cry because their team didn't win.<br/><br/>A real shame. How do you please both teams?"
"ld260685","10","6","14","3 July 2010"," Great film from a Great book
","Since both reading the books and seeing the films I can't imagine what (with the only exception being for the reviewers who went to see the films that were never fans of the books to begin with) would find wrong with Eclipse. Like with Twilight and New moon this film is based mainly around the plot of the books although with only subtle differences from what was written but that was to be expected. When I went to see it today I understood that in order to keep the film going at reasonable running length scenes would have had to have been cut out or shortened from what you see in the book. <br/><br/>Sure there are parts of the book I would have enjoyed to have seen in the film but for what was actually shown as with its predecessors the changes were so minor that there was still enough of the main plot from the book in there for me to be able to still enjoy it. The series True-blood and the film Interview with the Vampire are perfect examples of this as well because although they are both different from how they are written there is still enough of the source material in them for fans of the books to recognise and still enjoy watching them. As I hope will be the same with Breaking Dawn when the two-part films are released. I am not going to give details away but what I can advise for those that have not seen it yet don't let other peoples opinions sway your own opinion before going to see it."
"BarbaraEvans","4","6","14","1 July 2010"," Definitely better than the first two... but that's not saying much
","As a fan of the books, it surprised me that I was actually afraid of how terrible the movie would be. Yes, I didn't even think of the possibility of it being good. And I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>What's the problem? Definitely not the director, I mean they've changed it at least 3 times and it still sucks. The writing? Of course. The story is so low and plain. It doesn't have a course. It's like they filmed parts of the books that they knew fans would love to see and try to link them without success. If I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't get a single clue of the story or the big deal about Bella (that even the books can't explain). The lines are so repetitive. We know by heart what Lautner will say every time he puts his puppy face and what Bella'll respond. Also, we don't quite understand in this movie Edward-Bella relationship. I mean, in the first one is all ""I'll die for you"" and ""You're my everything"" and now all that (after all the sacrifices that BOTH made) goes to ***. I was at the point of wanting to kill Bella to stop all this fuzz around her. <br/><br/>Even though they tried to show us more of the relationship Bella has with her mother, you don't understand at all why she keeps treating her parents like that. Charlie for her doesn't matter at all. I used to understand all of this in the books, but now I see it's also wrong there. Come on, you shouldn't be daring to leave them forever. <br/><br/>Acting. So LAAAAAAAMEEE. Come on. We've seen Stewart in other movies and she's definitely OK. We've seen Pattinson, and I particularly loved him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter. Lautner is the best of the main three, but still that's not saying much. Of course Anna Kendrick, Billy Burke and Dakota Fanning steal the scene every time they appear, but it's not enough. They need to show some freaking emotion. Pattinson's face the whole movie stays like this: -.- <br/><br/>Makeup? You have to admit it is by far the best of the three movies... but, again, that's not saying much. What I mean is that if in Twilight you could see the difference between their neck and their face, now you can't... but it still looks like chalk. In one scene I could actually saw Carlisle's WHITE eyebrows. LOL! Besides, Bella's wig was TERRIBLE. And what's worse is that they kept showing her face so close that you could see everything. <br/><br/>Sets were amazing. Music was fine but it didn't make me had goose bumps like every good scene with great music does. And the clothes... Actually they were pretty great, according to each character, you know. Effects? Definitely better than the first two but... guess what? That's not saying much. Yes, I am saying that too much. And what's worst... WHY THE HELL DID VAMPIRES LOOKED LIKE THAT? Like some freaking crystal. Wolves looked like Lotso in Toy Story 3, but I have to admit the fights were really great. <br/><br/>Anyway, it's not worth it. I guess those books aren't meant to be good movies. <br/><br/>Oh! I almost forgot! The worst part of it ALL? (Yes, there's something worst) WAS THE FANS! God! I wanted to kill them more than I wanted to kill Bella! And THAT is saying something. I have 16 years old and definitely read some other books. They don't have a clue of what ""adaptation"" means (neither the people who work in this, I guess). At one point I was about to throw my shoe to her face, but I contained myself.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you're seeing a movie you want to WATCH, then WATCH IT and shut up."

","first things first you will b disappointed whether you have read the novel or not,its better if you have not because it will make you feel more sorry for the classic novel,the third in installment of the twilight saga,but don't give second thoughts to reading the book if you are judging it by the movie,well the movie is too rushed for the first thing and I thought they will utilise the time to showcase the battle in an epic manner, I was really looking forward to it but mostly dud.Plot has been twisted everywhere ,seems like they were keen on ripping the soul out of the terrific plot the novel offers,the crucial points in the plot like Bella finally figuring out Victoria's involvement were all dealt with so casually like they were not even in the plot,and I cant even guess why's Riley given so much screen time when not required and his role all cut in the fight,man where was Seth ripping him in parts.Even the dialogs were pathetic leading to all the wrong conclusions.Quileute legend,Rose's story and Jasper's telling of the newborns's enemies were really the worst part.Seems like there was no plot at all,even background scores were not as gud as previous ones.So why would you go watch it,well for all the beautiful males and females,Esme is stunning ,Rosalie somewhat down,Jasper was more beautiful in previous movies without the new hairdo,chemistry between Edward and Bella is something you can look fwd to,Carlisle n Jake are again very good at what they do,Jane's screen tym cud have been easily edited without affecting plot.well what I would recommend is that if you r a Twilight-hard fan nothing will stop you from going for it but you will be very much disappointed n well for others its very much avoidable,hope breaking dawn has have some luck with justice to it"
"helmutty","6","5","11","3 July 2010"," Better than the first two but...
","...still not quite good. This is better because it has intense battle scenes and epic music and faster pace but the still has the same lovely-dovely talk which drags. The CGI has definitely improved too. But all the lovely-dovely talk bring down the whole movie. All the talk between Bella and Edward seem like they are going on forever, they seem like they will never end. I could be annoyed too with Bella's decision of who to choose.<br/><br/>The story: It takes place after New Moon, which almost put me into sleep, and Bella is still indecisive the love between Jacob and Edward. Blah, blah, cue to the boring talk between them that go on forever. The new-born vampires are going to attack Bella? I was sleepy from the boring talk that I did not really know what the new-born vampires want. Okay, then there are two major action scenes which are short. Even the climax is disappointing. I mean, it is like what the heck do they need to practise for? I am actually surprised at the pace of this though it is faster than New Moon. I have seen David Slade's 30 Days of Night and I have enjoyed its grittiness and suspense. But in this, he chose melodramatic lines that go on forever and drag the plot down. I would say Howard Shore did a good job for composing. The other two movies' music are nothing.<br/><br/>Overall: This will be definitely be popular for the females who ogle at Edward or Jacob's six packs. Other than that, I don't know why someone touts it as the movie event of the year! I rather want to see that line on the Inception's poster."

"cookiemom1979","5","9","24","30 June 2010"," Parents Beware - Moral Issue
","I wish I had known about the moral issue in this movie before taking my 12 year old daughter to see it. The movie is rated PG-13 for ""some sensuality"". Well, there was sensuality in the last two movies, but in this movie, Bella is trying to take off Edward's clothes and lose her virginity. What makes this even worse is that she just had a discussion with her father, who was concerned about she and Edward being ""careful"". She is annoyed by this conversation and leaves the room stating she is a virgin. Next thing we know, she is at Edward's house, in his bedroom, trying to change that status. While Edward tells her he wants to wait until they are married, she tries to manipulate him into giving in. He appears to be giving in, (as I leaned over to cover my daughter's eyes), but then stops and tells her they must wait. Sadly this movie seems more about teen lust than teen love. And it hurts the moral community of this issue. With respect to the actors, the scene should have been left on the editing floor."
"fearless11","6","8","21","1 July 2010"," The work of the director, plus the actors and the presence of the author got to the making of a great film
","In my opinion, the book of the film is my least favorite. I don't like that much seeing the love triangle. But the movie is a lot better than I expected. Xavier Samuel did an amazing job with Riley. He has future. I think actors have been getting better from film to film and this one just arrived at the top. Robert Pattinson evolved a lot from Twilight to now and he did one so great job that when I was looking at the screen I couldn't even see Robert, I only saw Edward Cullen. Obviously, makeup and special effects were better too, but the wolves! Oh my god, if they weren't much better! This wasn't any Avatar, clearly, but from what David Slade could do with the book... That director did an amazing job. I think he will win some kind of award some day for a film he will have directed. He really knows how things should work. What to put in the film, what to cut from the book even with the screenwriter having to do some of that work. That was an explendid movie. Blew my mind up from what I was expecting, really. David Slade has much more of a brain than Catherine Hardwicke or Chris Weitz have... And the thing is that Stephenie Meyer actually was present at the shoots most of the time, so I guess that was as important as the director's vision. But really, better than ever!"

He was finally able to portray some different emotions. He actually smiled and had a sense of humor! Kristin Stewart did a fantastic job of showing the transformation of Bella from an unsure, scared little girl to the beautiful self-confident women she has become now that she is sure of herself.

You feel like a teen again when you are inside this universe. Thumbs up for the makeup this time to. They really did a good job. The only negative thing to say, is that ""new"" Victoria isn't looking bad enough.. It's a crime to change actors, even when necessary.

"sherryfundin-14147","10","1","1","15 January 2020"," Hit all the buttons for me...
","This review is for the entire saga.<br/><br/>From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.<br/><br/>Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...<br/><br/>Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.<br/><br/>I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.<br/><br/>Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!<br/><br/>My favorite quote:<br/><br/>""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a stupid lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a sick masochistic lion.""<br/><br/>Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.<br/><br/>BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too, so be on the lookout for those reviews."
"pokemon_trainer_lucas","7","1","1","23 June 2019"," Better than the last one, but just as lame, and still aimed at teens
","This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was a teen when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 9/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!<br/><br/>The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers."

","It's the third movie in the Twilight series. Bella Swan is completely in love with Edward Cullen. Jacob Black is not happy and still wants Bella. Seattle is hit with mysterious murders. Victoria has an army of newborn vampires. The Cullens and the Werewolves have to join forces to battle the vampire army.<br/><br/>The love triangle is in its last gasp and it does it in good style. The vampire army is a good addition. Overall, this is an improvement over the second movie. There is an approaching danger and a climatic battle. The romance is good. The human characters are essentially sidelined at this point. It's not a cinematic masterpiece but it's watchable even for non-fans."

","OK so to start off with yes i am a die hard twilight fan i've read all the books countless times and watched the previous two movies over and over and i loved eclipse!! it was by far my favourite so far! Out of the 3 movies Eclipse kept to the novel the best. There were lots of direct lines from the book that was kept in the movie which i thought was great! how the movie has gotten 3.4 (atm) on IMDb i have no idea, if you don't like the twilight franchise then why do you go watch it? or go on about how rubbish it was? we all know that twilight has a specific audience so let us that love it love it! I thought the new characters were excellent Riley was perfect! loved him! the expanding wolf pack was great and the flashbacks of Jasper and Rosalie's lives were great! cinematography i thought was fantastic! its all filmed so beautifully! The Bella/Jacob 2nd kiss on top of the mountain my heart actually skipped a beat! absolutely beautiful! For those saying the storyline was weak....well newsflash people the books are about Bella/Edward/Jacob! For twi-hard fans i think its clear that you are going to love it! everything was improved from last time and much more original dialogue was kept which was great :) Well done David Slade! I loved it! and cannot wait for Breaking Dawn :)"
"mmvw56","8","7","18","1 July 2010"," Best one yet
","This is a very entertaining movie. I'm a fan of the books and previous movies even with their flaws. It's not perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they did this one.<br/><br/>Fans might pick the little details apart, and believe me, I'm aware of them, but overall I think everyone did a great job. Some things from the leaked script were left out that might have made things a little clearer and convey more emotion.<br/><br/>I think Robert did a great job with Edward in this one. His devotion to her is completely believable, but I would like to see Kristen display more affection with him in the movie though - at times I was wondering what Edward sees in her. Breaking Dawn is supposed to be the culmination of their love, and I want her to work on showing some tears of joy and adoration in that one! <br/><br/>I recommend this movie even to people who have not read the books. David Slade did a great job - and even Melissa Rosenberg can be commended for sticking closer to the book and fans can appreciate the many book quotes included!"
"tarynhamburger","5","7","18","30 June 2010"," How do they get away with this?
","My guess is that the book series is just so popular that the production company thinks that they can get away with making poor films. They shouldn't! I thought it was slow, boring, and the acting was just God-awful. The only saving grace was Taylor Lautner's ever improving smoking hot body, and the fact that for once Kristen Stewart finally looked pretty for once.<br/><br/>It was better than New Moon; I will give it that. But other than that, it was just so lackluster that there is barely anything else to be said but that. A huge disappointment. The only way that you will like this movie is if you are already a die-hard Twilight fan. If you're not, don't go into it expecting to become one -- it just won't happen."
"kga4563547","7","6","15","30 June 2010"," Disappointed favorite part left out
","I thought it was a good movie, just very disappointed my favorite scene where Alice held Bella ""hostage"" was not included. I think it should have been in there. That part of the book had humor and passion. Alice got the car as payoff and then Bella called Edward and was angry and forgave him very easily when he got home and the scene that followed would have been great where Bella ""got the wrong impression."" I just think the scenes were too rushed and cut off. I understand they couldn't put everything in the book in, but it was just very ""choppy"" with several of the scenes. But overall, I did really enjoy the movie and I think all of the actors were great."
"whatever_123","5","8","22","1 July 2010"," The best one so far... still flawed.
","Unfortunately, I saw this movie when I started getting over my Twilight obsession that started when I was fourteen. The weird thing about the Twilight movies is that they get better, but not by much.<br/><br/>This movie had a darker tone to it, and that was good. The scenes that show Riley, the newborn vampire, wandering the streets and murdering people or turning them into vampires were pretty cool.<br/><br/>Also, I was glad to see that the two most overlooked characters, Jasper and Rosalie, got to have their shining moments in this movie. Like the book, the movie included their stories of their transformations from human to vampire. What really impressed me was that Jasper, until now, has been a really creepy and awkward character, and we got to see another side of him. He mentions to Bella the time he first met Alice, and actually looked... like he had feelings.<br/><br/>Now the bad things in this movie were almost the same as the last two films: Edward and Bella's ""chemistry"", Jacob and Bella's ""chemistry"", Kristen Stewart's acting. Edward and Bella have no reason to be together. Jacob has no reason to love Bella. Bella has no personality, and being a weak human, could be killed by Edward easily. What does she have to offer? Pointless drama. Kristen Stewart, as infuriating as it is, still sees no reason to work on her acting. It is still awful.<br/><br/>What also annoyed me was the message the movie sent to the teenage girls out there; that you should just hang back, and let your boyfriend do all the fighting for you, and that you don't need to stand on you're own two feet. You're boyfriend will do that for you! <br/><br/>One more thing, I did not like the new Victoria at all. Victoria is supposed to be a menace. A vicious, merciless, vengeful, unstoppable, bloodthirsty menace. The new Vicotria fell WAAY short of what she was supposed to be. She ran away from everything, she had this terrified expression on her face almost the whole time! The way Edward ripped her head off looked totally fake. It was too funny. People in the theater, die-hard Twilight fans, actually burst out laughing! <br/><br/>This movie was a step up from New Moon as New Moon was a step up from Twilight, but at the same time, it really isn't enjoyable unless you are a naive and immature twelve-to-thirteen year old girl."
"iswearimnormal","7","8","22","30 June 2010"," Definitely the best one!
","It's amazing what a good director can do, such as David Slade who directed the third of the Twilight installments. This movie makes me wonder why Catherine Hardwick, who directed the first, was even allowed to be within a 5-mile radius of a camera. Which is a complete shame, because I loved Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was everything and more compared to the first one. However, it was by no means perfect, I had a real problem with the screen writing and some of the editing. That being said, it's not like the screenwriter had good material to work with. There was some points in the movie when I felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela (soap opera). Through it was less cringe-worthy to watch compared to Twilight. I felt that there was not enough built-up to the ""big"" fight scene, and now that I think of it there was not enough follow-through either. My only issue with the editing was the few ""choppy"" transitions. I was also disappointed that there was not more Anna Kendrick or Billy Burke scenes. On a lighter note, the acting has improved significantly. There was hardly any eye-twitching and lip biting from Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson looked less constipated, and Taylor Launter did not have a voice crack. Also, in a few scenes it actually appeared for once that Edward and Bella are happy together, I believe I saw Edward smile for the first time. So overall I actually enjoyed this movie."

","Let me first start off by saying I was brought into this by my 11 year old daughter. The only problem I have with these movies is it is so difficult to bring the intensity of the books to the big screen. That being said, finally Eclipse manages to get something right. This was by far the best one yet. I was very impressed with Robert Pattinson's acting in this one - he seemed to have more substance (as Edward) in this movie. He was finally able to portray some different emotions, instead of his usual brooding all the time. He actually smiled and had a sense of humor!! Kristin Stewart did a fantastic job of showing the transformation of Bella from an unsure, scared little girl to the beautiful self-confident women she has become now that she is sure of herself. Love, love, love Billy Burke - he's just great! The only complaint I have is I wish more time would have been spent on Jasper's back story....would have liked to see more of him in his confederate uniform!!!!"
"lantis7","8","8","22","30 June 2010"," Eclipse-the human side
","Although I have not read any of the Twilight books, from a movie standpoint, this sequel was made with a bit more finesse then the last two predecessors. Although it was necessary to convey the love triangle conflict, there were times when this was so apparent and obvious, that it wasn't necessary to have Bella repeatedly continue her serious dialogue between Jake and Edward. We know how she feels, although who kisses a man in front of her man after she just agrees to marry her man? ...and who tells someone that they love someone more?..Ouch!...At times these awkward scenes became humorous for the audience which was perhaps a relief of the ongoing ,serious, bland, predictable, triangular love dialogue. And speaking of humor, what was that tent scene all about?Did we really need to get a glimpse of Jake's slutty side and didn't he have some fighting to do instead of warming up his dream girl? Make a fire or grab a few more blankets Edward! Overall, typical Twilight style with a touch of deeper detail, effects and human relating dialogue."
"blacklist-1","7","5","12","5 July 2010"," An astonishing achievement for the Twilight film series! A very enjoyable addition to it!
","My goodness! I never thought I would be saying this! But I actually really enjoyed Eclispe! This coming from a guy years ago who couldn't stand the first one! I saw the second New Moon at university because lots of friends who were girls beg me to see it with them at the film society and I mildly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Since writing the review for New Moon. I have taken to reading the books. I wanted to partly see if it was just the making of the two films that was the problem of why they were bad or that the books were the cause, well it was the films. The books are immensely enjoyable, the best for me being Breaking Dawn. In the books the chemistry between Edward and Bella is there, but that has been missing completely from the movies. And even Bella's happiness of smiling and laughing in the book was never apparent in either film.<br/><br/>I think since New Moon, the new director David Slade has made huge improvements and he has to be commended. The first of the improvements which I have been hoping for was improvement in the acting of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as Bella and Edward because in Twilight and New Moon they couldn't act. They mumbled there lines, sounded dull and bored with zip chemistry between them. But I'm amazed and very pleased to say, their acting has improved! Kristen has come the furthest. She had injected more emotion into her voice when delivering her lines and I can for the first time actually believe she cares about Edward. She also smiled and laughed! Something else that has been missing from the films that were apparent in the first two books. There were times where Stewart did fall flat of delivering her lines as her acting was still very bad in places, but she has improved and has at least stopped along with Pattinson the annoying habit of pausing before finishing a sentence, which brings me on to Pattinson. He has become better in his acting too. The anguish he felt at certain points in the film where Bella is in danger was clear and it made me feel sorry for him. Also the argument between him and Jacob was tense. He still delivers a lots of his lines deadpanned, but there were instances like Stewart where he injected more believability into his role.<br/><br/>What has also helped these two actors more is the scriptwriters. The dialogue is even less cheesy than New Moon (though there were still parts that were) and thankfully as mentioned flows naturally without any awkward pauses. Furthermore for the first time there was actually romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward, something that had been seriously lacking and had been desperately needed in the last two movies. When they are kissing in the meadow or Edward's bed. The chemistry was electric, which was something I wasn't expecting. Slade wisely uses extreme close up shots to show this.<br/><br/>Other parts of the film like the special effects were stunning as the other actors and actresses like Taylor Lautner who plays Jacob, like Xavier Samuel as Riley or Bryce Howard as Victoria did well in their supporting roles. The action sequences and there was more that made me like it even more was choreographed superbly, the scenery was stunning, the music was also nice, there were some good moments of comedy like when Jacob kisses Bella and she punches him in the nose and gets a broken hand for it was funny and I also liked the story more than the others. In terms of relating it to the books I have to say David Slade did a great job keeping in the essence of the story going (considering I thought Eclispe was the weakest book) even though scenes were cut out. Normally like the majority of others on IMDb I would severely criticise this film, but I cannot accommodate them this time. I agree with the few on here who have given this a higher rating. Improvements still need to be made particularly with Stewart and Pattinson, but they should be proud of themselves for doing better and I am glad there acting is improving along with some great chemistry with the characters. David Slade has made the franchise come in leaps and bounds and has to be commended for a terrific achievement. I look forward to Breaking Dawn with high hopes it will be even better. My expectations for the franchise has just been raised. I recommend Eclispe as a great summer film. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Hollywoodrulez","10","7","19","1 July 2010"," The best so far
","For the life of me I'll never understand how people cannot like a film like twilight. I'll admit the first one failed to impress me and if you've read my reviews you would know that it isn't very hard to impress me with films. Eclipse takes this saga to a whole new level of whoop ass. There is far more action and intensity in each performance and some quality camera work as well. The cinematography is well done as the light varies throughout the film nicely with each scene and it's mood. When there's romance it's bright and colorful when there is horror it's dark and creepy. The directing is also better in this film then it is in the other 2. It's worth a look at and comes recommended."

","I am a HUGE fan of the books, and have literally lost count of how many times I have read the series. ""Eclipse"" must prove that third times the charm, because it is the best film in the ""saga"" so far- hands down. David Slade did an excellent job bringing this story to the screen, and Melissa Rosenberg's script is the strongest by far. She finally brought the humor to the script that is rampant in the books. However, it's important for anyone going to see the film to remember that it is NOT the book. By now, people should understand what ""based on the book"" means. Hello Harry Potter! <br/><br/>But, the humor is FINALLY there, the romance is abundant, the music is fabulous and the visuals are stunning. I have seen it twice now, and can't wait to get back for a third time (hopefully tomorrow). This fantasy love story is true escapism at it's best!"

I think there are those who always complain about story content they should remember Stephanie wrote these books for teens so get over it already, i am not a teen but a 44 mum of 2teens and i am more addicted than they ever will be ..... bring on Breaking Dawn I will be going to the cinema many times to watch this one !!!"

","If your a Twi-hard then your good to go. The starting of the movie was a bit much and a little bit slow but it did pick up. Lets be honest, we Aren't WATCHING FOR Realism. We love the characters regardless of how UNREAL the situations must be. People who don't like this movie, probably went into it with a closed mind and didn't like the idea of the movie to begin with. The acting has gotten better from all the actors although it seems that the awkward moments just keep increasing with each movie. WARNING: The drama level has increased!!! so much more dramatic...not sure if thats a good thing or not... The movie stuck to the book and was fun to watch. If you liked the first one and enjoyed the second one even more then you will definitely love the third one. For those who love Jasper and Rosalie then you will really enjoy this movie. They did great background on both of them which allowed their to be further character development."
"rapagliaro","10","4","9","14 January 2012"," I simply love this movie!!!!
","I read a lot of the other reviews about this movie and i think people are being too judgmental and harsh. Guys seem to not like the fact that Edward(the vampire) sparkles, well this isn't an action movie, it's a romance,so to me vampires sparkling in the sunlight was a great choice. You really feel the emotional impact Edward and Jacob(the werewolf) have on Bella, and her dilemma on who she wants to be with. You have Edward, who is romantic and sweet, but being with him will mean she will have to become a vampire and leave her family. And you have Jacob, the warm, loving guy who can give her a life where she can still be with her family, but she doesn't love him as much as she loves Edward. There is just a lot of emotional scenes in the movie and it is so warming to watch! And guys, when you see this movie, it isn't ACTION, it is ROMANCE,there isn't a lot of fighting scenes and the movie isn't like the old vampire movies. I am not degrading old vampire movies, i love them, but i love this movie as well. I don't expect most guys to like it or understand this movie, and i know guys aren't going to act this way in real life( wouldn't want them to, it would be over dramatic in real life) but maybe you should think about being a little bit more emotional and romantic. But to me, the movie is very heart-warming and sweet. In Eclipse, Jacob and Edward are still fighting over Bella, but they put their differences aside to help Bella out, since she is in danger, and Edward and Jacob seem to have a small friendship building up. I also enjoyed the movie because it had more action than the first two movies and had another plot to it other than Jacob and Edward wanting Bella. I loved the ending, where the Cullen Clan was fighting the young vampires! Edward's ring that he gives to Bella was so stunning, and it makes you excited to see the next movie, when they get married. A lot of people have criticized this movie, but I enjoyed every moment of watching it. I am a big Twilight fan and this was the best movie so far. Most guys won't like this movie since it isn't an action movie,but I recommend that every girl should watch this movie. Some girls don't like the movie either, however, but I highly recommend watching it! I love Eclipse and I can't wait to see the next two movies for Book 4! Will be sad when the series is over!"

"Matt_Layden","5","3","6","3 August 2011"," The best ""Twilight"" film
","That's not saying much though, cause the film still lacks a lot of qualities that would deem a film enjoyable. They are pumping these films out like it's nobodies business and unfortunately they are making boatloads of cash. New Moon, the worst of the three, was misguided and had no interesting conflict, other than who Bella should date. Finally the series gives the viewers a showdown of violence as the ""vampires"" and shape-shifters take on a new army of ""vampires"". <br/><br/>There is a quote on the internet that best describes my feelings towards the series and it compares it to the other mega cash cow Harry Potter. ""Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity. Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend."" Now, despite what you may think, I don't hate the series. If I did I wouldn't watch them and flame Twilight messageboards. Instead I go in with an open mind. Yet for some reason the series continues to impress me with how lazy and boring it is.<br/><br/>I sit here wondering though, what could possibly happen in the next two films. I get the fact that they get married and have a kid, but it seems like a epilogue that is going to be stretched out way too long. The immediate conflict with Victoria is solved. So unless some kind of Volturi stuff happens (most likely), are two more films really necessary? The answer is no. They took a page right out of Harry Potter's book and decided to split the last film in two so they could make twice as much money. The young girls still flock to see a shirtless cry complain about wanting to be with a girl and a moody guy who no one understand but her. In real life do young girls have to choose between such an incredibly shallow pair of boys? <br/><br/>Eclipse happens to have the best fight sequences and dialogue that doesn't suck. The characters finally seem comfortable in their roles, despite still not reaching what I would call, quality acting. Kristen Bell herself, for whatever reason, looks totally different in this film than the previous one. Not a complaint, just something I noticed. She still lacks the strength (if there were any to begin with) the character so desperately needs to be interesting. These characters don't really seem to change. They have been saying the same stuff in every single film. Jacob cries because he wants to be with Bella. Edward wants to be with Bella, but doesn't want her to become a ""vampire"". Bella still wants to leave any career aspirations at home, along with her friends and family and kill herself to be with a boy. <br/><br/>The most interesting scene in the whole film is when Jacob and Edward finally sit down to talk one on one without Bella interrupting. Could this be a sign of maturity?"
"sledgehammertime","6","3","6","27 July 2010"," better than average, but only just
","For someone who had not read any of the books and only actually seen the first movie, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the film. The visuals are spot on - capturing nature at its very bleakest which sort of gave the two 'tribes' (vamps/wolves) a very good setting for the story to be told upon. The improvement in directing from the first film is VERY apparent (the first film was a complete shambles). However, rather disappointingly, the central three characters are just not up to the task of portraying this story to its full effect. Its frustrating to watch at times, as you often find yourself thinking that key moments involving the main cast just weren't acted well enough for their full effect, and non-key moments involving the supporting cast were acted extremely well! A couple of the computer effects are a little cringe-worthy here too and could have easily been left out (the vamp running through the forest scenes etc).<br/><br/>In summary, for a non twi-hard fan or whatever they are being called nowadays, this movie was definitely worth seeing on the big screen, but is trying to tell an epic tale rather averagely; the worst part is, you can tell there should be more!! Annoying :("
"LazySod","6","3","6","26 July 2010"," Too slow at the start
","Continuing where the 2nd film ends this one tells the third stage of Bella's choice making process. She's still tossing and turning between Edward and Jacob, and that is starting to make less and less sense to the people watching the films but not reading the books (like me). Still, the story goes on. And, since it continues where the previous one left off, this one makes no sense when watched on its own.<br/><br/>The film then. It starts slowly with the normal twisting and turning of the days - normal when you consider your boyfriend is a vampire and another friend you care about is a werewolf. All is well in the world, but there's something brewing just a few cities away. It looks like the start of something nasty, something that will have to be dealt with and that seems to be too big for the Cullen clan to handle on their own.<br/><br/>This story is one of the two red lines through the film - the other one is the obvious love triangle between Bella and the two guys and convoluted as that one might seem it still isn't enough to fill the first half of the film - it's just too slow with too many long stretches of nothingness. The 2nd half the film picks up speed and becomes quite all right, but it doesn't make the film as a whole work out. It's not enough, even though it's enjoyable (if you're very bored).<br/><br/>6 out of 10 sparkling vampires"

","OK.. First the love story was not downplayed. Second I think clotheslining someone at a 100mph where their head explodes and breaks off is pretty damn cool!!! Keep in mind that they could not get to close to the newborns as they were much stronger proved when Jacob got hurt. How else can u fight them if u can not go head to head and win. SURPRISE AND UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR! That is how! I rate this movie a 10 even though I didn't want to go see it I still went and watched it and I am glad I did. I found it amazingly good. Especially when Jacob had to cuddle Bella right in front of Edward and he had to let it happen to save her.. I mean come on who couldn't get behind that LOL!!!! I think if u have not seen this movie by the way sorry for the spoilers trying to make a point.. You should go this very second to the local theater and see it. I was even able to drown out the girlie giggles behind me every time Jacob showed up without his shirt on. That is how good it is.. And most of the bad comments are from ppl who read the books. Yes stuff is cut out but they can't take an entire book and make it into 4 movies.. It would take for every for each installment. I think they did it justice they have some really good stuff in this movie that makes it as shinny as the vampires lol!!!! BTW not deathtoll is his wife lol he made me write that.. LOL"

","I disagree with the people who said that the movie was poorly plotted. Darlings read the BOOK. They have the same plot, it is easy to understand. The plot was simple, yet fascinating. The acting was quite well executed, the only person I didn't in the movie was Bryce Dallas Howard (I am sorry if I offend you, this is just from my perspective). I didn't think it was a good idea to replace Rachelle Lefevre. It ruins the linked emotion from Victoria to James. But all in all the new Victoria is okay. My favourite scene was of course the fighting scene and the Training scene. It was so fun to watch. Oh and Jessica's graduation speech was simply inspiring. The meanings of the speech was to make mistakes and learn from it and take it with you when you move from another decision because nothing is permanent. If you don't like the books and the other 2 movies don't watch it. If you do like the books and the movies like me!!! (If u do, I luv u) watch it. It is a fascinating movie. Can't wait for Breaking Dawn. I read all the books more than 50x each (unlike people who exaggerate, I'm not joking. I loved the book that much I just kept repeating the books that I lost count of how much times I read the books) I have high expectations of Breaking Dawn part 1 & 2 but I am sure it will exceed my expectations even though I am a little hard to please. Love This movie soo much.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't hate me because I love the movie and you hate it. Hate me if you actually know who I am as a person and you just don't like me."

This is the first film that I have enjoyed more than the films before it. I'm a little bias of course because I am a fan of the Twilight series, granted as with every film - the novels are always better, than again they can go into a lot more detail.<br/><br/>David Slade has done a brilliant job on his part and I do hope he is given credit for his work on this film because I truly feel that he deserves it. To be honest this film has a little slice of everything, drama, humor, romance and action.<br/><br/>It is clear to me that the actors and actresses have matured in their line of work for this film. I found them far more convincing and to have much more chemistry than in the previous two films. Kudos to them for helping bring this saga from it's infancy to a fruit, ripe and ready to pick.<br/><br/>I do hope this film receives the notoriety that I feel it deserves, as well as everyone who was on board. Thank you all for delivering this wonderful film. Overall I give it a 10, and I would give more if I could.

"paulispinel","8","6","16","2 July 2010"," It was pretty good. Better than I expected. I'm a fan of the books too, btw.
","So, I can see why this movie can be so hated, (don't know why I stared like this) but there are also people who loves it, like me, and actually, I think that in part is because all the attention and fame that the Twilight series have been gaining since the first MOVIE. <br/><br/>To talk about this movie, you should talk about Twilight and New Moon. It doesn't really matters if you haven't read the books. Me, as a fan of the books, and i had read Twilight before the movie, and i already have read all the 4, I liked Twilight. It was very similar to the book, adding some things and getting rid of some others. I've watched Twilight about 5 times, not recently, and it was good to see it, it wasn't actually boring. New Moon. When I first saw it, I thought it was better than Twilight, but when I saw it for the second time I was kinda bored, and not only because I am ""Team Edward"", actually I don't know what happened the second time I saw it, it was weird. It was slow, and I love slow movies, but sometimes i just cant help it.<br/><br/>Eclipse. Summary: Way better than I expected. Will see it again. I have to say that I wasn't so excited with the release of the movie, like I was with Twilight or New Moon. And you know, i went to the premiere here in my city of Twilight and New Moon. There was a pre-sale of tickets for New Moon, and I bought them, and now there was also pre-sale for Eclipse, but i didn't even mind about that, and I thought it was better to see it later. Maybe it was ""fate"", but a friend won a ticket for the pre-premiere here at midnight, and I just arrived my home. I went on my own, and I think that it was even better. I left the theater satisfied and happy. The only bad thing, was that the movie is dubbed in my language, Spanish, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. The good about this movie, is that it shows and tells the necessary. It may not be in chronological order, some things, but it shows that, that 's what matters. I think the actuation was pretty good, and I could actually get into the movie since the first scene. <br/><br/>David Slade did a good job with this one, didn't disappoint me. My favorite of these movies so far, and is also my favorite book. It has action, romance, some drama. It may be predictable, but you can enjoy it. The only things i didn't like, was the black Volvo, which i don't know why the hell Chris weitz changed in New Moon, and how the didn't make the last scene how was supposed to be, with the POV of Jacob. It would have taken just a few minutes, and the people who hasn't read the books could understand better. But I knew what happened and what is going to happen, so i really liked the end.<br/><br/>I don't care that this movie has 3 stars here, and, i guess that all the newspapers and magazines will write bad reviews, and the ""haters"" could hate it even more. And I think I can understand that, because i personally think that it has more attention than necessary, and because is not your conventional vampire movie. Not the typical bloody and horror one. And I can understand vampire lovers, because they may think that is lame what Stephenie has done to the vampires... ""oh yeah, he fell in love to death with a human"" and ""hey, the glow with the sun light"". I'm still young, and probably don't know much about that, about the real vampire myths and all that, but I think that is good to change the rules sometimes. And I'm also so corny sometimes, and the series have waken up that part of me, and I would have never believed that I could read books! LOL yeah, i didn't like to read so much, but with the series was different. <br/><br/>If you expect to see the best movie, the best actuations, the movie that can be nominated for the Oscars, don't go with such high expectations. It goes also for the twilight fanatics. Its a good movie, but not the best. If you don't like the series, books or movies,have hated twilight since forever and you have a bad feeling about going to see Eclipse, then don't go. Don't know why would you want to waste time/money and ""torture"" yourself. But maybe if you want to give it a chance, and you want to have a good time, you should go. And for the lovers of the series, like me, I'm sure that you'll enjoy it, and some others will love it. The best movie ever? Hell no!! I can say that, but I don't expected these movies to be that way. I see the movies just like and adaptation of a really good books, and they're enjoyables. Best movie of the series? For me, its the best of the series so far.<br/><br/>Well, that's MY opinion, and the opinions are more than the stars, so if you love it or hate it, or enjoy, is okay for me :) As long as we don't ""discriminate"" people who doesn't share our opinion. Its just a movie at all! <br/><br/>8/10"
"simonwest80","7","6","16","1 July 2010"," Much much better than the 1st two - so thats almost a good film!!
","OK first off I hate the whole Twilight thing - every single little piece about it. I don't know why everyone likes its. Don't understand why people read the books (they are terrible, predictable and badly written) etc etc etc. I have however been dragged to the first 2 movies which I hated with a passion because if you hadn't read the books the movies make no real sense.<br/><br/>And boy was I looking forward to Eclipse....................<br/><br/>After the first 2 movies I had put in certain precautions with the wife to make this a win win situation.......... ;) Anyways, I sat down, and started watching.......someone randomly gets attacked by fast moving attacker and is left to die......OK that was pretty cool for a change Then we have the mountain side fly by I look at my watch 00:12. Christ this is gonna be a loooooooooong film. And we get straight into the looooooong dialogues I look at my watch after what feels like 20minutes 00:14 oh dear god..........<br/><br/>**SHOCK** Hold on what happened........I just laughed at something someone said?!?! No that cant be right. Hold on was that an actual different facial expression from Kristen Stewart. So in the first 20minutes i had seen 2 things I hadnt previously seen, acting and someone making the script bearable! The next couple of hours then play out to, compared with the rest, a pretty good film. If you can excuse the poor dialogue pulled straight from the book the action and movie itself is really good. I was able to follow everything without needing my wife to interpret things that were missed from the book. The characters felt far more alive (excuse the pun) and had personality. The acting was 100x better. Again, if you can excuse the corny dialogues this is a good film. If they took out 90% of the kissing scenes (most were irrelevant to story or plot) and spent more time writing the script rather than pulling chunks out the book this would have actually been a REALLY good movie. Instead you feel embarrassed by the long kissing scenes and groan at some of the tacky script.<br/><br/>But big thumbs up from a Twilight hater - we actually had a watchable movie from the franchise. This, however, is probably too little too late as seen by most the reviews here peoples judgement is clouded or they just didn't bother after the 2 first disaster films"
"kschildhouse","8","6","16","1 July 2010"," Best of the series...so far
","It's quite simple, if you're a fan of the book then you'll be a fan of the movie. I was actually surprised that the acting has improved greatly. At times there were some awkward moments but nothing that distracted from the movie as a whole. There was nothing left out in this adaptation. Books adapted to movies always go through rewrites and subtle changes. I've struggled with the enormous omissions in the Harry Potter series. I can't say the same for the Twilight movies. They, in my opinion, have done a great job staying true to the storyline and have managed to translate that book into a popular movie series. And while I know that this is a tween movie and that many people love to leave their negative comments, I say only this. It's for ENTERTAINMENT, it's not meant to be an Academy Award winning movie. If I had to choose between Eclipse and The Hurtlocker, I would choose Eclipse any day of the week and twice on Sunday."
"mackinley735","10","7","20","30 June 2010"," Best One Yet! Blew My Mind...In A Good Way!
","I went to the midnight showing, and all I can say is...WOW! I have read all of the books, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who was disappointed by the first Twilight movie. New Moon was a HUGE improvement and exceeded all my expectations! Since there was a new director for Eclipse and I'd never seen any of his work, I tried to keep my expectations low. It was hard, especially since this was my favorite book in the saga. But after I saw it, I had become David Slade's newest fan! This movie was definitely the best! Slade really captured the dark side of this incredible, beloved story while at the same time revolved it mostly around the love triangle. Robert Pattinson (Edward) was amazing. In my opinion, he did the best job of acting out of anyone. Taylor Lautner (Jacob) was very funny. The only two things I had problems with were Bella punching Jacob and Seth's wolf. Neither seemed realistic. But other than that, I think it was an excellent adaption of an excellent book. It was romantic, intense, comedic, scary, and most of all, amazing! Big props to Melissa Rosenburg! And might I add that Howard Shore's compositions really touched the heart and captured the mood. I highly recommend it for all Twilight fans. This book is so important to us, and the people working on the movie carry a large burden, so I'm ecstatic that they managed to follow the book written by the wonderful Stephenie Meyer! And for all you crazy, obsessive fans like me who are reading this, wear your adult diapers because the flashback scenes and the proposal scene are going to make you pee yourself! Not literally, but they are amazing! Thank you so much to all of the people who worked on this wonderful film! Definitely the best...so far! I can't wait until Breaking Dawn! 10 stars! Amazing, awesome, fantastic, and ROMANTIC! Just plain wonderful!"
"drama92","6","7","20","30 June 2010"," Thanks David Slade.
","Compared to Twilight and New Moon, Eclipse was GREAT! I know its very predictable and slow moving but it was first a book and what more can you expect? (its not harry potter.) I thought The acting between Rob and Kristen was much more relaxed and natural. The kissing scenes didn't sound like they were in pain either which is a big step. I was also pleased with the content in the movie...I don't think they left out anything what was crucial to the plot of the future movies or that just really need to be in there. One thing I was disappointed in was the Rosalie told her story. In the book she takes the initiative and goes to Bella and explains that she doesn't hate but just doesn't understand her desire to be frozen in time. It was okay I suppose but they also could have shown a bit more of her story too, being that is thee only time she gets to be known in the books/ movies. But overall I thought David did a wonderful job."

","Ignore most of the reviews that have given this film a 1 as the majority of them are Twilight haters but for some reason beyond me, they still pay to go to the cinema to see the movies! Do not get me wrong, I am not going to sit here and tell you that this film is a masterpiece and deserves to get endless Oscars, because it doesn't, but being a big Twilight fan it definitely does the job, my boyfriend who is NOT a Twilight fan found it enjoyable too.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment is the graphics for the wolves, a huge downgrade from the outstanding graphics from New Moon, and the way David Slade (who was probably not the best choice of director for this film) chose to show the vampires running at speed is also not done as well as in New Moon, but on the whole I loved this film. It continued to show me the reasons as to why I am without question team Edward, and the most vital details from the book are included. If you are expecting everything in the film to be identical to the book then you will be disappointed, because as with all adaptations this is just not possible, but if you go without this expectation and are a Twilight lover like me you will enjoy every second of it.<br/><br/>Eclispe was by far my favourite book, and I think also my favourite out of the three films. November 2011 and not come soon enough. I will look forward to the new directors approach to which will be, undoubtedly, the most difficult 2 films out of them all!"
"matthewgraygubler_cm","8","5","13","3 July 2010"," Best out of Twilight Saga
","Alright, let me just say that I am a fan of the books. I, however, did not enjoy the adaptations of the first two books. I went into this movie with hesitation. My friends had all said that it was good but I thought it would just be as horrid as the first two films. I was wrong. This film was better filmed than the first two. The special effects aren't quite as cheesy this time around. <br/><br/>The Good: 1) Jackson Rathbone pulls off his portrayal of Jasper amazingly well. He was more of a background character in the first two but given something to work with, Rathbone has exceeded my expectations of Jasper and has quickly become my favorite actor of the whole series.<br/><br/>2) Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and the rest of the Cullen gang (except for Robert Pattinson) return with some amazing performances this time around.<br/><br/>3) I enjoyed the background information on Rosalie and Jasper even if their scenes were cut a bit short. I also enjoyed the fight scene this time around. <br/><br/>4)Bryce Dallas Howard takes over Rachelle Lefevre's spot as Victoria and gives a spectacular performance.<br/><br/>The Bad: 1) The Volturi scenes were a little stiff. Not as great as I had anticipated.<br/><br/>2) Xavier Samuel wasn't that great of a Riley. I really didn't care for his performance.<br/><br/>3) The Wolf Pack didn't do an excellent job but did the best with what they were given.<br/><br/>The Ugly: 1) Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have not done anything to change my opinions about them. Nothing. They give very wooden performances and still don't bring any depth to the characters at all.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the books, you'll enjoy Eclipse, perhaps. I enjoyed it despite my hesitations."

","Hello movie going fans !<br/><br/>If you are considering seeing this movie, look no further than this incredible review :<br/><br/>Great , and expected continuation from last movie; no surprises there and also zero letdowns, as we see the plot unfold and the love triangle evolve very nicely, with a moving and mature moment near the end between script protagonists. Great acting with evolved actors and characters. Great special effects as you can imagine and this one continues to entertain without fail. A romantic action enhanced thrill ride you won't want to miss having seen last 2 movies, and if you are new to the series, make sure you catch up before seeing this one as you wont be disappointed since there is something here for everyone.<br/><br/>I continue to be exceptionally appreciative of overall toned down horror visuals that otherwise could have been extreme and it reminds me a lot of Hitchcocks: 'the birds' which was also rated PG yet easily maintains that 'edge of your seat' theater without resorting to effects that insult the viewers intelligence. It proves we don't need over-the-top-gore to create incredible movie experiences. <br/><br/>I love Jacob's character, regardless that they are all enthralling and I was hoping she would choose him honestly , because I would personally rather see her stay human at the end of this very rich plot, and if you are like me having not read the books, we shall just have to wait to see how things unfold in the last entry in the series.<br/><br/>Highly recommended family viewing for morals portrayed , keeping in mind youngsters because the movie does earn its PG rating although with great class.<br/><br/>Grab your favorite movie going companion and off you go! ;)"

Of course its still a movie that needs lots of work but duh nothing will be as good as the book. But thats the problem, don't compare the movie to the book nothing will EVER EVER be as good as the book. If a director spent his time putting EVERY single detail in the movie, it would be over 2 hours! Granted, it is a girly movie, don't expect typical vampire stories, cause its NOT a vampire movie, get it right, its a ROMANCE. Its supposed to be different. It truly is a good movie.

","Eclipse is my favorite of the books so I was super anxious to see the movie but nervous at the same time that Summit wouldn't do it justice. I went to the midnight showing and I was beyond stoked! They stayed truer to the book then the other two movies. There were times I knew what the actors were going to say before they spoke because of the book. The cinematography was gorgeous. David Slade has an incredible eye and his talent really shined when he successfully made this film a horror film and a love story at the same time! The actors really came together and stepped it up a notch. They all seemed a lot more comfortable with each other and Kristen, Rob and Taylor made me feel like I was in this crazy love triangle with them. The action scenes were more life-like and not too CGI like – compared to the other two movies. I LOVED it and I can't stop thinking about it...going again tonight! I heart Twilight! PS: All the dudes that are giving this movie a bad review because they had to see it with their girlfriend – maybe try to find something healthier to do than to be negative just to be negative? – like, see The Last Airbender or watch World Cup or do something outside? - basically let us TwiFans have our magic you have yours. Thanks. :}"
"r-hatcher321","9","6","17","1 July 2010"," I will return to see it!!
","Loved all of it! Was disappointed when it ended! Kristen's wig was tough at times...but the director compensated by the close ups, catching her lovely features and expressions. The team seemed to get the wig right the majority of the time. Kristen is naturally lovely and refreshing. Taylor stepped up his delivery and seemed deeper in his acting with this installment. It was very nice to have Pattinson in the whole movie! His resolve of unconditional love for Bella is Lessons in class, value, and virtue is nice in this casual sex saturated culture...what a concept! The fight scenes are amazing! They fit within the PG13 setting. It's clear the director was limited in expression there. It was interesting how the vampires were shown to break apart. I thought the throw a match on one of them silly. That should have been better thought out. However, Bryce Howard delivered a great, tho brief, performance. Loved her interactive scene with Edward. Go Bryce! Riley was brilliant. They should def bring Xavier Samuel back for Breaking Dawn perhaps sporting a mustache and curly hair as a different character. He is excellent!"
"jojosylla97","7","6","17","30 June 2010"," Eclipse
","OK don't get me wrong I honestly applaud the movie. I think that Mr. Slade honestly captured the book, in his own amazing way! I frankly am I dead-hard Team Jacob, and i don't think many saw this but what I'm about to say makes more sense if you read the book. How can I say this... I think that Jacob and Bella's relationship, and 'love' for each other that was supposed to be literally exposed in this movie was not up to my expectations ,especially near the ending and both the kisses they shared.<br/><br/>First of all, the first kiss, I think was completely rushed, the second kiss also. I feel like it was just done to get it over with, ""Ok, we kissed! DONE! NEXT SCENE!"" What bugged about the second kiss was how in the book it expressed way more emotion that I really expected to be incorporated into the movie. For this specific scene i really expected him to focus a lot on the books details like how she had that vision about how her life would be with Jacob and two black-haired children running into the 'familiar' forest.<br/><br/>And the final part that really irked me was the ending where Bella visits Jacob in his room with his broken arm (as said in the movie). I didn't like the fact that Jacob didn't even come anywhere close to repeating his famous line: He sighed.""The clouds I can handle. But I can't fight with an eclipse."" Not seeing this in the movie really hit me hard because I personally felt that, that specific line was the whole meaning behind the book. Lastly, what I wasn't a big fan of was how quickly she got over Jacob, in the books, she sobs for days! But I guess I'm just an over enthusiastic Team Jacob fan.;P Overall great movie!!!"
"RedConverse09","6","6","17","30 June 2010"," There Are No Words
","There are no words to describe this movie. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I left the theater wondering how I felt about the movie. It looked like a movie, it acted like a movie, and it felt like a movie, but I was underwhelmed. I was entertained, but not enough to feel like I really loved the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was over-dramatic, as always. The close-ups were irritating. The score was nice. The music is better off on its own. They didn't leave much out. It felt rushed. The flashbacks left me wanting more. Charlie, yet again, has the best lines of the entire movie. The dismembering of the vampires changed, yet again. They've gone from almost human to pottery to glass. The makeup department needs to be fired. Jasper's accent confused me. The fight scenes were all over the place. It was nice to see the ravine chase. The second-to-last scene with Jacob and Bella was awkward. The scene in the book was sad. The scene in the movie was mean. The Jacob-Bella kiss was bad. Really bad. All of the Jacob-Bella scenes were terrible. The contacts keep getting brighter. Edward's eyes were mustard-colored. Bryce pulled off Victoria. None of Bree's story was included. The Quileute legends scene was way too short. The wolf pack had three lines. Bella's hair was messed up the entire time. The graduation scene was okay. The party was strange. The tent scene was exactly what I expected.<br/><br/>It was okay, but not amazing. Could have been way better."
"dingbatdoodle","7","7","21","30 June 2010"," This series gets better every time, but still . . .
","I am a fan of the book series. I read the series after being forced into it by my neighbor whom I mistakenly told that I kind of liked the first movie.After reading the books, a soft spot in my heart for these movies formed and I am thus forced to venture out into the darkness in the wee small hours of the morning and fight my way through middle schoolers dressed up as wolves to see the newest installment.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware the movie had even started, in fact, I was still riding the high of seeing the Harry Potter preview on the big screen--I simply thought it was another preview. And then I realized it was Riley. Great opening scene. The movie is slightly rushed in the beginning, understandable due to time constraints. Many of the scenes left me wishing for just a few extra lines--words even. When you jumble scenes you must keep the characters motives consistent. I loved this movie, but as a fan of the book was a bit annoyed by the portrayel of the main character's love triangle. The character's actions didn't quite match or maybe they just weren't conveyed properly due to cut scenes--either way Bella seems even more obnoxious, Jacob isn't as devious, and Edward comes off like a jealous pansy.<br/><br/>That said, this picture is by far the most visually stunning. Thank goodness they fixed the Cullen's hair and make-up---New Moon was unacceptable. Rosalie's wig should have been burned. The background stories of Jaz and Rose are perfect--Jaz is awesome. And then there is Charlie . . . he is just so . . .well . . .you just want to hug Billy Burke. I can't imagine anyone else as Bella's dad. I think the acting is improving as well, there are some moments in this movie that are really quite good.<br/><br/>So, all in all--It was worth listening to the cat calls, the applause at the end of all the good scenes, the heckling of either team and the ridiculous comments from people who haven't read the books. It wasn't perfect, but no book adaptation is. There are a few good zingers in there that'll give your date a chuckle, fan or not. :D"

","I went to see Eclipse with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I saw the first movie as a rental with friends, and enjoyed it, then read the books. I skipped ""New Moon"" since I found that book boring (too much Bella is a whiner stuff - I mean really is she no one without Edward or Jacob - pathetic! What a terrible role model for young girls).<br/><br/>Be that as it may, I really enjoyed ""eclipse"". Very nice visuals, good acting from the cast, especially by Taylor Lautner, who makes Jacob much more appealing than he was written in the book. The movie really has it all - good intense action scenes, love triangle angst, comedy.<br/><br/>Not so great - Kirsten Stewart who seems to only have one facial expression with minimal variation. And some fans of the book may be disturbed that many key points/themes were a bit rushed.<br/><br/>I went back and watched New Moon, but this one is much better."
"clockbirdstar","10","4","10","5 July 2010"," If you are a Twi-hard, you will love this movie-even if left a bit unsatisfied...
","First of all, responding to the guy who gave Eclipse a 1 out of 10 and said to watch True Blood if you are into Vamp. dramas, True Blood is nothing but TRASH and people who like Twilight do not like it simply because it is a ""vampire drama""....There is so much more to it than that. With that being said, I will move on to the review. Eclipse is my favorite book in the series, so my anticipation of this film was seriously high, thus making it easy for me to be disappointed. At first, I blamed David Slade for not making Eclipse to it's full potential, but now I also put much of the blame on the damn editor of the film. The movie is so choppy. The first 20 minutes of the film gave me whiplash, and it felt emotionally detached. The acting was actually up to par, so it didn't have to do with the actors...It was the EDITING!!! Also, I was sooo disappointed with the soundtrack! All good bands, but it doesn't quite fit with the movie. The soundtrack was a serious shock for me. I felt like some important scenes were rushed through, like the bed room scene. I was devastated by how that scene played out. It could have been so much better! It was all a blur, and Edward's character was missing the intensity that is so tangible in the book. Another thing that really upset me was how the ending meadow scene unfolded. In the book, Edward and Bella are making out in the meadow and Edward takes away his ""conditions"" about Bella having to marry him before they have intercourse, and he tells her he is ready to give it up. But Bella is the one to turn him down this time, because something in her has ""changed"". That was one of my favorite parts of Eclipse because it is soooo...romantic and dangerous.. And the tent scene....I don't know...It just didn't do it for me. It was actually kinda boring. I could not believe how David slade directed it! Despite my monumental disappointments about these things I have ""nit-picked"", the movie is good. I know that sounds laughable after what I just wrote, but I'm serious. I have already seen Eclipse 3 times now. Point being, if you are a Twilight fan, you will enjoy Eclipse no matter what. It just takes a little time to get over the quirks and the failure of David Slade and the editing of this film. GO SEE ECLIPSE. SEE IT MULTIPLE TIMES. If you are not as critical or as detail obsessed as I am, you will definitely enjoy the movie."

","I have not read any of the books as yet..in fact the first movie I did not see until a friend burned a copy of it and brought it over one evening. Seeing that I have always liked vampire lore and such..I really thought I would like these films more than I did. I never could understand the hype over the ridiculous ""Team Edward/Tea am Jacob"" junk either...but that is a different story..(OK..it was dumb)..anyway...the story is..Bella LOVES Edward...but...wait..here is Jacob..whom longs for her to LOVE him too. Either guy is not going to be a healthy thing for Bella..both could kill her or cause her to be killed at any moment. How romantic. Then there is Bellas' father..who wears a badge...but never seems to be able to notice HUGE wolves running in the forests or the fact that Edward NEVER eats or drinks. Some observant guy/father he is. Apparently wolves smell..and vampires detest that and whoa..vampires are UNDEAD...and werewolves detest that. It all boils down to Indian lore...passed along through the years. Bella just part of that lore somehow..it is her destiny. Meanwhile..she has become close with both families..wolves and vampire...most of them anyway. When the Newbloods show up...new vampires who do not understand their powers yet and are vicious to kill...they wreak havoc on the town..and of course...Jacob and Edward decide they have to deal with it together..putting their hatred aside...to save Bella yet again. Frankly, I was expecting more...but the parts that should have been dramatic and involved ended too quickly. The fight scene should have been intense..but it was really not. The vampire who stirred up the problems to begin with was destroyed without much fanfare..it seemed to easy..why did it take so long? I liked it...and didn't like it at the same time. You almost wished for Edward to go ahead and BITE her..get it over with so she stops being such a tease...and we all know that Jacob is buff...he is powerful as a wolf....stop showing us over and over. We get it. He is tone and tan...while Edward sparkles and is pasty white. Both also have gross feeding habits...can you say ""bad breath""?. Teenage romance has never been so dramatic. Blockbuster? Maybe...according the the box office sales. A timeless film that will NEVER be forgotten? Sorry...no...it is not one of those."

","I really love the Twilight books (and I aren't a teenager- I'm 42). Eclipse was by far my favourite book having read it 4 times and for this reason I was really looking forward to the release of the movie. I wasn't disappointed - it fulfilled what I needed it to. Plenty of dialogue taken directly from the book onto the screen. Granted it was rushed - I would have been happy for it to be longer in order for them to be able to get the sequencing correct and for them to delve further into the back stories.<br/><br/>I saw the film with a friend who had not read any of the books and her view was that not much happened compared to the first two. I think for me as I watched I had my own internal dialogue going on filling in the gaps. I seem to know the characters so well from the book that it was a shame that it was felt that they needed to strengthen Bella's character. The book Bella would never have got on the back of Jacob's bike and just left Edward standing there or approach Rosalie. Also a shame that the tent scene wasn't longer as the Fire & Ice chapter in the book is the best and most amusing (fiving a great insight into Edward's head) As there were so many scenes with the wolves it would have been helpful if we could have heard the voices of the characters in some of these scenes so that we knew what the wolves were thinking.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like I have a lot of complaints but I accept that films are never ever as good as the book and your own little film in your head.<br/><br/>I would say that if you love the Twilight books this film will be a treat for you."
"marihkarla","6","4","10","3 July 2010"," fine
","I really can't understand why people would rate it so low of a score when in reality it wasn't that bad. My guess it has to do with the fact that like me they are kind of tired of the hype that has been given to certain things like Jacob's chest and not the actual love story that is happening. Or because they have finally realized how stupid the actual concept of the story sounds. <br/><br/>I myself have read all the books, and have for the most part enjoyed all the movies. I don't think it deserves higher than a six because it just wasn't amazing, it didn't wow me and the acting was terrible to say the least. But I am a loyal fan, I liked the story and I am not afraid to say so and yes I have read other books. I am not an over obsessing teenager, who dreams of a romance with a vampire and can't get over how hot Taylor Lautner has gotten. <br/><br/>The movie was way too acted out, these actors for the most part do not know how to act at all. Taylor unfortunately is not the best actor in the world, and ended up being a bit too dramatic for my liking. And lets not mention Robert Pattinson and his very furious faces; it was beyond annoying. I don't even want to get started with Kristen because just hearing her awkward voice makes me flinch. <br/><br/>So why did I dress up, on a Friday night to go see a movie that I knew had so many wrong things going for it? I think I did it because I am loyal to the story and my curiosity couldn't stop me from playing out. <br/><br/>It had its cute moments and I have to give it up for the man who plays Charlie because he alone drags this whole movie around. Without him, I strongly believe the Twilight Movies would have died long ago. My favorite scenes would have definitely been the ending ( and not because I wanted it to finish), and the snow scene ( although I can't quite say why). It was decent, if you are a twilight loving teenager then you won't be disappointed with the many showings of Taylor Lautner's very poised behind. ( no nude scenes though) <br/><br/>I also wanted to say that I enjoyed finally hearing some of the characters actually talking now, (finally the vampires speak) <br/><br/>So I suggest you go see it, it is really not that bad, we were sitting next to an old couple and they truly enjoyed as well. Try not to go watch it in places with many teenagers because you will hear a lot of noise and hopefully you will have better luck getting seats then the ones I got."

","I've read a lot of negative comments about how this movie is just more of the same, but what would you expect? It's a continuation of a series, and obviously the final resolution is still two movies away. So the people who say it's just more of the 'Will Bella choose Edward or Jacob?' plot need to realize that it is the centerpiece of the entire saga and one of the biggest reasons that the Twilight movies are so popular.<br/><br/>I went with my 11 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it from start to finish. I haven't read the books and she cover-to-covered them more times than I can count, so we both approached it from different angles. She liked the way it stuck pretty closely with the book, and I found enough action, humor, and intrigue to keep me focused from start to finish.<br/><br/>This, in my opinion, is the best of the three movies so far, as it balances out all the major elements that keep it moving through the whole two hours.

I think Kellan was a great choice for Emmett and here finally he got to be the always teasing and ready to fight teddy bear I love <br/><br/>Xavier - yummy. and a job very well done <br/><br/>BooBoo - I so wish there was more of him. there better be in BD. because he was so perfectly cast <br/><br/>fight scenes - yeah, those were awesome. not too long, visually stunning, very well acted <br/><br/>visuals - I loved that it wasn't all bluish like Twilight. that it had warmth and glow but also the darkness and cold. it suited the story and its different aspects.<br/><br/>the things I didn't like: <br/><br/>Jacob/Taylor - Taylors acting wasn't as terrible as I feared but he is so very much one dimensional. like he only has that one layer of superior and slightly bored smugness and he acts with it in every single scene. or he is overplaying the dramatic scenes. and I will admit, I cringed and closed my eyes during most of his scenes. some weren't that bad but if I could get my hands on a cut of the movie where the Jacob part sans EB are cut out I so would <br/><br/>Bryce as Victoria - I like Bryce but I missed Rachelle. maybe if Bryce got the part from the beginning it would have been different but this way it felt really disconnected and she lacked the fierceness I associated with Victoria too much <br/><br/>newborns - they were cool and it was good to see it but it was a little too much. it was one of the things that kinda hindered the flow of the story when we were constantly thrown back to things we didn't really need to know <br/><br/>pacing - especially at the beginning the movie seemed to skip instead of flow. it got better towards the end but the beginning was kinda distracting <br/><br/>alternations - not all of them. but some. like MR butchering my favorite line of the movie. and I felt they were a little heavy on the moments where Bella would realize all the things she would have to sacrifice. it was too in your face. a little more subtlety would do it good. and her final monologue about her reasons for changing. while I can understand and agree with the overall sentiment of it, the wording was poor and very much opposed to what the story actually is<br/><br/>over all it was better then I expected and it finally seem to do the characters justice. but I still think that the script is the weakest point of these movies and I don't understand why Melissa Rosenberg is still writing them"

","I have to say that I was expecting to not see all the important scenes from the book in the movie but we were in for a treat. Out of all the movies this one stayed true to the book and was put together in a great way. All the characters were more comfortable and played their roles well. The scenes between Edward and Bella were great and so perfect. The action scenes were well put together and were great. My favorite scene was the proposal scene and I'm glad that it was portrayed in exactly the way I imagined it.I have seen this movie on opening night and last night again and I'm sure I'll check it out again. I give David Slade two thumbs up. If you haven't checked it out please do."

","And that is probably one of the most thought provoking quotes said in Eclipse, the third movie in the Twilight film series based off of the books by Stephenie Meyer who has denied ever having watched a single episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>I believe her. If Meyer had seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series she would have easily avoided the many clichés that sprinkle her book: the forbidden romance between a human girl and a supernatural being; werewolves as the symbol of unveiled masculinity; vampires as the symbol of the outsiders of society.<br/><br/>To her credit, Meyer does do some original things with the werewolf and vampire mythos. Who else would have thought to make vampires sparkly underneath the sun? And doesn't every vampire movie have their own set of rules? Buffy, Underworld and even Nosferatu both had different takes on the mythos and the Twilight Series isn't any different.<br/><br/>After two movies, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) seem to finally be happy with each other. If only she could still be friends with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who's heart she broke in the previous movie. If only that darn Victoria would stop trying to kill her. It appears that Victoria (Bryce Howard Dallas) has been making an army of the undead to come and attack Bella and it's up to her vampire friends and an alliance with their enemies the werewolves to save the day. Of course, Edward is a vampire and Jacob, Bella's other beau is a werewolf. Jacob spends most of the time with his shirt off - and for a brief moment naked - in his human form. This is the heart of the story really, this never ending love triangle, not the shirtless teen.<br/><br/>The movie is very well paced and full of self referential humor. Edward asks Bella in one scene if the mostly bare chested Jacob even owns a shirt and Jacob in a later scene replies to Edward ""I am hotter than you."" The film does suffer from too many scenes of Bella and Edward conversing in what appears to be conversations they've already had a dozen times. Some of the editing seems sloppy. In one scene, it was very obvious that not all of the actors were all there at the time of shooting. The film also suffers from way too many oddly framed close-ups.<br/><br/>Eclipse already has a built in audience, so no matter how I review this film, it's going to make the money it has been destined to make and more. It's worth a watch, and it's very well acted compared to the first two, but personally I feel out of it's teenage demographic.<br/><br/>http://neonboy619.blogspot.com"

"lauryl4023","9","5","15","2 July 2010"," Best one yet!
","I thought this movie was very good. I didn't read the book just before seeing the movie (the Harry Potter movies taught me that wasn't a good idea) and I only read the book once. Although I'm not a die-hard fan of the series, I did go to the first two movies (with my friend who IS a huge fan and loved this one) and I have to say, this movie was the best so far.<br/><br/>You can tell the actors are starting to get comfortable with each other. Bella and Edward, while never my favorite couple, are nonetheless much more interactive and believable in this movie than they were in the first two. And Jacob is excellent. The scene that Jacob and Edward have together in the tent is superb. Also, I loved any scene where Edward was uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The back story of the newborns, taken from the new novella and not Eclipse itself, was an interesting addition. While not strictly necessary, it added depth to the villains that made the movie more interesting, and the fights more believable. Actually, they were likable enough that you felt bad for them when the Volturi were planning their demise. Not to mention some good violence scenes that came out of it.<br/><br/>Finally, the CGI of the wolves was great. I could almost believe there were real wolves there...of course, you could still tell it was CGI because of their precise movements, but they didn't stick out like bad CGI does. And the fights between wolves and vampires were very well blended indeed.<br/><br/>I don't know why this movie is rated so low...probably just people wanting the whole of the book crammed into the movie and missing their favorite part. But as someone who completely forgot what happened in the third book by the time I saw this, I have to say I loved it. The pacing was good (no random scenes circling around Bella for unnecessary lengths of time) and it was easy to follow. To all involved in its creation, keep up the good work!"

","While Bella (Kristin Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) continue their heated love triangle as to what is best for Bella's future, the nearby city of Seattle is caught within a mysterious string of killings and disappearances. The Cullen family fears the worse, as they are not sure whether the problem in Seattle is related to Victoria (Bryce Dallas-Howard) or the Volturi but nevertheless, they decide that it is best to take precautions in case they get caught up into a situation they may not be able to control.<br/><br/>Eclipse continues the Twilight Saga in a far tighter manner than both its predecessors and this allows for a far more effective use of the Twilight mythology. New revelations are made about the cultures of the vampires and werewolves and this aids the film with a more cemented supernatural feel. Additionally, certain minor characters are allowed to voice their respective pasts: this aids the film's narrative with added character depth as well as giving these characters a vital role in the events to come. The overall narrative is structured reasonably well with two poignant story arcs taking place and ultimately fuse by the end. However, the events in Seattle only provides a simple distraction to the poorly conceived love story which is clearly holding back the series. Thankfully, the love triangle in the film escalates into a stronger conclusion than expected, but that does not stop it being rough around the edges and filled with character development that seems out of place. The romance is also portrayed far too positively with the apparent negative consequences of such oppressive love going unacknowledged. Speaking of which, an apparent theme of selfishness can be ascertained from the primary characters yet it is never utilised strongly enough to help connect the characters. The narrative is commendable, in light of the previous attempts, and definitely a step in the right direction for the final two movies.<br/><br/>With added improvement to the story, it seems rather disappointing that the acting of the central three figures continues to just fall short. Stewart continues to proceed in a dull manner and by this stage it may just be what her character is truly like: but scenes of romance are never able to excite as you would expect of the vampire genre. Sure, the intent behind the love which surrounds the characters is understandable but it continues to lack feeling from Stewart though she does build life in the final arc of the plot. Pattinson is not much better but his acts of jealously do admirably convey the sort of sinister nature which belies his character's love: pity the film never plays on this. Lautner continues his surprising performance from New Moon but the script never really allows him to further his contribution. Minor characters continue to strengthen the acting ensemble but it is a pity that those who represent the Volturi, are either limited to a few minutes or are completely absent.<br/><br/>Another slight improvement is in regards to the computer animation, which flows slightly better this time around with the live-action; a soundtrack that does not always feel tacked on for commercial profitably as orchestra highlights some of the high moments in the film; and directorial control that makes for a more well-rounded experience in which some decent action sequences are allowed to come to life.<br/><br/>Language is in running with previous films with its minimal and tame use. There is no nudity but sexual overtones are slightly stronger in Eclipse than seen in the previous films. The violence factor has been increased rather noticeably, either via implication or actual on-screen events. There is a greater emphasis on action but the lack of blood in death scenes stops it ever being overly violent.<br/><br/>The Volturi may not grant second chances, and for the Twilight franchise that is a good thing. Third time lucky it definitely is as Eclipse is a marked improvement over both the original Twilight and New Moon, mostly because the overall quality is better. The narrative has more depth; the actors appear to be getting a grasp of their characters, and all while the balancing of melodrama with action takes place. The story offers interesting depth and developments which ultimately become underused and so it is unfortunate that no facet of the film is really as strong as it should be given this is the third film in the series."
"jordell5","10","4","11","5 July 2010"," by far the strongest film yet
","After looking at the average rating and the mass of pessimistic ratings given for Eclipse, I decided to give it a 10/10. Its not a perfect film, and I don't think it deserves a 10/10, but for all the people giving the film 1's, 2's and 3's out of 10 i am giving it a top score to balance it out. Even if you don't like the film, the concept, or vampires in general, it still deserves great credit for its great choice of music, amazing cinematography, at least decent acting.<br/><br/>Eclipse was my favourite book of the 4, and it comes as no surprise that it is my favourite thus far. As a male, Like other reviewers have said, it had the greatest amount of action and character development, while still maintaining the drama and romance. The Volturi are great, the Cullen family have more screen-time, and the scenery is how I pictured it in the books.<br/><br/>You think you've seen a bad film- watch House of the Dead 2, then watch this!"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","4","11","4 July 2010"," She Loves Someone Else
","When Sting performed with The Royal Philharmonic at The Hollywood Bowl, he said in his experience there are two kinds of love songs. There is ""I love you, and you love me.""—very circular. Then there is ""I love you, and you love someone else."" –which is the more interesting. ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" aligns with the latter. In ""Eclipse"" vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) protect their beloved Bella (Kristen Stewart) from merciless ""Newborn"" Riley (charismatic Xavier Samuel), who means to kill her with his powerful army of vampire. Edward and Jacob, literally mortal enemies by blood, are both in love with Bella. Bella must choose, reconcile her own heart, and her future as human or soulless immortal.<br/><br/>In the opening of ""Eclipse"" Stewart reads Robert Frost's ""Fire and Ice"" to Pattinson about the end of the world—metaphor for this story arc. ""Eclipse"" is not as eloquent as a Sting love song, and under the orchestration of Director David Slade and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (adapting Stephanie Meyer's novel) is captivating action packed melodrama. Granted I am not a fan of the books or the demographic. ""Eclipse"" is much better than ""New Moon"". The tone is darker, and enhanced by Howard Shore's score. This time around Slade and Rosenberg infuse a sense of humor about their material. In one scene Edward asks regarding shredded werewolf Jacob, ""Does he ever wear a shirt?"" Although at times the dialogue seems as awkward as a George Lucas movie—this may have more to do with the source material? In a tent on an icy night atop a mountain, Edward (Pattinson) and Jacob (Lautner) talk man to man about their profound love for Bella—each risking their life. Jacob asks Edward what if Bella chooses not to be with him. Edward says, ""Then I will let her go."" Jacob ends with a cute comment instead of acknowledging a mutual respect. Beholding to Meyer's material frequently keeps the movie from soaring. I think Rosenberg could have refined, matured, and retained the spirit.<br/><br/>Much of ""Eclipse"" is uneven. Elsewhere Rosenberg and Meyer exact eloquence. With amazing poignancy Rosalie Cullen (sad and beautiful Nikki Reed) implores Bella (Stewart) to reconsider her choice to become vampire—""You are frozen, never moving forward."" No possibility. Pattison's Edward pleads with Bella to consider her choice to ""turn"". He forfeited his very soul, and the paradox that he tells her is, ""I will protect your soul"". Perhaps, this is the very essence of the vampire vogue. The Vampire is the ultimate existential hero. He is immortal, but by nature destroys the object of his love. He lives forever, and is forever alone. Kristen Stewart as Bella embodies the angst and longing, but I think the narrative fails in underscoring the consequences of her humanity choice. Rosenberg gracefully enlightens the consequences of eternity with the past lives of Rosalie (Reed) and Jasper Hale (amazingly strong Jackson Rathbone). Rathbone is a surprise from the last 2 movies, as he commands as a leader instructing the Cullen's and the Werewolf to combat the powerful Newborn.<br/><br/>The Newborn are newly born vampire with insatiable blood lust and very powerful—stronger than the Cullens. Alice Cullen (stunning and strong Ashley Greene) has a vision of the army of Newborns lead by the Riley (Samuel) coming to kill Bella. However, Riley is a mere puppet of the malevolent Victoria (coldly compelling Bryce Dallas Howard), who seeks vengeance upon Edward (Pattinson)? Also lurking in the shadows is the powerful and calculated Jane (understatedly evil Dakota Fanning) of the omniscient vampire Voltari. Here unlike ""New Moon"" the catharsis completes with the bloody battle between good and evil with lives and souls in the balance. Pattison is commanding and passionate as Edward transforms into the great hero he is destined. He balances Edward's humanity as he fights for the soul of his eternal love. All culminates in the showdown with Edward, Victoria, and Riley—nice modern mythology.<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" is a welcome and satisfying surprise. It is Gothic love story in the midst of the battle of good against great evil, and classic hero story as well. Pattison and Stewart are amazing, and smooth out some of the narrative turbulence. ""Eclipse"" is well worth seeing, and now I look forward to the next ""Twilight""."
"wendy-the","7","4","11","4 July 2010"," A masterpiece considering the lack of story and idea
","We all know what Twilight is all about - it's a fiction novel written by a woman with no talent or writing abilities.<br/><br/>Still, the new Twilight movie was made as good as it was possible considering the fact that the book is unworthy of reading, let alone ecranisation.<br/><br/>The plot is very well paced, not too fast, nor too slow, although there are the usual pathetic one-on-one scenes that drag. Eclipse joins other Twilight movies in being visually beautiful, with gorgeous scenery and 'burned' colors. The soundtrack is also well done, maybe I missed more indie rock since instrumental and classical pieces prevailed.<br/><br/>Acting, well... I didn't expect much anyway. But there was one actor that simply amazed me with his lack of talent, playing his role like he was found that day on the street and was paid 100$ to take part of - Jacob. Yes, Taylor Lautner does not know how to act to save his life. Apart from taking his shirt off and looking like a child on horse steroids, he managed to ruin every scene he was in, specially the scenes when his desperation and anger was suppose to erupt. I haven't noticed before how bad he was. Maybe it was due to the fact that in previous films he had no more than few lines in his scenes. Maybe it was due to the fact that his nudity distracted me. Anyway, he's very bad. Very.<br/><br/>Robert and Kirsten are usually numb, they are probably both bored and don't really try. Kirsten is a tad better than in the past few movies, she doesn't breathe as much and smiles here and there.<br/><br/>What is also new in Eclipse, was the amount of erotic/kissing scenes. Almost everyone was sucking the life out of each other as soon there was even the slightest chance.<br/><br/>There are a few very good humorous scenes, well done, with word plays or interesting situations.<br/><br/>Summa summarum, Eclipse is the best Twilight movie so far, with minimal amount of cheesy dialogues and unnecessary romantic scenes. I would even call it a masterpiece since I've read the books and know that their substance is lack of brain, talent or writing abilities. So yes, they have made it as good as they possibly could. It does not get better for Twilight than this.<br/><br/>All the negative reviews you will read, just ignore them. The Twilight franchise itself is not cinematography's peak accomplishment, but this is a good Twilight film. Do not expect Dark knight, but do not expect Dracula 3000 either."
"cartidge","7","4","11","3 July 2010"," A film that is fashionable to hate
","This film has, on this site, attracted a negative reputation. But I'm not really suppressed by that, after all the previous two titles in the series also garnered a considerable degree of criticism. However, I'm not sure this criticism is warranted. I suspect many of the people who have written poor reviews and given the film a low score are jumping on the bandwagon. It seems that films like Twilight, and its offspring, have been branded as chick-flicks, ney, teenie-chick-flicks; and thus open to any criticism and without merit, by male viewers (or as I suspect in many cases individuals who have judged the film based on reputation as opposed to viewing).This view is not warranted, if you willing to remain open-minded and ignore that various male prejudices regarding the plot, the bulk of which are both juvenile and in many cases rather chauvinistic, the film is actually quite reasonable.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the film is not without genuine problems. For example, the primary female character Bella is an entirely two dimensional entity that fluctuates between bitter fluctuating reflection of her relationship with Jacob and morbid obsession with Edward. This results in pallid pouting through out the duration of the film. But then again, I have met self-obsessed teenagers that the film reminds me of, and in fairness Bella is equally vapid in the books. I also found the film rather patronising in places, providing sign post commentary for the most basic of observations and, rather than leave an explanation of various obvious plot developments to the intellect of the audience, instead chooses to excruciating to spell it out. But, again, the book does that too.<br/><br/>These issues aside, the film was actually rather good, aesthetically impressive and backed by an apt sound track. The film also kept a reasonable pace through for the duration despite being drawn from a novel in excess of 600 pages. Given the fact that the film is in excess of two hours, the achievement of retaining a good pace without condensing the plot into incoherence was most welcome. I was also impressed by the actors portraying the three main characters, given the rather bland characters Meyer provided them to work with, I thought they did a lot. There is also something to be said for the films gender politics. On the one hand I am not a fan of Meyer's literary attempt at an advert for 'Purity rings', but it is hard to blame the film for addressing the central underlying theme of the source material. On the other, however, it is good to see a Hollywood franchise attempting to cater for a female audience by placing male flesh on display; as opposed to the typical routine of filling films with breasts and bottoms in an attempt to add appeal for teenage boys. For too long film makers have seen the female body as a commodity, and at last they have begun to broaden their horizons. But most of all the film was, despite its various flaws and vapid characters (all of which can be placed at the door of the author), was actually entertaining and I left the cinema not feeling as if I had been cheated. While I did not have quite the same admiration for the film as many of the rapturous individuals in the packed screening I attended, both myself and my girlfriend, who is not a fan of the series I should add, both enjoyed it.<br/><br/>So all in all I thought this film was a flawed, if, fair effort and that much of the criticism surrounding it is simply because it is Twilight film, and that such an enterprise will always attract a negative, and unwarranted, reputation."
"dcobbimdb","8","4","11","3 July 2010"," I liked it & my 8 year old loved it
","It's weird how a movie gets a generally low scores as far as it's rating, yet the people who I talk to who have seen it seem to like it. I guess it's one of those cult following movies where the ""masses"" just don't get it or like it but there are those who obviously like it, kind of a love / hate type of thing I guess. Overall I think I liked this movie as much if not more than the first one. It's kind of funny too as I read a few preliminary screening reviews where people complained about a slow boring predictable story with bad acting & dodgy special effects. Honestly I liked this movie and thought the flow, story, acting, additional character development & action were all good. So to each their own I guess. My daughter loved it. So there you go<br/><br/>Far as younger kids viewing it are concerned, I should point out that I have an eight year old daughter and the fact that I saw the first two movies prior to letting her see them as after all it is a love story, she's only eight and it is rated PG-13... So I took a chance on this one being we went to see it in the theater together and there was definitely more kissing / make out scenes than I anticipated even know I new this one focused more on the love triangle aspect. There was one scene I thought I was going to have to cover up her eyes, but luckily it fizzled out before it got too juicy. Far as the action & gore are concerned, there is really no reason to be concerned here. The few ""feeding"" scenes aren't graphic and the climactic battle scenes while intense were not gory in the least being the action is pretty quick not to mention the vampires don't bleed but rather crumble more like statues when killed. I did not and would not bring my 6 year old daughter to see this though Overall I liked the further character development they did on the Cullen family members, this movie focused more on them whereas Bella's classmate friends took more of a sideline in this movie. Again I thought the story flowed and developed well and I was not bored through any of it. It's not the kind of movie where I could watch again and again though and I would typically not pay to go to the theater to see this movie, but my daughter is in love with the series. In the end I'm glad we went and had a good time."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","8","4","11","2 July 2010"," Close to Greatness
","I'm not a huge fan of the first two ""Twilight"" films. I liked them; I just think that they are heavily flawed. Some parts drag, the visual effects are enjoyably bad (here's looking at you, CG wolves), some intriguing characters are given frustratingly short time (Michael Sheen's pitch-perfect performance as Aro in ""New Moon"" comes to mind) and at times, I thought that Kristin Stewart and Robert Pattinson were too obviously underplaying their roles. Whilst many people choose to either love or hate ""Twilight"", I've chosen to remain firmly in the middle.<br/><br/>With ""Eclipse"", the ""Twilight"" fan in me has been set free. Not only is ""Eclipse"" the most gripping, cinematic and poignant of the three ""Twilight"" movies so far, it's the first which I would gladly go to the cinema to watch again and again. I'm surprised to say it, but I came dangerously close to loving this movie.<br/><br/>In a chillingly economic opening, a young man named Riley (the coldly menacing Xavier Samuel) is hunted down and bitten by a mysterious figure, left screaming in pain on the docks of Seattle. We then return to Forks and everyone's favourite human-vampire couple, Bella Swan (Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Pattinson). Whilst Bella is still intent on becoming a vampire, Edward is doing his best to put her off the idea. Things are further complicated by werewolf Jacob (the ever-shirtless Taylor Lautner), who desperately tries to make Bella shift her romantic attention to him. However, trouble is approaching. The vengeful Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, sexual alluring yet viciously inhuman), with the now-undead Riley as her right-hand man, is raising a newborn vampire army, a ravenous and ultra-strong force which is intended to destroy Bella and Edward. In order to avoid bloodshed, the vampire clan of the Cullens team up with Jacob's wolf pack. But just what role is the Volturi, led by the dangerous Jane (Dakota Fanning. bitterly witty and malicious), playing in this game?<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" is easily the best of the ""Twilight"" series so far for the same reason that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was better than the first two ""Harry Potter"" films; the change of perspective. Taking over the reins after Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz is British director David Slade. Having shown his aptitude with vampires in the gory, atmospheric ""30 Days of Night"", Slade brings much-needed edge to this material. He deftly blends action, horror, comedy and romance into a hugely entertaining, often compelling whole, whilst drawing much improved performances from the three leads.<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" also has fun with itself. At one point, Edward complains about Jacob, ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" It is this good-natured humour which stops ""Eclipse"" from drifting into the overly serious mood that the first two movies sometimes adopted, and actually makes the characters more human. Take, for example, the scene where Bella's father Charlie (Billy Burke in a performance of wonderfully low-key comedic timing) talks to Bella about boys. It is not only hilarious to watch, but it also strikes a note of poignant realism; this is something that could actually happen to girls around Bella's age, unlike the agonisingly silly wailing scenes in ""New Moon"".<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" is much more thrilling than the other two movies. An early chase through the forest is terrific, tense without being over-the-top, swift without being confusing. However, the big action scene is the concluding face-off between the Cullens, the wolves and the new-born army. This sequence is breathlessly choreographed, endlessly exciting and flawlessly paced. This is easily the most ""guy-friendly"" of the ""Twilight"" films so far. <br/><br/>Acting-wise, Stewart is much more likable as Bella in this movie, probably because she isn't stupidly throwing herself off a cliff or constantly moaning. Here, Bella is a much more complex and stronger individual. By becoming a vampire, she will lose all those closest to her, and Stewart shows Bella's inner turmoil with admirable restraint. There are moments where she slips (one moment where she yells at Jacob is exaggerated, and drew unintentional laughter from the audience), but for every slip-up there are five perfectly judged moments, such as the sad look on her face as she embraces her mother for what could be the last time. Pattinson brings an understated sadness and pain to his role, showing Edward's longing for Bella to remain human. Unfortunately, he's fighting a losing battle. Lautner (one of my favourite things about ""New Moon"") brings his charisma back to the table, with steely determination in Jacob's quest to win Bella's heart. All three leads are giving this their best shot, and whilst their performances aren't perfect, they all convince. The Cullen clan is memorably brought to life with lively performances, with the two stand-outs being Jackson Rathbone as Jasper and Nikki Reed as Rosalie. Whilst both were in the sidelines for the first two movies, here they get their chance to shine through flashbacks into their character's pasts; these scenes are powerful, chilling and unexpectedly moving.<br/><br/>This movie is gorgeous to look at. The sweeping camera shots evoke the same epic feel of ""Lord of the Rings"", with the luscious scenery bedazzling the eyes. Speaking of LOTR, that series' composer Howard Shore composes a perfect musical score, both bombastic and sensitively intimate when necessary, and which easily stands up to the enchanting work of Alexandre Desplat on ""New Moon"". The visual effects have much improved since ""New Moon"", with the wolves benefiting in particular. <br/><br/>There are flaws. The make-up work is too obvious, whilst I wanted to see more of some characters (most notably Victoria, Riley, Jane and new-born Bree (nicely played by Silent Hill's Jodelle Ferland)). Nevertheless, ""Eclipse"" is a really well-made, entertaining movie, with enough romance to keep the fans satisfied whilst introducing enough new elements to win over previous sceptics (such as myself). I look forward to seeing ""Eclipse"" again, to see if my high view of it could go even higher."

","The third Twilight movie is a bit better than the second one (which was just too much of Kristens character crying/being sad/suicidal etc.), but does that even matter for Twilight fans (I heard they are called ""Twi-Hards"", which is kinda funny) or those who won't watch any of the Twilight movies? <br/><br/>I guess not and after I watched it, I was pretty sure it would be more than enough for the fans. Which is not completely true as I found out a couple of days later. Seems that fans do care about the franchise and as a (female) friend of mine told me, she had wished the movie would have looked much better than it does.<br/><br/>What does that mean? That it does look a bit cheap (her words), because the set designs and everything else is pretty ""spartan"". I couldn't argue with that, though brining up ""Lord of the Rings"" is not really fair to the Twilight franchise. And I guess the makers were thinking the same thing though. Why spend too much money on those things (when they had to spend money on CGI), if fans only wanted the relationships to look forward too. And a few fight scenes, too of course.<br/><br/>And yes, as with every franchise, we do get ""darker"" here. Nothing too much, still teen-friendly, but why would you expect anything else. It is what it is. And since I started watching the whole thing, I will be there for the last (two) part(s), too."

I was going to after NEW MOON, but now.... You know, the Harry Potter-movies made me want to read the books after not wanting to do the ¨sheep-thing¨ and worshiping the books/movies with rest of world. But this movie did nothing to promote the books. OK maybe I am too old (30) for the teen-love-stuff. But I cannot believe teens will actually swoon at watching this movie.

Both had more coherence (not even close to perfect, but it was an improvement). The love triangle had a more than a couple of really interesting scenes (even if crazy) and I felt it was more intertwined with the overall story (in the prior movies they were kind of separated blocks). And the development of the supernatural aspects wasn't bad either (it could've been better, of course).<br/><br/>Besides that, the acting I think it improved and everybody did the best they could to act what was on page (which lets face it, it is really hard).

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","0","26 March 2020"," Darker, with more action, it keeps the level of the previous films, which is not a very good thing.
","This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work. Despite this, this film was a box office champion, the teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed their hands in satisfaction, just as with the two previous films.<br/><br/>The plot boils down to this: again together, Edward and Bella look happy, but a succession of mysterious murders in neighboring Seattle indicates that Victoria, the couple's enemy, may be trying to raise an army of newly created vampires, which may endanger the entire Cullen clan and also Jacob's pack. On the other hand, the threat of the Volturi to interfere hangs over everyone and Bella doesn't seem to know how to deal with Jacob, in love with her, and whom she doesn't want to hurt.<br/><br/>Again we saw a change in the director's chair, with the arrival of David Slade. From a distance, we saw an improvement in direction with his arrival, showing the lack of capacity of its previous occupants. There is an improvement in the environment and in the story told, which becomes more profound and involving as the danger and the action become more and more present in the film. The fight scenes are very good, but very fast, which helped the film acquire a somewhat uneven pace, with fast scenes and much slower sequences. In addition, there are still serious problems inherited from previous films and which are closely linked to the way the actors behaved.<br/><br/>In fact, each film accentuates the feeling that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were gross casting errors and never adapted well to the characters and each other. There is almost no chemistry between them, despite an improvement in the dialogues and the story told. Their characters' romance no longer seems like a childish crush, as in the previous two films, but it is still a long way from looking as breathtaking as it was supposed to. With the exception of some very concrete scenes, there is no involvement or depth in the way both actors worked, and the romantic scenes seem like pauses in which we can disconnect a little from what we are seeing and, for example, go to the bathroom for a minute. . Taylor Lautner is good, but not as good as in the previous film, where he had more presence and showed more talent. Bryce Dallas Howard was a pretty good Victoria and a convincing villain. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good and maintain the level they had so far.<br/><br/>Technically, the film maintains the good CGI, visible in the work of the wolves and in the extraordinarily choreographed action scenes. Howard Shore's soundtrack is very good, dark in the right measure and helped keep the soundtrack as one of the best strengths of the films in this tetralogy. Good scenarios, props, and very good large-scale images of cold and snowy landscapes complete the technical work.<br/><br/>This film is the darkest and most serious in tetralogy, but also the one that gives the audience the most action. We continue to face a dull story, but the introduction of these elements was welcome and helped the film to become more palatable and less boring."
"JoelPeterBrown","8","0","0","3 March 2020"," Character within the Characters Movie Trailer Review of 'Eclipse (2010)'
","TAKE WHAT MASTERED YOU!AND MASTER IT.<br/><br/>A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration which causes a person to want to improve themselves and copy the model.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA includes 'Twilight (2008),' 'New Moon (2009),' 'Eclipse (2010),' 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 1 (2011),' and 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 2 (2012).' Therefore, this review will place the most attention on the original film which I believe is the strongest representation of the character strength. So without further ado, the 'Twilight' SAGE can be seen as an exemplar for teaching an alternative way of living for resisting any kind of temptation.<br/><br/>For instance, self-sacrificial adjustments that is show through Edward and his family are ""good"" vampires who only feed off animals as a replacement for taking human blood.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, developing an alternative lifestyle with the character strengths exhibited of self-regulation, bravery, prudence, perseverance, and love as they have learn how to control their impulses.<br/><br/>This shows significant self-control and inner discipline in managing impulses and emotions, turning tendencies into creativity. While the themes that the 'Twilight' SAGA has presented throughout the film are: choices, love, good vs. evil, fear, isolation, language, communication, appearances, mortality, the supernatural, strength, skill, family, hate, sacrifice, man and the natural world, memory, and past.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA trailers are edgy with this atmospheric quality in the audio and visual design that makes you feel like you're apart of the character's world.<br/><br/>The trailer show performances that are full of confidence as the actors enjoy and believe in what they're doing. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, and Taylor Lautner were all compelling, truthful in the moment, and emotionally connected as they fully transformed into their characters.<br/><br/>Not to mention the other actors were believable in their characters as they stood true to the original characters of Stephenie Meyer's popular novel that's of the same name.<br/><br/>In effect, the trailer pulls you brings you into the world of this Forks town. Where ""High-school student Bella Swan, always a bit of a misfit, doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen, a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate"" (ref. Google).<br/><br/>As the special effects really enhance the movie; both audio and visual, giving it this dark and soulful style.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the cinematography was creative, along with an amusing production quality that had a dark feeling ethereal film score.<br/><br/>Overall, the 'Twilight' trailers are an astonishing work of art
that create suspense within you to see the movie."

The only thing worse than the acting is the dialogue - which was apparently written by an angsty teenager who has never talked to another living person in real life or read an actual book. Thank heavens I had Rifftrax to help get me through this movie."
"TheNabOwnzz","3","0","0","17 June 2018"," A slight improvement over the first two, but still pretty bad
","Ofcourse it is no secret that The Twilight Saga is not one of cinema's finest forthbringings, as its first two films are some of the worst examples of acting/writing you will ever see, and while Eclipse might not be much better, atleast the unintentional comedy finally seems kept to a minimum this time. ( Yes, there are still unintentionally comically bad moments, but not so many as previous ones )<br/><br/>The main reason that this one still towers over its terrible predecessors is because of the fact that we are actually given some insight to backstories of some of the Cullen's, such as that story about one of them being a confederate soldier or the one by that blonde Cullen woman ( I forget a lot of the Cullen's names as their characters were not very memorable ). The cinematography is a bit better than its predecessors too, yet we can still notice a lot of actual wideshots ( Such as the one in the mountains ) was greenscreened and therefore didn't quite look as great as it would have like to have been. Tension is a bit better than in the previous ones too with the story about the newborn army, but since this is kind of like a kids franchise we know none of the good guys are probably going to get hurt, and if they do, why should we even care? The people displayed here do not talk and act like actual people, and therefore an emotional connection cannot be made. <br/><br/>The love triangle between Bella, Edward & Jacob is starting to become ridiculous. Ofcourse, i don't quite understand what anyone could see in Bella who always has just one facial expression, but Jacob's & Edward's fighting over her borderline on the comical. Seriously, who would fight over a inhuman emotionless dead inside kind of girl like Bella? The screenplay might be a little bit better, but still it mostly consists of your typical Twilight conversations like: 'You love him', 'I love you more', yeah these types of clichés are what your general Twilight screenplay consists of most of the time. It might have less unintional comedy, but let us not forget the AMAZING scene with Bella and her father when she admits she is a virgin. The sheer inhuman and unnatural acting by Kristen Stewart will make you laugh out loud at this point, but at least it was kept to a minimum this time.<br/><br/>The acting by the three main characters is once again terrible. I reckon even if you get these actors to play on a film with an actual good script, they will still blow it with their delivery. Lautner might be slightly better than Pattinson and Pattinson slightly better than Stewart, but all three of them have non existent acting talents. It baffles me that especially Stewart is still somehow getting work, whose constant sighing makes it look like she is extremely nervous everytime she has to film a scene. I mean, i get that David Fincher cast her in Panic Room as the spoiled annoying little brat because she wasn't known at the time, but people who still cast her should know better. There is just no argument you can give in her favor when it comes down to acting. The sighing, hair touching, head shaking, eye contact evasing, open mouthing, deadened line deliveries & the list goes on. Like a robot sent from Mars to act on Earth, that is really what her style comes down to.<br/><br/>While it is a bit better than its predecessors due to the fact that it had a couple of backstories which took the focus off Bella ( Who is a TERRIBLE character ), it is still a Twilight film featuring Kristen Stewart & Robert Pattinson, and this alone still makes sure it is a mediocre mess."

","""Eclipse"" is the third part of the Twilight saga and deals with Bella, who increasingly wishes to become a vampire herself while she is not willing to leave Jacob behind and is caught between engagement with Edward and her desire for another man. At the same time an evil vampire is about to form an army that wolves and vampires have to fight side by side.<br/><br/>First of all this movie is literally pretty dark, electrical light doesn't seem to have reached the Seattle area. Despite this fact ""Eclipse"" is more or less your average High school love movie except that some of the characters show supernatural skills. However, the production is professional and the effects and technical side is appropriate for a blockbuster movie. Personally, I found a lot of plot points quite predictable but on the other hand I'm also probably not really the target group for the entire series.<br/><br/>All in all it was entertaining enough to not really get bored, even though some of the lines are really hard to bear. If you're a fan of the series or if you just like teen romances with some additional drama, this could be a thing for you."

I think Eclipse was great! It had humor, romance, action, thrill, good-looking people! Haha, you name it! All the actors did a really good job and it was fun to see new characters/people so it felt like a different movie and not all the same. I haven't read all the books so I can't compare with that but I like to watch the movie first because I like the thrill, and for me this movie was so freakin' good!I really enjoyed this movie and to be true I'm now in Team Jacob.

"escalade94","10","5","16","2 July 2010"," Actually pretty good!
","So the first Twilight movie received like a 6 rating on IMDb. New Moon received like a 4 something and I do not understand how Eclipse can get a 3!!! If anything at all, I think that the ratings were in backwards order. Now Twilight was not horrible horrible but there were many many things wrongs with it. The acting was just okay, the cinematography was amateurish, and the special effects were unimaginably horrible. I've seen Youtube videos that have better special effects. The soundtrack/score were pretty good though. New Moon was a tremendous step up from Twilight, especially in acting (except Rob Pattinson) and extremely in the special effects. Yet somehow, it received a lower rating. Eclipse was even better. The acting was a major improvement for almost all the characters, but especially Rob, Kristen, and the Jasper guy (forgot his real name). Taylor Lautner seemed a little lacking but he did okay. The previews had me worried that this sequel was going to be really really cheesy but it actually kept the cheese factor down to a low. There were certain parts in Twilight in New Moon that actually made me cringe with the acting and cheesiness. The screenwriter (Melissa Rosenburg or something like that) actually did a pretty decent job with this one. I wanted to smack after seeing Twilight and New Moon but she did pretty good with this one. The Eclipse book actually bored me a little through the middle but the movie did a good job of not boring us too much. So overall, this movie was a lot better than the previous two which is why I do not understand why it's receiving such harsh reviews. If you're a fan of the books than you'll love seeing this movie, but if your not, than just stay away because us fans aren't really going to care much about your criticism anyway. And hey! If it's such a bad movie....than why does it top the box office charts every time it comes out?!?!?"
"mariah-gorman","7","5","16","30 June 2010"," I liked it, but there are a few problems
","Okay, I have never been a Kristin Stewart fan. I don't know if it's her acting or her character but she makes Bella seem so stupid. I agree this movie is sending out a bad message to teens, with Bella going back and forth between Edward and Jacob. When you fall in love there is no one else. The fact that she kissed Jacob the day (or two days) after she agreed to marry Edward is just ridiculous. Not to mention she did it like 50 feet away from her fiancé. That would not happen. Taylor Lautner's acting has always bothered me, he did better in this movie but he's just.. weird. Robert Pattinson was impressive as always, I think he's the best actor out of the 3. IMO he saved the movie. There was hardly any action, the action that was there was pretty cool though. This movie is just a teen romance, don't go in to see it expecting anything more."
"Otterkin","10","4","12","5 July 2010"," It is a great film
","I was lucky enough to be in Canada for 10 days and my daughter and I were able to see Eclipse on the day of release there. We are now back in the UK and going to see it again when it comes out here.<br/><br/>I thought the film was brilliant, as were the first 2, which I also went to see with my daughter Jane.<br/><br/>Jane got me interested in the Saga when she came with me to Italy last year when I was judging a dog show there. She brought the books along and insisted I read them. I was up until 4am sometimes, reading the books - could not put them down. I am now reading them for the 4th time. Brilliant writing.<br/><br/>OK - so a love story can be corny if you have a hard head with no inclination to believe in a love which defies all the odds. I am sure Romeo and Juliet had its critics. Wondering out loud if the Twilight saga will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>When we went to see the film, 2 friends who are also Championship Dog show judges came with us. Our friend Jane said one of the wolves was undershot and the other (Rose)said one of them looked as if it had hip dysplasia. So when they make the next 2 films, I hope they ask a Dog show judge to help them refine the wolves' jaws and movement! You don't see wolves with undershot mouths or bad hind movement! <br/><br/>That aside, great film, gripping story, tense atmosphere, brilliant direction and well worth seeing more than once.<br/><br/>I missed seeing the fabulous Michael Sheene - when he bent over Bella in New Moon and said in that drawn-out way ""Isa-bel-la..."" it was delicious. Hope we see more of him in the next 2. Also thought Jane portrayed her vicious streak well in New Moon when she said ""Pain"" to Edward .............in this one, she just looked at her victim.<br/><br/>To all those who write such scathing remarks about the movies, I can't understand why you bother going - leave it to those who enjoy it - there are plenty of us! By the way, I am not a young mother - my daughter is 35....and we both love Twilight. Can't wait to see Eclipse again at the weekend and looking forward to the final two."
"mel22345","6","3","9","5 June 2013"," Entertaining
","Personally I like the movies of the saga which I find entertaining. Life is tragic enough so you don't always have to watch realistic films. It is all about what kind of movies you enjoy. I find it is a very relaxing fantasy movie, far better than some I wouldn't even watch through the end. Eclipse has more action than the first 2, a battle, but perhaps the emotions the characters are displaying I can't feel very much. I wouldn't blame the actors, I think they can display a wide range of emotions. Maybe sometimes they don't connect. The movie is revolving around the choice of the kind of future Bella wants, as a human or a vampire, and who she loves the most, and will her beliefs be changed by events."
"Rot-Fish","6","3","9","5 July 2010"," It captured the essence of Eclipse and I really enjoyed it
","I was looking forward to watch this movie so badly, since Eclipse is my favorite book. After my high expectations and all the bad reviews I read here, I can still safely say that I really enjoyed to movie. I completely understand that if you haven't read the books you don't get why all these typical teenage girl emotions are still in this movie. After seeing a glimpse of the rivalry between Jacob and Edward in New Moon it might look like dragging the whole drama further out into the third movie. Which should probably contain more other issues as well, since it's a new movie. Stil... if you have actually read the books you know that teenage girl drama is mainly what the books really are. The books are about these difficult choices Bella has to make and are about the romance between her and Edward and the confused feelings she has for Jacob. I read the books. I knew what to expect. Loved the story, because I am one of those girls who can't get enough of soppy romance. I actually thought they did a great job capturing the essence of Eclipse. They put all the most important things in there, plus they explained a lot of things that may not have been that clear in the first 2 movies. They also made it more like the book by putting more jokes in it. I find the Twilight saga quite funny, though the first 2 movies mainly focused on the drama aspect. Loved Robert's acting. He really is the only one to play Edward this convincingly. Even though I am mainly positive about the movie, I do have some things I didn't like. Michelle was 100 times better as the evil Victoria. Kristin plays a bit too vanilla-like to capture the essence of the spunky Bella... and I hated the make-up/animation they used on the vampires. Edward's sideburns were ugly and unnecessary. The eyes were too light; The contacts they wore in the first 2 movies were a lot better. Plus the way the vampires just broke like stones when they were killed in battle was laughable. Even though they feel like cold stone, they're not supposed to look like that. <br/><br/>And chill everybody :) it's just a movie. Read the books, love them, then watch the movie again. It's really not that bad figuring that they put +500 pages in a 2hour movie."

","Twilight was an average indie film, New Moon was a bad Hollywood film, and Eclipse is starting to get it right. Having never read the books, I have to look at this from just a movie-goers perspective. <br/><br/>David Slade, director of the cult film, Hard Candy and the much loved/hated, 30 Days of Night, is manning the helm with this newest installment of the Twilight series. And as someone who is unbiased with this whole phenomenon, I actually enjoyed Eclipse. <br/><br/>Pros: The acting is nowhere near as cringe worthy. The action is intense and great for us guys. The love triangle is actually worth watching. Some of the supporting characters are properly developed. The special effects are better.<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pace at times. The awesome battle scene is too short. Still some bad dialog. Luckily it's not as bad.<br/><br/>Basically if you're a guy who has to take a girl to see this movie, you won't be completely annoyed. David Slade managed to make this watchable and fun. Don't take it seriously. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée"

I came to read the reviews just for the heck of it but an avg of 4.1 for the rating intrigued me. <br/><br/>Was it really that bad? .... Heck no!!! I wonder if people expect some vampire, werewolf battles in this movie series more than the central theme.. which is simply 'love'. I agree it does get a bit cheesy here n there but I guess thats what should be expected in teenage love stories even if it does involve the creatures mentioned before.<br/><br/>Yeah she does not have lot of expressions on her face .. so? Does that make her a bad actor? I think that is part of the character and she would have messed it up if she were showing her obsession for Edward like a blonde cheer girl (No offense .. just trying to get you to picture it).<br/><br/>I liked the way they showed the history of a couple of the Cullens. It gave the characters a lot more personality than before. <br/><br/>A lot of smooching and cuddling... yeah... not for the people who like war movies and LoTR kinda stuff. <br/><br/>I am not going to say that it is an awesome movie. Just that its a genre by itself and you need to have an open mind and have seen the first 2 parts before you go for this one."
"Coralina33","5","3","9","3 July 2010"," People are too harsh on this movie
","after reading the reviews on here, i have concluded that people are content to give it either a 1 or a 10. it does not deserve either. let me say that i am a HUGE fan of the books, but i thought that the second movie was not very good. after watching this movie, i conclude that a lot of people that write these reviews will hate on it no matter what! i bet a lot of people didn't even see the movie. the movie is not perfect, but it is enjoyable and isn't predictable. the effects are pretty good, though not the best. the acting has improved in some areas (like rob pattinson) but Taylor laughtner is a weak point. i am not saying this will be an amazing movie, but it isn't awful. the story is better developed than the others, and you really feel for the characters. although, something that bothered me with all the movies: the actors all talk low and slowly.<br/><br/>overall, the movie is worth your while, and ignore haters that will not admit that this movie had good in it.<br/><br/>overall, 6.5/ 10"
"thelonelyone-744-580825","7","3","9","3 July 2010"," Good film to a certain extent
","the acting in this film was good, I have to say my favorite happened to be Bryce Dallas Howard who played ""Victoria"" however I thought that the main actors did a good job as well in their respective parts. Where the two spots that this movie fell down in were both towards the end of the film. Number one was the death of Victoria, I felt that the body looked Fake, as well as this. The last lines of the film when they were talking about telling Charlie the news of the impending wedding were a tad corny. Other than that the film was good and I still loved the computer animated werewolves, even though you can clearly see that they are animated, they have still been given a good amount of character and you quickly forget that they are merely pixels on a computer screen."

"mooshiegirl","8","4","14","2 July 2010"," Great movie if you are detached from the book.
","Much better acting, great graphics, outstanding music....but it was VERY different from the events in the book. This (out of all the books) developed Bella and Edward's characters the most and I feel that all got lost with the numerous changes made for the movie.<br/><br/>However, the movie by itself, is the best of the three. The budget increase was evident in the improved CGI. But in the most dramatic scenes, the background looked so obviously fake that it took away from the most pivotal acting. Oh, and Kristen Stewart's wig looked atrocious during the entire fight sequence. <br/><br/>There were a couple of pleasant surprises that book-fans will really appreciate! (okay, so I didn't really put any spoilers, but I was afraid of getting booted)"
"rabbyroo8","Null","4","14","30 June 2010"," Best One
","Gave it a ten. it probably isn't a 10 but it is definitely not a 1 which all these people are giving it. This is clearly the best one out of the twilight series. It's less talking and goes more. Got action and surprisingly a lot of funny moments. Easily the most entertaining twilight movie. Those fighting scenes were awesome. Seriously people just watch it. Talks a lil about some of the other Cullen's past which is cool. Who cares if u think the acting is so horrible. Is it really that terrible? If that's your only reason to bash the movie, then wow get off your high horse. I don't understand the negative reviews, that say things like ""once again, the twilight movie sucked"". if u didn't care for the previous ones, why are you spending more money to see it? I look at the dates of those posts and see it was the day it came out. Why did u rush out to see it, knowing u really didn't like the other ones? Or did u even see it? All the negatives sound way too made up."
"njoy828","8","4","15","1 July 2010"," Your already judging it simply because of the name.
","Eclipse is good. It's not great, it's not life changing relax, it's just a standard good film.<br/><br/>Obviously the budget's are getting bigger, therefore there are better stuns, better camera angles, better substance, and much better special effects.<br/><br/>The music is also a plus. And this film does something different and adds small character back stories (which were in the books) to the film. However since back stories from the twilight novel were cut from the twilight movie I didn't expect the film eclipse to add them in. But they did which was a very pleasant surprise and added something very new to the saga that none of its predecessors had done.<br/><br/>The movies are getting better. Each movie is developing, the acting is developing on everyone's part except for Taylor Lautner who was very dry in some scenes, weak in others, and then passed in a few. Stewart and Pattinson are getting better significantly with each film. Their chemistry is also very noticeable this time around.<br/><br/>Screenplay is the most highly developed element. Had the screenplay for the other films been written with this quality then maybe people wouldn't hate the saga simply because of its name and status in today's pop-cultural society. Close-mindedness is stopping a lot of people from admitting even the small things they do like about the film because they don't want to admit that they enjoyed it and fall into the crowd. swallow your pride and watch the film damn it. <br/><br/>Don't be an asshole. There are a lot of people I know who've read the books and enjoyed them but simply stopped liking them because it became a ""teen-phenomenon"" and are now closet appreciators or have denounced it completely and think its total garbage. What's there to be ashamed of? Top 2 reasons why people stopped liking the twilight saga.<br/><br/>1. The movies killed it. 2. ""Its all the rage"".<br/><br/>1. I understand, the first movie was completely ridiculous, but why that changed the way you feel about the book I don't get its not the author's fault people can't act or direct or manage to write a screenplay that depicts the depth to the novels (because there is a depth to the novels, I'll get to that later). She's not a terrible author. She's obviously a newbie. Did she know the books would get that big? Nope. So? Why are you bitching now? You read and bought the entire series but now that people think its gay your following suit? I had no problem admitting that the first movie completely let me down because it twisted the words that I read and displayed something that had no effort or heart. Not only that, it was so bad that I felt embarrassed. Embarrassed to say that I was looking for depth in something so melodramatic and shallow. And too embarrassed to admit that I'd been looking forward to see the film. But that didn't make me forget what I read or what I was hoping to see <br/><br/>2. There has always been depth to these novels. The thing about this series that's interesting is trying to figure out what Bella will do. It's a choice that all teenagers face to some degree. If you go this way, the outcomes are irreversible, if you go that way, the outcomes are still irreversible. That's the beauty of being a teenager, you steadily learn that life is based on your choice. And having the power of choice will always be overwhelming but its so much more magnified when your a teenager. But what's tragic for Bella is that she's not in a situation to test out option A and head towards option B if it doesn't work out. But Bella isn't lost she acknowledges her wants, she knows the risks and is willing to take them. This courage she has to follow her want and not the ""easy"" life that would appease the essential people that surround her is inspiring, because most are too afraid to take the such risks. But that doesn't make the ""what if's"" in her head rest in peace. The ""what if's"" will always be there -Jacob; the life she could have had with Jacob and what she feels for Jacob will always be significant- but, why live in a life being something you're not when you've got the opportunity of being who you honestly are? <br/><br/>I don't like how some say that the series give teenagers the wrong idea. What's so wrong here? Is the sexual tension wrong? Because I think people should start listening/reading the word's correctly. In this age/era/generation, sex is profited on. To me, women are being degraded, exploited, and are thinking less of themselves. Meyer took a leap of adding principle to his character. Edward made a tired tradition new again (at least for Bella), he made a big step in a girl's life (that is taken for granted now) beautiful again, he made sex seem ""important"" again. That it's not something you do to feel, its a stronger emotional bond that a relationship develops to experience. He did something that teenage girls have stopped doing for themselves; he respected Bella. And from that grew Bella's self-respect. Yes, I understand it is a hackneyed idea in this generation for a reason, but it would be nice if some of the self-respect teenagers had would come back, or at least be taught to them. It was that standard that made it so much more clear how precious Bella is to Edward. This is part of his appeal. Yes, he's a vampire, yes he's got the edge, yes he's the got looks, yes he's the got lines, but he's got something greater, he has the genuine qualities that a man should have; respectfulness, loyalty, integrity, and principle. What's the wrong message there? Isn't is a good thing to fight towards keeping a person like that in your life?"

","First of all to all the people that gave bad reviews even though they saw the first one didn't like it but went and saw the second one didn't like it then went and seen the third didn't like it and gave them all bad reviews what the point in going to see a movie if you didn't like the other parts to the movie in the first place thats just stupid. You write bad reviews when you where already set on saying you didn't like it!! <br/><br/>I loved it..I was a big fan of twilight and was a little disappointed that they left out quite a bit of detail from the book. but still was a good movie!! I was quite disappointed with new moon you didn't really get to see as much of the chemistry between Bella and Jacob in the movie as you do reading the book. In new moon Jacob falls in love with Bella but you barely see the chemistry building between them to know why? But was still good.<br/><br/>Eclipse i loved it is my favorite so far. i love the tent scene where Jacob is the heater and Jacob and Edward you could say sorta bond? the acting was better on all accounts and the flashbacks where good although i thought they could have let Rosalie's play on a little longer seeing as hers was so tragic! it was great to see things on jaspers side to hes a bit more involved in this movie!!and i want then to play Alice's past. the end where they fight in the meadow was better than i thought i didn't get to see it on the fist day it came out but when it came out i jumped online to read reviews and read some bad and good ones so decide to just go and decide for myself!! LOVE IT!! Over all Loved It Great Actors (Edward aka Robert the best)Bella could have done with a little more emotion but did well and was good to see they followed the book a bit more.. Overall would say if you like twilight go see it if you didn't like the first or second one (don't see how you couldn't not like them) don't bother because your already set not to like it!"

"weirdestwolf","7","3","10","9 July 2010"," Eclipse- better than the last two films.
","I do not claim to be a fan of the Twilight Saga- either for the movies, or the books. In my opinion, the writing of the books and the movies is mediocre and some parts of the story are rather shaky.<br/><br/>However, I do find the story sweet. To me, of course it is a story of a human girl who falls in love with a vampire and also has feelings for a werewolf, but it's also about the many different facets of love, and what they can lead to, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>So, obviously, I was frustrated with the first two films- I did not think that the writing allowed perfectly capable actors and actresses to portray the sweetness and humor of the story in full. It seemed like a shame- Kristen Stewart being my favorite actress, I had seen her in other films where she did a stellar job at acting her character. The scripts were written too darkly and kept the characters from developing into a three dimensional person, vampire, or werewolf.<br/><br/>From the first ten minutes I could tell that Eclipse was different- the characters were lighter and more real, and easier to take seriously. The acting improved ten fold with more realistic lines, and it was a visually pleasing film. Not to mention the soundtrack, which was simply to die for (at least for my musical tastes.) Of course, not everything could be rock solid, though. There were a couple chunks of dull long dialogue that slowed down the movie. However though, Eclipse being such a complicated story, I suppose some long dialogue was required to convey the plot to the audience, some of which had never read the books.<br/><br/>All in all I found it a very sweet and entertaining movie and would be pleased to see it again."
"Susie-daisy","10","3","10","5 July 2010"," Beautiful and very true to the book
","I read all these reviews before seeing this film. After reading a few I realised there was no point in reading more. I think because these movies are so intensely loved by fans and are so hugely talked about and promoted everywhere, people who don't get the craze can't stand it because whether you love them on not, the characters are everywhere you look and it can drive people crazy and cause them to have severe hate towards the whole thing if they don't understand the fuss. A lot of movie critics will write terrible reviews about this film, whether the films good or bad, its just what movie critics do, so I wouldn't take anything they say seriously. Anyway, Eclipse. I've read all books, I'm team Edward, Eclipse is my favourite book. I was nervous about this film, the trailers I watched had me worried. But it was actually very true to the book(as much as a 2 hour movie can be to a 628 page book)I had previously thought the Bella/Edward scenes in New Moon were okay, but after seeing Eclipse I realised they weren't. The Bella/Edward scenes in Eclipse are beautiful, you can tell the actors have really grown into there characters and also feel so comfortable working together. The camera angles, the music, it all really works in Eclipse. David Slade has surprised me. I just wish they'd get rid of the Vampire contact lenses. The ones from Twilight were fine. If your a Twilight fan, I don't understand if you find yourself not enjoying this film. If your not a Twilight fan, I still don't get how you could find yourself hating it, your just being stubborn and possibly even immature. But if you do find yourself disliking it, fair enough, forget about it and move on with your life, instead of all the others who seem to hate it so much they can't stop talking about it. Overall I'm gonna say Eclipse is the best out of 3. The acting is amazing. I'm so impressed by how well these actors have understood the characters, especially Edward as he's a touch character to portray properly and I don't think many people would be able to get it right, but Robert Pattinson manages to play the beautiful vampire just the way it should be and for that I love him."
"luberoi","10","3","10","5 July 2010"," Favorite so far!
","I loved it! I think that David Slade did a really great job putting this film together. It follows the book really closely. I found that it developed the relationship between Bella and Edward more. I am totally ""Team Edward"" so I enjoyed that part of it. <br/><br/>I didn't really love Jacob in the book and although I love Taylor Lautner as Jacob, I find his character to be a bit of a whiner. It bothered me in the book and even more so in the movie.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a Twilight fan. I saw it in IMAX and it was so amazing.<br/><br/>I had read the book about Bree and felt immensely sorry for her at the end. I would have loved to have more of her character but realize they can't fit in everything.<br/><br/>Loved it and can't believe I have to wait another year and a half for the first part of Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>Patience is a virtue, so they say :)"
"iconic87","5","3","10","4 July 2010"," Was The Best Twilight Movie Yet! And Wasn't Bad?
","I'm not a die hard fan or fan boy at all, i saw the previous two and was interested to see what would happen next. Overall it was the best out of the three. So whether you are or not a fan of this film series it is still worth seeing if your in the mood for some vampire and werewolf action. And as i said before i saw the previous two and if you saw them to then you really should check this one out it's actually not that bad. I was pretty surprised. Although in some prespectives i thought they could have made it better, but then again no movie is perfect. A lot of people rag on it for no reason. All in all a good movie to see with some friends."
"scawy_bear","8","3","10","3 July 2010"," Loved the books, Hated Twilight movie, Loved Eclipse.
","OK, so I don't quite consider myself a twi-hard, nor a Twilight Mum, I guess I fall somewhere in between the age categories for both, but I did LOVE the books. Yes I think they could have been written better, but for a new author she did a great job with a wonderful story. I Hated the movie version of Twilight, as far as I'm concerned the casting agent needs to be SHOT IN THE HEAD!! Bella is WRONG WRONG WRONG, they should have actually picked someone who could act. Rosalie is even worse, c'mon, Rosalie is supposed to be beautiful beyond compare, all I see on the screen is a drag queen! and in Eclipse she looks even worse. Eclipse the movie is so far the best of the 3 movies, they did actually keep to the story of the book where Twilight and New Moon failed, they added enough about Riley and Bree for those who have read the new Bree Tanner book, and skipped enough of the more boring bits to make it fit into a movie sized package. In short, 8/10, would have been more if Kristen could act and Nikki wasn't made to look like a man in drag."
"jacob-l-williams","6","3","10","3 July 2010"," One of the most romantic films ever?
","Eclipse the third in the 'Twilight Saga' as it is now called is by far the best one of the three films. As I wrote in my review for the two former films they were both beautifully filmed and acted but I didn't really connect with the characters and found it all to be a bit slow, in Eclipse this is not the case.<br/><br/>The beauty of the other two is still there; once again the colour is immense with the scenes in the snow often hurting my eyes which is a good thing, I just don't understand why more filmmakers aren't abusing colour in the way Twilight because in the films its really effective. The soundtrack is also good with Muse, Metric and Florence & The Machine (three brilliant bands) all putting there music down for this.<br/><br/>What this film does better is that unlike the other two it actually starts straight away and you are instantly intrigued by this newborn vampire. However it is not this that gets me, it was the pure romance on display all the way through the film. Now I'm generally not the biggest fan of romance but this inter-species love is portrayed in a way that you couldn't help but feel for the characters, the way its done is far better than in the other two and the three main actors are growing into their characters with each film.<br/><br/>The only let down is that like the others Bella - played by Kristen Stewart - comes across as a total bitch when she says the line ""I love you both"" I actually felt really angry and wanted to throw something at the screen, I do not believe it's possible too love two people so obviously she doesn't love either of them or is lying to one. <br/><br/>Other than this minor let down though it is by far the best of the three and I have to say I am looking forward to the final installment because I know that even if the plot like in the previous is rubbish I will be able to admire the beauty of what can be achieved in colour and cinematography with modern technology.<br/><br/>8/10"

Plus in Breaking Dawn part 2 I really wanna see how different Bella is as a newborn vampire, she's less clumsy,and she's really more aware of everything and then when they gather the witnesses for Renesmee...AWESOME! The series is just very well thought out and it's brilliant! Stephenie Meyer is a genius!!!!! <br/><br/>Team Edwardd! :)"
"michelle_barmer","10","3","11","16 July 2010"," Amazing - in so many ways...
","Absolutely Amazing! It was breathtaking and enchanting how extremely well all the characters from the Twilight Saga was brought to life in Eclipse. I am very impressed with David Slade's vision of the movie and how well he managed to tie everything together. When you leave the Theatre you know that David Slade is a director who really did understand the book. Thank you David for making this Twilight experience exceptional. <br/><br/>I don't care what critics say - the acting was better than great. Kristen does an amazing job when she portrays Bella's confusion as she is second-guessing her choice to become a vampire. It is brilliant how Kristen manages to communicate the confusion through great acting – without countless monologues or dialogues to explain her emotions. That's what I call acting! Taylor Lautner was also great. His character could easily have been tiresome after New Moon but he managed to keep Jacob interesting. Last but not least – Robert. There aren't enough words to explain how perfect his portrayal of Edward in this movie is. He brings the character to life in such an astonishing fashion that he is worthy of all praise. Thank you Robert for that breathtaking experience! <br/><br/>But it wasn't only the main characters that made this movie great – everyone in the cast should get their fare share of admiration. The Cullens where fantastic – I loved the fact that they where so three-dimensional. The acting and storyline made you fall in love with the whole Cullen clan - just as one does when reading the books. <br/><br/>Eclipse is a stunning cinematic experience and a Hollywood Epic!"
"taylc022","10","3","11","16 July 2010"," Eclipse = EPIC
","Eclipse was amazing. i went into the film as a team Edward girl but in some scenes i really felt for Jacob as he knew Bella loved him and i think subconsciously she knew too. however I'm a Edward girl and Robert acted even better in this film. The chemistry between him and Kristen was real and you could see that. The plot of the film is that there are many murders happening in Seattle and the Cullen family realise it is a new born army being built up by a local boy named Riley. While this is happening Bella is ungrounded as long as she sees other friends and not just Edward. Bella visits and hangs out with Jake much to Edwards disgust and disapproval. Basically Victoria is back and wants Bella dead, Jake and the wolves team up to kill the army and Victoria. Jake tricks Bella into kissing him. Bella makes Edward stay during the fight which i think is wrong but can understand why.... The vampires and wolves win however Jake gets injured in the fight and declares that he will fight for Bella until her hearts stops beating bless him >3 Bella tells him that its Edward and always has been. At the end of the movie Bella declares why she has chosen Edward and its basically because she acts more herself around him and not what she feels she should be which is what she would be if she was with JACOB. Basically it ends with Edward proposing and Bella saying yes and then declaring that they have to tell Charlie oh the horror!"

With that said, I will say that this movie, so far, is the best of the series. If you're a true fan of the series, you'll thoroughly enjoy the movie, even though there are things that MS changed. <br/><br/>I still don't understand why people who hate Twilight go and see the movies in the first place. If you don't like the books, there's a high chance you're not going to like the movies either. And there are going to be die-hard fans that are going to whine that the movie isn't exactly like the book, but that's hard to ask especially since the book is so long and the movie isn't.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, and I will be seeing it again. I definitely recommend it also."
"zardoz-13","10","3","11","11 July 2010"," ""Eclipse"" Eclipses ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon""
","Stephenie Meyers and the people producing the cinematic adaptations of her supernatural ""Twilight"" novels know how to stretch a good thing out. Happily, the elasticity in this interspecies romance franchise hasn't frayed over the last two blockbuster films. The outstanding third installment, ""30 Days of Night"" director David Slade's ""Eclipse"" literally eclipses both ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"" with more action that either predecessor boasted. Not only do the pugnacious werewolves look more realistic, but also ""Twilight"" scenarist Melissa Rosenberg has intensified the competition in the three-way romance between Bella and her two jealous suitors Edward and Jacob. Indeed, Edward and Jacob have at least two substantial, well-written scenes where they analyze their behavior toward each other in light of Bella. They spar without touching each other. Mind you, the narrative is somewhat predictable because Bella still yearns to be a vampire while Edward staunchly opposes her obsession. Basically, the action is unfinished business. When Edward isn't trying to discourage Bella's desire to be undead, Jacob struggles to convince her that she really loves him. He argues that nothing serious will change if she chooses him over Edward. Some of the narrative threads left over from ""Twilight"" that were partially tied up in ""New Moon"" are mopped up here in ""Eclipse."" The evil Victoria has been biding her time to exact sweet revenge on Edward for destroying her vampire lover James. Further, the Volturi lurk on the fringe of the mayhem with malice aforethought. <br/><br/>""Eclipse"" opens in Seattle where twentysomething Forks native Riley Biers (Xavier Samuels of ""Road Kill"") leaves a restaurant after dark during a light downpour. He is attacked without warning by an unseen assailant in a lonely alley. No matter what Riley tries to do, he cannot elude his attacker. Indeed, we can see little more than Riley, just a blur of something menacing him. On the docks, the mysterious attacker slashes at Riley's hand, and he winds up writhing in agony. ""Eclipse"" gets off to a grim start, but things lighten up as the scene shifts to Forks in a meadow where Bella and Edward discussing matters of the heart. Interestingly, the film concludes with them back in the meadow as a prelude to the last ""Twilight"" movie ""Breaking Dawn."" Meanwhile, Bella's poor father, Forks County Sheriff Charlie (Billy Burke of ""Jane Austen's Mafia!""), doesn't have a clue about Edward and Bella's relationship. Basically, Charlie would like to see Bella see somebody other than Edward and prods her to visit Jacob. Naturally, Edward abhors every second that Bella spends with Jacob. He assures Bella that he trusts her, but he puts no trust in Jacob. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, clairvoyant Alice (Ashley Greene of ""King of California"") has a vision about the trouble in Seattle, but she cannot put her finger on who is stirring up the trouble. Eventually, the Cullens learn that an army of newborns is being assembled in Seattle, but they don't know who is behind them. After a time, they learn that Forks native Riley Biers, who has been reported as missing, may be at the core of the problem. Predictably, Edward tries to shield Bella from the truth, but he doesn't get any help from Jacob. Earlier, Edward and Bella flew to Florida so she could spend time with her mom. During their absence, the vampires fractured the treaty with the Indians. They were pursuing fleet-footed, high jumping Victoria through the forest when she hurls herself across a stream into werewolf country. Emmett Cullen (Kellan Lutz of ""Accepted"") found himself face-to-face with a snarling werewolf while Victoria gave both of them the slip. Not surprisingly, Jacob is appalled that Edward hasn't told Bella about the incident or that it was Victoria. Essentially, Jacob and his tribe enter the fight when they learn that vampires may storm the country. Of course, neither the newborns nor the Volturi know anything about Jacob and his shape-shifting werewolves.<br/><br/>The violence in ""Eclipse"" is quite stylized. When the vampires attack each other, they look like they are playing a game of old-fashioned football where the goal is to batter the opponents more than score a touchdown. The fatal blows that are delivered make it look like our heroes are smashing live-action statues. Not only do the vampires never bare their fangs, but also the blood and gore are confined within the limits of a PG-13 rating. According to Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli of ""Supernova""), these 'newborn' vampires pose a threat because they are actually stronger than either the Cullens or any other vampire because they still have some of their own human blood in their system. They live to the hilt of their existence and they have a difficult time keeping a low profile. If you remember ""New Moon,"" you will remember that the law of the Volturi, the Supreme Count of Vampires, condemns any fangster that calls attention to themselves or their breed. <br/><br/>The thing that holds this Gothic melodrama together so well is the theme of change. ""Eclipse"" examines Bella's decision to renounce life in favor of becoming a vampire and the various opinions that the Cullen clan as well as Jacob offer about it. Like previous ""Twilight"" directors, David Slade seems to know when to let the drama dominate and the violence roar. Nevertheless, Slade also knows when to insert humor that lightens the mood without overexposing anything. Moreover, ""Eclipse"" provides a glimpse into the lives of Jasper Whitlock and Rosalie Hale and how they became vampires. The school graduation speech that Jessica Stanley delivers is refreshingly different. ""New Moon"" lenser Javier Aguirresarobe encores as director of photography, and he creates a palate of moody colors that reflect the tension and the atmosphere. He also captures the pictorial beauty of the surroundings as well as the luminous cast with his widescreen compositions. In short, ""Eclipse"" qualifies as a grand looking movie."

"Buddy-51","6","2","6","12 May 2011"," uneven entry in the ""Twilight"" saga
","Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament – should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? – has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, ""New Moon""), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation. She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move – eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up – her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own. The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control ""newborn"" vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves – bitter, sworn enemies of one another – to join forces in defeating them.<br/><br/>These ""Twilight"" films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like ""True Blood,"" as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way. And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way. Still they do have their moments."

","For me, Twilight series is easy to under-appreciate.<br/><br/>My comment re Twilight 1 relates to the movie series and my comment re Twilight 2 relates more to my experiences of the novels. This relates to the movie series leading to me discovering Kristen as an actress.<br/><br/>I discovered the Twilight Saga because some episodes include Dakota.<br/><br/>A lot of Kristen's stuff is available in affordable, to me, second hand copies and that allowed me to spend several months getting to know her other stuff. It includes a lot that is really okay.<br/><br/>Eclipse commentary mentions a film that K S and Jodelle Ferland had both acted in. I had to try to get that and it was available as a relatively low cost second hand blu-ray. K S has the lead and I found this to be one of her best movies. I preferred it to Twilight Saga 1, but now consider them both to be good but different.<br/><br/>This made me discover more and I found that I already had two on DVD, features that I had considered as memorable. K S was starting to seem to be rather hot. It was definitely not my early reaction to the Twilight series that showed me that but The Messengers and Panic Room and Zathura.<br/><br/>The other stories seem to mostly have some common elements, with the possible exception of Jumper, where K S appears at the end in a minimal role, as if a cameo appearance. Of these I currently prefer Fierce People and The Safety Of Objects and Cold Creek Manor and Mission Without Permission and In The Land Of Women and The Cake Eaters and Snow White And The Huntsman, but that is just personal taste. Also the difficult Adventureland and The Runaways, easy to follow stories that pose difficult questions re how a storyteller needs to describe real realities."
"pollyannalady","9","3","12","11 July 2010"," Eclipse - Bella's Lullaby?
","Overall, I REALLY liked the movie. I've read all the books. Eclipse probably being my favorite. At this point, I'm kinda 'over' the love triangle. So, lets focus on the other characters and aspects of the movie for a change...<br/><br/>The effects:<br/><br/>Loved the 'sparkle' effect in Eclipse! Best yet!<br/><br/>I really liked the wolves in Eclipse. In New Moon they were beautiful - but HUGE! Like, the size an elephant huge! I know the book describes them as big. But I thought they were ridiculously big in New Moon. In Eclipse, their size was better. Or maybe they were the same size, but just looked better? I don't know. <br/><br/>The fight scene was great! Maybe a bit brief, but great! I like the way David Slade handled the vampire's speed in Eclipse. Probably the best so far, to me. <br/><br/>David Slade did a great job on the cinematography. Especially with Jasper's back story. That whole thing was beautiful! <br/><br/>Twilight had an obvious 'blue' tint to it. New Moon was 'red'. Eclipse is the first movie in the series that didn't seem to distract me with color. Good job!<br/><br/>The make-up was also really good overall. Except, it seemed like nearly all the actors needed their eyebrows trimmed! Bella's wig was only distracting for about 10 minutes. Then I got over it. Jasper's wig/hairstyle grew on me as well. A big improvement over the way he looked in New Moon (for the minute and a half that he was in the movie).<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>I am a Team Edward person. The character of Jacob bugs the 'heck' out of me! Especially in New Moon (the book). Talyor does a good job with his role anyway. Beyond that, I'm probably Team Alice/Jasper. I just love them so much.<br/><br/>Ashley and Jackson have great chemistry and are so sweet (as their characters) in Eclipse. It was so great to see Jasper's character fleshed out in the movie. That was probably my favorite part. Jackson did a WONDERFUL job with his work in Eclipse; as did Nikki. <br/><br/>Billy Burke as Charlie was spot on. He makes me laugh. When Charlie gets between Edward & Jacob to cool off the fight...I thought that was so funny. A human cop stopping a vampire & werewolf from ripping each other apart! Awesome.<br/><br/>The 'wolf pack' as actors are all really good. Leah & Seth are nice additions.<br/><br/>The tent scene was very nice too.<br/><br/>Musical Score:<br/><br/>So far, Twilight had the best score/soundtrack. Maybe I missed it; but I didn't hear 'Bella's Lullaby' at all in Eclipse? Did anybody remember hearing it? There was 'Clare de Lune' playing in the background at the Cullen house in one scene. But, nothing of the lullaby? That's unfortunate or maybe an oversight?<br/><br/>I hope the DVD has great special features??? Looking forward to it. <br/><br/>Peace!"

"bricescott46","10","3","12","5 July 2010"," Best Movie of the Year....With Some Flaws
","In my opinion I think that Eclipse was the best movie I've seen all year. Although it is clear to see that the movie goes by the same story line as the last two ( with tweaks ), that is what it's supposed to do. Hello... its a sequel, that's the whole point of a sequel-to pick up where something left off.<br/><br/>In Eclipses defense I say that it was a good movie. The acting was wellplayed out and produced and the action sequences were beautifully put together. I can honestly say that the directer David Slade did a good job of getting the aspects from the book correct, but I can say that I was disappointed on a couple of things they left out and a couple things I DID NOT WANT TO SEE...one of them being-seeing Taylor Lautner BUTT NAKED. And though I enjoyed the movie I could go without seeing Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson suck face a whole hour of the movie and again seeing Taylor Lautner with his shirt off. Past that the movie was a great success. Harry Potter, step aside because unlike you we don't want to have 12 movies where you do the same thing over and over again."
"megzie-x","10","3","12","5 July 2010"," If you don't like the movies, why keep coming back for more?!
","I can quite happily announce that I am a Twihard, and for me, this movie was definitely the best of the three so far. If you're not a Twilight fan, and do not like the films, why keep going to watch them? By giving the movie a '1 star', is definitely rating it unfairly, due to the fact that you don't like the saga. Give the film a fair, overall rating so that others can have a real idea of what they are going to expect.<br/><br/>On the ratings, there has been mostly males rating this movie? Okay, I think everyone here knows that this saga has a wider female audience, so here is a factor which adds to the unfair rating it has been given. We know men are less keen on the Twilight Saga! <br/><br/>If you're a Twihard,then this film is brilliant! It stays true to the books and is visually incredible! Everything is there! If you are not a fan, please stop wasting your time writing bogus reviews, because we know you don't like the films! I just don't understand why you keep watching them? hmmm."

I saw one guy that gave 1star for special effects well I can't give 1 point for special effects since they were really bad, but since they don't allow me to use 0 for rating I suppose 1 is more than fair.<br/><br/>As another dude said, if you want vampires and werewolves watch True Blood, I am adding that any 6 hours you take from the TV show are way better than the 3 Twilight movies put together."
"HelenMary","6","2","7","20 May 2013"," the best of the Twilight films - but still not great
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). <br/><br/>Out of the films, this was my favourite. As most with most of the films - and general comments translate across the franchise - there's not much to it but the interaction/rivalry between Edward and Jacob makes for fun watching, and often quite humorous. The increased interaction with the Quileutes and their mythologies is possibly the most interesting part of the entire five films and there's a lot of it in this film. Bella's increased to-and-fro with all the angst about her future is tiring as her reactions as no less stilted and limited than at the start. You'd think her character would develop. Edward at least has the excuse that he's dead! It's an entertaining film, a big, cinematic piece as with all the others with lovely panoramic scenes, but it's not great."
"crvida3","5","2","7","21 July 2010"," 50/50
","Having read all of the Twilight books a long time before the films were mentioned, I can say that I at least appreciate that it's hard to please everyone when it comes to making a film adaptation of a book, whether that book is popular or not. As I found the first and second films rather cringe-worthy at times due to the acting, I did personally quite like that the producers stuck as close to the book as was possible, and quite a few points that were vague in the book are explained somewhat in the film to which I would go 'Oh yeah, I get that now!' I've always been a grouch when films waver somewhat erratically from their written roots, but fans of the books and the previous films will most likely appreciate the attention to detail that has been a constant throughout the previous films. However, as I mentioned previously (and I hate to admit it as I for one am a lover of cheesy films) I found the acting at times to be quite amateur for such a popular franchise; Stewart just doesn't seem to quite hit the undying love mark that we've seen in other films, and at times I wonder if her chin will actually begin to graze the floor due to the amount of time her mouth is hanging open in what is meant to be a shocked/thoughtful expression; in actuality it comes across as making her look rather gormless and is an annoying little feature that winds me up throughout all of the Twilight films. Unlike the previous two films, I found Eclipse to keep up a decent pace throughout its entirety which is always a plus point for such a lengthy film, and the scenery of it is just amazing; they really picked a beautiful place to film Eclipse- some of this film is jaw-dropping in its beauty. Although, at the end of the day, the beauty in the surroundings means nothing when the dialogue feels empty. It is very rare that you find a film of such popularity to have such dead dialogue in it; rarely when the actors are talking on-screen do you actually feel the emotions that they're meant to be portraying, and for that reason I couldn't really let myself be absorbed into the film, and ended up watching it with half-hearted interest."
"radu-andreea30","9","2","7","8 July 2010"," Better that I expected
","After reading so many terrible comments addressed to this movie I just gave up any expectation but went to the cinema from curiosity. I knew already the story from the books. However, the movie was better than I expected. It followed quite closely the story of the book. I consider it a better performance than New Moon. Jacob must have got more used to his role as he's acting much better than in the first two movies:)) I think he is the only one who progressed actually. Bela is really acting in the same style, almost a bit boring and Edward used to seem more involved in the first movie. There is nothing deep or completely impressing going on but still it's a nice movie to watch, even funnier if you take your boyfriend along. Enjoy it!"

","OK, so i was a late bloomer into the book craze, i read the first one about 3 weeks after it came to theaters (i read the book before i saw it), but then ate up the other books, one right after the other! Yes, i am an adult, and i loved the books, but strictly for the joys of getting lost in a story, they are by far not amazingly written or anything like that, so don't start busting my chops about literature, OK.... but, as i was saying, i loved the books, but the movies....Twilight, decent, it was nice to see the characters visually, i think they did a decent casting job. I love Kristen Stewart as Bella, and i think Rob Pattinson is great for Edward...but i think the lack comes from the directors and the screenplay writers Saying that, i thought New Moon was actually pretty bad...i reserved my copy of Twilight on DVD and haven't even considered purchasing New Moon, maybe by the time Eclipse comes out on DVD i'll get it.<br/><br/>but back to the topic, i actually enjoyed Eclipse a lot. <br/><br/>Yes, like the other reviews, there was a LOT of story left out. It did seem too fast and too slow at the same time. However, the makeup i actually thought was decent this time! Twilight you could see the makeup on everyone, New Moon, not that much vampire work, so not that big of a deal, and Eclipse, i actually like the stylization of the vampires...they were meant to look a little stony and not just white. Yes, the score sucked, the sound editing could have been a little smoother, and the transitions between scenes should have been a little more blatant sometimes. However, as these movies go, i really did enjoy this. Maybe they'll release an extended version DVD to fill in some of the gaps, or maybe, now that they are doing Breaking Dawn in two films, they extend some of the Eclipse story into Breaking Dawn. Anyway, it was fun, i'd go see it again."
"MultiColouredRed","7","3","13","1 July 2010"," It surprised me...
","We all need to remember that it is a Twilight Series film that we are reviewing here. It never has, and never will be, a great piece of art. By giving this the rating I have I am in no way comparing it to silver screen legends. It will never stand the face of time, and this rating is purely based on how enjoyable I found the experience of watching it, keeping a comparison of the previous two in mind. Remember that there is only so much a director and screenwriter can do with the material they are given (which in this case, as anyone who has read the novels will know, is pages upon pages of lovelorn fluff and faux danger). To me, anyone that could make something remotely entertaining and enjoyable from this source material is a sheer genius.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think David Slade is one. Very rarely could I see his true cinematic tact and I did feel that he held back a lot in creating this one. This was definitely not his true artistic vision. However, of all three directors who have taken the reigns on these projects, his work is by far the superior of the three. Melissa Rosenberg also surprised me in this one. Despite never really being a fan of her work and still believing that she is probably the worst thing that happened to these movies, the fact that she included many humorous and tongue- in-cheek moments within the goofy dialogue actually made watching the film slightly less cringe-worthy than the previous two.<br/><br/>Perhaps these factors, mixed with the inclusion of probably the closest idea of a real plot line that the series will ever have, actually surprised me in creating what I would say is a fairly enjoyable film. I am not going to lie, there were still strings of dialogue that literally had me cringing in my seat, but they were much fewer and farther between than we saw in New Moon. The storyline felt as if it was constantly in motion; it never sat stagnating on the screen. Just when a sequence became a little too drawn out, it would move right along nicely. Most important of all, I actually felt that these characters, for the first time, truly felt for one another - particularly recurring non-main characters like Alice and Jasper.<br/><br/>Look, its obviously not the best film I've ever seen, but it did keep me fairly entertained for two hours and I did find myself, in a series first, actually engaging with the characters. Twilight and New Moon felt oddly detached and indifferent to me, but this one seemed to stick. I actually smiled and laughed and FELT for them where I previously hadn't. I've never sympathized with the characters and watching this I felt just a glimmer of a connection. Just a glimmer, mind you. It should honestly be much more than that."
"apesmarie","6","3","13","30 June 2010"," Better than the Book
","So this movie was not amazing by any means, but I believe a 1 or 2 out of 10 is a little harsh. If you are a twihard you will be a little disappointed but your not going to cry about it for days. I've read all the books and the third was my least favorite, so naturally i was expecting it to be pretty bad and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. It still has the corny lines that it did in previous movies and in the books however, it does not make it a horrible movie. it just give's you something to laugh at. So I believe that if you have seen the first two and enjoyed them or if you have read the book, or labeled yourself as a ""team Jacob"" or ""team Edward"" you will enjoy this movie at least a little."
"Robert_duder","7","2","8","15 January 2012"," Continues to be better than the first but still a travesty in acting
","What can I say about Eclipse that I didn't already cover in Twilight and New Moon. This is no different than those two films and my comments on them will be identical. So really you can look up my reviews for those two movies and find out exactly how I feel about this one. Literally nothing has changed. The story is perhaps a little better with a new killer victimizing the people of Forks. The action is better than the first and about the same as New Moon as well so if you preferred New Moon over Twilight than this one will keep you equally as entertained.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into great deal with the cast. Everyone is the same as they have always been in the series. I will say that Robert Pattinson gives a slightly better performance than ever before. He is still creepy (and not in a good way) obsessive, melodramatic but its toned down just a little bit. Kristen Stewart's Bella is perhaps a little one dimensional in Eclipse compared to previous films but it does feel like she is maturing as a character.<br/><br/>Yet another director takes over, David Slade, who comes to us from music videos and you can see that style especially in some of the fight sequences. The special effects are a little better than ever before which is a good sign. Basically this series gets just a little better with each instalment but at the same time it will never become a 'good' movie. Despite that the series has generated over a billion dollars so who am I to speak but it speaks testament to good marketing and mass hysteria because this is a B-Movie at best and completely ignorable for the most part. 7/10"

","I'm a guy and I think this movie is good, great actually. So I can't say I understand why so many guys are against it.<br/><br/>Yes the love triangle is kinda cheesy but if you look past that this movie has a lot more to offer. It offers a new twist about not only vampires and also the werewolves and, to my knowledge, it is the only vampire movie that actually proposes that vampires can choose to be good, or rather not evil, by not killing humans.<br/><br/>Also I like it uses the native Americans beliefs in animals spirits to explain what werewolves are instead of the usual bloodthirsty animals that always ends up being killed.<br/><br/>As for this movie in the series I think it is the best. A big battle between werewolves and vampires and as always those evil head vampire clan in the background. Just wish there was more of action and intrigues and less of Bella and her love feelings... really don't care much about that. Other than that I think it is a great movie!"
"Rizar","Null","2","8","3 November 2010"," The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010, PG 13)
","The Twilight movies (so far) began with a vampire's dangerous love. Edward's romantic intensity boiled his undead instincts to their max and attached him to Bella beyond his control. In an unguarded moment, Edward might uncontrollably drink Bella's blood. Most of this is absent from ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,"" the third movie in the saga. Hidden behind artful landscapes (waterside sunsets, firelight chats, dark vampire nights, green forest fields, snowy mountains) and flashy, humorous sequences is a hollow and wordy love triangle that had fantastic potential.<br/><br/>Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has a way of getting into mortal danger. Again she's hunted by vampires. Victoria, from the second movie, ""New Moon,"" wants revenge for the death of her lover. But it will take Riley's army of vampires (and a little luck avoiding the Volturi, an order to the most powerful vampires) to get past the Cullen family led vampires and Jacob's werewolves.<br/><br/>Riley (Xavier Samuel) uses a new weapon and it's probably the best fantasy idea in the movie. A mysterious, deceitful, and smart vampire is able to breed new vampires and control them for short periods of time like puppets. New vampires are ultra powerful (stronger than regular vampires, or werewolves even), uncontrollably thirsty for blood, and known for mass killing if they are left without guidance after their conversion. Vampires and werewolves unite to defend Bella against the army. Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) has experience with controlling them and helps train the Cullens and the werewolves to deal with the new born vampires.<br/><br/>Much of the plot involves an ongoing romance triangle. Enter Edward (Robert Pattinson): all of our knowledge of Edward, the 100+ year old vampire, comes in glimpses and mostly from the point of view of other characters. His character sort of hovers around waiting, and waiting for the last two movies, without us getting to know much about his inner world (perhaps he's like a stage under construction left with minimal shape or feature). Traditional marriage (abstinence, for example) and Bella's safety are the main things he functions to promote. But maybe if we dig deeper, we could find something more about him in Bella's interesting confession.<br/><br/>Edward is so other worldly and so non-human, for Bella, he stands for an existence other than the normal mortal one. Bella doesn't just love Edward and want to be a vampire; she wants to be a vampire for her own reasons (and happens to love Edward too). Bella feels strange in the human world. She's more comfortable with a vampire's embrace and feels natural in it. But all of this is difficult to put on a poster or to frame in a close up, so none of this spoils anything important because David Slade's film doesn't get to any interesting uses of it.<br/><br/>Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a werewolf, further complicates the triangle. He wants Bella to choose him over Edward for the sake of his warm, beating heart and normal life (of the living). Plus he hints that werewolves sometimes imprint on humans and they would do anything for their loved one once imprinted. (Perhaps he would be as much a puppet as Edward is from his love for Bella, or as a new born vampire is for blood.) Some of Jacob's scenes are shirtless, muscle poses while others are humorous or warm exchanges with Bella or Edward. His wordy dialog says a lot but doesn't mean much of interest; it certainly doesn't give the viewer much sense of aggression, action, comfort, etc., that characterized him in the novel.<br/><br/>One final complaint is about the spacing of characters: in the mountain scenes, it was a bit difficult to tell where characters were without the help of dialog. Is Edward watching Bella and Jacob kiss? Is Jacob running fast enough through the forest to adequately spread his scent and successfully hide Bella?<br/><br/>The film is certainly made for fans and audiences familiar with the world. Don't try to count the number of references based on other Twilight movies, but this didn't seem harmful to the story. Some of the best parts were the snowy battle scenes, the dark vampire setups/intros, the werewolf battle attacks, and Riley's mastery of newly bred vampires. But the villainous vampires were not as scary as they could be. The high body count of supposedly immortal vampires makes you wonder whether Bella and Edward should argue so much about whether (or when) to transform her to a vampire. It was a bit more enjoyable to watch than ""New Moon,"" but it still didn't deliver highly interesting characters (besides Bella) or well developed ideas."

The acting was better, special effects were more believable, and it might actually be considered an good movie to someone who wasn't obsessed with the books. My local newspaper even rated it a 9/10, while the first two were a 4/10 and a 6/10. Still a long way to go to measure up to the books, but if the movies keep improving the last one (second part of Breaking Dawn) might actually be pretty great."
"JVMblaamaba","6","2","8","19 July 2010"," Mediocre at best but not the worst film ever.
","The Twilight Saga gets much hate from people and a lot of love from fangirls but in this addition in the Twilight Series it is the best in the series. Not saying it is a good film, it is still bad but it has done much better then the previous installments. The Characters are from what we have learned from the previous films but the interesting part of this film is that Edward and Jacob are the ones that develop the most and there is a scene where we see the two actually not hate each other and actually talk and develop but the next scene they be hatin each other. Bella still has no character or great development at all. The only character I liked in this film and really wish he had more screen time would be Jasper. Jasper is probably the best in the series but his screen time in the films are cut short, I'll return to why I liked Jasper later on in story. The Two Antagonists of the film is a red head vampire named Victoria who did nothing at all! In Twilight she hanged out with the bad vampires and then wanted to get revenge for a death of her lover. In New Moon... shes in the film for 3 minutes and doesn't do anything for the film! In Eclipse she does nothing for like an hour of the film and then finally talks to another Antagonist named Riley who as well only forms an army and falls for Victoria after knowing her for two minutes, very lame and underdeveloped character. Victoria really had no part in the film but to be the bad guy and run around a lot. The Story is simple but goes on for way to long! Most of the film consists of Bella and Edward talking... Jacob and Bella talking... and talking! Until finally an hour or so in the film the plot is finally set in about a vampire army and then... More Talking! Its mostly character development scenes for most of the film until there are two interesting parts in the film, the first being a blond female vampire who tells her backstory about how she became a vampire which actually was a good part in the film but the best was the backstory of Jasper in which played strong and I liked, it sucked it was so quick though because I really enjoyed watching the backstory. Basically its all dialogue scenes until the action between the good vampires and werewolves finally kicks in to fight the bad vampires. The action scenes are really good and well done and well shot. The ending is short and sweet as this could have been the beginning of the film right here! There could have been no conflict if Bella didn't screw around with everyone in this movie. Overall this film was not the worst film ever, it is bad but mediocre at best with exceptional acting, alright cinematography, and a very slow plot. I wouldn't watch it again."
"montanacork","5","2","8","19 July 2010"," -throws hands up in the air- get over it, not everyone will be pleased with these movies.
","If you were reading this, hoping to read yet another, complaining of how Kirsten Stewart has no emotion and cant act, or that Taylor Lautner's abs have gone from 6 to 4 pack, you should go along to read the other 300+ reviews.<br/><br/>Movies of books most of the time NEVER live up to the book itself. The reason for that is because we paint a specific picture in our head of the characters and how they would look acting out the chapter. Everyone is different on how they read a book. Different picture+Everyones different = no one can be satisfied. Yes, the series itself cant even hold a candle to the Harry Potter books, but I see why it's loved by millions of teenager girls(and boys, I don't judge) because Edward is what most girls picture as a perfect boyfriend. Beautiful, Gentlemen, Loving, Kind, Willing to die for you, Madly in Love, and to look at you as if you are the only girl in the world. Even I was sorta bedazzled the way Edward looks in my mind, the way he takes care of her, worries about her, shows pain in his eyes when Jacob tries to get in the way of there love. I understand quite well of how many girls daydream if they were in Bella's shoes. But, for me, that isn't enough to push me to love the books. The movie itself is not half bad: the fighting scenes are pretting intense, enough to make me think it looks real, its MUCH better then the first two movies, and I think Kristin Stewart did a good job portraying Bella Swan. Remember, the character of Bella Swan is an awkward girl, that which matches Kristen perfectly. But, her way of showing her emotion, is like everyone else says, very sad. She is a very good actress, but this movie of her is low on her best movies acted in. Robert Patison, ugh..For me, he doesn't give out the fire that bleeds threw the pages of the Twilight books. I don't think there is really any emotion/physical connection on screen. For me, he isn't the same actor mentally who stared in Remember me, which was much better. Taylor Laurent-sighs- is like Heidi Montag. Sex symbol, both incredibly attractive, but has no acting ability. Yes, Taylor will sell tickets to his movies when he takes his shirt off, but he will never be portrayed as a serious actor, only when he takes his shirt off and takes some serious acting lessons. <br/><br/>Nof Stephanie Meyer, why did you portray Bella Swan as a women who does nothing more then complains and lets people fight her battles. Please, for future refence, this is not a good image to plant in the eyes of a girl, hoping to be in that same situation, 2 guys that love her, will fight because the situations she put herself into.<br/><br/>Besides that, this movies is good enough to spend $9.95 at the movie theater(if there is nothing else playing)"
"neil-476","7","2","8","15 July 2010"," What a surprise after two dull movies
","I went into the third Twilight movie on the assumption that it was half a fingernail - you know, ripping off half a fingernail isn't much fun but, having got to that point, you might as well rip the other half off. You know from bitter experience you aren't going to enjoy it, but at least it finishes things off. The first movie told how sulky Bella got together with stylish vampire Edward, and the second one told how werewolf Jacob became a second contender for the underwhelming affections of this depressing teenager. So in I went, all ready to start tearing the second half of the fingernail off.<br/><br/>D'you know, I enjoyed it. It has a lot of action and a strong sense of developing threat and dread, and several flashback sequences showing how members of the Cullen family became vampires in the first place. All this stuff was well done and very entertaining, and comprised a large part of the movie (compare this with the first two movies which were downright dull). The only time the movie flagged was when it spent time with drippy Bella and her besotted rival paramours.<br/><br/>What else did I get from Eclipse? Apparently native American werewolves are several times bigger than the humans who turn into them. And apparently vampires are made of wood (at least that's what it looks like when bits get knocked off them. Plus they burn really well). And it turns out that the Volturi (aka Vampire High Command) are needlessly sadistic and unpleasant (plus, from Twilight 2, they are stupid enough to have their headquarters in a town which holds an annual anti-vampire festival), so my money is on a showdown between the Volturi and the Cullen clan in the final chapter, especially as Bella's nemesis Victoria is now cinders.<br/><br/>I no longer blame Kristen Stewart for Bella - it is hardly her fault that she is lumbered with performing one of the worst conceived and written characters in the history of Gothic romance.<br/><br/>So my verdict is: unexpectedly enjoyable."
"lucy-hulsey","9","2","8","14 July 2010"," Great Movie
","The Twilight movies as a whole are receiving a lot of criticism as being lacking in comparison to the books and although I would agree with this diagnosis I would also remind people that in reading a book the potential is only as great as your imagination and I think in most people we all have the ability to create and visualize something spectacular. In the movies however its different because the picture is already made for you and a movie will never come up to the standard that a book has. Twilight Eclipse is a great movie although they do miss out parts of the book and although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie I was a little disappointed in the fact that if they had given each movie more time they could have made them incredible. I think Twilight is a wonderful story and although it is receiving criticism which can be as expected much like any movie would there will always be pro's and con's. Twilight has a teenage tag to it although I think its wrong to suggest that its the only age range of people that are fans of it as I am in my late 20's and many of my friends are also as addicted to it as I am."
"justin-fencsak","8","2","8","9 July 2010"," Great vampire love story for die-hard fans gets better...
","The further adventures of Bella Swan and her friends continues in this next-to-last installment of the popular Twilight saga, Ecliipse. Set in Forks, Washington, the film once again deals with Bella's decision to choose which man she'll marry, the werewolf Jacob, or the vampire Edward. Meanwhile, the Volturi are on the hunt for Bella and her family. Directed by another director (an unknown), this film has better special effects, a Hollywood-style score by Howard Shore (no stranger to fantasy films), and some epic love scenes that may leave some guys to go to the bathroom. The movie is a half hour less than the previous one, although the upcoming Breaking Dawn will be much longer, despite being in two parts."
"katkoot-kate","9","2","8","8 July 2010"," A good bridge to the end
","I have just got back from a midnight showing, and I am all the richer for having seen the next installment in the Twilight franchise. The story flowed seamlessly from the last, despite the change in director, and the characters are maturing well in their roles, in that they seem more natural as these characters. Before I went, I sat and watched Twilight and New Moon, so that I could refresh my memory, it worked and I feel like I have spent the evening immersed in their world. Being given a little more back story to some of the characters such as Jasper and Rosalee, really helps you empathise with them - it helps you understand why they are the way they are. While I feel slightly robbed by the fact that the last book is being split in to two movies (more as a money making exercise, I'm sure), I can't wait for the next installment. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart perfectly embody that awkwardness of teen romance, and all the supporting cast are amazing, particularly some of the new introductions, and it's a shame not all of them will return in the next part. There is action for the guys, romance for the girls and little bit of everything for those who just want to watch a good movie."
"JessiReese","9","2","8","6 July 2010"," Fans of the book will enjoy the movie
","I am a fan of the series. Nothing hardcore, I didn't camp out to see the first showing, or wear my Team Edward shirt, and buy all the promotional items they were selling at the theater. Point of fact, I saw Eclipse a few days after it opened, and I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Riley being stalked by Victoria. This was interesting to see, and I wondered how the Newborn story was going to unfold being that everything is told from Bella's perspective in the books. The movie gives us a chance to see things from another point of view. I did miss Rachel as Victoria, I just don't like recasts... She was in the first 2, they couldn't have worked it out to keep her for her battle with Edward? <br/><br/>The triangle Jacob/Bella/Edward was done nicely, although I wish some of the dialog from the book had found it's way into the film. When Edward confronts Jacob, he comes off much more protective in the book. <br/><br/>Loved the scenes with Charlie, Billy Burke is fantastic, and never seems to miss his comedic timing. The sex talk with Bella cracked me up.<br/><br/>The 'war' was great, it was fun to see the Cullens do some fighting, Rosalie was MIA, but lots of good stuff from Jasper, Alice, Emmett, Esme and Carlise. The way the director chose to have the Vampires break apart was different from the original dismemberment of James, however it was a follow up on the marble/stone breaking set up in New Moon.<br/><br/>I think fans will love Eclipse, for the same reasons they loved New Moon and Twilight. It was just a fun escape for a few hours."
"preppy-3","6","2","8","5 July 2010"," The continued weak acting of Stewart and Lautner really hurts this one.
","The continuing adventures of vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the human girl named Bella who loves him (Kristen Stewart) and another guy named Jacob who's a werewolf (Taylor Lautner). Problem is Jacob loves Bella and Bella has to choose between Edward and him while a bunch of deadly vampires prepare an attack.<br/><br/>This started off pretty well. It's well-directed, has some beautiful cinematography and Pattinson and his family are all good actors. Also we get flashbacks to Edward's family and why they became vampires and those are interesting. Also the werewolves are great! Unknown Xavier Samuel also makes a strong impression as Riley. Then what's the problem? Stewart and Lautner. They are TERRIBLE! Their faces never change expression and you seriously don't know how to take their scenes. More than once I thought why were Edward and Jacob were even interested in her! She's whiny and expressionless! We also get at least FIVE conversations over who she should pick as a boyfriend. It got old real quick. These talks are boring and really drag the movie down. Still the teenage girls in my audience seemed riveted. I also got a good laugh of how they all groaned when you first see Lautner with his shirt off (he IS in very good shape). The final fight is also lots of fun--quick and violent with great special effects. This gets a 6 for Pattinson and all the other actors, some beautiful scenes and the special effects--but Stewart and Lautner really wear this down."
"ElvenNights","8","2","8","5 July 2010"," I Definitely Get The Books, Watch At Theatre Not At Home.
","The key to the Twilight Saga is two fold. One, the draw of being Meyer's interpretation of these classic supernatural beings. Especially the vampires though the werewolves are amped up as well. No running from sunlight. No ghoulish mutations. Phasing at will. In her idea, a perfect being basically chiseled out of diamond. Unstoppable, undeniable, insatiably immortal.<br/><br/>By the way, you get your own tailored super power. Two, sharing all of that with your perfect soulmate getting down and dirty in the lap of luxury. Now, what is the overwhelming suspense. Where and when will Bella be changed and given the keys to paradise. Doesn't come across as well in the movies, but that's the draw people who ask why is the series so popular. Read the books. The conflict, now vigilantes and the vamp secret service are trying to bust the party up. <br/><br/>Most people who watch vampire/werewolf type movies envision themselves with the monsters' capabilities. The problem is, the drawbacks usually soon outweigh the positives. Now we have all of the magic with little to none of the problems. Proof of this is the fact that when the vampires disappear in New Moon we were all counting the pages until they returned. <br/><br/>Even the werewolves were sexed up for all of us who used to sport plastic fangs as kids well after Halloween and pretend to be wolfmen. The movie doesn't explain the werewolves as well but from the books they all live forever, or until they stop shape shifting, get buff, real tall, and stay young, oh yeah, they keep a constant temperature of above 100 degrees no matter what the weather. <br/><br/>On to the films. I liked all three movies but can now say that Eclipse is my favorite by default. Here's why. Twilight was one of the best movies that I saw in 2008 so I really liked it. Not a lot to it though on the rewatch. The music may have made the movie and had me into it the entire time. Was I the only one who didn't want it to end and was picturing myself at the prom. Okay, now New Moon if you read the books is a bit of a debby downer for about four fifths of it's entirety. I read the series twice but skipped New Moon the second time around. The movie I have to say has probably my favorite soundtrack of all time though. Gotta love it. <br/><br/>Eclipse is a more mature film. Not as Degrassi-ish. More suspense, more thrills. Delves deeper into the world and keeps a good pace. I enjoyed the CGIs and could have done with a bit more. The shattering effects during the fight scenes added a nice touch and was inventive. Pulling back a maimed quartz crystal limb from the mouth of a humongous wolf will entertain me every time. <br/><br/>Here's the main issue. The problems with Eclipse are the depictions of Bella and Edward relationship wise and their personalities. They're not how Stephanie wrote the characters. Thing is, that's the majority of the substance of the books. Probably the screenplay writers fault as well as the actors. In the novels you feel for and love the characters. The movie, not so much. Bella is supposed to be smart, mature for her age, independent (never has a lot of friends, does her own thing type), a bit insecure about being uncoordinated, but at heart a go getter and feisty. For all of the anti femme talk. Here's the deal.<br/><br/>Being a strong female lead doesn't require being a femme nazi with a hand crafted light saber in your drawer. Wink wink. I like strong women and Bella is written as being strong. Everyone has thoughts like her, over-thinking, we just don't act on them all and neither does she. For Twilight Kristen pulled it off brilliantly. I remember the first time seeing her out of character and thinking, wow, she's nothing like Bella. Kristen is sort of impulsive, a touch immature, and kind of a quirky tomboy and her own personality shows instead of how Bella was originally written this time around.<br/><br/>In the books Edward holds all of the cards and is kind of grandfatherly in his protectiveness of Bella. It comes across as being chivalrous if not sometimes over protective. That's how Meyer shows how much he cares about her I suppose. She's classic. Bella striking out on her own, being daring or seductive plays out as her growing up and not being helpless in the book versions. Basically retaining some balance and control of herself. It doesn't come across like that in the movie. In the movie Bella holds all of the cards and comes across as being insensitive and selfish. The screen writers tried to make Bella more like Kristen and Edward more like Rob which was a mistake because both of them have somewhat irritating personalities in real life. <br/><br/>Also, isn't Edward supposed to be the strong mysterious silent type. A throw-back. Pattinson has turned him into a whiny kind of lame stalker. Not too cool for school. It's got to be the way that it was written because he did a great job in Remember Me.<br/><br/>Everybody else's character and skills have developed well. Ashley and Nikki, mouth watering. Other than a couple of mis-castings of the Volturi, and Lefevre being hotter, pretty good job. I do have to ask what the heck the makeup artist were thinking when they applied Facinelli's dye and face paint. He looks a lot younger in real life. Kinda how Carlisle should minus the hair. You're supposed to make people look better, not worse folks. A touch Madhatter-ish. Anyways. That's it. Over all, an entertaining film. When it's all said and done I can watch Eclipse numerous times and like it more and more. The most important factor of a movie."
"Radioteque","5","2","8","3 July 2010"," Somewhat better than New Moon.
","""Eclipse"" was a satisfactory movie, with a few good actors and a few intense scenes sprinkled in here and there. However, the actors Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner did a... Somewhat non-sufficient job at this movie. Stewart was off, Pattinson overplayed his part, and Lautner did not deliver the charisma needed to fulfill the book. The lines such as ""I love you, Bella"" were not said well enough to be believable, and the CGI effects were less than well-done. There were multiple flaws, able to be seen the first time around. Overall, the movie felt like it was rushed, but some of the acting was much better than New Moon and Twilight. I would not suggest paying for this movie if you are expecting a ""Wow, that was amazing!"" type of reaction."
"amuskens7352","9","2","9","25 July 2010"," Great movie!
","This movie was extremely spectacular, and by far the best movie of the Twilight Saga. I watched this movie on the third day it was released, so I couldn't enjoy the movie to its fullest.<br/><br/>The performances of Taylor Lautner and Xavier Samuel. Taylor changed so much from New Moon; despite the fact that he was angry through the whole movie, but he performed his ""angry personality"" role convincingly. <br/><br/>Praise for Xavier, a newcomer to the series, and a one timer unfortunately as well. Not only was he good looking, he had great facials, and performed his role well.<br/><br/>The usual was from Robert Pattinson. He was pretty much the same as New Moon, except his hairstyle was completely changed in here in a bad way. I thought he looked really weary and almost dirty throughout the whole movie?<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart always looks bummed out in these movies, but I supposed it suits Bella's personality. This was my second favorite book of the series...I have to say that although I was Team Edward for Twilight and New Moon, Taylor Lautner completely swayed me to Team Jacob in this movie with his great performance, a definite highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The jokes were great, the special affects vamped and well done, and the corny music that came along with the Bella/Jacob kissing scene, and the little sad serious song that came with the Edward/Bella sensuality scene added up to me giving it a 9/10!!!"
"WebKinect","9","2","9","18 July 2010"," The best so far!
","Firstly i have to stress that i have never read any of the books so my review is based purely on its credits as an enjoyable movie and its comparison to the previous two.<br/><br/>To be honest when my partner asked if we could go and see this at the cinema i gritted my teeth as i was dreading it. I never saw either of the last two at the cinema, just on DVD while i thought the first one was just about watchable, i thought the second one was one of the worst and most boring movies i had ever watched. So like i said, i was dreading going to see this! Thankfully i was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed this one! For the first time with these films i didn't feel the time go by as it seemed to go very quickly. Its a lot of fun with some fantastic special effects, some great action and a fun love triangle.<br/><br/>If you stop harping on about how close to the book it is and go to see it with the attitude of going to see another action movie about vampires and werewolves then i promise you you'll enjoy it!"
"jacks-31","8","2","9","17 July 2010"," Great but still didn't quite cover the real love story
","My very favourite book in the Saga. Not my favourite film however. Why? Coz I feel that the director has gotten carried away with too many irrelevant story lines including bigging up Jacob's role way too much. In this film he is whiney and I just want to slap him. They have so obviously jumped on the band wagon re Taylor Lautnors abs too. What they have missed out on is the real intense feelings between Bella and Edward. Some of the best lines from the book are omitted and the film is filled with inappropriate dialogue and far too many comedy moments. I really thought that Riley's back story was well done and appropriate. The new Victoria was poor, I much prefer the original who was more menacing and believable. Rosalie's and Jasper's back stories were okay, poor Rosalie she looks frightful throughout this film and her wig is laughable. Why was Alice's role in Eclipse not as prominent as in the book. I thought her and Bella's friendship really took off in the book. Edward's makeup was too extreme and the whole Cullen's contact lenses not right. I get the feeling David Slade is not team Edward. The soundtrack is brilliant. Well done to whoever pulled all the songs together. I really hoped to see some strong emotional scenes between Bella and Edward, I only got the 'leg hitch'. Lets hope Bill Condon is brave enough to tell the real 'Breaking Dawn' Melissa Rosenberg obviously isn't.<br/><br/>Fav film of series Twilight, raw, emotive and the awkwardness of the young cast reflected well the awkwardness of the early Bella and Edward relationship."
"insomniac_rod","6","2","9","17 July 2010"," Decent production values. Somewhat dull but way better than the previous.
","""Eclipse"" is the most commented movie between teenagers. It has a hot cast consistent of desirable teen actors. Who is not tired of listening to people who are into Team Jacob or Team Edward? Brrr.<br/><br/>""Eclipse"" is in my opinion and uncomfortable watch. For one instance I thought it was well directed but contrasts with kitschy dull dialogs filed with clichés that made me cringe at some points. I mean, we have a splendid atmosphere through dynamic aerial camera angles, dark settings, excellent atmosphere (the first scene where Riley is attacked under a heavy rain for example), a brutal battle that is surprisingly attractive for the eye and more.<br/><br/>But in the other side, we get boring love declarations, Edward rejecting Bella when she's ready for sex because he ""wants to wait until marriage"" (come on!), Bella telling her father she's a virgin, Jacob telling Bella he loves her, and Bella always being the center of attention.<br/><br/>I think I know what happened with ""Eclipse"". In my opinion, it's easy to diagnose because Director David Slade is an avid Horror follower and even directed the obscure ""30 Days of NIght"" and the underrated ""Hard Candy"". Slade was obligated to insert the terrible dialog sequences, the kitsch moments such as when the three share a tent. I mean, it's a really uncomfortable watch: a horror atmosphere PG-13 oriented movie mixed with romantic dialogs in which we are supposed to believe that a handsome vampire is the perfect lover. Blah!<br/><br/>The movie looks good. Feels good and generates memorable moments. The battle between the army of vampires versus the alliance of werewolves and vampires is tremendous. Great camera angles, intense fighting, violent be headings, beatings, vampires and werewolves getting pounded to the ground, and the cool fight between Edward and Victoria. This battle is the best scene in the trilogy, IMO.<br/><br/>So we have a charismatic cast, just decent CGI, and a visual attractive direction. I didn't think I would find in a ""Twilight"" movie a band of vampires causing hysteria, murdering, burning cars and more. It was about time!.<br/><br/>Another positive aspect about this movie are the flashback sequences that show the past of the Cullens. At last we know what's going on with Rosalie's hostile attitude. I liked Jasper's love story and what happens with Alice. In these scenes I got a feeling of a stylish horror movie flick. <br/><br/>The flashback that explains the feud between werewolves and vampires is great. The way the ""cold man"" appears and is destroyed by wolves is very dark and good. But it was even better when the sexy female vampire returns to the village in revenge and destroys the whole tribe. That's until she's attacked and killed by the grandpa and wise man of the place. I liked how her wife sacrifices her life in order to stop the sexy but mad vampire. Damn good scene. <br/><br/>We even get a very creepy nightmare in which Maria speaks in Spanish and Victoria suddenly appears and disappears while whispering in Riley's ear. I didn't see that coming!.<br/><br/>What are the uncomfortable scenes I was referring before? When Bella is freezing and Edward can't do anything about it. So, Jacob appears shirtless (as always) and offers hugging Bella to make her feel warm. Both men argue and Bella tells them ""don't fight"". Also, the moment where Bella decides to kiss Jacob because she suddenly realizes she loves him. And the worst of all, the line ""I'm hotter than you"". Brrrr. But I knew these king of scenes were going to happen. Shame to myself!.<br/><br/>They also keep talking about their wedding... since New Moon! And nothing really happens. The whole vampire-human conversion also keeps ringing in my ears. <br/><br/>The acting is a little more better than in ""New Moon"". Or at least the lead actors believe their crappy dialogs. Robert Pattinson still looks static and doesn't show any emotions. Well maybe the role asks for those kind of histrionic qualities. Taylor Lautner reminds me a lot of A.C. Slater from ""Saved by the Bell"" and that's why I think he's a cool guy. His acting is putrid and I hate every scene where he appears shirtless. Kristen Stewart is a major babe. I mean, it's really difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she has on screen time. Her acting is wooden. <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard takes on the role of Victoria. She's extremely sexy, arousing. I like her facial expressions.<br/><br/>Nikki Reed, Ashleey Greene, and Anna Kendrick don't have much on screen time but their charisma is very natural. They are three beautiful girls that act really good, very sexy (specially hot Nikki) and it's good that we finally learn more bout their past. Xavier Samuel was good as Riley. An interesting scapegoat by Victoria. Billy Burke is a low profile but decent actor that delivers some funny lines like ""This Edward, I think I like him a little more"" or something. The rest is OK.<br/><br/>I wanted to know more from the Volturi. It's amongst the best sub-plots of the trilogy. Dakota Fanning has more on screen time and her scenes demonstrate she's a key character in the future. Oh, and she's very pretty. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was really good, catchy. Muse's song should be very popular. <br/><br/>In general, I think ""Eclipse"" is way better than the kitschy ""Twilight"" and the mess that became to be ""New Moon"". At least in this one we have action, romance, and a dark atmosphere. Fans of the books will love it and fans of horror like me will just ignore it in the future.<br/><br/>But take my word, it works better if you want to get lucky with a girl after watching in on the movies."
"wblack24","7","2","9","8 July 2010"," A review from the eyes of the loyal boyfriend
","Being the loyal boyfriend that I am, I gladly accompanied my lady to see the latest Twilight movie. That is, of course, after I got to spend money on dugout seats at the Braves game and got her to go see A-Team with me. Twice. <br/><br/>So, before I saw Eclipse, I decided it was a good idea to watch the other two. Well, I had seen the second one with her last year but re-watched it as well as watched the first one for the first time. I was prepared; stocked full of Twilight trivia and know-how. <br/><br/>The first two movies were OK. The thing I enjoyed most about them was how I could easily relate to being heartbroken at that age, and the amazing location in Washington state near Seattle. Seattle is my favorite city. New Moon was a bit too melodramatic for my tastes, but nonetheless offered a decent narrative on teen angst. I've been there, haven't we all?<br/><br/>So, with Eclipse I expected improvement. And what did I get?<br/><br/>Lots of improvement! It was actually an enjoyable movie. Being one of (I counted) four males in the audience, I had to cover my ears (at least it felt like it) every time werewolf boy Jake showed up with his shirt off...which was literally about 90% of the time he was in a scene. <br/><br/>I had never read the books, so I was upset at how many girls are ""team Jacob"" or whatever. I am an old-fashioned fellow myself and believe in loyalty and all that good stuff. So, the whole ""I love Eddie boy, but I also love Jake...just not as much as Edward"" stuff that Bella kept pulling kinda annoyed me. You could tell that the younger girls were all for Jacob...the macho, buff hott guy while the older women were for Edward...the loyal, quiet, old-fashioned guy. <br/><br/>Anyway...the fight scene! Yes the fight scene...it was pretty cool. Especially the fight between Victoria and Edward. It got pretty intense. I won't spoil all those goodies though. <br/><br/>The surprise star of the movie was definitely Jackson Rathbone. You got a nice little backstory on the fella that seemed pretty hidden in the first two films. His southern accent came out of nowhere though. I mean, that was a little forced. He was in the Confederate Army in Texas during the civil war when he became a blood-sucker...and when he was telling the story to Bella his accent started coming out of nowhere. But, he really did get some good air time which was solid. He took his 15 minutes and put them to good use. Bravo, chap. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie was an enjoyable more realistic (er...you know what I mean here) movie than the other two. Bella isn't as awkward, and Edward is actually IN the movie this time. Taylor Lautner did a lot better acting this time. Everyone's acting was a lot better. <br/><br/>I don't know really much about what happens in the next installment, but from someone who doesn't read the books and went to be a good boyfriend...it was good fun. So, if you're a guy dreading going with your girl...don't be scared. It's actually pretty good."
"mkbencec","10","2","9","5 July 2010"," Absolutely fan(g)tastic!
","After watching the movie at an Advanced Screening in my local cinema this weekend I still am speechless as to how perfect this movie was.<br/><br/>David Slade did not only capture the action of the scenes that required it but also concentrated on the romance between Bella and Edward allowing for humour and jealous dialogues between Edward and Jacob.<br/><br/>I think the story of the book (which I have read and enjoyed) was fully captured and rightly partially re-written to suit the fast pace of the film. Yes, Slade did give information on the Newborns that you don't read in the book. (You do get it if you read Meyers recently published Eclipse Novella) However, that is a really good thing. This allowed him to not just ""introduce"" random Newborn Vampires but actually give the viewers an insight into what exactly the Cullens were up against and also give the viewers a better idea of the implications of Bella's choice to ask the Cullens to change her. In fact, it also points out a bit of a flaw in the book ""Eclipse"". The book retrospectively explained Bella's epiphany regarding why the Newborns were after her. It is much better to allow the viewer to put the pieces together than wait for the movie to spell it out. (Much more fun this way!)<br/><br/>Slade also allowed the non-readers to gain background information on the characters by having Rosalie, Jasper and even the Quilleute tribe tell their story on how they became what they are today. Their stories again stayed very true to the book and yes - again - some good action there but again I need to point out that this was also present in the book so Twilight fans should really take a step back when criticizing this part.<br/><br/>Personally I think this is by far the best visual adaption of the Twilight books so far. It gave the viewer everything and more than the book did. The visual effects and wolf-animation were by far more realistic and convincing than in New Moon. The story in itself was much more ""together"" and it finally gave each character a moment to shine.<br/><br/>Is this movie for you? Well, if you like the Twilight Saga and haven't slept through the first two movies you will definitely enjoy the film. If you haven't read the books but watched the last two instalments you will also enjoy this film - and definitely better than ""New Moon"". The only reason you might not enjoy this is if you are completely put off by any type of violence (even if in moderation) and if for some bizarre reason you believe Eclipse is soley about Romance and a love triangle between Jacob, Bella and Edward. (It is not!)<br/><br/>The movie was - in one word: excellent!"
"SquigglyCrunch","2","1","3","24 August 2016"," Laughably Bad...Again
","Twilight: Eclipse follows Bella as she tries to decide whether or not she wants to marry Edward, meanwhile dealing with the semi- aggressive feelings of Jacob. At the same time a mysterious army of vampires is forming and the Cullens must prepare to fight them off. <br/><br/>Similarly to New Moon, which I enjoyed, the writing is often so bad it's hilarious. Eclipse features plenty of said scenes that have become so iconic now in this series for me.<br/><br/>From time to time I was surprised to actually witness a decent scene in this movie. By that I mean some parts were actually kind of well- done. Some scenes ended and I thought ""huh, that was actually kind of above average"". Considering the quality of these movies haven't exceeded an average level yet, I was happy to see some things that didn't suck. While these moments were short-lived and often just barely above average (as in the difference between a 5/10 and 5.5/10 scene), they were an improvement. Who knows, maybe by the time I reach the last movie it'll actually be average. <br/><br/>Unlike New Moon, however, this movie's pacing went down. While it wasn't as boring as the first movie, it definitely had pacing issues. That's really the biggest thing that separates this movie from New Moon. New Moon managed to suck but be well-paced enough not to put me to sleep, but this one was, while still funny, much more boring. <br/><br/>As per usual, we get some 'excellent' performances from the cast. Kristen Stewart is worse than usual, Taylor Lautner is still garbage, and Robert Pattinson continues to be better than everyone else, if only by a little bit. <br/><br/>And again, as I've come to expect, the writing is putrid. Somehow more so than the previous movies, though. More stuff is rushed into with barely any development, and it makes me wonder why everyone cares so much or how they caught onto something as quickly as they did. <br/><br/>The special effects still suck. Not a lot to say about that. <br/><br/>Something I kind of hate about these world building movies is that the world is never completely built when the series starts. So the creator keeps making new stuff and making some new things more important than others. While in the first two movies we got very little about the anatomy of vampires, we saw it more here and it was so overused that it felt like a newly added part of the movies. While it still makes sense with the universe and everything it was just so thrust upon the audience with so much of it that it felt like the director was just making up new bullcrap and hoping we wouldn't notice. <br/><br/>Also, the fight. While some of it was somewhat entertaining, it was, for the most part, stupid. Somehow none of the main characters died, and only one got injured. And yet, every single opponent died. These opponents are supposed to be much stronger than the main characters. They actually state that their opponents are vastly stronger than them multiple times. But regardless, when you don't kill any main characters it does make the movie less intense and less realistic. I care less about the characters because I know nothing bad will actually happen to them. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight: Eclipse is, while fun at times, still absolute trash. It's massively flawed at every corner, but sometimes those flaws are funny. It's sort of like a turd with ice cream on top. It tastes like crap, but it's still ice cream and it's kind of funny to look at, similarly to New Moon. Only this time there's a really tired old tour guide trying to explain how the turd came to be in extensive detail. While it's kind of interesting in a weird way, it's still pretty boring. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. You'd be better off watching New Moon. Not only is it less boring, it's also funnier."
"joshuadrake-39480","6","1","3","17 April 2015"," ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse""...good if not better than the original TWILIGHT
","The first TWILIGHT film was really good as I said in my review for the first TWILIGHT film. I got to NEW MOON and I said I hated it and it was something that I would never watch again, but now I get into the third film in the Twilight film franchise, ECLIPSE.<br/><br/>I had to say I had mixed feelings when I first saw the trailer for THE TWILIGHT SAGA - ECLIPSE. Do you know how crappy and bad that the story of THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON was? Well, the third film gladly makes up for all of the crappy stuff NEW MOON had in it.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie follows the book nicely. The film follows Bella Swan once again, as she develops awareness of the complications of marrying Edward Cullen. As Victoria draws nearer with a group of newborn vampires, Jacob Black and the rest of the werewolf alliance to destroy her, in turn, to keep Bella safe. While Bella tries to decide who she is, a fight brews and the consequences are paid once Jacob gets hurt. Intent on keeping a compromise with Edward, she vows to keep true to her engagement and marry him.<br/><br/>After the critical response and box office success of NEW MOON, it was announced that in early November 2008, Summit Entertainment announced that they had attained the rights to the remaining books in Stephanie Meyer's book series, TWILIGHT: New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. In February 2009, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. The director of the second film, Chris Weitz, decided since he was in the post-production phase of NEW MOON would not be directing the film. Instead, David Slade was directing the film, with Melissa Rosenberg returning as the script writer.<br/><br/>The story is not as confusing as the story of NEW MOON was, it is really good. The CGI on the werewolves is a very good improvement over the CGI in NEW MOON. The dialogue is not an issue in this film as it was in the second film. The musical score was not composed by Alexandre Desplat, as he would work on the final two Harry Potter films, instead Howard Shore, composer of The Hobbit trilogy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was brought in to compose the film score. The soundtrack is once again amazing with songs like ""Heavy Heart."" The acting is back and forth, but credit has to be given to the three main actors: Kristen Stewart as Bella is amazing, Taylor Lautner as Jacob is amazing this time around and Robert Pattinson as Edward is once again amazing. The entire original cast returns this time including Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Elizabeth Reaser, Peter Facinelli, Billy Burke and Ashley Greene. Also returning, Dakota Fanning as Jane and she is stunning and very beautiful.<br/><br/>There are new major editions to the cast: Jodelle Ferland plays the role of Bree Tanner, a newly turned vampire. Ferland was in a video game adaptation of Silent Hill, which was released in 2006. Other new cast members included: Julia Jones as Leah Clearwater, Booboo Stewart as Seth Clearwater, Jack Huston as Royce King, Catalina Sandino Moreno as Maria and Xavier Samuel as Riley.<br/><br/>The biggest casting change was the part of Victoria. Since the character was originally played by Rachel Lefevre, Summit Entertainment announced that Bryce Dallas Howard would play the part for the third film. Lefevre was saddened and disappointed by the decision to recast her part. The action sequences is really what makes the movie a stand-out for me and the fight choreography is really good. This movie should have won an Academy Award for best visual effects and best music as far as those two went.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: ECLIPSE is really good, if not better than the third film."
"willcundallreview","5","1","3","23 March 2015"," So close to being pretty OK
","Rating-5/10<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is the third instalment in the series and one that well, kind of takes it up a notch. Now please don't get me wrong, this is an average made movie but one that is so close to being kind of OK, it actually weirdly surprised me. It's better than New Moon by a long way and also in my opinion better than the first movie so this really does feel like the closest point this film series can get to franchise redemption so far.<br/><br/>This part is better acted, Kristen Stewart steps it up a notch and Pattinson does too after a poor showing in New Moon. Even Taylor Lautner gets slightly better and it almost feels like he has come of a new age with confidence and more actual skill in his work. The story is kind of overstuffed in truth though with new people, Bryce Dallas Howard returns, well replaces the previous actor to play Victoria, the evil vampire bent on revenge on Bella since the first movie. The problem with so many people is that it feels hard to not only keep track but also it means the acting goes down a level as most of the new people are inexperienced.<br/><br/>The film is no doubt a thrilling one, it has it's action although it is very much confined toward the end and so anyone wanting all out fighting will be slightly disappointed. One good thing with this though is that it doesn't hang around like it has done previously, the school isn't shown as much and we also get to explore more in the vampire world and we finally spend some time not talking about Bella. The romance is as ever it's radiant self, but is still awkward but not as much again as before. The lines are less stupid and the characters feel more real in this showing, some fans may feel it even strengthens in this one as the relationship is tested at times.<br/><br/>The cinematography is one of the technical aspects that improves here, it feels more good movie like and avoids the common traps that make the camera work feel dull and not exciting enough. One trap that does get fallen into is the director David Slade, now he isn't bad but he doesn't improve enough for this to be a good piece of work for him, it falls back into the same old kind of category and although I feel Slade and the movie do try to escape that, it ultimately just about slides back in.<br/><br/>It can feel just a little slow at times Eclipse can, with it's as I mentioned more time away from the school, it is more interesting but the boredom can creep in and kind of pointless adventures and conversations are had that feel very much like time wasting. The effects that are fairly poor before are still not perfect, but they are at least used well and on the point of the slow film, when the effects come, it can breath fresh air into the plot. They are also not overused as is also the usual case, before we had silly backdrops that looked really dumb, now all that is annoying scenery wise is the incredibly strange camera filters.<br/><br/>Overall this is a kind of so-so movie that although never makes the grade, never falls flat on its face. This feels like a new beginning in the chapters of Twilight the movie series and is much more confident and all credit for at least pleasing hardcore fans yet again. One thing to say though is that this isn't good I will repeat, it may be for me the best in the series so far but I highly doubt the most cynical of critics for the series will find any solace in this part."
"brchthethird","5","1","3","13 November 2014"," A marginal improvement over 'New Moon'
","This installment of the Twilight saga is a slight improvement across the board from the last one, but it is still every bit as cheesy. The story this time is a little more engaging, following the love triangle between Edward, Bella and Jacob and revolving around an unexplained series of killings in Forks. It turns out to be an army of Newborns being built by Victoria, and this draws the attention of the Volturi, who have a slightly expanded presence here. One thing that does keep me watching these movies without being utterly bored is the unintentional humor, especially in this one. The scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob are really funny and over-the-top in their portrayal of masculinity and because of the woodenness of the performances. Some other positives include effective tension in a few scenes, as well as more action. The obvious set-piece here would be the climactic battle between the Newborns and the Cullens and the werewolves. However, since the movie is PG-13, the violence is bloodless. I still have some problems with the visual effects being slightly less than convincing, but at this point I don't really expect them to improve significantly anyway. Generally speaking, the acting has improved marginally since the first one, but the material they're working with is passé, immature and flawed. One performance in particular that stuck out to me as being really bad was Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi. Also, Stephenie Meyer's Mormon roots are on full display now, as Edward acts as the mouthpiece for ""traditional"" values. It's a shame, really, that teenagers eat this stuff up. Times have changed, but most likely they were distracted by all of the teenage flesh on display. There's also a creepy moment early on where it's suggested (through dialogue) that Bella is essentially being groomed to be a vampire. This takes on a new meaning when you remember that Edward is over 100 years old, and Bella is a minor (although she does turn 18 in the movie). Still, this movie is somewhat worth watching, if only for the moments of unintentional comedy. Just don't complain if you don't like it, since you most likely made it through the previous installments to get to this one."
"fenniferdead","7","2","10","8 May 2011"," not as bad as one expects
","I know a lot of people seem to hate Twilight. Either they don't get it or think the whole teen romance thing is retarded. But those instantly closing their minds without giving it a shot are missing out. I genuinely enjoyed this film. I thought it was better than the second one and it had some decent storyline to it. The feeling I get a lot of times is that people hate this film because its too mainstream, too big and hyped, whatever. But they don't seem to understand the characters. They are, for lack of a better term, acting like old farts who just like to complain. I did enjoy this film and I'm starting to get used to all the characters to where I get to know them better. The action was a lot better than I would have expected for this type of film and the effects were okay. One should at least try and watch this film openly before just badmouthing it."

","I saw this movie 3 times in the theater an i will explain them all.1st was at the midnight showing i was soo excited an i literally enjoyed watching it i loved the book and the director did not disappoint.Kristen Stewart did a way better job then in the last 2 movies i saw her and so did Robert Patinson. Taylor Lautner was good but he came off to me as trying to hard or something to that affect. Bryce Dallas as the new victoria amazed me with her performance and in my opinion (no disrespect for Rachel Lavere) i would have perferred her to have been victoria for the other 2. I left the theater amazed an happy with the movie that i went the next day just to see it this time i wasn't so entertained it was still very good bu i was only really looking forward to the action scenes in the end. On my 3rd time to the theater i was finally convinced that the movie was amazing the plot a little rushed but the dialouge made up for it the acting so much better an the intense fighting scenes had me on the edge of my seat all 3 times. I love David Slade(director) an i wish he would be directing Breaking Dawn. If you did Like this movie and your blaming the director please don't because its not his fault i think if anyone wants to blame someone it should be the screen writer she is the one who writes the scripts and takes things out from the book the director is the one who films it."

","I have waited to see the third film-adaptation of the ""Twilight"" series. Now that I had, I thought it was AWESOME! and perfect to go with the first two ""Twilight"" films.<br/><br/>The film starts off where ""New Moon"" left off: Victoria, still bent on revenge, is making an army of vampires to destroy Bella and the Cullens. And also, Bella is on the ""deciding"" point of her choice to stay normal or become a vampire like Edward. Especially when he had just propose to her...in marriage! But for now, it will take a first-once-in-a-lifetime truce with Jacob's werewolf clan to stop the army of ""newborns."" So anyway, that is all I talk about and I really love this film."
"Captain_Who","8","2","10","12 July 2010"," The best of the three thus far, but still a bit off as well.
","I seem to be one of the few straight guys out there who have read all the books. I try not to be influenced by the insanity that is the teenage girl, and write the movies off. I did make the mistake of seeing the first film on opening night, and thus had to contend with the large amounts of screaming girls who all wanted to fight over who was better..Edward or Jacob. Oh and to answer that question: Neither...they would both kill you in a heartbeat.;) <br/><br/>With that said I very much enjoyed the latest installment of our friendly vegan, sparkly vamps. The pace was pretty good, and I was happy that they kept things from the book in the movie unlike some book to movies I have seen that liked to make unnecessary changes and even add plot elements that were not present in the novels, mainly Mr. Potter and the Percy Jackson movie. <br/><br/>I was unhappy at the recasting of Victoria. While I love Bryce Dallas Howard, and would love for her to have my children, it really messed up the feel of the story after having Rachelle Lefevre establish the character so perfectly. While both actresses are extremely pleasant to the eyes, Rachelle really gave off a more unnerving feeling when you looked at her Victoria, while Bryce I just wanted to make out with and run towards rather than away. <br/><br/>In the end, good movie. Bad choice to recast Victoria, but still worth watching.<br/><br/>P.S. I still love you Bryce! Call me!"

","I really enjoyed the Twilight book series, but I haven't always liked the movies. I thought Eclipse was the best movie so far; and all in all, I enjoyed it. I thought the screenplay was far better than previous Twilight movies. The acting had improved somehow as well. The actor who played Jacob Black was especially committed to his role. His portrayal stole the show for me. The action scenes were good, and kept my husband from being completely bored by mushy love scenes. Without giving anything away, I would say that the movie stayed pretty true to the book, which I liked. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the books and anyone who enjoys romantic films."
"Erilyn","9","2","10","5 July 2010"," Loved the movie but......
","First let me say that Im 35, not a tween thats goo ga over the Twilight series. I was very disappointed with the first movie. Second was better, third even better. With the exception of a few things.....<br/><br/>First - Get a new makeup crew!! Whoever is doing the makeup for these movies should be fired. Seriously, I've never had formal training and I can seem to make people look more realistically undead than whoever is doing the makeup for these films. In each movie the makeup is different. I cant seem to understand why they cant get it right after THREE movies!! Rob is hot, they should be enhancing his features and not covering them up with so much makeup he looks like a zombie. None looked undead rather they looked like they were in bad Halloween makeup. Bad Bad Bad!! <br/><br/>Now to the movie....Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. The 2 hours flew by. Before I knew it, it was over. The only other grievance I have with the movie other than the horrible makeup job was the fight scene. It should have lasted a little longer. It was too good to be over so soon. Jasper was awesome and kicked some major butt in this movie. However, If you blinked you would've missed it. Such a shame. The whole movie built up to that moment and poof! - it was over too soon.<br/><br/>I don't get why so many bad reviews, it was really good. The kissing scene with Jacob and Bella broke my heart for Edward. The movie was funny and had a lot more dialogue from Kristens character than the previous 2 movies.<br/><br/>My hope for Breaking Dawn - The characters hold nothing back in terms of acting. The makeup crew get replaced with people who actually know what they are doing, the writers really pay attention to how they write the script because this is the final book. It HAS to be emotional in some places and it HAS to connect with the audience. I really hope that the editors do a good job with transitioning from scene to scene. And PLEASE - no cheesy scenes like in New Moon where Bella and Edward are running after shes been changed.<br/><br/>Get a director of high caliber for the last 2 films. These are the most important of the series as its the end. We want to feel the love between Edward and Bella and share in her happiness as she moves into a new phase of her ""life"".<br/><br/>So all in all, I gave it a 9. Cant wait for DVD release!"

","As a moderate Twilight fan (by no means a Twi-hard), I've thoroughly enjoyed both Twilight and New Moon. Eclipse, however, is the best of the series! Great action sequences (love the wolves). The acting was what you've come to expect (though I did find Pattinson's performance improved this time around) - an overall nice experience.<br/><br/>A major bonus was when Tyler Lautner took off his shirt and there wasn't a theatre full of screaming women (as happened with New Moon). I guess they're finally used to seeing him without a shirt. :-) If you are a fan of the series, you of course must see this, but I'm sure you have already. If you are not a fan, this honestly is the best of the 3 films in the series so far."
"Louisville88","10","2","11","19 July 2010"," If you hate it, it's probably because you haven't seen it or made up your mind before hand
","Okay, the first movie SUCKED, the second one was good, but the third one is SO much better. Is it a perfect film? No, not at all. But it is better on so many levels.<br/><br/>People attack the story. A.) I've watched worse and B.) It's actually legit. Who were the target audience members? Young adults. Okay, so 12 year olds and their mom's found their way in...big deal! That does not ruin the fact that the story does have solid ground. It is a chick flick, so that is probably what gets most guys. Also, vampires have been brought in a 100% different light (I myself am not a fan or the changes, but I realize that this is someone's story and that vampires are not real. There is not a code of conduct when writing these fables) Eclipse brings the suspense. It brings a darker tone. It brings better performances from Kristen and Rob who show that yes, they too can smile and enjoy life. They make out better. They interact better. Some of the minor characters get to shine more. Jasper and Rosalie to name two. They both were very good with what they had.<br/><br/>One reason New Moon was enjoyable for me was Taylor Lautner. He SAVED that movie for me. Had he sucked, it probably would have faded. I laugh at the people who dismiss him because of his body. Jealous guys mostly who all they can say is he has a body and no talent. Yet, do they complain when Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman go shirtless? Nope. Kate Winslet has appeared nude in more movies than any non porn star but she isn't less of an actress. It's just them trying to make a cheap shot. Now, back to him, he once again was great (when I use these words I don't mean Oscar). He is so sincere and I know that as he gets older he'll get better. This boy knows how to use his face aka eyes and mouth in expressing more emotions than any line could get across. He will go places.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard was a welcome change. The other actress did little to leave an impression and Bryce actually knows what to do. The story flows better, the pace is steady and the acting is 30 times better (which for this may not be saying too much!) Eclipse won't be making the AFI's top 100 any time soon, but it will gross over 300 million in the U.S. and it will stand as being superior than the past two. Whether you think vampires should sparkle or could care less if Bella chooses the troll down the block, this film holds merit. The struggle is actually felt this time (whereas in New Moon the audience really only felt the bond between her and Jacob and not Edward which shouldn't have played that way). Also, there is a scene where Bella is with her mother. I actually felt a little emotion inside me during that. I WAS SHOCKED! Usually I only feel sorry for Jacob, but Kristen got something out of me!"

"m-missy54","8","2","11","5 July 2010"," Loved it, and I'm sick of the misconceptions.
","I made an account just to review this movie, because I was reading through these negative reviews I realized the people just don't get it. And that is usually because they don't take the time to understand or actually read the books and then give their opinion. I'm sure there are a few people out there who have actually read the books likes them, but dislike the movie because of their own reasons, but that seems rare. 99% of reviews I have read on here were just ridiculous. People REALLY DON'T get it. Which I guess is understandable, I can't judge.<br/><br/>The movie was great in my opinion. A lot better than the first two. I have always liked the first one because of the mood, the feel to it. I loved the colors in it. The second one I did enjoy watching but I had a few complaints. I felt like the pacing was off, the parts that we actually wanted to see were a disappointment because they went so fast, and then the parts that weren't really too entertaining dragged on. But the fact that I loved the books, and they did do some parts right, it's nice to see it played out on screen. To see the things I saw in my head come to life. And they did do a lot of things right.<br/><br/>Also, they left a lot of important things out and changed a lot of unnecessary things. But to be fair, New Moon is a hard book to get through, but we get through it because it is important. It's a piece of the puzzle. Another complaint of mine is the WRITER, ugh. She has the easiest job in the world, the script is already written for her and she messes it up every time, changing dialog for no apparent reason, just playing with it. We love the books, not her interp of the books, or what she THINKS they should have said.<br/><br/>That being said, Eclipse is much better in all aspects. They didn't really leave anything important out. A COUPLE of minor things, but they got everything important which is why some people think it seems a little crammed together. That again would come from someone who didn't read the books, to understand the pacing better. The script is better. Pretty much everything said in the movie is right out of the books. No complaints there.<br/><br/>I heard of someone complaining that the flashbacks were too long, not at all. That would also come from someone who didn't read the books. They are shorter than they are in the books. I would have liked to see more of Rosalie's but her's is still quite enjoyable and Jasper's is AWESOME.<br/><br/>People that haven't read the bookS don't understand the characters. I know a lot of people didn't like the first one because they didn't understand half of what is going on, it is almost impossible to unless you have read the books, that first book that was hundreds of pages long. The people that make these movies know that we don't really need a PLOT. They are making them for the fans, we know what happens, plus so much more that is in the books that they don't even touch on in the movies. All three movies haven't even scratched the surface compared to the layers and complexity of the books. We love seeing it because we love that would and want to see at these SOME of it on a screen.<br/><br/>Eclipse was wonderful. More cullens, I am pleased that Rosalie and Jasper have way more lines. Alice and Jasper are SO CUTE. I loved seeing them fight. Kristen and Rob did good. I sometimes wonder if I like Kristen and Robs acting. But then they both do scenes and I am impressed by their talent, in different ways. People complain Edward always looks like he is in pain. This is because he is, if they had read the books they would know that him even being near Bella makes his throat burn like he's getting a hot iron shoved down his throat. All actors have difficult roles to play and they all do it very well.<br/><br/>Rob smiles more in this movie which gives more life to Edward. I thought it was really believable, the acting. In certain scenes I was just swept away, thinking of the books.<br/><br/>Rob and Taylor's hotness is nice sure. I don't even really notice it and I know most Twilight fans don't really care about that, and if they do, they still didn't get into the series just for that, and they get excited to see these people come to life. Jacob doesn't wear a shirt for a REASON. It's because he is poor and when he bursts into wolf form it destroys their clothes and shoes, they can't afford new ones so they try to conserve their shirts. ANd shoes. There are some things that annoy even us fans, but we just go oh, man, wtf, and get over it. Because overall, the experience is worth it. <br/><br/>Overall, Eclipse, if you are a fan, is so amazing. You will love it. It stays true to the book. And I think the entire cast, and the director did a great job. It comes closer to the book we all love. And a series we know isn't perfect but we love it anyway. I could go on and on about people and their misunderstandings but I don't have all day."
"megha6582","6","2","11","2 July 2010"," Not great......but not bad either!
","The first thought that came to my mind after watching Twilight eclipse was that this movie is better than its predecessor New Moon, which I thought for the most part was slow-paced, bleak and dull. This movie has some good moments but that said, it has its share of flaws too.<br/><br/>Liked: Chemistry between the lead actors, conversation between Edward and Jacob in the tent, the interaction between the Cullens and the werewolf clan, the action sequences and the occasional funny lines.<br/><br/>Disliked: The dialogues, that fact that the acting hasn't improved as much as I would have liked, the Volturi (I dunno what in the world they were doing in this movie), the replacement for Victoria (she doesn't look mean enough) and Bella's endless confusion (make up your mind girl!).<br/><br/>I'm sure the die-hard twilight fans would love this movie. Those who haven't read the books or watched the previous movies, might end up scratching their heads a bit. As for me, I've decided to go read the books.....it might make me a tougher critic of the movies but I think it just might be worth it!"
"texasfanlonghorns1010","6","2","11","1 July 2010"," The Film Served Its Purpose
","First off let me start by saying that this film is not for everyone. The Twilight movies all have a specific audience. More than half of there targeted audience is 11-16 year old females. The rest is made up of those who just really enjoyed the books.<br/><br/>Let's address the issue of ""bad acting"". When I attended the film a lot of people in the theater thought that the acting was terrible at times; I agreed. But bad acting is going to be over-looked every time Taylor Lautner(Jacob) takes his shirt and Robert Pattinson's face is on the screen. Again consider the audience. Being that the audience is young girls who like ""hot"" guys, screw good acting, let his abs do the acting.<br/><br/>The film tried the best it could to pull in a male audience, and they kind of succeeded. The reason why I say that they ""kind of succeeded"" is because the action became repetitive. After the first few times that the Wolves kill the Vampires it gets old. As a male, I can't wrap my mind around the idea that these so called ""hot"" guys are chasing after this ""average"" looking female. Kristen Stewart is not bad to look at at all, but in the film she is portrayed as the average chick. The start of Team Jacob and Team Edward was brilliant. I have noticed that the male audience was predominantly Team Jacob, and I have found out why. Edward Cullen is too DAMN sensitive to be a VAMPIRE. Even though Jacob is sensitive as well, the fact that he turns into a Werewolf makes him more like-able to a male audience. <br/><br/>The character back stories were very smart for the film makers to do. The only character that i had a problem with was Jasper, only for the simple fact that he is all of a sudden a Bad Ass in this movie compared to the last one. Even though we don't see much of him in New Moon, I never would have guessed that he was this great brawler. Don't get me wrong, it felt good to see a vampire with balls.<br/><br/>Even though the film is fantasy Bella Swan does not see the reality in the choosing of Jacob or Edward. I don't if the movie was trying show this on purpose or maybe it just happened by accident. The fact that she is in love with both of them, is cool. But even after she finds out what will happen to her after she is changed and she is still persistent in wanting to be changed is unrealistic. After she finds out that she wont be able to have babies and still wants to be changed is unrealistic. The fact that she is willing to leave her father and mother who have done her no wrong is unrealistic. But at the end of the day it is a fantasy, and I am not the target audience. <br/><br/>I gave the film a ""6"" because it did what it was supposed to do for its targeted audience. For those of you who didn't like the film and said it was terrible, it's because you are not the target audience and every movie is not made to please everybody."
"joshuadrake-91275","9","1","4","23 September 2015"," Greatest TWILIGHT Movie in the series
","The first TWILIGHT film was really good as I said in my review for the first TWILIGHT film. I got to NEW MOON and I said I hated it and it was something that I would never watch again, but now I get into the third film in the Twilight film franchise, ECLIPSE.<br/><br/>I had to say I had mixed feelings when I first saw the trailer for THE TWILIGHT SAGA - ECLIPSE. Do you know how crappy and bad that the story of THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON was? Well, the third film gladly makes up for all of the crappy stuff NEW MOON had in it.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie follows the book nicely. The film follows Bella Swan once again, as she develops awareness of the complications of marrying Edward Cullen. As Victoria draws nearer with a group of newborn vampires, Jacob Black and the rest of the werewolf alliance to destroy her, in turn, to keep Bella safe. While Bella tries to decide who she is, a fight brews and the consequences are paid once Jacob gets hurt. Intent on keeping a compromise with Edward, she vows to keep true to her engagement and marry him.<br/><br/>After the critical response and box office success of NEW MOON, it was announced that in early November 2008, Summit Entertainment announced that they had attained the rights to the remaining books in Stephanie Meyer's book series, TWILIGHT: New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. In February 2009, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. The director of the second film, Chris Weitz, decided since he was in the post-production phase of NEW MOON would not be directing the film. Instead, David Slade was directing the film, with Melissa Rosenberg returning as the script writer.<br/><br/>The story is not as confusing as the story of NEW MOON was, it is really good. The CGI on the werewolves is a very good improvement over the CGI in NEW MOON. The dialogue is not an issue in this film as it was in the second film. The musical score was not composed by Alexandre Desplat, as he would work on the final two Harry Potter films, instead Howard Shore, composer of The Hobbit trilogy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was brought in to compose the film score. The soundtrack is once again amazing with songs like ""Heavy Heart."" The acting is back and forth, but credit has to be given to the three main actors: Kristen Stewart as Bella is amazing, Taylor Lautner as Jacob is amazing this time around and Robert Pattinson as Edward is once again amazing. The entire original cast returns this time including Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Elizabeth Reaser, Peter Facinelli, Billy Burke and Ashley Greene. Also returning, Dakota Fanning as Jane and she is stunning and very beautiful.<br/><br/>There are new major editions to the cast: Jodelle Ferland plays the role of Bree Tanner, a newly turned vampire. Ferland was in a video game adaptation of Silent Hill, which was released in 2006. Other new cast members included: Julia Jones as Leah Clearwater, Booboo Stewart as Seth Clearwater, Jack Huston as Royce King, Catalina Sandino Moreno as Maria and Xavier Samuel as Riley.<br/><br/>The biggest casting change was the part of Victoria. Since the character was originally played by Rachel Lefevre, Summit Entertainment announced that Bryce Dallas Howard would play the part for the third film. Lefevre was saddened and disappointed by the decision to recast her part. The action sequences is really what makes the movie a stand-out for me and the fight choreography is really good. This movie should have won an Academy Award for best visual effects and best music as far as those two went.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: ECLIPSE is really good, if not better than the third film."
"Martypies","8","1","4","27 June 2015"," Good representation of the book, but not perfect!
","Many people have slammed this movie, pretty much the same people who hate all the Twilight films. For a franchise that made over 3.3 billion dollars, they certainly cop a lot of flack. It is not fair and most of the criticism comes from immature boyfriends who can't sit still long enough if there is nothing blowing up on the screen! I feel sorry for all directors of these movies because they are hamstrung by ratings censorship. If they were able to make the movies with an MA rating they would have been much better received by a wider audience but because the books were loved by so many young girls, they could not make the movies violent or sexy enough to do the books justice. Eclipse is a very good film but please don't go if you can't keep an open mind, especially if you have not read the books."
"landcguinn","8","1","4","11 May 2015"," This would be my least favorite of the Series
","And, in saying that, I still loved the movie, it is just my least favorite of the five. I thought Bella was different in this movie for some reason. She looked different, she acted different - there was just something ""off"" about her. Maybe she was directed that way on purpose, but Bella was just not the same ""Bella"" of the previous two movies. I didn't care for the character of Reilly. I think he would have been better played as an innocent (instead of the really angry portrayal of his character). I personally didn't care for Leah either. Again, she was just too ""angry."" I mean, hating the Cullen's is one thing, but it's almost as if because she lost Sam to Emily, she hated life all together. She was, after all, Seth's sister, and he was just such a sweetheart. Jacob beefed up for this movie for sure, and I liked him a little better. He didn't take Edward's place in my heart whatsoever, I always have been and will forever remain: Team Cullen!"
"maxi-neubauer","6","1","4","15 July 2010"," Wrongly Interpretated and Unperfected
","I would really like to write a positive review to this movie, but I tend not to.<br/><br/>This movie is not a masterpiece, but it isn't too bad either.<br/><br/>I love the Twilight Series, but the movies have disappointed me so far. I mean, they simply haven't come up to my expectations. They weren't bad but I had hoped for more. New Moon was the one that I actually loved, though the storyline of the book had already made me sleepy while reading and therefore the movie was a little boring at some parts as well. Fact is that the director did a good job and so I was thrilled by the way he presented the story.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm not willing to criticize the story itself, because the books are not subject to the rating of this movie - also, we have to say that, in most cases, the books usually are better than the movies. Questions about and incomprehension of different characters and actions belong in an internet forum on a fan side, not in a movie review of a film that is based on a number one novel...<br/><br/>The Movie: This movie in one word: corny. When it was clear that David Slade would direct ""Eclipse"" people hoped for good action. Maybe that's why they hired him. I was very impressed that a man like him produced something that wasn't only a romantic movie, but turned out to become a quite exaggerated version of what the fans had already read in the novel.<br/><br/>But well, the director is the one to interpret. Therefore, the movie left the impression on me that David Slade got the story the wrong way.<br/><br/>The result of his work is dull, almost like: OK, I don't like the story but I got to make a movie - so just let's get it over with...<br/><br/>What the movie is missing is tension, feeling the viewer develops - short: dramaturgy. I felt like there was too less music. This is a device that usually brings up emotions.<br/><br/>I was surprised that the presentation of the title was almost the same as in New Moon, why didn't he come up with something that would underline his style or the character of the movie?<br/><br/>It seems like the editing wasn't completely done or time was short.<br/><br/>The screenplay was good and fulfills the novel. But there is a lot of comedy in this movie, maybe a bit too much. It overlays the actual seriousness of the situation and makes the story seem a little ridiculous from time to time. <br/><br/>Special effects, besides the wolves, were a little disaster in this movie. I mean, the scene in the woods when it snows looks unreal, it's obviously a fake landscape. Okay, they couldn't have Taylor Lautner run around half naked in actual freezing conditions, but we've seen better fake landscapes. <br/><br/>Is the movie HD? I could see the makeup on their faces! Which, by the way, was a little too much on the vampires. They didn't look beautiful to me anymore... Maybe it was the light... And since when does the hair of vampires grow? Jasper's was shorter just a view twilight- months ago...<br/><br/>In my eyes the actors did a good job.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner presents Jacob just the way he is in the novel: overprotective in an uncomfortable way, bossy and trying to tell Bella what's best for her (which makes her actually think about if she's making the right decisions).<br/><br/>Robert Pattinsson sticks to Edward's typical facial expressions. Though it was debated that he would not be the best cast for the character, we get used to him and he is quite convincing in his role. (By the way, I think he is SUPPOSED TO be overshadowed by Jacob, because he willingly keeps in the background to let Bella decide and not force her to anything! It's not because of acting abilities...)<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart seems to identify with Bella better. She understands her character quite well. I never had trouble to buy what she did or said. Besides, the actress seems to have a totally different personality...<br/><br/>Robert and Kristen together seem different now. They are much more convincing as a couple. Who knows why... ;)<br/><br/>Conclusion: Do not watch if you're unfamiliar with the novels or the story itself!! It doesn't change what's in the novels but doesn't present it with all the facts and stuff you believe you know about the characters when you read the books. Cause what's fascinating about the Twilight movies is to see what you've read. It's not made for someone who expects one movie that concludes and starts logically.<br/><br/>Fans will like it, but for them it's not a perfected movie."
"lilholik","6","2","13","2 July 2010"," Best of the three
","Eclipse was by far the best of the Twilight saga so far. I'm not a reader so I will not discuss how close or far this film is from the book. What I do know is I am by far a huge vampire and werewolf fan.<br/><br/>I will start with the acting though. Very much improved but still not great. After seeing Robert Pattinson in the movie 'Remember Me' I hardly doubt his acting ability and blame it on this series that I even thought he was bad. On the other hand, I can't say that for the other two big three. It does seem as though Kristen Stewart has read comments or something and has decided to try breathing through her nose for once but her acting is definitely not great. How she got cast for this part I'm not even sure (though I would not change her now). Taylor Lautner is improving but I still see him as the worser of the three. Congrats on all the muscles but you probably should have worked on your acting abilities a little more.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the first 20 minutes were horrible but the movie did pick up. In the end I did enjoy the film but had I not been interested in the saga I probably would not have been. This film was much better put together than the first two and finally some decent action to it. I'm still lost on how 2 people fall in love with Bella's character but hey... that's what Hollywood does.<br/><br/>I still think after reading a lot of the reviews here that so many are biased but the horrible obsession people have created over this series. The movie was not bad... the acting was much improved and the action and dialogue was better. I liked Twilight but I liked New Moon better (though I was not at all satisfied with it the first time and watching it again away from a bunch of screaming teen-aged girls in the theater definitely made a difference) and I definitely like Eclipse more than others.<br/><br/>Overall you wanna be somewhat knowledgeable of the series before you go. But it is entertaining."

","Considering my hate of the previous two Twilight films, I was surprised that this managed to engage me for the entire 2 hours. The film is simply better as a whole. The second film was unnecessary, with protagonists going missing, and the same love story playing out in a loop. Nothing was resolved in the last film, so it's good to see David Slade being able to handle this more complete picture. He does a surprising amount, finishing off character arcs from the first film, visiting the Cullens' pasts in rather sumptuous and well paced flashbacks, and giving everyone a bit more substance. Rather than laughing at the film, it actually made me laugh intentionally a few times. Jacob, Bella and Edward are still mostly terrible and boring characters. I just can't care for their relationships. One of the new antagonists was much more interesting. An emotional puppet coming to terms with his new powers. The wolves also looked A LOT better, and it was depressing to see action scenes that were shot better than recent action films such as The Expendables and The A Team."
"yevonwm","6","1","5","11 December 2010"," The weaker of the three films
","I haven't read the books but I was definitely disappointed with how little happens in this film. I saw all 3 films in a day and the first 2 were fairly fast paced and entertaining but for a film that sells itself as a romance novel *nothing* happens in it. There are some action scenes and some fairly impressive CGI werewolves but they still cut away a lot of the time when a vampire does something that would involve CGI which makes you wonder what they spent their $65M budget on. I was also pretty fraustrated with the constant swaying of the plot, its obvious whats going to happen at the end of the film but it goes backward and forward treating the viewer like a bit of an idiot. Honestly you could skip this film, knowing that theirs a fourth coming out next year I'd just wait for that."
"joben-525-633946","6","1","6","16 December 2012"," Eclipses 'New Moon'
","Certainly over the top on romance scales, stuffed with ridiculous dialogue and an inconsistent cast, the 'Twilight' adaptions certainly leave their-selves open to criticism. However, for some strange reason, I found 'Twilight' a reasonably entertaining encounter and the much slated 'New Moon' - pummelled with abuse from critics - more than watchable. So what for 'Eclipse'?<br/><br/>It is certainly not without its flaws which have been highlighted transparently at the beginning of my review. Just like the original movie though, if you are able to cast a blind eye to the cringe-worthy aspects it entails, you may be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a villainous vampire intent on revenge following Edward Cullen's (Robert Pattinson) antics in the first instalment. She will attempt to pursue Edward's love Bella (Kristen Stewart) and kill her to make him feel how she did. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, numerous deaths in Seattle force the wolves and vampires (good) together in a bid to stop a possible vampire army.<br/><br/>Also, Bella must make a difficult decision over who she really loves - Edward or childhood friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner). <br/><br/>Flashes of 'Eclipse' are what makes it a greater achievement than the much slower paced 'New Moon'. A thrilling climax and an intriguing love triangle are the main highlights of the film but also the fact it includes some an essence of humour. 'New Moon' had a gloomy ambiance and took time to find its rhythm; it wasn't necessarily a poor sequel but its what made it the weakest of the three.<br/><br/>'Twilight' and 'Eclipse' are my current highs in the franchise however I still expect greater achievements for the coming movies. These films are just beginning to get interesting..."
"melisafilm","9","1","6","28 November 2011"," Not for all, but a pretty good movie!!
","In the Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010), David Slade pieced together just enough fluttering romance, heart pounding suspense and action packed material for his target audience. While this may not be the movie for the typical sci-fi lover or anyone of that nature, it is a wonderful title for those of you who crave romantic films. This movie fulfilled all expectations of a characteristic romance but also had enough variation that it would keep any emotional movie go-er wanting more. This movie also provides beliefs and values from both sides of the spectrum – Edward, the polite conservative of the 20th century and Bella, the teenager of our century; it provides some beliefs relevant for almost every age.<br/><br/>Who says you can't be in love with a 110-year-old-yet-forever-17-year-old vampire? Not Stephanie Meyer. This film (as does the original novel it derived from) adds a refreshing new flavor to the typical love story. Compared with other films of the same genre, it does fit all the requirements. Two people, against the odds, find love and persevere until the end – 'til death does them part, except it doesn't end there. She's in love with a vampireoh and a werewolf. Another vampire – make that an army of vampires, are setting out to kill her. She wants to get married but with doing that she is moving into a houseful of vampiresone of whom accidentally tried to kill her in one of the previous film of the series. Stacking this movie up against other movies – traditional or original? I say both.<br/><br/>The verdict is Twilight: Eclipse is a great addition to the saga and will be a hit with the love-crazed and Jacob-loving fans. It extends the borders of what a ""romantic film"" truly is and keeps you at the edge of your seat (even if you've read the book). Keeping this in mind, if ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Inception"" are the types of movies that are your cup of tea, this movie is not something that is exactly recommended for you. But if you loved the last two Twilight Saga films, or just have a sweet-spot for the romance genre, then you'll go Twi-hard for this one."

","The Twilight Saga's: Eclipse is the third entry in the series. No, it doesn't compare to Twlight, but it is very entertaining and is much better than the last drab entry, New Moon. This time, Victoria is back, with a vengeance, seeking Bella out once again for the loss of her beloved James. Meanwhile, an army of newborn vampires, lead by MIA, Riley Biers, is attacking the town of Seattle as the Cullens stand by, awaiting the Venturi to step in. When they don't and Edward's Bella is threatened, the Cullens are forced to take action against the newborns before it is too late. Eclipse also introduces a new feel to the saga, with a bit of comedy that will have you giggling away as some legendary lines are dropped along the way. Charlie is hilarious in every scene,and Jacob and Edward's anti-alliance make some dramatic scenes more entertaining. Along with action, romance accompanies, with the same love triangle that we've seen in both Twilight and New Moon. To some, the romance is getting old, but for others the mystery of whom Bella will choose lingers in the air and will keep you guessing until the very end. Secrets are revealed, lives are lossed, and one's intentions are questioned as this heartpounding saga continues."

","(Credit IMDb) As a string of mysterious killings grips Seattle, Bella, whose high school graduation is fast approaching, is forced to choose between her love for vampire Edward and her friendship with werewolf Jacob.<br/><br/>I'm not a Twilight Junkie. I'm not on Team Edward, Team Jacob, Team Bella, or any other silly stuff like that. If you're one of those people reading this review, skedaddle! I do blame the Twilight franchise for making crazy teenagers think that this is what vampires is all about, but I'm far from a hater. The first Twilight gets blander each time you watch it. New Moon is a bit more fun, and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was at least well done for the most part. I truly feel Eclipse is the best movie of the series. While New Moon really started Bella & Jacob's feelings for one another, this movie explores it even further. I've always felt Bella & Jacob had far more chemistry with each other. Robert Pattinson is a decent actor, but his Edward Cullen character was inferior to Jacob's in my opinion. I've never read any of the books, but Bella & Jacob are far more interesting together. As decent as New Moon was, it was a bit too serious in my opinion at times. This actually has some goofy humor, which serves this movie well. Kristen Stewart is considered laconic to many, she gets plenty of meme's made about her lack of emotion on the internet, but I think she's one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Watch stuff like Cake Eaters, Yellow Handkerchief, Welcome to The Riley's, Speak, among other things, and you'll see I'm right. She's solid as usual as Bella, but some of the stuff she does made my eyes roll. She kisses Jacob because she is torn between him & Edward. She is rather promiscuous. If I was either one of them, I'd say ""Sorry, hunny. You're on your own!"" It made me laugh, don't get me wrong, but it makes it hard to root for Bella as a character. Robert Pattinson is OK, and has much more screen time in this one. That's either a good, or a bad thing, depending on who you are. Taylor Lautner has some natural charm to him. He isn't necessarily a great actor, but he does have semblance of charisma. He has more to play with as well. The rest of the cast range from adequate to solid<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It's cheesy as hell, but I enjoyed. There! I said it! I always give credit where credit is due, and I always try to give films a fair chance. This is entertaining, if nothing else<br/><br/>7/10"

","As this, the third instalment of the 'Twilight Saga' gets underway a vampire is at large in the city of Seattle; it transpires that he isn't hunting though; he is creating new vampires to form an army. Meanwhile back in the town of Forks vampire Edward Cullen is proposing to his girlfriend Bella Swan; she isn't in a rush to marry but does want him to make her a vampire; something he doesn't wish to do. Things are complicated somewhat by the fact that her friend, the werewolf Jacob, is deeply in love with her and believes that she could love him too despite her protestations to the contrary. When the Cullen clan learns that there is an army being raised in Seattle that intends to come after them and Bella they prepare for battle; a battle that if they hope to win they will have to get help from their natural enemies the werewolves! When the battle comes they learn that there is an old enemy behind the new army; an enemy who wants Edward to suffer.<br/><br/>After the somewhat disappointing 'New Moon' things get a lot better here; there is a good sense of atmosphere and the young vampires make a good enemy; as does the person behind them. The love triangle took up a bit more time than I would have preferred but given that it is meant to be a romance I can hardly complain. The special effects were decent but at times felt a little too obvious; especially as the werewolves transformed from human to CGI wolves in a fraction of a second. The cast do a good enough job although I wish Taylor Lautner, who played Jacob, had kept his shirt on a bit more seeing him like that reminded me that I'm not in the target demographic for this film! Overall I'd say fans of the series will almost certainly love this and those who dislike 'Twilight' won't although why anybody that hated it would still be watching by part three is a mystery unless they are being forced to watch by their teenage daughters."

","Unlike many people who have given this movie negative reviews, I like the Twilight Saga Movies. The acting is criticized, but the actors portray their characters accurately and convincingly as they were written. Certainly, the books are not Shakespeare, but they are interesting and light reading. There is good use of music in each of the movies, and each movie is different. Someone complained that these are NOT werewolves. That is true, the wolves in the Twilight movies are ""shape shifters,"" not werewolves. Besides which werewolves and vampires don't actually exist - it's all fantasy! So if Stephanie Meyer's take on vampires is different from the traditional interpretation, so what? I actually found this interpretation of vampires interesting and different.<br/><br/>There is also criticism of Bella's character being whiny and selfish. There are many young people who feel like Bella's character; not outstanding in anything, not fitting in etc. I see Bella finally discovering she can ""shine"" (as a vampire) allegorical and encouragement for any young person that there is a place where they too can shine.<br/><br/>And then someone said Edward's refusing to have sex with Bella before marriage means he's gay. What!? It is refreshing to see a movie where a young couple waits until marriage to have sex.<br/><br/>In any event, I find the Twilight movies entertaining and interesting, which is all I expect in a movie"

","I must admit at first I wasn't a fan of twilight in fact I strongly disliked it but after watching the first instalment (purely because there was nothing else on TV) I found myself wanting to watch the others and so I did and from what I have seen there are some things that should have been improved for example the vampires sparkle which I thought to be very stupid, Kristin Stuart's acting could've been better as well as Robert Pattinsons'. But as the saga went along they became better actors but still need a bit of improvement i also thought that eclipse is the best one i have seen it has more drama, action and it was nice to see another actor step up to the plate-Jackson Rathbone-who plays Jasper Hale did a fantastic job in preparing and teaching the others about the 'Newborns' but in my opinion this tells/shows me that jasper has a harder time dealing with human blood than the others i mean after all he had to kill them off. It was also nice to see the past of some of the characters and to see the wear wolves and vampires unite for Bella's safety. Like all novel based films not every film will have it word for word or it will miss out on less important parts of the book i mean after all they have to fit it into a 2 hour movie, so just be happy with what they have created. If your not happy with it, simple DON'T WATCH IT.<br/><br/>Overall if you are a Twilight fan you should be happy with this film but if you're not answer this question:<br/><br/>why are you watching the twilight saga if you hate it?<br/><br/>Ps. I have not watched breaking dawn when i wrote this so please excuse Best one i have seen comment as it MAY NOT be true when I see Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this."

","Okay, I'm not a die hard Twilight Fan. I'm not part of any team, and I DON'T wanna have Robert Pattinson's babies LOL! I DO however enjoy these movies very much. The acting has steadily improved and I would definitely recommend these to ONLY THOSE WHO ARE NOT CLOSE MINDED PEOPLE WHO Don't HAVE A LIFE!!! Like I said I'm not crazy for these movies, but I'm open minded and these have grown on me. In their defense, there are plenty of other movies that are a series to pick on. I collect movies, its a hobby, and I learned that everyone has an opinion. So for those of you that hate this series...just keep your big mouths shut, and get a life. Let people have their opinions! Let them get whatever small joys out of life that they can. If you don't like these movies, state your opinion, but end it there. Don't write a loooooooooooonnnnnng drawn out story about how you hate them. Let people like what they like! I am definitely looking forward to going to the Breaking Dawn Premier this Friday!!!"
"clgoodson7","Null","1","7","13 November 2011"," Leaps and bounds above the first two films
","This film shocked me and when I say shocked me I mean wowwwww!!!! This was a decent movie. To some it was even worse a movie because they are of the a.d.d generation and have no right reviewing something if they don't have an understanding and appreciation for the art of filmmaking! This film had a stronger story than the first two combined, the acting was much improved, though still very dramatic ala Gothic soap opera. Kristen was very much there emotionally and seemed more grown up and less self centered. Robert Pattinson provided an intensity that allowed chemistry to be more believable and relevant for the two lovers. I gotta hand it to David Slade. I think he did the best who could to pick up the pieces that were so amateurishly, lazily, slopped around by the previous two directors who obviously had no artistic dedication to the series. Those directors were the evil genius masterminds who knew they would make a ton of money and didn't have to make good a movie to do so. Those fainting screaming girls just want to see their characters visibly on screen and it didn't matter to them if the movies were actually seriously respectable. But David Slade is an aspiring filmmaker with a respect for the art as seen in his debut Hard Candy. He really did try to use the clicheeeeeeeeeeee driven writing of Stephanie Meyer and make something special out of it all. And he succeeds more than fails! Eclipse is not a perfect movie but It gives a bit of hope for those true film lovers who are in the know of how trashy the series has been handled, the hope for those fans that are still curious as to where the finale will go, that maybe, just maybe, fourth time is a charm and it will all end with a BANGGG!!!! But do we usually allow more than three strikes??? We shall see!"

","Just watched Eclipse on DVD this afternoon, watched twilight on sky the other week so decided to watch new moon again and then eclipse for the first time. Daughter watched a couple of days before me and she said it was good. I loved it, its a story of romance and love. The special effects are great we wondered how they make the vampires look like they are running so fast, so we watched the special features behind the scenes etc DVD, and the special effects are fantastic, you need to watch that to see how much effort goes into making films that make people do things that are impossible. I really believed that they are vampires thats how good the acting and effects are. Blokes wont probably like it too much as its about finding true love and it doesn't happen in real life but its a film make believe, because if there are vampires and werewolves like that outside I am staying inside. We have now decided to buy and read the books as according to the special effects DVD they only put a small proportion of the book in, there is always more in the books. We cant wait for the next part."
"gpunkts","6","1","7","21 March 2011"," Best film of the 3 so far
","This is definitely a watchable action/romance film. If you compare it with the best of the genre - of course it falls short in a couple of categories, but it definitely is head and shoulders above the previous 2 films. Most important - try watching it without any pre-set ideas.<br/><br/>About the bad parts: yes, some of the acting is very shallow. Yes, the tempo is a bit slower for a normal action film. Yes, the plot is a bit unrealistic. Then again - you do not watch such films for a realistic plots.<br/><br/>The good things: there are really nice views (and I am not talking about the visual effects, just nice sceneries), there is a nice ambiance, and this time you do care a bit about the characters, as they finally seem to have at least some motivation.<br/><br/>So I would advise you to watch the film if you want some easy going entertainment and in general like the combination of action and romance.<br/><br/>But of course, don't expect a masterpiece here. Just a normal film."
"TxMike","Null","1","7","17 December 2010"," Third in the series, I rather enjoyed this one.
","It helps to have seen the first two, for continuity, but it is not essential. I am a bit surprised at its low rating, as I think it is a better movie than the second one.<br/><br/>The news (in the movie) tells us there have been a rash of unexplained murders in the Seattle area. We soon find out that a rogue vampire is building an army. It does this by biting people who then get vampire attributes and, as we also learn, are the strongest when ""newborn"" as a vampire. But why? <br/><br/>The new character is pretty Bryce Dallas Howard as pretty, red-head vampire Victoria. She is out for revenge because her vampire boyfriend had been destroyed some time back, and her best revenge would be to destroy Bella. So the whole movie is about both the vampires and the werewolves in the Forks, Washington area protecting Bella.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is of course back as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, and Taylor Lautner as werewolf Jacob Black. Each of them loves Bella and wants her for himself, each convinced that he would be the best for her. This creates some interesting, competitive situations.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: During the third act the local vampires and werewolves cooperate to create a plan to protect Bella and to defeat the army of outside vampires. They succeed and Victoria is destroyed. Bella agrees to marry Edward, but still wants to become a vampire. Edward still resists. I suppose we will find out in the next movie."
"lasy365","8","1","7","12 December 2010"," Follows Book Given Format
","All the naysayers, my my. No it's not perfect and the acting is sometimes painful but, people love it because of the books. If you hadn't read them you would feel completely different about the film. You would have been looking forward to it like the next episode of NCIS. The books have spoiled us all. Very had to compete with are expectations of what and who these characters should be.<br/><br/>I think the bottom line is a one weekend gross that paid for the film. Not to many films even come close to that. We will watch them all hopping for the few moments that come close to what we wanted to see. Otherwise, wait until it comes in a box set, all five films, for ten bucks. At least you can save some money."

","I was really looking forward to this movie as most of us twihards were, but I was really disappointed. There were parts in the actual film where the movie was literally green, I know this is probably the theaters's fault, but honestly we waited how long to see it.<br/><br/>I loved that Bella had a stronger role in this movie, but there was so much lacking from the story plot that should have been in there. This is completely the screen writer's fault.<br/><br/>Melissa Rosenburgh not only went back and changed ideas and thoughts that she put into New Moon, but she forgot a lot of important things. The way Stephanie Meyer wrote Jasper and Alice's introduction was perfect, and should have really been left as it was. The perfect southern gentleman! Melissa Rosenburgh please get your head out of your butt, I understand fabricating small battles like in New Moon, but really? Why are you ruining these books for the true readers? Do not disappoint me for Breaking Dawn, it is by far my favorite book and I want to see every detail played out like I would have while I was reading the it."
"eastwoodbound","8","1","7","5 August 2010"," Maturing With New And Better Direction
","David Slade has thus far been my favorite director on the Saga. I loved his work in 30 Days Of Night and Hard Candy so it was no surprise to me that Eclipse surpassed Twilight and New Moon in presence. It felt darker and more engaging as well as complicated, despite already knowing the story from the books. The only complaint was with casting. I know I don't stand alone on this issue but either Bryce Dallas Howard should have never been cast in this part or the make-up department behind her should have been fired, maybe both. Thankfully, Victoria dies. BUT, Michael Sheen was great casting!<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke's version was quite dull and cheap to me and Chris Weitz upped the ante but it was just sorta soapy to me, just my opinion. Even Bella's look went from plain to make-up and soapy in transition. I thought this was Chris's best work and enjoyed it much more than The Golden Compass.<br/><br/>I think Breaking Dawn will be worth the wait, but it is tragically so far away. It's the greatest book in the series and it was smart to break it in two. I didn't know all that much about Bill Condon to tell you the truth but I just watched Chicago the other night and was beyond impressed. I think the best is yet to come....."
"Monsterattackjapan","6","1","7","20 July 2010"," Better than the previous but it's still too uneven
","In the core of The Twilight Saga, there is the love story of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. And in the first book I found this rather entertaining and cheesy but still entertaining. But as the books kept adding more and more, that was lost and the movies while being poorly made aren't really helping. In Eclipse this core isn't really part of the movie, the movie works with all the added material, mainly Jacob Black.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is an actor I do like but not playing Edward. His performance in Eclipse relies solely on the same painful look on his face and nothing else, and he talks kinda like an emo Christopher Walken. He does have a good few lines in the movies, but nothing else really. Edward come off as a jerk and rather creepy, instead of charming as he is supposed to be. Kristen Stewart has the hardest job as she has the weakest character. Kristen doesn't fit this role at all, she is a great actress that ends up coming off as flat and uninteresting as Bella, thanks to a uneven screenplay. And her character just gets weaker and weaker as the movies go on, she can even make the most simple of decision in this movie. Then there is Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black that is fantastic in this, the one character I didn't care for at all in the books, is the only one I give a damn about in the movies. Lautner plays Jacob with a certain mix of charm and a cocky attitude that works on- screen and is fun to watch. The rest of the rest of the cast is decent, unlike the previous movies in which they really didn't have much of role, in Eclipse they all play a much bigger part and they all worked well.There is definitely chemistry in the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The big improvement of Eclipse is that it doesn't take itself as serious as the previous installments. They joke around about how over the top and ridiculous everything is and it makes the movie easier to like and more fun to watch. The other improvement is the action,it's very well choreographed and it's exciting and entertaining to watch. These are much-needed improvements in the franchise and they made the experience so much enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are still many problems needed to make these movies great, Eclipse is the only one of these movies that I would say is good, but still many improvements are needed. The plot of the army of new-born vampire could have been more interesting but the plot is really non-existing because the movie keeps its focus so much on Edward,Bella and Jacob that they rush the story towards the end and just tell you whats gonna happen instead of showing us, and letting us be part of the film. So, it feels more like a friend explaining the novel to you instead of you paying to watch the work of professional writers, actors and director. And, I know that Twilight is more about the characters than the plot, but when the lead character is so weak,and Edward being so obviously one note, that leaves the movie in a tough position. I like the supporting cast but their time is so limited on-screen they don't add much to the movie, so it's up to leads and only Lautner stepped up .One actor can only do so much.<br/><br/>So summing things up, Eclipse is a decent movie, way ahead of the previous installments. It still won't win over non-fans, but with the better made action scenes and occasional humor it's a more enjoyable experience. Many improvements are still needed, but this is a good step forward. It's more of the same but it's better made.<br/><br/>I give it a 6.5/10"
"TheMovieGal","Null","1","7","14 July 2010"," Twilight: Eclipse comes to theaters with great anticipation
","For many years young girls have fantasized of being the damsel in distress. Times due change but the main theme of a young girl needing a knight to come to rescue her continue to infuse themselves into our newest films. In a mix of vampires and werewolves, The Twilight Films have capitalized on bringing a story to the screen that satisfies the girls romanticism of stories known mostly today as fairy tales.<br/><br/>""Twilight: Eclipse,"" which opened last weekend is the third film in a series brought to screen as an adaption of the very popular books written by Stephenie Meyer. Bella, the central character played by Kristen Stewart, continues her relationship with her vampire boyfriend Edward, portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Bella is a self-admitted awkward teenager and her character has more complicated decisions than most teenagers. About to graduate from high school, it's not what college to select that concerns her. Her desire to be a vampire and evolve into a new and strange world is her main desire. Yet, there are battles to be won and hearts to be broken before things resolve. Taylor Lautner returns as Jacob along with all the vampires as well.<br/><br/>""Twilight: Eclipse"" is a fair film on it's own, but for Twilight fans it is the best of the three films. This film has had a special effects upgrade and the story line allows the us to see in the past of the vampires long lives. There are quite a few breaks of humor that sparkle in the mist of such a dark story of even a darker world. Billy Burke, as Bella's father, provides the necessary anchor to make the story effective and he and Kristen Stewart share a few good father/daughter moments.<br/><br/>It is truly a mistake to see this movie without viewing the previous films ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon,"" which luckily are out on DVD. If you are ready for two hours of vampires, werewolves and more teenage angst than the prom, this is the film for you. And as the Twilight fans already know that this is not the finish for the series of films. Twilight: Breaking Dawn will be sent to theaters in two parts. Part one to air in 2011 and part two to follow in 2012.<br/><br/>For more film review by Kay Shackleton, click here: http://www.examiner.com/x-53875-Palm-Springs-Film-Industry-Examiner"
"speechie125","7","1","7","13 July 2010"," Come on, these movies are just fun!
","If you were a fan of the books (which by the way have a good story, but are very poorly written), then you will like the movies. These characters are supposed to be melodramatic. That's the point.. it's fantasy and it's fun. It has romance, action, attractive people, and they are entertaining. <br/><br/>I am not a big Kristen Stewart fan and she is really what detracts from the movies. She is not Bella Swan, she is just Kristin Stewart acting sad or worried or attempting to have a personality. She uses the same mannerisms to express emotion in everything I have seen her in. The book Bella is a much brighter character despite the darkness in which she finds herself. I just want to shake Stewart sometimes.. please demonstrate something other than forced reaction to the surroundings. The guys are good and I can't really imagine other actors playing those characters. Edward is supposed to be tortured and emotive and Jake is supposed to have a serious anger management problem and be completely okay with it. Pretty spot on really. <br/><br/>All the critique aside, this is romantic fantasy at it's best. It is utterly non-reality related and provides a superb break from the mundane. I think especially for women, it catapults us into one of the most delicious imaginary worlds ever... the two most perfect yet forbidden men completely in love with us and willing to fight to the death if necessary. Come on, that's just money right there and I'll take another bite of that apple thank you very much."
"gran_taire","10","1","7","9 July 2010"," definitely deserving of a higher rating...
","Okay, let me start by saying that I am a fan of Twilight. I'm not die hard, and I only really liked it after I heard Kristen was going to be in in the saga. Eclipse was my favorite book in the series, so I had been eagerly awaiting it's release. I wasn't expecting it to be Oscar winning movie making, but I sure was surprised at how great it was. Let me start with the script. The plot & dialogue were much better written in this film than the first two by Melissa Rosenberg. The soundtrack was AMAZING as well. The music featured many hot artists in the current indie scene, and the music was great, and it was used wonderfully in the film. The acting wasn't Oscar winning, i must admit, however it did surpass well over the expectations for normal films. Many call Kristen Stewart's acting horrible, but when you see the script, it's just how Bella was written. The author for the original books has stated that Bella was something like an avatar for people reading to put themselves in to, and Kristen does do a good job of portraying that into the character. The rest of the acting was wonderful, the short lovely moments with stars like Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard really add up to make a good movie. Howard Shore did a magnificent job at the score, and it also made the film better. Kudos David Spade, this movie was great. Sure it may not be Oscar winning, but it's still enjoyable, and isn't that what it was trying to achieve? I seriously doubt someone could rate this movie so low, there is nothing seriously wrong with anything. I suspect some people dislike this movie because of the whole Twilight label it holds. Just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is. It's a big improvement from the other films in the franchise, and with more action, great music, not bad acting, and wonderful cinematography, what isn't to like?"
"bkoganbing","7","1","7","8 July 2010"," Uneasy Alliance
","For those who read the books that this film series is based on there were no plot surprises. But filmgoers like myself might have expected that the vampires and werewolves would be going at each other in Eclipse.<br/><br/>Not so, instead the vampires led by Robert Pattinson and the Indian werewolves featuring Taylor Lautner work out an uneasy truce in Eclipse. It's a tension filled truce because these two really hate each other because of their love of Kristen Stewart. Because of that they unite to defend against a common enemy.<br/><br/>In nearby Seattle there have been a rash of killings and disappearances that have the city in panic. The vampires however know what's going on. Someone is recruiting a vampire army in the way that vampires have done since Bela Lugosi. And we learn in Eclipse that new vampires are the strongest because they've not learned discipline. <br/><br/>Who's doing this is Bryce Dallas Howard, female vampire who's mate was killed by Robert Pattinson back in the first movie. She's out to get the human girl he loves in the same manner.<br/><br/>But since Taylor Lautner is also in love with Stewart, he can get the werewolves to work in uneasy alliance with the vampires to save Kristen. It all leads to a real nasty climax of a battle.<br/><br/>The stars are among the hottest box office there is in current Hollywood. Pattinson's soulful looks together with Stewart's beauty and Lautner's physique all have their share of fans. Personally I'm a fan of Lautner who has the finest teen body since Mario Lopez on Saved By The Bell.<br/><br/>Nice sincere playing by the cast and the great special effects make this an undead treat. I still love the way the Indian kids wolf out to protect the tribal land."
"bearofspades","8","1","7","8 July 2010"," My first dip into the franchise.
","I'm a 44 year old English teacher in Korea and have had to listen to my students praise these movies and beg me to watch them ever since they started coming out. I resisted because I obviously wasn't in it's target audience. I do like good vampire stories, but this series didn't seem to be it. That said, I broke down and saw the movie.<br/><br/>Wow, it was just a movie. Nothing hideous; easy to follow even though I'd never seen its predecessors or read any of the books. Over all, the feeling is hyper-melodramatic and that makes it drag a bit. But is that enough to make so many people dislike it so strongly? Why do we always need things blowing up and jumping from one scene to another? The drama felt grounded, the flaws in acting felt like weaknesses inherent in the actors' young age and/or the character's young age. Pattison is 24 and his character is supposed to be so aged but he comes off so naive and younger than his actual age. Lautner just comes off really young. I like the way he projects a young person's seriousness when they think they fully understand all the emotions they have, but they don't, really, because it's just their first time. He really came off well portraying someone having deep feelings for someone else for the first time and the awkwardness that goes along with that. As for Stewart, I saw The Runaways first and was afraid I was just going to feel like I was just seeing Joan Jet again. I was happy that it wasn't true. I don't know if her Bella matches the one in the books, but it is separate from the other characters I've seen her play, and that was nice. She shows talent. All the other characters threatened to be over-shadowed by the leads and the central triangle. That's why I enjoyed the flashbacks giving more information about some of the secondary characters.<br/><br/>Over all, I connected with it far more than the Underworld series. The landscapes are gorgeous and the cinematography is nice if not exceptional. For all its action and violence, I found it to be a quiet movie about one girl's dilemma between two guys. As such, it held my attention surprisingly well."
"EdwardJasper","8","1","7","8 July 2010"," A lousy screenplay, but top quality acting and directing save this from being a flop!
","This was without a doubt the absolute best of the series so far. However, the screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg was absolutely dreadful and to be frank this woman can write good at all. The actors fell a little flat because of the screenplay. The acting was good and the leads were very convincing. The directing of the film was great and the romance between the triangle of Jacob, Edward and Bella was nicely done by the director. It did need more humph though and that again is a short coming of Melissa Rosenberg.<br/><br/>There great scenes of comedic value that Billy Burke with Kirsten Stewart had. The scene where they talk about how Bella is a virgin is highly amusing and after Bella hits Jacob for kissing her, the scene with Charlie, Jacob, Edward and Bella is funny. The pace of the film is quite good and the final fight scene with the wolves is handled incredibly well, this was the only real highlight of the screenplay."
"hizdotter-649-878865","6","1","7","7 July 2010"," Must read the books to fully appreciate these films.
","You must ""READ"" the books to get the entire story. I felt the movie plays along the storyline the best they could with the short amount of time they had. For those of you who haven't read any of the books I completely understand what you are missing but it is wonderful to watch these movies after you have read the books as your mind fills in the rest. These Saga's are much better stories than the Spiderman, Batman, Wolverine, Iron man and Star Wars romances in those Sci-Fi movies. Those who gave these poor ratings obviously are not readers and haven't ever read classic romance novels such as Romeo & Juliet, Wurthering Heights, any of Jane Austen's either."
"DJRumpy","6","1","7","7 July 2010"," Decent enough with more action than the previous titles
","Let me first state that I'm not a 'fan' of this series, so I've never read the books, and my only exposure is via the movies themselves.<br/><br/>I found this installment in the series to actually be a bit better than the first two. It is definitely more action oriented, with a faster paced plot than the previous titles. I was not a fan of the angst filled themes in the first two, and you don't escape that completely in the third, but it's not so overbearing as it was in the first two where I ended up just wishing Bella would be hit by a truck.<br/><br/>The acting actually seemed improved from the first two as well. I would chalk this up to the actors becoming more familiar with their roles and having a little more experience under their belt. I'm actually surprised that this film has a 4.5. I can only assume the fans of the genre found some fault or flaw that they didn't think kept true to the original story. I didn't find myself looking at my watch, or noticing how long the movie was so I rated it slightly above average.<br/><br/>If you're a casual viewer of this series like I am, you will probably enjoy it. It smacks of typical summer fare that is enjoyable, if not forgettable. It was easily worth matinÃ©e prices and kept me entertained for 2 hours, so I consider it a better than average movie. <br/><br/>6 out of 10 for decent action scenes, a good story line, and decent acting. Don't expect any awards, but expect to get a decent few hours of entertainment."
"tehlemonhead","6","1","7","6 July 2010"," still not great, but worth seeing
","As someone sick of the hype and disappointed with what the first two installments did with a good book series, I was pessimistic about the film, but heard The Last Airbender was worse, so I chose to see it. At least I get to see Taylor Lautner a few times, right? <br/><br/>Some scenes were truly entertaining and, well, awesome. Rosalie and Jasper's back-stories gave the film some much-needed depth and character development. Those two and the other supporting actors (the families of the leads) did a good job, even though Jackson Rathbone faltered. Edward was cardboard and disappointing as always, and Bella only has one emotion, but I can't really figure out what to call it.<br/><br/>They spent a lot of time focusing on the so-called attractive leads' faces and a certain shirtless figure, and the effects were shabby in parts, although the CGI wolves were well done.<br/><br/>Several scenes made me want a fast forward button, especially the one-on-one Edward and Bella scenes, but otherwise it was a solid film. The plot could be strange for people who haven't read the books, and some parts confused me even though I've read all four.<br/><br/>But I don't regret the time and money spent on this, and I'll probably rent it with my friends so I can add some commentary to Bella's oh-so-controversial choice. Don't skip it because of the annoying ""Twi-hards"" or the less than mediocre other films. There's some cheesiness and slow movement, it won't win any Oscars, but it's an entertaining two hours."
"BwSwim","6","1","7","6 July 2010"," Best of the Series So far
","Unfortunately for fans of the book series, and for anyone who managed to watch the first two films, the movie series up until this point has been a letdown. The acting was poor, and the story just did not seem to be working on film. They could not convey all of the emotion that was coming from the book, and the dialogue was just not there.<br/><br/>In saying that I was not really looking forward to this movie, but since I read the series I figured I owed it to the books to give it a watch. I went in with low expectations, that were buoyed a little bit by the fact that this is my favorite of the books.<br/><br/>Eclipse as a stand alone movie is decent at best. I would rate it a 6 out of 10. It has it's entertaining parts with the battle scenes, and it actually integrates some humor onto the screen. The actor is the best of the movies so far, but is still mediocre. When comparing it to the other two films I think that this is definitely a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>I would say it is worth a watch if you are a fan of the series, and if not... maybe redbox it."
"benangelus57","7","1","7","6 July 2010"," Best One Yet, But Where's The Continuity?
","I saw this film with my girlfriend on the sneak preview weekend in the UK, and I had expected it to be the best film of the series as it was also the best book of the series too. When i walked out of the cinema the first thing I said was they needed David Slade from the start. Perhaps he wouldn't have captured the emotion of the first two films as they are more of an over-riding factor than in this one which is all geared towards the battle, but he did brilliantly. Without giving too much away the fight scene was very well choreographed and fully deserving of the MTV movie award for best fight scene it will undoubtedly win.<br/><br/>My grievance with this movie is that there is no continuity between the films. for example in all three films when vampires are injured in some way it is different: Twilight: rip like flesh New Moon: crack like stone Eclipse: Weird crystal stuff? Also it may have just been me but I'm certain Jasper and Carlise never had these accents in the first two films which have now just been invented to fit in with their back stories. Whether this was down to the fact the director changes constantly, I don't know, but it was at the back of my mind constantly<br/><br/>overall however this film was easy to lose myself in, and towards the end even felt like a Harry Potter film with the cheery reconciliations accompanied by upbeat music. highly recommend for fans of the series as i doubt Breaking Dawn will live up to these standards"
"RCWjr","7","1","7","4 July 2010"," Eclipses New Moon
","I enjoyed Twilight. New Moon, was not thrilled with and still is not a movie I have seen more than once in the theater and on DVD. I think it was the morose, depressing feel of the movie. That is how the book is, but still, the music, score and soundtrack, and performances/chemistry just seemed off. That is all corrected with Eclipse.<br/><br/>Performances are the best of the series. Stewart and Pattinson have a natural ease to their relationship now that was great to see. Stuart in particular has come a long way. Her constant eye fluttering when she tries to emote is all but gone and she has ditched the continual stop and go delivery that even my 9 year old daughter noticed and grew tired of in the previous films. Still on the relationship front, Stewart and Lautner's chemistry is MUCH improved over New Moon. I never bought into their relationship in New Moon, here, I sense more of a bond between them. All of this is can be created to the actor's finally getting into the groove with their characters, as well as being more seasoned. Also, director Slade should be credited. Who knew that the guy who brought us scary as hell vamps could turn around and take a story that is polar opposite and improve upon the previous two entries. Charlie is back with a lot more to say and that is welcome return to the first film.<br/><br/>The story is much more gripping this go around, it is not focused on just Bella mourning her relationship with Edward. We get more information about the Cullen family. We get much more time between Bella and Charlie, we also get more with Jacob's family/tribe. It is a more full story than we have had in any of the entries thus far. We still only get a brief glimpse of the Volturi, wish we had more. The most enjoyable is the continual questioning if immortality is a gift or curse. We are given arguments on both side, though mostly on the curse side. This is something that has set this story apart from other vampire incarnations. Immortality is seen as all wonderful, but is it really? That is the question here. One element of the story that is actually expanded on is Edward's virtue of waiting until he and Bella are married to ""consumate"" their relationship. There is a scene where this is explained and it is something today's young women should take heed of; if their relationship is true, then it doesn't have to include having sex, but that be kept for the right time and that makes it much more special. Hoaky perhaps in today's world, but a welcome stance for a series to take. A relationship's power/truth is not measured by the physical side, but the actual love and respect between the guy/girl. <br/><br/>The Cullen family is a lot more involved and for me that made this film a lot more enjoyable. Jasper in particular, who we hadn't heard much from gets a lot more to do and say here. I have mentioned this before, but the FULL story we get here is what makes Eclipse a lot more enjoyable and really sets up the final book's two-part movie venture.<br/><br/>Special effects continue to improve. They are still not up there with some of the best FX I have seen, but compared to the first film, they are light years ahead.<br/><br/>There was an element of humor in the script I was surprised by and again, a welcome. These moments came during times of banter between characters that came as very natural. It made them more real to me. In all of our relationships we get to a sense of full ease and can say most anything and that is where these characters are.<br/><br/>All in all, Eclipse has made me excited about the movie series again and now I am anxious to see it completed with Breaking Dawn."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","7","1 July 2010"," Patience pays off
","The first two episodes of the Twilight series (particularly the second) required a considerable amount of patience from the audience (swooning over Robert Pittinson and Taylor Lautner notwithstanding) as they tantamount to two establishing scenes (ultra-long ones in this case) that usually appear in the beginning of a movie. The patience of the audience finally pays off in this third instalment where, armed with the familiarity with the characters and background, they finally get full enjoyment of the movie as events unfold.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the story has to be the eternal triangle. The tantalized sentiments of the three protagonists are rather well drawn out by the movie makers. After giving each of the two gentleman consecutively centre stage in one of the first two episodes, the movie makers now engineer a good balance between them, pleading the case of each, alternatively. Lautner attempts to repeat Clark Gable's feat of singlehandedly destroy the shirt industry (""It happened one night"", 1934) while Pattinson exhibits a gentlemanly trait reminiscent of Leslie Howard's character Ashley (""Gone with the wind"", 1939). Kristen Stewart, almost minimalistic in her close-up-abundant portrayal of the no-nonsense contemporary young lady, is convincing as their irresistible object of undying devotion.<br/><br/>Almost as important is of course the matter of life and death (two layers, in this particular movie), played out by no less than 4 power groups - three of vampires (one old, one new and the Cullen) and one of werewolves. The build- up is good and the convoluted web of conflicts, alliances and ultra motives rival that of the modern international political intrigue. The finale is a tad anticlimactic but this you would tend to forgive, being aware that something will have to be left for the final episode ""Breaking dawn"".<br/><br/>Another attraction of this movie is the rich pageantry of interesting characters, of which only a few will be mentioned here as examples, as there are so many. We get three intriguing side stories. Jasper (a very cool Jackson Rathbone) tells how he became an expert in fighting these ""Newbies"". Rosaline softens towards Bella's approach and explains her apparent hostility with her tragic past. The werewolves reveal the origin of their conflict with the vampires. Each of these stories has also a bearing to a later scene in the movie. As expected, we see the conclusion of Victoria, this time played by an actor with good credentials, Bryce Dallas Howard who was hailed as future bright star in ""The village"" (2004) (but unfortunately has not yet realized her full potentials to-date). Dakota Fanning's Jane of the Volturi vampire clan that we had only a glimpse of last time (""Full moon"") now makes her presence more strongly felt. Among many others, the one that is worth mentioning is the ever-present Anna Kendrick (playing Jessica) whose face you will not forget if you have seen her in Tom Hank's ""Up in the air"" (2009)."

","To start off, I'm a Twilight fan. So, if you're one of those ""Twilight fans suck!"" people, go ahead and hit the ""dislike, unhelpful"" button, or just stop reading right now. You're most likely going to give my review no chance anyway, just like you didn't give this movie a chance. <br/><br/>Eclipse was a major improvement from the previous two movies in the series. The plot improved, the acting improved, and the scenery was gorgeous and detailed. I especially loved the flashbacks, the scenery and costumes shown were true to the time era and very detailed. Also, yes, the acting may not be the greatest, but based off of other movies these actors/actresses were in, they do have acting abilities. Maybe it was the material they were given to work with, not their acting capabilities that weren't good. I believe that most Twilight fans will enjoy this installment in the Twilight Saga movies. <br/><br/>To all of you saying that this movie is ""a cheesy teen movie"", I have a news flash for you: of course it is. The entire Twilight series was geared to teenagers. It's not that hard people; if you know you don't like the series, don't watch the movie. If you have your mind already set against the movie before you see it, obviously you aren't going to enjoy it. What really irks me is people that already dislike the movie/series but watch it anyway, then come on here and rate it really poorly, thereby discouraging others to see movie even though they may like the series. Please be more responsible with your movie reviews."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","8","5 September 2011"," A Step Up from New Moon
","Eclipse (2010) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Third film is the hugely successful series has Bella (Kristen Stewart) having to choose from the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and her best friend and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). While the three have their issues, a new breed of vampires are stalking Seattle and have their eyes on Bella. ECLIPSE is certainly a major step up from NEW MOON but that's not saying too much. Director David Slade manages to make a good looking picture and a somewhat well-made one but there's still no question that the screenplay is downright bad and pointless. I'm sure there are millions of girls who would disagree with me but as I sat through this film I kept asking myself what the point of everything was. I mean, are we supposed to really care about this love triangle that's going on? Not for a second did any of these three hit me as real characters and instead they seem like throw aways from a soap opera. I didn't believe any of their motivations and I didn't believe anything any of them were saying. I mean, having the 17-year-old Bella making decisions on her future as if she's some sort of an adult just made me laugh. I can't believe we're supposed to be taking any of this stuff serious and even if she wasn't in love with a vampire and werewolf you'd still question a lot of her and these men. Not for a single second did I find either man to be ""good"" for her. It seems both of them share a great number of problems and control issues, which I guess many would say I'm reading too much into them. The dialogue is downright horrendous at times and once again we've got a story for maybe an 80-minute movie but of course it gets extended to over two-hours. I thought the film did manage to get good performances from Stewart and Pattinson. Both were back in fine form after the really bad second film. Lautner once again shows that he probably didn't read any lines at his audition and instead just took off his shirt. Perhaps it's just because I'm a straight male but I was a little confused as to what point the male werewolves had at always being topless. Once again we're treated to some horrible and embarrassing CGI effects, which really made me wonder why the production values weren't bumped up a few notches and especially considering how much money the first two films made. With that said, there's some mild entertainment to be had here but let's hope things improve."
"nikowanamate","10","1","8","9 December 2010"," this was fantastic
","lets start of by saying, if you are one of those people who did not like this film, then don't read further, because i liked it and i thought it was huge improvement from the last.<br/><br/>this film starts of at a high and grabbing point that makes you question that maybe this time they seemed to know what they were doing. i felt that this film was edited well in places, but in others that editing looked timid and frail, and that i think is partly because they wanted to please the fans. though i was pleased with the ravine chase in the movie, the editing was rushed at the start of the chase but It better when Victoria had gone to the other side of the border. i deeply enjoyed the way the score seemed not to add only a dark quality to the film, but the way in which the score gave it a very traditional film making feeling due to the sound of the drums and weirs clicking in the background of the score.<br/><br/>the film was moved through fantastically and i thought, rather much better than the last one, the love dovey moments weren't over done to the moment were you feel uncomfortable like they did in new moon. this film showed that the director cared about showing the story as well as telling it, David added a cinematic edge, which has been cropping back into films since avatar.<br/><br/>overall, the film was good, despite one or two patch performance and the let forgetfulness of the editing, i was generally pleased to see that this film was huge improvement.<br/><br/>p.s if this proves to be true, then we will have a truly amazing two part breaking dawn, that better than eclipse...."
"blackberrybabe","10","1","8","19 September 2010"," The choice is obvious...this is the one
","Being a Twilight fan, I couldn't wait to catch Eclipse, the third installment of the Stephenie Meyer franchise. I sat in the theater, waiting for it to begin, wondering what favorite lines of mine from the book would make it into the movie. I also couldn't wait to see Robert Pattinson's gorgeous face again.<br/><br/>The movie did not disappoint. Just like New Moon, it was pretty close to the book. In this one, Seattle is plagued by unexplained deaths; these are the result of Victoria. She is building an army to take on the Cullens and get to Bella. Meanwhile, Bella is wrapping up things in her human life to prepare for her departure into the world of the undead. She visits Jacob a few times and he tells her he's in love with her. He says he knows she loves him too, but won't admit it. Later, Bella agrees to marry Edward in exchange for him having sex with her after the wedding. After battling Victoria's army and her own inner demons, Bella comes to realize exactly where her heart does lie.<br/><br/>As usual, the three leads are dead-on in their performances. Truthfully, I hated Bella in Eclipse; I couldn't believe she would treat Edward the way she did. Kristen Stewart made Bella likable; even though I still hated Bella, I could understand her point. Except, of course, when she asked Jacob to kiss her. Out of everything that was cut, that made it in. I knew it was important, but it didn't make me any happier. And despite the fact that I'm Team Edward, I do like Taylor Lautner as Jacob. He is probably the stand-out in this movie, getting to fight vampires, kiss the woman he loves, and accept the truth. His final scene is heart-breaking and I almost found myself wanting to console him. Almost.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson takes Edward to new levels. You can see the pain he's feeling when Jacob keeps Bella warm in the tent and makes his jealousy evident in several scenes. Some say Pattinson's performance is horrible, that he shows no emotion. He's playing Edward as Meyer has advised him to; Edward is supposed to be rather reserved and isolated. This is what makes his emotional scenes so powerful. He also is mesmerizing when fighting Victoria. A truly fine performance.<br/><br/>Another stand-out in this film is Jackson Rathbone. His character of Jasper finally gets his chance to shine when we learn how Jasper came to be. And although several of the best lines from the book are omitted, Rathbone's intensity is not. You feel his pain as he explains ""I didn't know of another way"" when he joined Maria and his never-ending love for Alice. Though I was irritated that one of the best lines in the entire saga was not present in the movie (""I felt hope""), I was rewarded with a nice Jasper-Alice kiss. And Ashley Greene herself portrays some great emotion when dealing with the visions of Victoria coming to Forks.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is just as excellent, especially Nikki Reed and Kellan Lutz. Emmett gets a chance to fight and show his humorous side and Rosalie finally explains her dislike of Bella. This helps you understand her more and realize that although she's self-centered, there is still a human there. Bryce Dallas Howard replaces Rachelle LeFevre as Victoria. I really wanted to hate her; I was convinced that only LeFevre could play Victoria. I was wrong. Howard is almost as perfect as her predecessor and shows off some real talent when Edward is goading her. My bias for her dropped during the film and I became glad that she was in it. And there's a new vampire to drool over in Xavier Samuel as Riley. This brings the list of hot men in this movie to one hundred. I can only imagine what Breaking Dawn will have.<br/><br/>Like before, the cinematography is beautiful. There are several shots of the area that they live in and several cool action shots. Costumes are modern and desirable, especially the blouse Bella wears in Edward's home. The soundtrack once again includes music from musicians that I didn't know exist, such as Sia and Beck and Bat for Lashes to the ever-faithful Muse. And, true to form, there is one instrumental on the soundtrack album, one for those who are Team Jacob.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a fan of the Twilight Saga will not want to miss any of the movies, but most especially this one. So far, it is the best in the film franchise."

","I had not followed the Twilight series at all when my 11 year old daughter and I went to the movie Eclipse. I enjoyed it very much even though I had no previous knowledge of what was going on.<br/><br/>Of course when it was over, I HAD to see the previous two movies Twilight, and Twilight New Moon. They were also very good, and I'm now caught up with all that has taken place.<br/><br/>Just the other day I read the book ""Breaking Dawn"", and enjoyed it as well. I look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out.<br/><br/>On here I've read so much about poor acting, but after going back and watching the videos again, I'm not sure what those people are talking about. If they can rate the Twilight movies so low based on the acting, then how about some references to good acting... Because as far as I'm concerned, there's no issue with acting at all.<br/><br/>I buy the video's and will spend the $$ for the movie theaters as well just as my way to support the Twilight series and those who do the acting."
"Christian_Dimartino","6","1","8","18 July 2010"," Finally: An acceptable addition to the atrocious Twilight series.
","Twilight is a phenomenon that I haven't been able to understand. The first film was hilarious. I fell out of my chair while watching it. The sequel, New moon, wasn't as cheesy. But it was actually worse. The first two films were atrocious, but now, by round three, Eclipse, is the first film I can consider acceptable. <br/><br/>Eclipse isn't that bad. It only took two films. This one isn't nearly as annoying, cheesy,badly acted, boring,slow,etc. To tell you the truth, I was actually kind of interested in Eclipse. I'm ashamed to say it.<br/><br/>Victoria(played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is ganging up an army to try and kill Bella Swan(played by Kirsten Stewart), the damsel in distress who is with Edward(played by Robert Pattinson).Bella is in a love triangle with Edward and the always shirtless Jacob the wolf(no i'm not being sexual)(played by Taylor Lautner).<br/><br/>Twilight 3 actually explains something this time. It explains some of the character's background. I still can't quite recommend it but I will accept it because I laughed here and there and it kind of interested me and it's a worth addition to the atrocious series.<br/><br/>It's not nearly as dreadful as the first two. At least this one's not as boring,as repetitive,as slow, as annoying,as badly acted, and well, I don't need to tell you. We all know why they blew goats.<br/><br/>Bella is still the village bicycle. Maybe by round four they will finally get my recommendation. not quite yet though. I am saying rent it. There are better movies out there. Such as Inception, Knight and day, and Toy story 3. It kind of pleased me, cause I kind of liked it. I never thought i'd see the light of day. I never thought I would even come close to recommending a Twilight movie. But I say rent it.<br/><br/>Eclipse:B-"
"theHAMster999","6","1","8","17 July 2010"," OK These are not great films
","Every girl in the world goes crazy about these books and these movies. I read the first two books and they were pretty good. Good enough for me to read the third and fourth when I have time but they are not particularly well written. My sister is crazy about these movies so I went with her to go see Eclipse and New Moon at midnight. It was fun and enjoyable but these films are not good. I unlike most people enjoy watching great films not average ones. These movies do not suck but why spend so much time on them when there are so many other great movies out there. The direction is bad and the acting stiff and awkward. The best parts of the film being cheesy comedic lines from Taylor Lautner which are almost making fun of the saga itself. Making fun of the situations they are in. They are not boring although they are at time laughable. This movie is the better of the three. These are not Harry Potter films. The Harry Potter movies are actually good or sometimes great. These are pretty good date movies to go see if there are no other films out. Do not waste your money going to see it in theaters but rather wait till it comes out on DVD and one of your TwiHard friends has a movie night that everyone goes to. Do not waste your money on it but I do encourage you to purchase or download the soundtracks to all three movies. They are the best part of the films. If you like soft alternative rock music like Linkin Park, Paramore, and Muse you should get these soundtracks. Each soundtrack is better then its film.

"sonia-malaquias-792-440551","7","1","8","15 July 2010"," Better, but still not there....
","Eclipse is no doubt much better than New Moon with some real acting from the 3 leading actors this time. Not that they are bad, but they were suffocated in the previous movie by a very stiff directing job. And some of the chemistry between Bella and Edward,which conquered everyone in Twilight, is back. I confess that after watching the horrible New Moon and hearing that a horror film director was chosen for the part in Eclipse, I dreaded the outcome. Surprisingly, he did got it right! The formula of not deviating from the books is all the fans expect. The book is always narrated in first person, and so it is good to hear Bella's thoughts every now and then. That was well covered in Twilight. The books captivated the public with a love story between teenagers and so it has to be light, and full of jokes mainly from Jacob as he is really the youngest of the three. Also, I believe that what appeals to the fans , and not only the young ones, is the way sex is treated in the story. In a time where you see teenage singers overdoing everything to appear sexy (some are borderline vulgar), is refreshing to see sex linked with all the stirrings that first love causes in a old fashioned way, maybe, but nevertheless alluring. Bille Burke is as always by far, the best actor in the movie. The actors who play the Cullen family are all terrific since the first movie of the saga, but now that the storyline gave more significance to their character, they really had a chance to shine. There is one negative point to Eclipse though: the soundtrack. The songs helped Twilight to be a success ( who can hear Supermassive black hole by Muse without remembering the vampire baseball game?)and prevented New Moon from being a total disaster. But the soundtrack in Eclipse is a bit disappointing. The song chosen for the scene in which Bella try to seduce Edward is a bit cheesy. And honestly, none of the others impressed me either. If the last book is divided in two movies, let us hope for a much better soundtrack in the first part, because there is no action in it."
"sneha-ragavan","7","1","8","15 July 2010"," Relief at last...
","Skeptical as I was, having quite laughed my way through the first two movies (what with the standards for bad editing, terrible acting, and cheesy dialogues that both movies in their different ways set), Eclipse was a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>Firstly, there's not too much slow-motion drama here of Edward and Bella staring into each others eyes for what really seemed like forever in the first two movies... thankfully we were spared of the 'oh so intense' glares and stares of Edward, the puppy-dog eyes 'want me.. want me!' of Jacob, and the oh very sloppy 'kiss me' expression of Bella! <br/><br/>The movie cuts the crap, and moves through the story in what is perhaps the neatest adaptation possible of the book.. most of the characters in the book get their share of screen-space and time, which was much lacking in the previous two movies.. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes are actually very funny.. (Charlie and Bella, the tent conversation, Jessica's speech) and there are some very well shot not-so-funny scenes as well (the training scene with Jasper is a personal favorite, Riley and Bree, the marriage proposal scene, the meeting with the Volturi)..<br/><br/>and the fight... it was really very well done.. slick, and if you forget for a while about whether the wolves could've looked better or not, you'll see the running, jumping and fighting looked really convincing, and the editing is first-rate! i mean, just compare it to Edward's jumping around and tree-climbing in twilight, and you'll see what i mean.. <br/><br/>all in all, this is the first really decent movie of the Twilight saga made.. sure the acting could've really been much better, but as I said, at least they wiped the silly expressions off their faces in this one, and got down to the narrative.."

"Freakstone","5","1","8","4 July 2010"," Not as poor as expected
","I read these books after watching, and somewhat enjoying, Twilight. I found the books to be poor on the whole and would probably rate them as follows: Twilight - Reasonable. New Moon - Awful. Eclipse - Mediocre. Breaking Dawn - Laughable. I think I kept reading them for the same reason we slow down to look at an accident on the opposite carriageway.<br/><br/>That said, I'm watching the rest of the films, and probably for the same reason. So far, they're following the pattern of the books. I'd've given Twilight a 7 and New Moon a 1 (2 at the very most) though I have to say that the change of director between Twilight and New Moon was most likely the primary cause of such a despicable result.<br/><br/>Fortunately, they appear to have changed director again, and it shows in Eclipse. Despite the reviews here, I saw it today and, while I wouldn't say I was overly impressed I was, at least, pleasantly surprised to see that things had improved dramatically since New Moon, both in cinematography, screenplay and on the acting front too.<br/><br/>The three stars, Stewart, Pattinson and, er, the kid who never wears a shirt, were still pretty wooden in this, but the overall effect of the film was neither as disjointed nor as cringe-worthy as that of its predecessor. It's still cheesy, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't laughing myself out of the cinema at the end or feeling embarrassed to even be associated with such trash.<br/><br/>If you liked Twilight, I think you'll like this. If you liked New Moon, you're bound to like this but then you're probably not even bothering to read reviews and are most likely about fourteen and female."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","9","21 July 2013"," Sue me, but...
","I actually found myself enjoying TWILIGHT: ECLIPSE at times, and that's the first time that's happened with a TWILIGHT movie; the first two movies left me cold throughout. This one has flashes of inspiration and there's been an improvement in the direction at the very least, which is all for the better. There's actual drive to the plot, too, with the massing of evil vampires instead of just the same old love-triangle stuff of the last two flicks.<br/><br/>There are also signs that the acting is improving, particularly in the case of Robert Pattinson who's more relaxed and less wooden than he was before. I even warmed to Kristen Stewart a little (but only a little). The action sequences, making use of copious CGI effects work, are well handled and 30 DAYS OF NIGHT's David Slade blows the efforts of previous directors out of the water.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect, and it's still a chore to watch in places; Taylor Lautner is ever the weak spot in the cast, and there's a lot of faffing around and sitting around talking when there should be action. But still, it's better than before, and I hope that improvement carries over to the last two in the series."
"Samiam3","7","1","9","23 April 2011"," Better
","Following a rather clumsy second entry, Eclispe is just the kind of third entry that the Twilight series needs. Though not great, it's Superior to Twilight and New Moon. The editing is tighter, the plot is more fluid, the cast is starting to open up, and there is more action. Even the writing, which is the worst thing about the whole series, is improved here. In addition to throwing in a few jokes, we are treated to some back story to characters which up till now have been little more than sparkling faces.<br/><br/>The one thing about Eclipse that I didn't like was that the rivalry between Jacob and Edward is snarly and obnoxious. Bella frequently has to play referee and step between the two. In New Moon we were meant to think that Jacob is the nice boy. Now I'm not too sure I like him that much. He is presented as being a bit more selfish and immature than I think he should be.<br/><br/>Eclispe deserves credit where credit is due, things are coming to life in a way that makes the series enjoyable to anyone outside the twilight fan base, (or at least to anyone who likes Gothic). The problem is whether, it warrents the recommendation of two predecessors, one not bad, and the other mediocre."
"phyreworx","8","1","9","11 October 2010"," A Not-So-Late Review
","Eclipse continues off with Victoria's (Bryce Dallas Howard) plan to avenge her dead vampire lover James (Cam Gigandet) by slowly creating an army of vampires, including one Forks native whom she later deceives just to have her plan put into works. After Bella's (Kristen Stewart) and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) near-death experiences in the previous instalment, the two leading characters mended and promised never to leave each other again. Edward was especially protective of Bella ever since news of newborn vampires surfaced and Victoria hot on their tail. Eventually, the Cullen clan and the werewolves had to forget their differences for a while in order to work together to fight off the ever-raising number of Victoria's army and protect Bella. The movie concludes with Bella's protectors killing Victoria and Victoria's army, but not without the Volturi almost interfering the fight.<br/><br/>Eclipse, in my opinion, has a much darker theme compared to the first two movies. David Slade, who specializes in sci-fi/thriller movies, is best-fitted for this instalment. He is able to show well in the big screen the highlights of this romantic-sci-fi novel. The cinematography is very much appropriate for the storyline. Visual and sound effects are close to reality, though they aren't as superb as those in Avatar or in any high-budgeted sci-fi movies. The setting brings about the natural side of the characters. One thing I find a bit disappointing is Stewart's portrayal of Bella. She lacks emotions in expressing Bella's thoughts, which makes her monotonous. Well, I still have the same comments about Stewart's acting ever since the release of the first movie saga. Among all the cast members, I find Taylor Lautner's character, Jacob, the most moving maybe because he is able to really give life to the character with his facial expressions and body language.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga's storyline is really not that unusual, for it has been patterned with ancient legends about vampires and werewolves. One movie I could think of that has, somehow, the same plotâ€”that is vampires and werewolves fightingâ€”is Van Helsing (2004)."

People genuinely avoid me because they don't want to hang with a ""Pattinson chick"" <br/><br/>I think the film should be given a break, it's not a bad film, it's not a bad cast, it's not a bad director! It came out at probably the wrong time, where now you have the Harry Potter films, which in my opinion are yes better than the twilights, for they go out to a larger surface area of people, female and male. <br/><br/>But! The films are great, and the soundtrack is too! I feel very sad for Rob and Kristen, who now may get chosen for films, but will not find anyone liking them anymore, since everyone who hates Twilight hates them, no matter what they go on to do... <br/><br/>The film is amazing, if you're into Twilight, go see it, if your not even, it doesn't matter, give it a break and just look at it as another film not as a ""chick flick twilight"" film."

","Just got back from the cinema after seeing Eclipse. I must be in the minority of 32 year old males who actually liked this movie. I was a late comer to the whole Twilight saga. I only got into it when my girlfriend started reading the saga. I've liked the two previous movies too. As I said in the review of New Moon I'm really interested in the whole werewolf thing and there's plenty more werewolf action in this movie. My girlfriend told me that her favourite character in this book was Seth and he is pretty cool. For me, the best bits of the movie are the action sequences involving the werewolves. God I'd love to be a werewolf and this ticks my escapism box nicely. Oh and contrary to what I've read in some other reviews I think there was chemistry between the three main characters. One other character who comes across very well (in my opinion) was Jasper. Roll on Breaking Dawn part 1!"

"thekyles99","1","1","9","10 July 2010"," Haterz who see it anyways???? Its for the fan's guys!
","The wife and i just watched this and boy let me tell you, never mind what the critics are saying, these movies keep getting better and better. Another favourite for 2010 and believe me it's a small list. This and Toy Story 3....that's it! If you haven't read any of the books of Stephenie Meier(although i suggest you do so) you don't need too because the storyline follows very closely to the book. Something book adaptations as of late have failed miserably in doing. Great Cgi only left me drooling for 2011-12's Breaking Dawn the last in the series. Critics have also said that the casting is terrible another thing i highly disagree on considering once again if you are a fan of this series in print as I am you will know that all were cast perfectly right down to Kristen Stewart as Bella as she is as awkward in real life as Bella is in the Twilight story lines. Funny listening to the teenybopper set of girls that were set directly behind me gasp every time Taylor Lautner graced the screen (shirtless of course) Which even had fellow cast mate Edward asking ""Does he own a shirt?"" Taylor if you are unfamiliar with these films plays Teen wolf Jacob Black in this. This chapter opens up with various people in Seattle going missing which in turn raises flags amongst the Cullens as being far too familiar and want to do something about it before the Volturi step in. Red head (as Jacob labels her)Victoria (this time played with perfection by Bryce Dallas Howard) is still stalking Bella, in retaliation for Edward killing her mate in the first one James. The future seeing vamp Alice keeps getting visions of the new vamps titled the newborns and Victoria making their way to Forks for a major fight, which in turn has the Cullen's seeking help from Jacob's werewolf brothers. Can Jacob and Edward, who are having their own game of tug o war going on with Bella, bond together with their clans and fight together and protect Bella?

"heyheyu-783-809793","7","1","9","5 July 2010"," Expectations.
","For the true die-hard fans, the film did it's best to live up to the novel. In fact, it did a pretty good job. If you've seen the previous two movies in the saga you cannot deny the fact that the acting has improved a great deal. And if you had set your expectations very high before watching the movie, then you shouldn't have. What did you expect it to be like? After all, this is a teenage movie about vampires. There is credit to be given for the action sequences, the script ( in most parts ) and the intensity of each love triangle scene. Well done to Pattinson and Lautner. Eclipse is everything I had imagined it to be while reading the book. ( With the exception of 'ice' that had replaced my vision of a bloody battle in the action sequence ) otherwise, it stayed pretty true to the story and is a solid build up for the next two installments. Surely, a movie raking in more than 100million internationally in its first opening week deserves something a little more than a 4.5 out of 10."
"Sora799","8","1","11","7 July 2010"," Fantastic movie. Twilight finally nails it.
","It took three films, but ""The Twilight Saga"" finally nails just the right tone in ""Eclipse,"" a film that neatly balances the teenage operatic passions from Stephenie Meyer's novels with the movies' supernatural trappings. <br/><br/>The movie can be watched for free at http://www.online-TV-episodes.com/ and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Where the first film leaned heavily on camp and the second faltered through caution and slickness, ""Eclipse"" moves confidently into the heart of the matter -- a love triangle that causes a young woman to realize choices lead to consequences that cannot be reversed.<br/><br/>With the momentum of a movie series that sees installments arriving like clockwork every year, ""Eclipse"" looks primed to be the most successful film yet in Summit Entertainment's franchise. The action is pretty much relegated to the climax, but it's nifty enough that young men may get into the series too even if ""Eclipse"" isn't their first choice on a Friday night. (Read about the fan frenzy surrounding the premiere here and here, and check out photos of the Thursday night event at L.A. Live here.)<br/><br/>The film starts a little slowly with its classic reintroduction of its main characters, heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), more determined than ever to go vampire for her undead boyfriend; the gloomy dreamboat Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), an ancient being who still hasn't graduated high school; and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a perennially bare-chested Native American who shape-shifts into a wolf at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>Even here the film doesn't mind kidding itself. Edward takes one look at Jacob and complains to Bella, ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" The script by Melissa Rosenberg offers a few more opportunities like this that wink at its own silliness.<br/><br/>Things pick up rapidly once intros are done, with the ramifications of the girl/vampire/werewolf triangle becoming increasingly intense for all parties while an outside threat looms over them all. <br/><br/>A crime wave has hit Seattle, a few leagues from the bucolic Washington town that shelters so many supernatural creatures apparently without any townspeople catching on. A series of vicious killings and disappearances tip off the Cullen clan that a vampire is creating an army of newborns - - newly turned vampires whose ravenous thirst makes them stronger and more deadly than ""old"" vampires. <br/><br/>This army recruiter is red-headed Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, the epitome of sensual, feline cunning), who, in seeking revenge against the Cullens and Edward in particular, means to destroy Bella. Which causes Edward and Jacob to contemplate the unthinkable, a temporary alliance to protect the girl they both love. <br/><br/>It's like the uneasy partnership between lawman Wyatt Earp and outlaw Doc Holliday against the Clanton clan at the O.K. Corral in ""My Darling Clementine."" Well, why not a Western? ""The Twilight Saga"" already mixes together high school melodrama, outsider fiction and teen romance into a mishmash of sci-fi and horror genres. (Check out video of the ""Eclipse"" stars talking to THR on the red carpet of the film's premiere here.) <br/><br/>Since Rosenberg's writing has never been the problem in the series, much of the credit for the success of ""Eclipse"" probably belongs to the series' third director, David Slade (""Hard Candy,"" ""30 Days of Night""). He quickly establishes a rapid yet unhurried pace, a willingness to let tongue perch in cheek and an unapologetic indulgence in this basic fantasy of every teenage girl -- that two high school hunks are in love with her and willing to die for her, except, of course, that one is already undead.<br/><br/>The three leads shine under his direction. Stewart anchors everything with a finely tuned if not slightly underplayed performance that catches her character in moments of doubt about the course and the man she has chosen. Pattinson makes you forget the white makeup and weird eye contact lenses to concentrate on a person torn over his love for a woman and the sacrifice he knows she will have to make to stay with him. <br/><br/>But it's Lautner who nearly steals the movie with his ripped muscle and steely acting. He definitely has the ""it"" factor Hollywood always looks for. (The ""Twilight"" cast invaded ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" last week; check out photos here.)<br/><br/>The high school scenes and those between Bella and her police chief dad (Billy Burke) are quick and light and doubly effective for not dawdling. The series' more peripheral characters are coming into better focus as well. The film delivers back stories for both Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) and Rosalie (Nikki Reed) of the Cullen family as well as the origins of Jacob's family, the wolf pack, without any of these flashbacks seeming like intrusions.<br/><br/>Speaking of the wolf pack, the CG wolves, huge creatures whose ferocity fails to mask their tenderness, are very cool, and the fight at the climax among wolves, vampires and one poor human is no letdown. It delivers the goods without overstaying its welcome, which is more than can be said about most CG movie fights.<br/><br/>Production values are aces with DP Javier Aguirresarobe and production designer Paul Denham Austerberry very much taking advantage of the dark, woodsy and utterly beguiling beauty of British Columbia."
"starjen222","6","1","11","1 July 2010"," Entertaining, but....
","There's something missing in ""Eclipse."" It has the action element for males and the romance element for females, but those two facts don't cover up the movie's flaws. Kristen Stewart is the main negative facet of this movie. Kristen has always been a little dry, but ""Eclipse"" required more emotion from the young actress than she could deliver; people say that she's ""naturalistic"" when it comes to her acting prowess, but to me she is simply dull and stoic. For example, after Jacob is horribly injured while fighting a newborn she does not look sad or disturbed in any way (not to mention her voice barely fluctuates from monotone at all). Robert Pattinson gave a better performance than Kristen, yet was constantly strained and humorless throughout, which is nothing new.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner was the best of the three. Although he may be a bit over-dramatic at times he conveys his character well for someone of his limited experience. The stand-out performance came from Nikki Reed as Rosalie; for someone with few lines, she was believable and not overly theatrical. <br/><br/>For fans of the book, you will be happy to find that the plot line is close to the novel's. The flashbacks of Jasper's newborn days in the South and Rosalie's transformation were interesting and well-acted. However, some key scenes you desire may be left out/changed: Quil's imprint, Bella's thoughts about being in love with Jacob, and Bella's reaction over her decision to pick Edward instead of Jacob are a few of the characteristics that are absent. Also, when Bella kisses Jacob, it seems as if she is kissing him simply to prevent him from hurting himself, not because she's secretly in love with him. Their romance was in my opinion conveyed inadequately.<br/><br/>I think that many people will believe that the conclusion of Eclipse did not satisfy all of the hanging questions of New Moon; although many events occurred such as the newborn vampire back story, Victoria's hunt, Edward's marriage proposal, the pseudo- love triangle, etc., the audience is left in almost the same position as they were at the end of ""New Moon"": there are villains after Bella (Volturi), Bella loves Edward more than Jacob, Bella is still human, and Edward's proposal is hanging over them. Although I enjoyed it as I watched it and didn't mind Taylor Lautner's physique, ""Eclipse"" leaves something to be desired."

"hahnpaul-63454","4","0","1","18 February 2019"," Eclipse continues the Twilight Saga and nothing really changes.
","Eclipse continues the story Twilight and New Moon began. It follows on Bella Swan reuniting with her boyfriend-vampire Edward Cullen and with the rising threat of vampire Viktoria trying to get revenge on her and Edward because they killed her boyfriend in the first film of the series. It also follows the struggle between her and Edward because she wants to be a vampire but he doesn't want this life for her. The third big conflict is the one between Edward and Jacob, now at the same place fighting for Bella's heart.<br/><br/>I hate to repeat myself and it does get a bit better, but still: the movie is so slow. But besides that I liked the conflict with Viktoria, but what I didn't like was Edward always trying to either get her to marry him or trying to talk her out of the idea of becoming a vampire. Like that was the only thing the two talked about in the movie. What I also didn't like was the conflict between Edward and Jacob. The main reason was that I didn't believe Edward that he loves Bella as much as I believed Jacob. And they became 'friends' too soon.<br/><br/>From a logical standpoint I didn't really understand why the Volturi wanted to kill the Cullens so badly. I thought they wanted to use the power of their children and Bella. Or have they changed their plan? Maybe they should have taken a little more time explaining that instead of three minutes of stuttering and awkward pauses from Bella's and Edward's side. But besides that the characters were fine: The Cullens are great as always. I didn't really like Viktoria. She is just this stupid villain with nothing on her mind but revenge. It's like she doesn't even have her own thoughts and feelings anymore, she's just moved by hate.<br/><br/>It's not a step down, but at the same time not really a step up from New Moon. I just hope it gets better after this one."

"nogodnomasters","5","0","1","4 December 2018"," I AM HOTTER THAN EDWARD, BUT I STILL CAN'T ACT
","Mousy Kristen Stewart, who dates outside of her species, causes a vampires vs. newbie vampires vs. werewolves war, perhaps the best scene in the movie, which lasted about two minutes. The movie is filled with numerous flashbacks, primarily to the 19th century. Unlike the Harry Potter series where the acting improves from one movie to the next, this one does not. No wait. It is not bad acting. We discover that newbie vampires are uncontrollable and emotional. Vampires that are uncontrollable must be destroyed, so only unemotional vampires, who simply appear to be bad actors survive. They in turn like the aroma of infrequent bathers and wig wearers who are also bad actors, i.e unemotional. So that explains it. They are supposed to be unemotional. Why the werewolves, who look like an underage male revue sucked, I don't know.<br/><br/>The most painful scenes are the one on one dialogue scenes. Here their ""unemotional"" ability comes out. Unfortunately this consists of too much of the movie as I kept yelling at the screen, ""Get on with it!"" Besides Edward's glitter, what is also unnatural is Kristen's hairline. I kept waiting for her fake hair to fall off. Young females will certainly rate this as 5 stars as the whole unnatural world is fighting over one of them, one that lacks a great body, personality, or hygiene. (Just a joke about the hygiene as everything unnatural keeps sniffing her scent.)<br/><br/>Kristen wants to be a vampire. Edward doesn't want her to be one. Edward wants to get married. Kristen doesn't. She wants to have sex, but Edward doesn't want to have sex out of marriage. (Guess the compromise coming in the next movie?) Dad doesn't want Kristen to date a vampire, but would rather she go out with a werewolf. The movie saga has become overly hokey.<br/><br/>It is unfair to say all the acting was bad. Alice Cullen was noticeably good, although she normally appears talking to Kristen. In one scene an excited Alice tells Bella, ""You will be spending the night in our house with Edward."" Bella, whose blank face doesn't even twitch, has a long dramatic Shatner-like pause, and finally remembers her line and says, ""Like, alone?"" It was MST-3000 bad. I had to laugh.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning, who can act, played a very minor role where she wasn't allowed to act, just recite a few lines. The movie reminded me of ""Billy Jack"" where fans of the movie couldn't fathom why the Academy overlooked the movie, or when Star Trek fans couldn't understand why Shatner never got an Emmy. They would say, ""Maybe because William Shatner was so good as Captain Kirk, they didn't realize he was acting."" The same could be said of the Twilight series. We really don't realize these people are acting (except Alice)."

"robertmaybeth","10","0","4","3 February 2018"," Don't read the bad reviews until you watch and decide for yourself-there's a lot of good story here.
","The good thing about the ""Twilight"" series is, if you like the first one, you will probably like the sequels. The same pace, story elements, and character development is similarly good in all of them. And this third sequel really makes the story bloom. All the elements of the first two ""Twilight"" movies are here - the vampires, werewolves, and ""Volturi"" (sort of like the Vatican for vampires) are thrown into the mix along with a lot of new characters and story points. If you haven't seen any of the other movies what I'm about to say won't make sense, but it's a good idea to watch at least one of the preceding ""Twilight"" films and preferably both before trying to take in this one.<br/><br/>Bella has decided that she wants to make the ""change"" (become a vampire) to be with Edward til the literal end of time (as vampires are immortal and stay the age they were when they changed). But of course, there are plenty of problems. Bella needs Jakob (her friend from Twilight 2 and a rival to Edward for Bella's affections) to guard her from some other rogue vampires (we find they are called ""newborns"" as they are freshly turned vampires). The newborns are massacring people in Seattle and drawing too much attention to the ""cold ones"" (Vampires). So the Volturi (vampire grand leaders in Italy) are coming to resolve the matter, either by diplomacy or violence. This creates a dilemna for Bella and Edward, as the Volturi spared Edward and Bella's lives only when she promised to make the change... and if they come to Seattle, they may discover that Bella violated her promise and is still human, drawing their deadly wrath. The meeting of the minds (the Cullens) at 1:20 is something I found very entertaining, as the Cullens pool their intellects and visions (another vampire power) to quickly decide on how to deal with the newborns and Volturi... <br/><br/>I found this movie just as entertaining as Twilight 1 and 2. Suffice to say, if you loved either of those movies, you will almost certainly enjoy this one. Let the haters be damned, I really enjoy the Twilight series."
"davispittman","8","0","1","8 April 2017"," My favorite twilight movie
","To be honest, this is the best installment in the twilight saga. It's not only the most entertaining, but it is also the most well made cinematically. The cast is the same of course, except for Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria. I really liked Howard as Victoria, I think that she's actually better than the original actress that played her in the first twilight movie. And I think that the main reason this movie is the best is because it has a great balance of action, romance, and a good storyline to go along with it. The first one was all about introducing the characters and getting everything set up. The second was all about Bella trying to make it without Edward and exploring her relationship with Jacob. And this third movie has made it through the introducing and the obstacles new moon gave us, and now it's all about Bella and Edward strengthening their relationship, fighting the evil forces threatening them, and events that lead up to the two breaking dawn films. The acting is pretty good in my opinion, sure I guess things can get a little cheesy at times, but that's excusable. I enjoyed the action sequences and I liked the writing overall. I give The twilight saga: eclipse an 8/10."

","After enjoying the first two adaptations in the Twilight series I took a look at the 3rd films IMDb page,and I was pleasantly surprised to find some positive reviews,which led to me getting ready to open the third chapter in the Twilight saga.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Leaving a night club in Seattle, Riley Biers gets attacked by Victoria,who turns him into a vampire.Once he has been transformed,Victoria starts to Biers to train ""new born"" vampires for a war against the vampire who killed her lover.<br/><br/>A year later<br/><br/>Whilst Victoria gathers her army,Edward's 18 year old (human) girlfriend Bella Swan grows increasingly uneasy about getting married at such a young age,as Swan continues to ask Edward if he can turn her into a vampire,so that there love can last forever.Caught up in their deep love for each other,Swan & Edward are left horrified when news flashes on the TV screen about strange killings taking place in Seattle. Learning from Swan's dad Charlie that he has been investigating the disappearance of a man called Riley Biers for a year,which leads to Edward fearing that Victoria is about to get her revenge.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Replacing original actress Rachelle Lefevre, Bryce Dallas Howard finally makes the baddies role in the series be fully felt,with Howard's wide eyed fury and short,to the point dialogue unleashing the anger that Victoria has towards Edward.Getting the role after sending an audition tape from Australia, Xavier Samuel gives a wonderful performance as Biers,by Samuel doing very well at keeping Biers good looks mask on,as Biers slowly transforms into a zombie- like,dead to the world beast.<br/><br/>Taking a different route to the first two by not solely focusing on the love story aspect in the adaptation,the screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg smartly uses the baddies to give the title an exciting sense of urgency,by making everything that Edward and Bella do have some connection to the oncoming onslaught from Victoria & Biers.After building a love triangle between Bella,Jacob and Edward in the second film,Rosenberg opens up all the emotions which had been suggested in the past,which goes from Jacob pushing Bella to admit her feelings,to Bella having to hold back her passions to give Edward her virginity.<br/><br/>Kicking the film off away from his lovers,director David Slade & cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe stop the light breeze from the last movies in its tracks,and take the saga in a murkier direction,thanks to dark blue needles of rain scattering across the screen,and the light greens from the blossoming romances of the past being replaced by stylish,washed out whites.Backed by a shimmering score from Howard Shore,Slade cuts a fantasy atmosphere deep within,by lighting up the screen with rough & tumble werewolves V vampires battles.Along with the impressive fantasy fight scene,Slade also gives the vampire factions distinctive appearances,with Victoria's vampires looking rotten to the core,and Edward's gang looking almost heavenly,as the third chapter in the Twilight saga ends."

","This is the third movie in the saga, and two years since Twilight came out. I will say that this has been the most interesting one of the set yet. The actors seem to have matured, as well as the characters. Kristen Stewart was able to project Bella Swan's conflicted, yet firmness in her decisions on the screen. Robert Patterson looks more natural in character, possibly from having other acting experiences in between the Twilight movies. His Edward Cullen's character has brought his ""old school"" mentality to the surface, showing some conflict between him and Bella. He was born in 1901. Taylor Lautner gave a great performance of his frustration and his love.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, there were more background information on other members of the clan, as well as more on the vampires of the Twilight universe. Also, we were given the glimpse of the inner workings of the Volturi and their role in the world.<br/><br/>Altogether, the plot has thickened and the world has become more complicated for the oncoming of Breaking Dawn. For those who have seen the previous first two movies, I think this one will be a treat for them. This movie is not just about a love triangle, but also of human communication, decision making, dedication, loyalty, and commitment. There are different parties and play and each have their own agenda. The love triangle is really just the backdrop. <br/><br/>My only disappointment is the extremely small role of Anna Kendrick. I believe her part and most of the high school scenes should have been cut to save us the agony of watching a great actress' talent being wasted and saving the viewers' time. She was great in Up in the Air, I hope she will get more prominent roles in the near future."

","let me at first make some categories and ranked them so that my approach to this movie will be crystal clear: ACTING: good, not perfect. the main 3 actors (Pattinson, Stewart, and Lautner) are still immature and young, so there should not be high expectations. although, Lautner's voice is as nice as it should be. in the book, it is described as ""husky"" and it is. I wonder if it's one of the reasons why he has been chosen for the role! Charlie is totally believable and much like the book. thank you Billy Burke! MUSIC: perfect, it was chosen very carefully and correctly. i like the music in the mock battle, the music in the Cullen's house when Bella ans Edward are alone in his room, and the music in the Edward and Victoria's fight. they are really awesome. SCREENPLAY: good enough. i know it's too hard to write a screenplay based on novel. because when you want to visualize a text, you have to omit thing which can't come to pictures such as thoughts and feelings that have a very important role in books. at last i think this movie is better than previous one (new moon) and as lovely as the first one (twilight). although i still strongly believe the books are sth else!"
"cutigurlvr","8","0","6","26 February 2011"," Pretty Dramatic
","It's not like I'm obsessed with The Twilight Saga or something,but I really liked this movie.The plot and the soundtrack were simply amazing.Everything in that movie was so perfect:the cast,the set,etc.But the acting has truly disappointed me.Only 2-3 actors were really good,the rest were simply melodramatic.Bella(Kristen Stewart) talks like she has stones in her mouth and Edward(Robert Pattinson) is always in agony.Alice (Ashley Greene) is being too much of a nice polite young lady and Japer(Jackson Rathbone) is too quiet and also in agony.But I liked Victoria(Bryce Dallas Howard).The new Victoria is so much better than the first Victoria(Rachelle Lefevre).I also liked Anna Kendrick's performance.She was really cool.Of course she was good,she was nominated for Oscar(for another role).<br/><br/>I liked the collaboration between the werewolves and vampires.Hot and Cold.I also liked how vampires broke like glass.And how they ran.<br/><br/>So,per total,it was quite a good movie.I recommend it."
"g-bodyl","8","0","6","20 February 2011"," Better Than New Moon!
","Eclipse is definitely better than New Moon. There is more action and the love story becomes more intense. Also, this movie stayed true to the novel. It also sets up the stage for a really great finale to the series.<br/><br/>This is pretty much a battle between Jacob and Edward to see who gets Bella. Also things look bad when the Cullens discover that there is a vampire army being bred.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad at all. Stewart and Pattinson aren't that impressive but they aren't horrible. Billy Burke and Dakota Fanning shine in their roles.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty good especially when it came to the wolves. The music by Howard Shore is also pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good installment to the Twilight franchise. I do hope the last two are much better. I rate this film 8/10."
"sjmutchie","6","0","6","2 October 2010"," A Large Step Up from New Moon, but a Mis-Step Nonetheless
","Not looking forward to seeing the next 'slip up' in the Twilight 'Saga', I went into the movie theater again with little to no expectations. And I must admit, I was slightly surprised...<br/><br/>Not much can be made from a lousy script, but a lot of character development was made. Kristen Stewart got a little better at portraying ""Bella"". But half of the credit has to be given to the script writer, who actually decided to give Bella a personality this time around. The writer goes more into Bella's 'fun-loving' past, such as vacations with her mom, and the jokes between them. Kristen also did a much better job of keeping her gaping mouth shut. She actually uttered a full chuckle instead of her little scoffing noise that she usually makes when trying to laugh. Nice step up, but still way below the normal standard of 'good acting'.<br/><br/>Edward stayed the same; not a lot of development. However, the chemistry between Edward and Bella seemed stronger, especially coming from Edward. Instead of looking at Bella like a delicious entrée, (I KNOW he's a vampire; ignore my pun) he looks at her like a true lover would. He also has some good comedic timing in his few jokes with Jacob.<br/><br/>Jacob...now there's a nice improvement. Still being all about fun, yet mature and serious, Lautner gives a very believable performance. 90 percent of acting is reacting, and Lautner did very well with reacting to the situations around him; taking advantage of every moment he could to dangle Bella in front of Edward's face.<br/><br/>The heart-to-heart that Jacob and Edward has was interesting, and went over better than I thought it would. But again, the scriptwriting was lazy. I predicted roughly 60 percent of their conversation almost word-for-word.<br/><br/>Rosalie's past was a WONDERFUL insight to her present actions. Reed does a very good job of keeping her 'snobby girl' facade even after she lets Bella in on her feelings and past. Her story makes you feel bad for her, which is something that the audience desperately needs to feel for Rosalie. There's a reason she acts the way she does.<br/><br/>Jasper's past was a great flashback as well; I was half hoping that more of the movie would revolve around his and Rosalie's past. They were much more interesting than the love triangle that was happening at the time. (And as a third-party observer; Jackson Rathbone looks SO FINE in that Civil War uniform!) The wardrobe department needs to fire a few people. Putting the ENTIRE Cullen family in DENIM-colored TRACK-SUITS? Honestly? *sigh* The Finale was nice and action packed. Just enough of the werewolf/newborn battle and just the right amount of Edward/Victoria showdown mashed together. There's been a bit of controversy about re-casting Victoria, and personally, I saw no difference. Other than the voice change, Howard did a great job of keeping Victoria's revenge-filled personality alive. Even Riley, who played a major part, was absolutely horrifying and devious.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed with Jane. From New Moon, we know that she's absolutely threatening, sadistic, and insane. But Dakota didn't relay it that well to the audience. Her lines are emotionless instead of horrifyingly quiet. There is a way to be quiet and terrifying, and Dakota couldn't hack it. The rest of the Volturi guard was fine.<br/><br/>It was a lot to shove into a single Twilight movie, but it was done tastefully. All it needs is a better actress for Bella, better scriptwriting, and more scenes with the Volturi. I absolutely cannot WAIT for Breaking Dawn pt. 2, so that Michael Sheen can re-enter the scene and show these teenagers how it's DONE!"
"animax_fan","10","0","6","9 September 2010"," Not for anyone who doesn't already know the script by heart
","It's obvious I'm biased, but then again who isn't? I'm a die-hard fan and I've known plenty of fellow twi-hards and certainly a great number of twi-haters, am related to some of them too. Frankly, I know this movie doesn't deserve anywhere near a seven, but I'm a fan, so in my eyes, anything with 'The Twilight Saga' attached to it would be worth a perfect score. So it's all about preferences.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, if you've hated the previous movies, if you're disgusted with the whole franchise, if you've got a thing against tame, fang-less and sparkly vampires, don't watch it. You should probably be hailing 'Vampires Suck'. This movie is NOT for anyone whose idea of a good movie is a bad ass hero, a spunky heroine, and lots of blood, action and gore.<br/><br/>Let's face it twi-hards, Edward isn't going to come up to scratch if you're looking for a bad boy; and I love Bella, I do, but she's not gonna be shooting any mean vamp through the heart or taking anyone's head off. In fact, she's an almost perfect damsel in distress, the only thing that saved her from being coined that, is the suicidal move of slashing her wrist (therefore saving Edward's life).<br/><br/>But if you're one of us, if you're a dedicated fan who is more than willing to overlook any possible flaw, go right ahead. If all you're looking for is a good time screaming for Edward, or Jacob, or Bella, and enjoying the camaraderie between Twi-hards, Eclipse will probably be the best movie you've ever watched, because in my opinion, it's definitely better than Twilight or New Moon.<br/><br/>Stewert and Pattinson still have the same problem of talking too slowly and pausing too much and too long, it would have put anyone but a loyal twi-hard who's mouthing the words along with them to sleep. Honestly, I don't see much chemistry between the leads, although I must say Rathbone and Greene were sweet during the practice-fight scene.<br/><br/>Anyone who is not a fan, will find this movie a bore, a waste of time and money, and quite possible a cure for insomnia. Although, as a fan, I feel that it's my duty to say that a certain redeeming part of the film was that the opening with Xavier Samuel was adequate and the ambiance was definitely less dull and sleep-inducing as compared to that of Twilight and New Moon."
"sweetmystique32","8","0","7","8 September 2010"," The best of the 3 and I'll tell you why * Spoiler alert!*
","This was my favorite book of the series and thankfully they really made an effort with the movie, too. You should know, I am Team Jacob but I was able to hold my prejudices at bay for the sake of the movie. It's not perfect by any means, there's of course a few things I would've changed but nothing too major or dramatic, just a minor change or two to add for the fans.<br/><br/>Too, something that book fans need to realize and consider is this is a different medium. Things have to be sacrificed when making a book into a movie so inevitably some scenes end up looking sorta choppy or pushed together in an unlikely way but that's the price you pay when you condense things. <br/><br/>So with that said, let's review. <br/><br/>The acting—so many ppl don't like her as Bella but I think Kristen is perfect as Bella. She acts just the way Bella does in the book so when ppl say they don't like her, I think it's really Bella they don't like, and I agree, Bella is a ridiculous character but it's not fair to condemn Kristen for that. Rob wasn't and isn't my first pick for Edward but he does stiff and boring really well which is what Edward is so for that reason he's a good pick. He actually is kinda cute, another reason he's a good Edward. One thing to note too is that it's too easy to forget that Edward is a snarling vicious vampire, you don't see much evidence of this in the first 2 books/movies but here you do, particularly the fight in the forest. He let's go and allows himself to be what he truly is even if it means scaring Bella. Good for him! Taylor is an awesome Jacob, I honestly can't see anyone else in this part. Due to his size and what-not I think people forget how young he really is both him and his character. He's got his work cut out for him in BD though, I hope he can reach into his character more.<br/><br/>The story—Melissa R. actually did a good job of condensing the book into a script. I definitely enjoyed it more this time as opposed to the other two. All relevant points were in there and she even made it funny at times. Objectively speaking I've found that ppl who have a problem with the movie are actually criticizing the book and the writing, so to speak of the movie by itself I really feel it was well-written. The tent scene coulda been funnier and the Jacob/Bella farewell scene coulda been heavier (it was really sad in the book and should've made me cry in the theater too but it didn't). I really wish she had pumped those up more.<br/><br/>The directing— Mr. David Slade you saved this movie, ur my hero! Thank you for bringing your genius to this, you really gave it the edge this series needed. You made it okay for guys to watch what is largely a chick flick. <br/><br/>Ambiance— The music this time around was awesome. It really seemed to fit in with the theme of not only the moment but the movie itself and it's place in the series at the same time. The scenery/setting was right out of my imagination, even more so. The campfire tribal meeting scene was so beautifully shot and added so much, even better than the book.<br/><br/>I thought they ended the movie well, with B & E in their meadow. And unlike the book where I'm never truly convinced of Bella's motives and convictions on marriage/being turned into a vampire, in the movie I left with knowing her a little better. Melissa R convinced me (Remember I'm Team Jacob now) that Bella is ready for the next step and things are as they should be, in the movie at least. So with that said, they of course leave it open for the next movies, Breaking Dawn 1 & 2, I however refuse to see them, well the first one anyway. I thought the book sucked beyond all things that suck hard. JMHO. <br/><br/>If you can be objective and have an open mind I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Why anyone goes to see this movie if they don't like the series is beyond me and makes no sense, but a-holes are determined to hate it no matter what. How weird is that?"
"Jona1988","5","0","8","7 September 2010"," Well it is the best in the series yet.
","I liked the third book best(haven't read the forth yet though). Definitely not my kind of books but they are still an alright read. It's somewhat fun to see visually the story ones just read. But I thought the first film was really poor, i most ways. With the second it got better(even if I felt the second book was the weakest) but still a weak effort compared to many other adaptations. Thankfully with the third movie the improvement in quality continues. Positive, sure quite a lot could still be better but I myself was mostly satisfied.<br/><br/>The story stays with the book pretty well which was good but so has the other two mostly. However what was done better this time around was the plot, in that it didn't feel like it rushed forward and painfully lack in details which I often think movie adaptations tend to do. Even if you've not read the book you will have little problem following what is going on. Sure it's vampires and werewolves but really Twilight is the usual teenage love story. Absolutely not unique. Aimed for teenage girls but I think even others can enjoy it once as a ""feelgood"" film. But I admit the romance gets a bit long-drawn and doesn't make perfect sense at times, but of course that is the central thing of the story.<br/><br/>The action was very bad in the first film. Yes the action may be a side thing to the love triangle but still a flaw. The third book has the most action so I felt it vital that those scenes should improve. Thankfully the action has gotten better, it's not great but it worked well enough. Some of the wolf cgi looked somewhat flawed a places though. An improvement enough at least.<br/><br/>The acting is no big problem according to me. A bit wooden some but you get a feeling for the characters. I have no big complaint over the actors they chose, even though not everyone looks like you've yourself imagined from the books but thats often the case. Kristen Stewart is way prettier than you imagine Bella in the books. Definitely not a problem.<br/><br/>I'm no fan of the book so had no real expectations. But it was an mostly entertaining movie experience. Quite a bunch of flaws but an improvement over the previous two. The action, storytelling, maybe even the acting has gotten better. Overall a satisfying adaptation that will please the fans. 6/10"
"scottshak_111","7","0","7","27 August 2010"," Better than New moon !!
","I happen to be a fan of The twilight saga and comparing all the three of them I must say I liked the third one the most.Here at least Kristen Stewart has come out of her role of a pointless dame who she happened to be in the past two movies.She had in the past got her stuck to this sluggish persona which I hated the most.As the story however plays with her character and the difficult choice she had in front of her of choosing between Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson was a joy to watch. I've started to like Taylor Lautner, as my sympathy lies with him because of the fact that he has become a one side lover and he has still not given up.His die hard capability really is fascinating.It was a joy to watch Lautner stealing Pattinson's girl in the tent and of course by the apparent kiss that Lautner was asked for by Stewart. The movie has got more action than the past two movies and I loved it.Victoria comes back to take her revenge but eventually she has to pay and was slain by Edward with Bella's assistance. I'd recommend everybody to go for it coz the movie is not bad at all. I don't know whats wrong with the others who are criticizing the movie like hell. I think it was a good movie and I can't wait for the fourth one. The twilight saga is certainly a captivating series and its a real joy to watch the romance of Edward and Bella with a mist of Jacob in it."

","So Its Bella's last year of school and she wants to turn into a vamp and get in bed with him. Every new age teenage girls dream huh. Edward like the not so new age male in return asks her to marry him.<br/><br/>The thing is she's fooling around with Jacob and the volturi just wont leave them alone like the good bad guys they are. But you guys already know the story so Im ganna jump to the ""I love I hate I perish"" part. (Or was that I burn I pine?)<br/><br/>Lets start off were no others do, with the secondary characters.<br/><br/>They have more dialogs, which leads us to a bit of Jasper's and Rosalie's backgrounds as a person and not as a Cullen. Which in my opinion was the best part of the book surprisingly well written and fairly described.Sadly they made it so dull and slow in the movie, if I didn't know any better Id think they were just trying to make time with these scenes.<br/><br/>They made it so obvious it didn't seem natural. Why would Bella all of a sudden care about Jaspers past and why would he open up like that when he is so reserved. (Completely different situations in the book *sigh*).<br/><br/>Once again these two very great actors were put to shame with boring and fake dialogs.These are not the kinds of roles that get you respect as an actor. The surroundings in the flash backs weren't convincing and dare I say neither were the outfits. <br/><br/>The surprisingly good news is that the poorly described action scenes in the book turned out very well put together mixed in with a bit of entertaining Edward Jacob antagonism. Visually the fight scene were quite captivating for not being an action film itself.<br/><br/>There are lots of unnecessary Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and wolf dude close ups for my taste, and we all know why they're there.To lure the audience when boring dialogs are being said. Now if the actors weren't so expressionless all the time it wouldn't feel like such a D class soap opera. Im not complaining about their acting. Im complaining on how they want to compensate for the lack of everything into those kinds of shots.<br/><br/>What else? Well we've got a new Victoria played by the oh so wonderful Bryce Dallas Howard, but yet again how can you give birth to a great performance with a lousy script?<br/><br/>They had something great going with her disciple that should have been explored a tad more. Non the less it was a nice and refreshing plot for all the readers.<br/><br/>The main dilemma with these films is they have such talented actors as secondary characters, and yet what do they give us? St st stuttery Kristen Stewart and those other two guys who are there just too show off some chest.Not that complaining about that, but they have two more films two get there ACT together. They have good potential but they're not quite up there like their costars.<br/><br/>Oh two things i was keen about: Jasper and Carlisle didn't have accents on the other films, and Bella's hair is darker. On some shots they glossed patinson's lips over the top which looked awkward and unnatural. We all know vampires are feminine, but feminine does not mean extremely queer!<br/><br/>All In All David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces; but with level 1 performances from the lead cast and blunt dialogs.<br/><br/>Does the movie serve its purpose? Yes! Does that mean its a good movie and everyone will love it? No! Because its purpose is to sale merchandise. Why do you think there's the Cullen crest and Bella's ring and this and that.<br/><br/>But it entertains, its enjoyable, there's plenty a eye candy(unless you're a man). The characters are lovable, teen girls can relate to Bella. Its just nice for the moment, you will find no cult classic in this franchise."
"TheBkMogul","6","0","6","7 August 2010"," The best chapter in the ""Saga""
","This saga of vampire movies finally realizes it's potential in the hands of Slade as Eclipse is truly good in it's own right. It's still got the love triangle, it still has some groan inducing dialogue (sprinkled in with some light hearted moments), but what's gone is the doom, gloom, and downright depression that plagued all of ""New Moon"". We've got a marriage on the way, but a group of new-bloods threaten to take over a city. However, we've got alliances that are forged and pacts that are made.<br/><br/>I really can't single out any actor or actress since they are all average at best, but collectively, the ensemble cast works fine. I actually did enjoy Dakota Fanning and her legion, who basically looked on ominously in the distance, waiting for their a reason to strike. This bodes well for Breaking Dawn, which I hope puts the series out with a bang, because Eclipse sure set the stage for it."
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","6","29 July 2010"," Slade brings sharp edge back to romance saga
","The third instalment of the Twilight saga sees Bella Swan (Stewart) struggling in her friendship with Jacob (Lautner) whilst her love for Edward (Pattinson) grows, but an army of newborn vampires are sent to Forks by an old enemy to avenge a death.<br/><br/>The saga based on Stephanie Meyer's bestselling novels has sprouted much praise and critics all over the world and whether you like it or not you have to admit it has made one massive impact.<br/><br/>Hopefully with more edge and better direction the hype and praise will be surrounding the accomplishment of a good film rather than who is dating who off screen like we had with New Moon last year.<br/><br/>Eclipse starts in a fast manner with a new figure being chased by an unidentifiable attacker in the pouring rain. Straight away you can tell it has the right director at the helm in Slade. The action is consistent not just in this opening but throughout. His choice of extreme close shots and realistic taming of motions for his characters works better than its predecessor. There are times when the story itself borders quite finely on its 12A certificate but that's the beauty of this story. He handles the managing of time very well not always overselling and when there is a vibe of repetitiveness on in the air that is more due to the source novel and the amount of mind pondering being conveyed through the protagonists here.<br/><br/>When reading Eclipse last year it seemed to me the tension and adult circumstances moved up a few notches and there was more intrigue and scenarios that made it less queasy and more entertaining than many critics have said. The violence is sharp but not graphic and parents may wish to take note of the implied meanings in many conversations between the teenagers.<br/><br/>For this film the plot shifting from scene to scene in the 'war' works well enough but it is the romantic side the twi-hards will be interested in and none will be left too disappointed.<br/><br/>All the ideas and screenplay will satisfy many as Pattinson and Stewart generate their best on screen chemistry, despite a few queasy moments. Lautner still frowns too much but has improved vastly since New Moon.<br/><br/>This adaptation is better than others because it incorporates the side characters in more. Jasper, Rosalie and the wolf pack get more on screen time which was a necessity to the film's success.<br/><br/>I must confess I went into the cinema believing this would carry forward the slow repetitive vibe of New Moon but thankfully the pace is faster, the comedy is sharper (Billy Burke is a genius as Charlie Swan) and the 2010 release justifies the nature of Meyer's book which is what it needs.<br/><br/>If you, like me were let down by the second part fear not. Go and give this a view because if you liked the raw upgraded book this shall not disappoint.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Twilight books - fantastic for my imagination Twilight movies - fabulous compliment to my imagination I've been writing and rewriting this review, trying to find the right words. To put it simply though, I believe that the books are like the best meal you've ever had, and the movies are like the spices, the sauce on the meal that compliment it and give it life.<br/><br/>Let's not forget what these movies are - adaptations and a visual showcase. I can't say that they are not as good as the book; they are not books so they shouldn't be compared. They are movies! But what they offer should not be disregarded, or discouraged by anyone. They are a director's showcase of what he believes the movie to be so it's just a different perspective to our own which doesn't make it wrong.<br/><br/>But you know what ... if they capture and portray to us most of the magic contained in the book, in the characters, I will be happy.<br/><br/>Thank you Catherine Hardwicke. You found the people, you gave it a beginning, you picked THE best soundtrack and I thought you had Edward's hair the best, but too many scenes with Bella's ears popping out unfortunately. Your kissing scene was the best and the editing was really good. Baseball scene was awesome and again, the soundtrack and the score – mesmerizing. My only issue was the lack of dialog, that's all and a few scenes I would've liked to see which missed the cut. That's OK, there was magic and mystique in your portrayal and we can't go past that.<br/><br/>Well done to Chris Weitz. He gave us a beautiful perspective of Jacob and he portrayed the scenes delicately. I believe he gave the characters the space especially from the outset of production. His sensitive approach to the leaving scene and yet letting Jacob show his fun happy side was appreciated. Edward looked more like a 100 year old vampire in this whereas in Twilight he seemed like a teenager. I loved the hair on this movie for all except probably Jasper and Edward. It should be more like it was in Twilight. Editing was OK, the linkage between the scenes was great, Volturi were awesome – love Michael Sheen! Your wolves were fantastic so big ups to your CGI. Your backdrops were incredible; soundtrack was good though a little bit too quirky for me. I have grown to like it though.<br/><br/>David Slade - wow! I think your job was the most difficult. You saw Catherine portray the characters, and then you watched Chris developed them in his own way. I got the feeling that you tried to stick to the book, provide awesome dark moments and action which is your specialty and then just let the story come through. Brilliant! Some will say it sounded like the book; however it visually wasn't the book. I saw who cares to them, using the words from the book made it more like we were reading it and adding the pictures. Awesome! Charlie was great in this, the scenes were real. My only criticism was the linkage from scene to scene kind of made me feel like I was jumping around. I've seen it twice and will see it again. Once I have the DVD it will be much better for me. I loved the opening scene with Bella and Edward in the meadow, very nice. I loved the way you portrayed the stillness of the vampires, their speed and agility. We never see such things so it's hard to imagine yet after watching the movie I can visualize it now. I think Stephenie had a big part to play in the tent scene and we fans are grateful. Bryce did a fantastic job, wonderful. Your portrayal of the newborns was great, Riley and Victoria's background hinted at just enough. Bella's hair though – let's never do that to Kristen ever again. Her real hair is too beautiful to be ruined with wigs! And Edwards hair was still a little like New Moon, but I still loved it. I think the close-ups could be relaxed a little and give us a bit more dialog. I think it should've been longer.<br/><br/>For Breaking Dawn - what would I like to see? Edwards's hair like it was in Twilight, Bella's hair more like it was in New Moon, Alice/Jasper/Emmet/Rosalie/Carlisle and Esme developed more as they have such beautiful personalities we should see them more. Don't be afraid to make it 3 hours - we will watch it and give those more to say. They say so much in the books that we shouldn't be cheated out of that, I feel.<br/><br/>I've never read books as much as I have with these. I have never watched a movie so many times as I have with these. And what's even better, my husband is also hooked which is a big deal for my rugby, macho man. I often think of how Stephenie could've felt when she saw this story in her head. I am thankful she had the skills to be able to write it for us."

","I went to see it on opening midnight session and I must admit I expected more from the movie but still it was good and I would for sure see it again and again.<br/><br/>What I find most annoying is people who haven't liked the previous 2 but have gone anyway to see the 3rd and then come make nasty comments on IMDb.<br/><br/>I agree this movie is not intended for everyone and the books are far much better than the movies and it would have probably been better to be made in am mini series for TV and more could have been added and it would have been more like the book.<br/><br/>But never the less I loved the 1st, liked the second and liked the 3rd.<br/><br/>I'm also sick and tired of people saying that Kristen cannot act as well as Robert Pattinson. People need to also take time out to see some of their other work. You will be surprised.<br/><br/>As for Eclipse it is worth watching in my opinion if you are a Twilight Fan.<br/><br/>Lost of action going on and funny bits. If you are an Edward fan then lots of Eddie in this as well as if you are a Tay Tay fan u wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>For me I can't wait for then next chapter of this series and I'm sure it will be just as good as the rest.<br/><br/>For those with negative feedback maybe u should skip the next chapter and find something more for your taste."
"Sylver_loup88","9","0","7","24 July 2010"," I don't get how Twilight beat Eclipse
","I really hated the previous two movies, Twilight and New Moon. There was absolutely nothing to them, the lighting and filming was bad, and the acting was horrifying. At least, in Eclipse, the actors finally got some of their stuff together and managed to make themselves look convincing.<br/><br/>I have to say, I have read all four of the books and I was a fan of them. However I do hate Robert Pattinson and Kristin Stewart's roles, which make the characters in the book sound like snobs and losers. Ah well.<br/><br/>Eclipse was the best out of the three movies. First of all, it had action and teamwork. It was much more fast-paced than the previous two, the filming and lighting showed up MUCH MUCH better, and the side characters finally got some light to them. I was very happy with the film considering I didn't expect much from it due to the previous two disaster films.<br/><br/>I would say it is definitely worth watching if you want to redeem the series for yourself or if you just like the books. It will probably be the best out of the saga, as I cannot see Breaking Dawn ever topping Eclipse.<br/><br/>9/10 for satisfactory Vampire action, FINALLY!, and Werewolves on the roll!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","8","21 July 2010"," The Twilight Soap Opera Continues
","¨You have a choice. I didn't. None of us did. But you do and, you're choosing wrong.¨ The Twilight saga continues with this third installment of the popular Stephanie Meyer novel, Eclipse, and I don't think the film will win any new converts by now. You either liked the previous Twilight movies or you hated them and this third film will not change your opinion on them. So if you disliked the first two then stay away from this one, but if you liked them -like I did - then you won't be disappointed with Eclipse. Yes, the movie continues with its cheesy dialogues such as ¨Isabella Swan I promise to love you every moment of forever, ¨ and awkward pauses such as ¨I kissed Bella (pause). And she broke her hand (pause). Punching my face (pause). It was a complete misunderstanding.¨ , but the characters are what make us come back, the soap opera triangle love between Edward, Jacob, and Bella. The scenery and action scenes are also pretty well crafted. This movie even plays a little with the audience and decides to use some humor. Bella's difficulty to decide what she wants is getting kind of old and some of the same situations from the second part repeat themselves in this film so it doesn't feel as fresh, but the film is entertaining nonetheless. Like in the previous two installments the screenplay for Eclipse was adapted by Melissa Rosenberg, but this time it was directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night and Hard Candy, the last one was a movie I enjoyed quite a bit in 2005) and he does a decent job at satisfying the hard core fans who really just want to see more of Jacob and Edward fighting for Bella.<br/><br/>The pace of the Twilight movies are so slow that there isn't really much explaining to do with the plot that is pretty simple. Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are graduating from High School and it is time for the Cullen family to move once again. They are planning on moving to Alaska and Bella is going with them. Meanwhile there are a series of murders taking place in Seattle and the Cullen's suspect that the killings are being produced by a newborn vampire army. What they don't know is that Victoria (this time played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is behind this army and is preparing them to attack Bella so that she can get her revenge on Edward for killing her partner. Edward's brother, Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), knows how to face this breed of vampires so he prepares everyone for the upcoming battle. The Cullen's and the werewolves make an alliance in order to face the army because they both want to protect Bella. In the meantime Jacob (Taylor Lautner) declares his love for Bella and she has to decide who she wants to stay with, so the soap opera begins.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner have become overnight sensations with Twilight. Stewart is by far the most talented of the group as an actress and she has proved herself in other movies like Adventureland and The Runaways. She is also a pleasure to see on screen although her character in this film may become a little tiresome with all her indecisions, but that just proves how human she really is. The movie itself has become some sort of soap opera, but by now those of us that are hooked want to see the final outcome of the franchise. There is nothing new in this third installment and some elements can get old, but the action scenes make up for it in the final battle. This time the vampires and the Cullen family had more screen time, although I wasn't a big fan of all the flashbacks which only served to make more time before we got to the final battle scene. If you come to think about it not much really happens in this movie and most everything could be told in 30 minutes since it serves as a kind of bridge to the next film. From the beginning we are left waiting for the final battle and the entire midsection of the film focuses on the love triangle, but the movie still manages to entertain because by now we are already drawn to the characters and used to the pace of the movie. I recommend this movie only to those who have enjoyed the previous two because it is more of the same, so let me state once again if you didn't like the other films then save your time and stay away from this one."
"phd_travel","8","0","7","21 July 2010"," Better than New Moon - mostly enjoyable
","Really liked this one. I was so disappointed with New Moon. Thank goodness Eclipse is an improvement.<br/><br/>Pluses: 1. Action and romance are back. There is a lot of action and romance for those who found New Moon a drag. Much more intimacy here as well. At least you feel you got your 10 bucks worth here. <br/><br/>2. Directing. Slade is also a better director than Weitz any time - better focus and faster pace.<br/><br/>3. Acting. Kristen looked very pretty and carried the movie - no mean feat for an actress her age. The proposal and abstinence message were quite romantic. Rob is good though it's puzzling why his coloring seems to change from scene to scene. He doesn't seem consistently pale. Taylor's facial expressions are a bit limited and sometimes his face is a bit weird looking. They really do exploit him here poor thing. <br/><br/>4. More balanced storyline. A lot more air time for the supporting cast especially Rosalie and Jasper's backgrounds and the wolf vampire history are interesting. It was nice to get behind the characters more and have some explanation of the history. Although would have liked a bit more from the human classmates like Angela, Mike and Eric. <br/><br/>Minuses: 1. Dialog.<br/><br/>There are long heartfelt emotional speeches by the leads, and some of the dialog is a bit lame. Maybe some of the weaker parts could have been shortened. Ms Meyer's words do need a little help when moving from page to screen. In Twilight the dialog was more humorous and to the point. There are some funny moments though like Charlie's talk with Bella ""I'm a virgin!"" and Jacob's ""I'm hotter than you"". <br/><br/>2. Score. The songs chosen were inappropriate and distracting especially when the Cullens were training the wolf pack. Twilight 1 was the best for scoring and music they need to look back to that for inspiration. <br/><br/>3. Casting The newborns Riley and the new Victoria - Bryce Dallas Howard are not special enough (why did they dump Rachelle Lefevre?) and you don't really get a feel for them like the James in Twilight. Basically lame looking threats - no charisma. I still think Dakota Fanning lacks menace she's just too babyish looking.<br/><br/>4. Scenery. Some pretty parts used but the Seattle killings felt repetitive - is there only 1 dirty backlot they could have used? The meadow and clearing were not great. Photography could have been more stylish in parts. <br/><br/>Overall an improvement over New Moon. I still find the original Twilight the most enjoyable. Eclipse was entertaining and romantic, a big step in the right direction for Breaking Dawn."
"planke1167","9","0","8","20 July 2010"," Great movie
","This movie was definitely one of the best experiences i've ever had with movies.<br/><br/>I got chills so often! I laughed, i shuddered, it was awesome. They only reason i give it 9 and not 10 is Kristen Stewart. It's so sad that she's such a bad actor, but the overall picture is great. When i think about the film, my mind doesn't linger at Kristen's poor performance, but with all the great stuff which happened in the movie. It was only when i had to grade it, that i remembered the bad bad BAD performance made. :/<br/><br/>One of the best films i've ever seen, despite a truly horrific acting by the lead character. That something you don't see everyday.<br/><br/>:) Enjoy the movie."

","As a fan thats seen all three movies, and read all four books, i have to say that i like all three about the same. eclipse is my favorite book, but breaking dawn is one i can not wait for. i was slightly disappointed when i went to see eclipse. i understand that there is a rating to keep, but im REALLY SICK OF ALL THE CLOSEUPS!!! come on, really???? twilight didn't have THAT many closeups. they showed way more in that movie too. new moon even. but eclipse..... i feel that in order for them to avoid certain things they just did a closeup. its annoying. i wasn't very fond of how quickly the movie seemed to go, new moon actually seemed to take its time, even twlilght, but eclipse was over by the time it started. i understand that bella has her choosing to do, and thats why the ending was the way it was, which is nice that they completed certain things, but...grrr, the movie was rushed and to the point, therefore lacking some different little things, that i know if yall go back and read the book, you'd be saying, y wasn't that in there??? i hope that the people in charge of making breaking dawn take the time to read some of these. all i have to say is, not so many freakin closeups!!!!! come on already!, i understand the rating, but can we go out with a bang here for breaking dawn????? comeon. u can get away with a lot even though its pg-13, and i know that if my daughter was old enough to be apart of this craze and the final movie turned out to be R id take her. the books are awesome and i cant wait till shes old enough to read, shes 2 now. i wish she was bigger, it would be so much fun to share this with her. maybe thats what needs to be done. these moms need to share this with their daughters. it wont surprise me at all if the final movie made a killing on release, even if it was rated R. it would appeal to a wider audience, and would even send some of those people back to the first movie - twilight. maybe im wrong. whatever. i wanna see a good happy, true to the book finale. even if it means an R rating."
"jonnyfendi","5","0","3","8 July 2010"," Shirtless Werewolf + Very-cool Vampire + Girl Who Can't Even Made Up Her Mind = 'Twilight' Us
","Thiz movie is phenomenal. A lot of movie critics sneer at thiz romantic flick. But on thiz review, I want to stay neutral and try to be objective. If you want to be fair, whoever the Director or the Cast members will be getting a hard time to fulfil viewer great expectation since everyone pays full attention to thiz franchise. The original content is written by a woman novelist Stephenie Meyer. Twilight Saga schedules for quadrilogy. I think thiz third constellation is better than the second one, ""New Moon"" (2009). But the first one ""Twilight"" (2008) is still the best because of its mysterious atmosphere and effective introduction by former Director Catherine Hardwicke. Thiz time, The Director is David Slade who is previously known for ""30 Days of Night"" in 2007. Thiz sequel has better pace of story-telling. Although some people said the sequences are a little bit slow and boring. But I think if you want to get some precise romantic scenes, thiz is the only way to do it. Slade successfully captures the emotions for most of the times with his close up cinematography. If we look at the main performers, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) do not show much improvement than before. The better performance belongs to Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) with his deep eye gaze. The best performance surprisingly comes from the supporting Cast member Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi members. With her accent tone and body language, Fanning made an incredible vampire's aura. The blood-thirsty Jasper's character (Jackson Rathbone) annoys me a little bit. His character evolves too much. In two earlier prequels he was almost invisible, but on thiz third one he has changed dramatically to become tough vampire warrior. I observe, Thiz is an odd movie, where girls love it and boys hate it. I hope they didn't come to the theater just to see some good looking faces (I'm saying thiz, it's not because I'm a Twilighater). On the other hand, if you look inside, no matter how corny the movie is, it still has a story to tell (I'm saying thiz, it's not because my close friend is Twilighter). The formula is repeated quite well, shirtless werewolf plus very cool vampire plus girl who can't even made up her mind, equal to movie that totally twilight us.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"dvc5159","4","0","2","8 July 2010"," The best of the ""Twilight"" series... which isn't really that big of an improvement.
","OK, first off, I am not a fan of the Twilight series, nor am I a hater. I'm just a neutral in-between casual movie-goer. I am also not a book reader, so stop reading this review if you want to compare the film with the book. I would also like to mention that the first ""Twilight"" movie was mediocre but the second movie was just plain abysmal, in my humble opinion. And also, I personally find the fan frenzy over the entire ""Twilight"" franchise, book or movie, completely overblown. I mean, come on. Lovers are voting a 10 and haters (most of which who haven't even watched the movie yet) are voting a 1. People, if you don't like the movie, don't see it and bash it unreasonably. Let the movie critics do that for you.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Eclipse"" is leaps and bounds better than ""New Moon"", and some steps up above the first. Apart from the screenplay and dialog (which is still bland and mostly uninspired) and special effects (which are on par with ""New Moon""... which isn't really that much of a compliment), the acting, music and especially direction has improved significantly.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. Yes, they have genuinely improved slightly in terms of acting and chemistry. Heck even the quips they give each other are believable; Edward's quip about Jacob 's lack of a shirt made me chuckle. Some of the actors in the dark parts of the film display genuine fear and emotion, something that was lost in the previous two films. And near the end, Pattinson challenges an enemy by personally taunting them where it hurts most, and you can see the fury in each of their eyes. Other actors also get their moment to shine; Jackson Rathbone and Elizabeth Reiser in particular as Jasper and Esme Cullen, Billy Burke who made me laugh more than ever in any of the previous movies, heck even Dakota Fanning improves with an ever increasing mysterious aura around her. Bryce Dallas Howard is sadly wasted as her villainous role is nothing more than an extended cameo appearance if you count the minutes she's on screen.<br/><br/>However, the script is just as boring as the previous two, with so much predictability and wooden stiffness to it that, I felt like it was bordering on just plain stupidity. OK, yeah I get the old ""no-one-else- but-you"" type of clichÃ© and I kinda appreciated the fact that the hero is trying his best to get the girl away from his dangerous life to no avail and to the rival's delight, but it is written in a very stunted way that it looks as if the girl switches from one boy to another like clothes hangers. It's kinda stupid if you ask me.<br/><br/>Production design is good but getting unoriginal, fast (it's basically the same as the previous two), while the cinematography is great in which you get to see beautiful panoramic scenery and/or the wolf pack's shirtless abs. It's a mixed bag, that one.<br/><br/>Call me a movie freak, but one of the best thing worth watching (or listening) in the movie is Howard Shore's fantastic orchestral score, which is rousing and sweeping, and best of all easily suits the film. Compared to Carter Burwell's atmospheric score in the first film and Alexandre Desplat's great but horrifyingly mismatched score in the second, this one feels more suitable and gives out even more emotions than the actors themselves. And during the battle preparation and action sequences, one can't help but wonder when Frodo and the Fellowship are going to show up to aid their battle.<br/><br/>Finally, director David Slade. The film's action sequences and moody/grim parts has his style all over it. Even during some of the talk scenes, the camera shakes in a similar way to that of Slade's previous films ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"". Heck, the very well-handled action sequences is basically a PG-13 ""30 Days of Night"" with no blood and extra werewolves thrown into the mix. From the moment the film starts, his taut direction immediately puts you into the action. But most of the action is near the film's end. Moreover, it's a huge surprise to why Slade ever got dragged into the ""Twilight"" franchise: he should be doing more gory films instead of this. Nevertheless, an interesting director does not make a bad script into a terrific movie, but at least Slade does his best with the material he's given.<br/><br/>In short, although the third time's the charm with the ""Twilight"" franchise, it's still adequate, and it's mostly a hit and miss with the movie-going crowd. If you hate ""Twilight"" you're gonna hate/stay away from this one; if you love it, you're gonna love this one. Simple. As a normal movie reviewer, this is just nothing more than a decent time waster, with romance, vampires, werewolves and CGI.<br/><br/>One could wonder what Bill Condon could do with ""Breaking Dawn"".<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10"
"definitelynotintheirteam","Null","0","7","8 July 2010"," Surprise! I'm not sleepy at all
","I'm watching any kind of film... just to know whether I like it or not. The Twilight Saga is not an exception. The first movie makes me sleepy with all the poorly acting, the dialogue and the story but I thought b/c its a cheap project and supposed to be indie... so never mind. The second movie--expecting to be good b/c of Chris Weitz and all the money in the world--only makes me suffering in theater. Constantly checking my watch and wondering when it'll be over, yawning, yawning and feel extremely bored. So, when Eclipse comes to the theater at the same time with my occasionally insomnia problem... thinking this could be the perfect sleeping pill, I'm going to theater and I was surprised! I didn't feel sleepy at all. I actually enjoyed it a little (but the lack in acting still bother me, though--do they really think: ""B/c of the PHENOMENON this film will always be top 5 in the box office, so why so serious if wooden acting or simply JUST said the line without too much effort will do. The Twihard never complain."") and realize that watching this didn't help my insomnia at all b/c throughout the movie I always smiling, grinning or laughing. Sometimes sighing. Maybe when the actors put some soul in their acts, this could be one of my fave romantic comedy... just ignore the vampire-werewolf things."
"ohtobepublished","Null","0","7","4 July 2010"," Not just for the Twi-hards
","Saw a preview of this movie and as a fan of Meyer, I wasn't disappointed. Mostly a great cast, lots of humour and suspense, uber-camp Volturi...what more do you want?!! Look, all you guys who have given it crappy reviews....fine, but let's face it, you knew what you were going to see. It was never going to be Citizen Kane. You just have to suspend all belief and let it all wash over you. I don't go to swoon over the actors like some of the girls sitting behind me in the theatre, I go for a good old movie that pays homage to a great book. It did that, and by the way, it's not just for the book fans...dragged husband along (he's never read the books) and he loved it too.<br/><br/>Only one gripe...has Rob Pattinson got over productive saliva glands? Lots of swallowing and grimacing in between his lines....or was I imagining it???"
