","That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant ""hungry for more."" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful. I appreciate the positive feedback from everyone! If you enjoyed this review, please click on cinephile-27690 and click ""reviews"" on the right for more reviews!

","In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...<br/><br/>This movie is perfect. This movie is the reason why I write movie reviews. This movie helped me appreciate effort and art. This movie helped me defeat my prejudices against things I don't really know.<br/><br/>It is a perfect kids movie, it is a perfect adult movie. Most Pixar movies actually contain very mature messages and this movie's message, ""anyone can cook"" is why we watch movies. Movies are meant to inspire the audience and this movie does a great job. Show this to a kid, they will watch it over and over again. I know because I used to watch this movie every single day.<br/><br/>This is not Remy's movie, this is not Linguini's movie, this is definitely not Gusteau's movie. This is Anton Ego's movie. The character development of Anton Ego is phenomenal. We see an arrogant critic become a humble and honest person, and it is what we should become at the end of the day. Most of us start out as arrogant and we do not appreciate effort and talent. However we must learn to give credit where it is due. We see Ego's journey in becoming this modest person, he changes for the better.<br/><br/>The final scene is one I cannot praise enough. Seeing Ego complete his arc This movie is an inspiring masterpiece, something we really need in the movie industry today.<br/><br/>Maybe I highly rate this movie because of my memories watching it. The scene where he tastes the ratatouille is exactly how I felt re-watching this movie. When I rewatched this movie I experienced something new, an appreciation of kids movies and their messages. This movie changed my whole perception on animated movies. Today, most movies are cash grabs produced with the sole purpose of making profit from tickets and action figures. We need more movies like Ratatouille in this world. In this critic's opinion, this movie is nothing less than the finest movie in history."
"stalcup","10","560","655","17 June 2007"," Incredible
","Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.<br/><br/>The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.<br/><br/>The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.<br/><br/>And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.<br/><br/>10/10"
"superfan18","10","435","544","11 June 2007"," Excellent movie!
","Tonight I went to see Ratatouille during a preview offered to Myspace users in Boston. Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real ""feel-good"" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I've been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!"
"Tripper27","10","314","393","17 June 2007"," A fantastic story that adds to Pixar's stellar reputation
","I checked out a sneak preview of Ratatouille last night, and I must say I truly loved this movie. Everything from the animation to the score to the voice acting to the story (and especially the story) was EXCELLENT.<br/><br/>I don't know if it appeals to kids as much as other Pixar offerings, but this one upholds their legacy of excellence.<br/><br/>Casting Patton Oswalt as Remy was PERFECT. The rest of the voice cast was outstanding as well...including Pixar ""house voice"" John Ratzenberger. See if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge (as in, don't read the cast list).<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award-winning one he created for ""The Incredibles"" and the incredible music he has created for most of J.J. Abrams' recent projects, including ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". <br/><br/>Even with my 3-year-old son making it really hard to concentrate, and our ""we got to the theater late and had to sit up front"" seats, this movie was fantastic. Everyone should go see it, even if they don't have kids.<br/><br/>Brad Bird - you done right by us movie fans again...Ratatouille is great!"

","Fantastic ! ... Can't wait to get the DVD ! The technical / animation / lighting ..etc aspects of the film are awesome. Pixar has raised the bar again.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, is that it showcases Pixar's ""mantra"" , that being story, story ...story.

That all contributed ..for me at least... to keeping the movie very interesting right to the end.<br/><br/>While I found a few things predictable, there were also quite a few twists and and unexpected events / scenes, that just kept giving me more new ""stuff"" to enjoy 10 / 10 Mike"
"willden21","10","275","345","17 June 2007"," An Amazing film, made for film lovers, with an artistic/indie appeal
","I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.<br/><br/>The story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too ""indie"" for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.<br/><br/>P.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours."
"ashowen","10","201","261","16 June 2007"," Another Disney-Pixar Masterpiece!
","This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! ""Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!"""
"PoisonKeyblade","10","376","512","17 June 2007"," Best Animated Film in Creation
","The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.<br/><br/>Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a little rat who dreams of becoming a chef just like his idol, the human Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). After a mishap, Remy loses his family in the sewers and comes upon a fading restaurant that had previously been owned by Gusteau before his untimely death. He comes upon a lowly garbage boy, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and together they set out to revive the once-legendary restaurant.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. The animation is even more stunning here than in some of the other Disney/Pixar productions, and the breathtaking landscape of Paris, France, really adds a layer of realism to the film. The food looks so real and delicious, and the humans and rats look incredibly realistic. Remy and Linguini are both lovable characters, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way. Surprisingly enough, this movie is the funniest of the Disney/Pixar films, with very subtle and unique humor.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the voice acting really makes the film different, and each actor is perfectly suited to his or her role. The best among the bunch happens to be Lou Romano, as he deals with his character extremely well and is incredibly believable. There are times when the acting and animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching an animated film altogether. Brad Garrett is actually tolerable for once, and is excellent in his role as Gusteau, who acts as Remy's conscience for the majority of the film. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are rooted from Gusteau's chats with Remy and many others come from the relationship between Linguini and Remy. On another note, Patton Oswalt does a magnificent job voicing Remy, and Peter O' Toole is very memorable as Anton Ego, the food critic for 'The Grim Eater'.<br/><br/>Overall, you can't ask for a better film than Ratatouille, a new classic from Disney/Pixar that is filled with humor, amazing animation, and, most importantly, lots of heart. Some of the scenes are so poetic and perfect that they just bring tears to your eyes. It may be hard to believe, but Ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year, or perhaps that you will ever see. It manages to be better than Toy Story, better than Finding Nemo, even better than the fantastic Meet the Robinsons. I saw a pre-screening of the film on Saturday, June 16, but I cannot wait to see it again once it hits theaters everywhere on June 29. See Ratatouilleit is highly original, heartwarming, uplifting, and a very thrilling movie that has to be the best animated feature of the last few decades."
"antokeo-95792","10","8","8","3 July 2019"," A masterpiece is an understatement
","When this movie first came out and I was relatively young I did the mistake of allowing the animated nature of this movie cloud my judgement. If I had known better, I may have been able to appreciate this movie far earlier.<br/><br/>I have not seen another children's movie that contains as much important and profound messages as Ratatouille. The way it tells the story prepares you very well for every point it has to make, and in the end these ideas start settling down, everything starts making sense, not just the movie, but life. Listening to Anton Ego's review in the end felt like drinking a warm glass of milk and honey on a cold day, it was not just comforting, it wasn't just uplifting, it felt essential, it felt as though the cold had finally gone.<br/><br/>At some point in life we all find ourselves in an existential crisis, we start questioning our identity and our purpose in life. I've never watched something that has given me a better sense of identity and meaning than this movie right here. Remy is an inspiration, he is aware of what he is and how nature has defined his life to be, but that does not stop him from finding a purpose. He had a gift, he never had a desire to make something of it until he was inspired by Chef Gusteau; for a rat to cook life had a long list of challenges awaiting Remy but god damn it he found a way that works. He could have spent his life sniffing food to prevent poisonings in his colony, a task which is very meaningful and perhaps to many rats, a drram"
"movielover_gator","10","280","404","18 June 2007"," Pure brilliance... beats Nemo, Cars, etc !!
","I saw this movie in the sneak preview, and I just loved it! You will be amazed by its creativity and brilliance. I would easily vote it to be the best animation movie ever beating nemo, cars, monster inc, etc by a mile! This movie is for people of all age groups. Kids, adults and even those who do not like animations will love it.<br/><br/>I do not want to say anything else here and spoil it for you. All I can say is if you do not watch it, you will be missing out on a very very very special movie.<br/><br/>I have never written a review on here before, but this movie made me write one. Ratatouille is pure brilliance!"
"robcat2075","9","189","288","17 June 2007"," A First Rate Film
","I just saw ""Ratatouille"" tonight.<br/><br/>It's a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...<br/><br/>-The character performances are so good, I think there's no sort of movie they couldn't make. I've heard Pixar's John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.<br/><br/>-""Cars"" definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.<br/><br/>-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely ""real"".<br/><br/>-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought ""I can't believe they are doing this tired movie cliché"" but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.<br/><br/>-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!<br/><br/>-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now."
"mshuman-2","9","38","54","17 June 2007"," GREAT addition to the Pixar family of films...
","I attended a sneak preview of Ratatouille, and I have to say, Pixar has done it again. I enjoyed Cars, but didn't LOVE it like some of the other Pixar Films (Monsters Inc and The Incredibles are my favorites). This movie, however, was just about perfect. If I had one complaint (and it's VERY small) it was a just a little too long, but not by much. But the voices, the computer animation, the music, and above all the story were all top notch. I'm continually amazed at how Pixar continues to crank out great films like these that both children and adults can appreciate. I have a feeling most critics and film goers alike will rate this one very high. I wholeheartedly recommend the film - it really was a fun night out at the movies! Congrats Pixar!! Oh, and they also continue to do wonderful shorts that appear before the feature. This one involving aliens(that's all I'll say) is really cute and continues that fine tradition.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the DVD!"
"www-aktomer","10","5","5","4 June 2019"," Awesome movie!
","I generally like animated movies more, so my review might be biased a little. But overall, the movie was great. It was very relatable. Not a rat cooking in a kitchen, of course, but in breaking out of mainstream, going against the wind, breaking the stereotypes. That kind of stuff.
Going to my all time favourites definitely!"
"verdie","10","8","9","30 June 2007"," The best yet!
","At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.<br/><br/>From the standpoint of writing, this one keeps an astonishing number of themes going, creates great multifaceted characters, and maintains believable suspense and motivation, all without ever seeming strained or ""written."" From the standpoint of animation, it's unbelievable. The translucency of a rat's paw, the dented shine of a copper kettle, the complex texture of a crumb of bread, are all rendered with breathtaking accuracy. (And Paris has never looked lovelier -- if the French tourist board didn't subsidize this production, they should have.) From the standpoint of voice acting, it ranges from believable and unshowoffy (unlike the annoying star turns we're seeing in a lot of these days) to the stentorian sneer of the great Peter O'Toole.<br/><br/>And, most of all, the character creation and animation is beyond belief. The facial expressions, the unique-to-each-character body movements, the sense of weight and texture are so incredibly closely observed and reproduced that at times I had to work to remember that what I was seeing was animation and not Oscar-caliber acting.<br/><br/>If this one doesn't go up in the Best Picture category instead of simply Best Animated Feature, there's no justice in Oscar-land."
"cricketbat","9","10","12","28 December 2018"," Features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time
","Not only does Ratatouille do a fantastic job of portraying the joy of eating, but it also features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time (the childhood flashback scene). Yes, the premise is goofy and, yes, rodents are actually pretty disgusting, but that doesn't make me love this movie any less. This is one of the Pixar greats."
"bobsgrock","10","8","10","22 January 2008"," Amazing, spectacular, and perfect.
","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.<br/><br/>It's hard to put your finger on, but why exactly is Pixar able to create these astonishingly good films that aren't just entertaining and delightful, although they certainly are that. They are able to tap into the very realms of the human condition, and with this bring to the surface emotions and feelings you come to not expect from an animated film because after all, animated automatically infers a film for children.<br/><br/>Of course Ratatouille breaks that mold and I am just so pleased that I got caught up in the world of Remy once again. With their endless budget from Disney, Pixar can create and explore any aspect necessary and writer/director Brad Bird does just that. The story here comprises elements of drama, sadness, family relations, job pressures, as well as a wonderful monologue near the end by a critic for critics. The story is pitch-perfect, always understandable and the foundation for which the film is made.<br/><br/>And, since it is Pixar and Disney, the look and feel of the film is so engrossing, it looks better than other animated films made after it. One of the things Pixar does so well is find the middle ground in making elements of the frame look real but not too real, thus still maintaining an animated universe. They did it with the water in Finding Nemo, the cars in Cars, and they do it here with the food, which at times looks so real you want to taste it.<br/><br/>I really can't say anything bad about Ratatouille. Even the story elements of how Remy and his human counterpart, Linguini, are able to work together work because this is the animated world which lends itself to more freedoms than our world. The voices are terrific from Patton Oswalt to Ian Holm to the great Peter O'Toole as deathly-thin food critic Anton Ego. There really isn't anything here that doesn't work and Michael Giacchino's score emits the spirit of Paris that sets the background for this story. This is just a great film, perfect in its story, its characters and the wonderful, vibrant world it creates. Years after its release, Ratatouille continues and will continue to impress and immerse viewers in a touching story with beautiful surroundings about the cutest rat in the world becoming a chef in Paris. Only animation, and only Pixar, could make this a film and succeed."
"David65536","10","8","10","1 July 2007"," A classic of the computer animation films
","To me this is one of the best animated movies of the last years. It has a very inspiring story and has a timeless signature. It has many comedy elements but is not overloaded with jokes that make reference to the present time (like Shrek).<br/><br/>This movie integrates a very nice story, with attractive characters and the last advances in computer animation. Is a real art work in the sense that it integrates all its elements without oversizing one of them: an inspirational cartoon tale that uses the computer graphics with some elements of comedy.<br/><br/>The facial and corporal language of the main characters is amazing. I love too that its makes reference to the typical problems that sometimes you have to get all the things you love at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie also has many other goodies inside, but it's up to you to discover them."
"GSmith9072","7","143","263","17 June 2007"," Pulls the most out of an okay story
","Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.<br/><br/>Story-wise, that's the only area where I can detect any trace of criticism. I felt at times, dare I say it, that the emotion was a little bit forced. There were just certain times I didn't understand a certain character's frustration. Also, I felt uneasy about the films unusual balance of fantasy and realistic themes, such as how the reactions to rats were carried our toward the end of the film and how it blends into the films major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrences. That lack of coherent continuity gives a writer a lot more flexibility in how to tell the story. In other words, it's kind of a shortcut. But it's an observation that is made up for by other successes in the film. The film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional themes with a little more depth (to truly enjoy it, I'd recommend erasing the fact that rats often carry disease from your mind). It's cute without embarrassingly forcing it and unpretentious. The very fact that what makes it work may fly over the heads of small children isn't a reason to condemn it. It's true though that I feel that younger kids may get a little restless halfway though, and not just through my own experience at the theater. however, this is another great film for an older audience to enjoy a simple well told story. As for whether it will have that lasting effect that Pixar films usually carry, only time will tell."
"Quinoa1984","10","13","19","29 June 2007"," truly devilish fun and mind-blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style, but also very successful in storytelling- magnifique!
","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clichéd extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie! <br/><br/>The story is the fish out of water, or in this case rat, where a little rodent named Remy, who is totally immersed in the style of Augustus Gusteau, a famous French chef who dies, and who's position is filled by a lowly garbageman named Linguini. He can't cook, of course, but somehow Remy, separated from his rat family, cooks something up on the spot as a not-quite accident, sending Linguini as the one who supposedly made it. On the fluke, he becomes the new chef at Gusteau's...only, the chef's a rat, literally, hilariously pulling Linguini's hair to make him a cooking puppet (early on this makes for some of the best physical comedy of any Pixar movie). This fluke becomes the start of the usual ball of string unraveled bit by bit, involving an heir to Gusteau's fortune, a love interest in aggressive chef Colette, and Remy's reconnection and estrangement from his huge rat clan and his father. All the while Bird throws in such dangerous and downright devilish comedy for a *G* rated animated movie. And there's morales to be learned too, or sort of taken away, I guess, only this time in the true Disney form instead of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, it's Remy and the, well, illusion of Gusteau's ghost appearing to him as a quasi-conscious.<br/><br/>What makes Ratatouille stand out of the pack from the fellow summer far of the moment, particularly 4th of July fare, is how there's such deft to Bird and his team navigating along the lines of making the comedy work to its excessive lengths while always keeping a firm grip on which turn the story will take next (the moments I didn't quite expect- the whole heir angle involving Linguini, and the climactic scenes with the rats preparing the restaurant's dinners, all washed before going to work, and keeping 'under wraps' the health inspector at the same time!). I probably laughed just as much during this film as I would at something much raunchier like Knocked Up or Grindhouse, to give recent examples, but as mentioned there's a riskiness to Bird's style here.<br/><br/>One scene I particularly loved is when Remy is training linguini to command the muscle-controlled hair pulling scheme at his home, and there's a build-up to what seems like a knife going to cut into his fingers while he's chopping vegetables (up to this point he's been hopeless in his training), but at this very point where we should expect the worst, which is funny unto itself, it starts to level out and he's sort of under control. Sort of in that he'll still be naturally clumsy enough to spill the wine on his own head. Same goes for little things like the quite silhouetted bit Remy passes by with the lover about to shoot the other and then falling into full embrace, or the actual fellow employees at Gusteau's, one of who has the wildest thumb ever shown in a movie, least of all a 'family' movie, that I can remember (albeit Bird does come out of working on the Simpsons).<br/><br/>So many masterstrokes of comedy go on that it's almost neglected to note how exciting a lot of the film is too, the run-around Remy has in the kitchen first time he comes in or the chase through Paris between the crooked head cook Skinner and Remy, and how seamless voice-work and the (now highly expected) advances in Pixar's technical innovations go together. It was a good guessing game who was the voice of Ego (it's O'Toole, but then it could be any given old regal British person), and to pick out that it's Ian Holm or Garofolo voicing some of the other parts, but it's not something that is immediately meant to be stand-out like in other CGI movies where it's being sold mostly on celebrity voice talent. It's almost like a lot of this comes quite naturally to Bird and his team, and yet because it isn't it reverts to becoming all the more remarkable. Ratatouille is simply an exceptionally fun picture, loaded with sight gags and puns and slips of behavior, and never overbearing with any of the usual messages that come pre-packaged for kids in these movies, all the more remarkable as it comes nearer to Pixar reusing previous ones."

","Ratatouille, Brad Bird's third feature (after the scintillating Iron Giant and The Incredibles) measures up to his oeuvre. It's a fine film with wonderful animation, a charming story, and a slam bang finale that had me laughing. The story, in brief, is that Remy the Rat has the dream (and the talented nose) to be a great chef. Through a series of misadventures, he finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a former five-star restaurant now clicking over on the reputation of its deceased former owner, the great chef Gusteau, whose ghost (or else figment of Remy's imagination) is mentor to Remy. Remy develops a relationship with the hapless Linguini, a garbage boy in the kitchen with a secret past, and through him begins to return the restaurant to its greatness. <br/><br/>If the film has a weakness, it is in the second act. The baddie here is the head chef, Skinner, who is anxious to retain control of Gusteau's in order to launch lines of frozen foods. The problems here are that the main conflicts do not really play out. Once the relationship with Remy is established, Linguini becomes more interested in the only female chef in the kitchen, Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo) and for whatever reason begins to treat Remy as an afterthought. Since Remy is his only link to culinary glory, he has to be an idiot to treat the rat this way. Remy's personal inner conflict is based on the fact that he longs to treat humans to new culinary delights, while he is made all too aware of how humans feel about rats. Last, Skinner is concerned that a secret from Linguini's past will loosen his hold on Gusteau's. This is dealt with in the most perfunctory manner - Remy finds out, steals some documents, there is a chase (which is very well done) and then Skinner is out. Skinner never truly develops as a villain anyway, and his performance is probably the least weighty. Remy's conflict about how humans feel about rats never feels authentic. He knew about this all along, and he obtains far too much joy from creating new dishes to ever walk away from Gusteau's once has gotten his foot in the door.<br/><br/>However, once Linguini gains control of Gusteau's, and has wowed customers through Remy's genius, comes the big test - Anton Ego, the Simon Cowell of food critics, whose word can make or break a restaurant. He is initially developed as the baddie of the food world, but in fact this character is the heart of the film - he may be terrifying, but in fact he loves food, loathes mediocrity, and is honest. His visit to the restaurant, while Linguini is dealing with a full-scale kitchen mutiny, is the comic and action highlight of the picture. It is one of the best, and funniest, climaxes of any films on screen this year. And to understand how this can be, in a scene where the interaction is primarily between the kitchen and dining room, requires someone to see the film. Peter O'Toole does a superb job in voicing Ego, and his take on the evening, and his discovery about Remy (when he insists on meeting the chef), that he later writes up in his review is one of the most sterling pieces of critical journalism to ever appear in a film, ever. I highly recommend Ratatouille. The performances are terrific, the animation is wonderful, and so what if some parts of the plot drag or are never adequately realized. It is nonetheless a terrific movie."

","Disney and Pixar have done it again. They've combined their amusing + universal story, sprinkled on some killer animation, added a dash of perfect voice acting, and sautéed it to make very endearing main character, who will appeal to children and adults alike. The end result has been astounding.<br/><br/>Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a small rat with big dreams. Where the other rats have a passion for food, Remy has a passion for COOKING food. He aspires to become like his role model and idol: Gusteau - the best chef in all of Paris. After Remy loses his family, he finds himself face to face with Gusteau's restaurant - which is now slowly losing its 5 Star reputation. Unfortunately for Remy, his hero Gusteau suddenly passed away, leaving Remy pondering on what to do. When Remy bumps into Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage boy, they set out on an adventure together, to discover themselves, to discover secrets, and most importantly, to discover the art of real cooking.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning. It is so realistic that it's unbelievable, every little detail has been perfected, and each twist and turn of the story pulls on your heartstrings.<br/><br/>Each actor voicing over does a great job, each one is well suited for their role, especially Lou Romano as Linguini - the chemistry between Remy and Linguini was fantastic! Just with the voice, an audience is able to identify with the characters, and view the superb chemistry these two actors, by just listening to their voices. Either way, it really worked for Ratatouille! <br/><br/>In conclusion, Disney Pixar have a new bestseller family film on their list, following Toy Story, Shrek, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille will earn a place in your heart."

","Brad Bird's latest creation takes place in Paris, the city that is thought by many to be the city of the worlds greatest food. However, there are some problems. Mainly, that our hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat. A rat that is a brilliant chef with a taste for fine food, but a rat none the less. Running from a mad old granny with a shotgun, being separated from his family, being flushed down one of the biggest pipes EVER! and being followed by the ghost of the late, great Gusteau, the chef that says ""Anyone can cook"", are just some of the problems the poor rat has to face. <br/><br/>While this is a sweeping statement, a food critic named Anton Ego (voiced brilliantly by Peter O'Toole) takes it a bit too literally,making sure Gusteau's restaurant isn't as popular as it was. When Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano), a terrible garbage boy/wannabe chef, he takes him under his wing (rat paw) and controls him through a strange method of pulling his hair??? The film has an excellent screenplay, amazing animations, brilliant art and mostly superb voices. The rats, normally horrible and dirty, are cute and clean. Brad Bird's screenplay is rich with jokes (Remy waves to a cyclist, who, disgusted, isn't looking where he's going and crashes into a car in a cloud of shopping and bike parts), passion (Linguini's love, Colette) and tiny details which would amaze even the greatest director (Remy's oven-glove bed, the rat poison/exterminator shop, Gusteau's ghost telling Remy what to do). It's all there, you've just got to look for it.<br/><br/>There is only one bad thing about 'Ratatouille'. The character and voice of Languini, is in my opinion, not as fantastic as the rest of the film. Lou Romano doesn't quite seem to hit the right note, one brick short of a house or whatever you want to say. Linguini's character is too whiny, even for someone in his position. If he whines about the cooking, and at some points Remy, ditch the rat and go get a different job. He just doesn't seem to have his heart in it to me.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm, Patton Oswalt and all the others, however, make it a very grand dish indeed. Patton Oswalt relies mainly on ear twitching and eyebrow raising, but when he does talk, you listen. Ian Holm, the small, evil chef who need a stool to taste soup, is, as ever, brilliant and Peter O'Toole seems to relish being the bad guy, just as Anton Ego loves to criticise the lack of relish (forgive the pun, had to be done...and the rhyme!). Dark, mysterious and even scary, Peter O'Toole brings an edge to another great Pixar villain. <br/><br/>All in all, the film is a masterpiece, definitely Pixar's and Brad Bird's best dish yet, but hopefully there is more to come. Consider it a starter, an ""amuse de bouche"", and just wait for Pixar's next dish, whatever it is, and hope it's just as delicious . In the words of Anton Ego, ""Surprise me!"". Parents, just hope your kid's don't want a rat"

","When ""Ratatouille"" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see the animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.<br/><br/>Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish ""Ratatouille"" victories in every category. It deserves them all."

","This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.<br/><br/>Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.<br/><br/>Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really ""bad"" ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer's dream), most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as ""just a kid's movie"".<br/><br/>Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered. I can't wait to see it again."

I picked up the DVD and watched it 3 times. Remy is adorable and I fell in love with him ,his facial expressions and body language are so sweet, you care what happens to him,there is one scene where he is trapped in a jar and Linguini is going to drop him in the water,you can see the fear in his eyes and how vulnerable he is,it pulls at your heart and you want to just rescue him and take him into your arms. Once the kitchen show gets going though it really rocks.. Linguini is hilarious and Colette a wonderful tough lady chef who falls in love with Linguini. Hijinks in the kitchen as both Remy and Linguini pull off the most hilarious illusion of cooking with Remy pulling his hair to make him do things and Linguini's incredible Jim Caerryesque slapstick bodygags. The supporting cast is equally marvelous with various big stars doing voiceovers like Brian Dennehy ,Peter O'Toole and others adding to it's charm. I'm usually OK with most animated Disney movies that have come out lately but this one really moved me and I'm a 42 y/o man. It was very adult in nature since it appealed more to the older crowd then just kids. I do hope they do a sequel as I would most like to see what happens to Remy next.

","Today I had the privilege of seeing Pixar's 8 feature-length release, and the current front-runner to receive the 2007 Best Animated Oscar.<br/><br/>That film is Ratatouille. It revolves around Remy an adorable little rodent who desires to be a great chef, and Linguine, a bumbling but well-intentioned nerd who helps Remy become a great chief. The movie begins in a French country-side house where Remy and his disapproving rat brethren (""shutup and eat your garbage"" says Remy's father when Remy complains about wanting high-quality food) are driven away by a miserable elderly French hag. Through his escape from the French hag, Remy lands in a Parisian restaurant created by a famous French chef named Gusteau. Gusteau took his own live after a bad review from a famous food critic named Anton Ego, but Gusteau still appears in Remy's imagination to offer various pieces of advice, such as ""anybody can cook"" and ""stealing is wrong"". Through Gusteau's inspiration and Linguini's bumbling nature, Remy and Linguini become cooks in a partnership that may bring Gusteau's restaurant back to it's former glory. Complicating matters are a feisty female cook, an asshole of a head chef, the reunion between Remy and his disapproving family, and snarling food critic Anton Ego.<br/><br/>Do not be afraid of Ratatouille's 110-minute running time, this movie has a far-quicker pace that some 90-minute movies. If you are a kid, you'll love the Looney Tune-esqe slapstick. Through accident, Remy can control Linguini like a puppet by pulling on his hair. It's a real thrill to see Linguini make body motions that are completely against his will. If you are older, you will appreciate the message this movie provides: no dream is too important, if you work hard enough and never stop believing you can achieve anything. This not the first time that message has been told in an animated film, but it's a lesson that's worth repeating. That is not the only thing this movie has to tell us. Like Remy, we as humans must decide whether to go our own way or do what our family tells us. We must also decide whether it's better to be respected doing things that make us miserable or to be disrespected doing things that make us feel happy. Not since Amadeus has such an enjoyable movie asked such serious questions.<br/><br/>I left this movie feeling really wonderful and enchanted. Enchanted because I saw the good guys get what they deserve, enchanted because I saw the jerks get what they deserve. I felt enchanted because I witnessed the marvelous performance of Peter O'Toole as the crusty but lovable food critic Anton Ego. The way Peter O'Toole used the word ""Perspective"", I couldn't help but get goosebumps, and I mean that as a high compliment.<br/><br/>While I still await The Simpsons Movie with great anticipation, now I highly doubt it will win the Best Animated Feature Oscar, because it'll have to be really good to beat Ratatouille's magic.<br/><br/>My grade (out of 4 stars): 4"

","Maybe later, after the initial euphoria from last night's sneak-peak viewing has faded, I might change my vote to an 8 or 9, but for now I'm giving it a ten and calling it the best ""cartoon"" movie so far this year. <br/><br/>I'm no CGI snob - the animation look great to me. The music was unobtrusive, noticeable only when it was supposed to be notice. Other pluses to me was an absence of song and dance scenes and cutesy sidekicks. The story (thankfully) took a couple of turns that bypassed the paths usually ambled upon in animated stories that have animals presenting human traits. And although it did have a happy ending, it didn't have the expected ""everyone's dreams came true and they all lived happily ever after"" ending, which was a nice change. <br/><br/>What I liked most of all, was how the movie was able to express the concept that preparing food should be more than a necessary chore, that eating food is more than just fueling your body, that eating should be an enjoyable experience. I am now on a quest myself to find a recipe for ratatouille!!!"
"jaredmobarak","9","10","15","23 July 2007"," He calls it his Tiny ChefRatatouille
","Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.<br/><br/>Pixar will always be at the top of the computer graphic echelon because they have never catered to the increasing trend of dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. It appears that the current trend in America has been to try and make everything too equal, thus simplifying things in order for those less motivated souls to understand and laugh at, at the expense of the intellectuals which should be allowed some intellectual stimulation as well. Rather than go for the ""fart jokes"" and clichéd old-hat humor, Disney's newly bought animation studio has proved time and again that story is paramount and that without it, no means of skill or effects can survive. Locking up a talent like Bird for his most recent two films shows the dedication they have in getting the right people involved in the creative process. <br/><br/>The backbone impetus of this story is not at all truly original. It is very much an ugly- duckling type tale of someone who has decided to go along a path different then his people have for generations. While being slightly ostracized at home, he goes into the world in order to find meaning and a use for his extraordinary skill. Since that skill is a keen sense of smell, what better occupation than gourmet chef is there for mixing those flavors at his service in unique and wonderful ways? Unfortunately, our hero is a rat, and we all know that they don't go with hygienic kitchens very well. He must find a kind soul to help him do what he was born to do, and with that fateful meeting in Gusteau's restaurant, our tale unfolds. By going against the stealing mentality of his fellow rats and living amongst the humans, I was starting to think we would eventually get to a point where his clan speaks of how he has angered the rat Gods and their supply of garbage has been cleaned up by environmentalists around Europe. I quickly hit myself in the head, remembered that this wasn't Happy Feet with rats, and sat back to enjoy a real fairytale story that didn't try to shove an agenda down my throat. Fairy tales tell of morals and happiness and originality succeeding over prejudice and Disney/ Pixar still knows how to deliver.<br/><br/>Animation-wise, Ratatouille is a sight to behold. The fur on each rat is as tactile as that on Sully from Monsters Inc. and the liquids on display are gorgeous. Whether sewer water, Parisian streams, or blood red wine, each fluid is rendered with amazing clarity and realism. Even the human characters, something not often attempted by Pixar, are caricatured enough to make them slightly abnormal so that instead of looking at their humanistic flaws, we see them as just other animated creatures in a world of their own. Also, the set pieces are elaborate and highly detailed. The restaurant dining room is fantastically displayed and each swoop through the double doors of the kitchen brings you into a new world beyond the sinks and utensils. Even the underbelly passages of the rats are highly detailed as we go through them fast and furiously while our hero Remy runs to get above ground, going past numerous rooms that are seen through cracksa comically French domestic dispute among them until we get our first glimpse at the grandeur of Paris.<br/><br/>Despite the beautiful graphics and the unobtrusively effective voice-overswhen you find you aren't wondering who is who, you know the acting is successfully integrated into the wholeit is the story that really shines. Bird has culled his imagery from many sources, including a bit of what I feel is Tim Burton for the nemesis food critic Anton Ego who eerily reminded me of Christopher Lee, yet has made everything his own. Remy the rat must fight against his heritage and his very being in order to live his life the way he wants to. There is a lot of comedy involved in getting the human Linguini to become his friend and partner on the journey to culinary perfection, but there is even more heart behind it all. We are treated to some nicely quirky supporting roles, but none are ever put to the forefront in order to overshadow the real stars. While not the ensemble these types of films usually are, our leads are strong and never falter to the point you wish we had more of the others. I accepted the terms of the plot early on and never tired of the journey Brad Bird and company led me on. Pitch-perfect at every turn."
"DICK STEEL","10","6","8","10 August 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Ratatouille
","The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.<br/><br/>One of the rare successful rats in the animated genre is Mickey, but Remy here (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has more character, and with that photo realistic quality to him, will give Mickey a run for his money. It's a class act story about a rat who dreams of being somebody, of wanting to follow that dream in becoming a chef in Paris, and is undeterred by his size, and well, form, even though in any kitchen, the last thing you want is a rat in it. And to realize his dream, he forms a symbiotic friendship with bumbling Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy who just joined the restaurant which Remy's idol, the late renowned chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), founded.<br/><br/>It's a story about the tussle between friendship and family, with the latter providing an added emphasis, and you'll happen to just about find a familiar chord to it. Remember the time when your folks frown upon the friends you keep, and how sometimes, through their good intentions, unwittingly stifle your hopes and desires? Or how family becomes that obstructing stone on the pathway to success, or being taken for granted to provide for greedy, unabashed family and so-called friends? Ratatouille explores these and more, though they're kept veiled and subtle for the narrative to move on, and never provided a dull moment for kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>Pixar's animation continues to astound, and provide inspiration to the many 3D animators out there - they have always set new benchmarks for others to follow, and I think they're on top of their game with the excellent animated portrayal of Paris, the kitchen, and of course, the rats, with that touch of photo realistic quality to it all, which does wonders to the food presented. Amongst the food, I like the crusty breads best - you can almost feel the texture, and the rustling sound is just to die for. And the cheese, you can just feel it melt in your mouth. Mmm mmm!<br/><br/>The story's adversaries might be familiar - a mean boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and a mightier- than-though food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), but it's the latter, despite his shorter screen time, that does its best to chill, and it was such an obvious jab with making him English. The comedy's here top notch, not necessarily relying solely on slapstick to bring on the laughs, but possessing many sly moments throughout as you root for little Remy and his escapades, less so for Linguini though, who comes off as that perfect loser in life.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a perfectly delicious offering worthy of that Pixar stamp, and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser. I'm not sure why the delay in getting it released here, and having to suffer watching poor quality animation along the way. But the wait is well worth it, and I bet everyone will be pleasantly surprised indeed, with all the ingredients coming together for that wonderful presentation, that tastes and looks ju st wonderful. Despite the overkill of trailers, pre-screening warnings to turn off your mobile phones, etc, continue to put your trust in that little rat Remy, and savour what Ratatouille has to offer. No regrets - highly recommended, and another contender for my top movie of the year listing.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is preceded by the trailer for the next Pixar movie Wall-E, and a short Pixar featurette titled Lifted, about two aliens and one of their attempts in passing the Alien Abduction course. Stay throughout the animated end credits for a little coda at the end."

","Its easy to see how this story came about. Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: ""Lifting."" It features a novice ""animator"" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.<br/><br/>Count on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.<br/><br/>In this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by ""the critic."" So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.<br/><br/>It appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how ""Ted's law"" is followed: the distance between the ""real"" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the ""living cartoon"" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.<br/><br/>So these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.<br/><br/>One of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)<br/><br/>You can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.<br/><br/>But there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.<br/><br/>There's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.<br/><br/>The credits of this movie ostentatiously say that """"Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film."" You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.<br/><br/>Its a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.<br/><br/>One character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. <br/><br/>These folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Ratatouille, the new Disney/Pixar CGI animation film currently sweeping the cinema circuit around the globe. Pixar known for so many CGI animation classics manages to keep churning out winner after winner, and here with Ratatouille they manage to hit a home run, scratch that... a grand slam.<br/><br/>The story is not only funny, but also touching in that it reminds to never forget about the people who helped you get where you are and that family whether related or not is important.<br/><br/>The main premise is about a rat named Remy whom has the gift to cook. A connoisseur of fine food, Remy manges to help a bumbling garbage boy with no self confidence become the talk of Paris by using him as his personal mechanism to prepare Paris' finest cuisine. However Remy has a dilemma, now that he has risen to stardom, he also has his family who tries to bring him back to the colony because of their distrust for humans, and once Remy's human robot begins to let the fame and fortune go to his head, it becomes a matter of personal resentment he himself must overcome given he is the main cause of the problem, and also the source of the solution.<br/><br/>Out to get Remy is the current head chef of the famous Gusteau's, Gusteau's once Paris' famed 5 star restaurant, has now become a 3 star tourist attraction because a snobbish food critic feels the food served is not even good enough for peasants. Once word of the fine food hits the papers the critic himself has to find out how Gusteau's made this triumphant comeback.<br/><br/>Ratatouille has tons of laughs, excitement and mayhem. The jokes are truly and mainly adult oriented with a sprinkle of moral lesson mixed in for the kiddies. Although G-rated Ratatouille does go onto to be a bit racy at times, but really it is having fun poking fun at the French Culture without insulting the legacy.<br/><br/>Director brad Bird, best known for his hit The Incredibles manages to bring the element of family and trust front and center while engaging the audience in one of the most entertaining animated films since The Lion King. Ratatouille shines as Pixars greatest achievement from beginning to end, and is worth double the admission price for the story alone.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to say this isn't Pixars finest film yet.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"jamesnicolay","10","7","10","22 July 2007"," The best animated film ever...
","To describe Ratatouille as the best animated film ever made is still an understatement. It is a topnotch achievement--the chef d'oeuvres amidst a world of hamburgers and fries.<br/><br/>The advanced screening of the latest collaboration of Disney and Pixar, directed by the ingenious Brad Bird, whose previous works were never disappointing (The Iron Giant and The Incredibles), was probably most anticipated by some Filipino viewers who are aware of the increasing popularity and immense critical acclaim of the Ratatouille. To paraphrase a critic, it was even hailed as the ""prophet who spreads and embodies the new age of the world of animation."" As much as I wanted to digress back then, I admit that I was giddy and excited to witness what the fuss is all about. As soon as I heard that there was a two-day advanced screening of Ratatouille, I told myself that I had to see it by hook or by crook.<br/><br/>I went inside the theater with extremely high expectations. I was blown away--the film did not disappoint--and the critics were right. BUT more than that, watching Ratatouille is a cinematic experience--I left the cinema shivering and in awe. The last time I had the same experience was with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, the Oscar best picture last year. I won't be surprised if this--yes, animated film--gets the same honor next year. <br/><br/>The quality of Ratatouille's animation can be compared without embarrassment to modern paintings or visual art compositions. The texture and the colors of Paris juxtaposed with the vivid outlines of the furs of the rats--combine these with excellent camera movements that follow the world of a rat adjacent to the oh-so-romantic alleys and lights of Paris--these unlikely combinations are beautifully illustrated that the audience is easily enchanted-- transported into the lovely world of Remy and Linguini: the little rat chef and the simple young man who just wanted to get by after losing his mother.<br/><br/>The story is focused primarily on Remy, gifted with an extraordinary sense of smell which eventually developed into his keenness and sensitivity to food. That's not a problem at all if he were perfectly a normal human being--Remy is a rat, one of the icky rodents that survive in packs, stealing food, rummaging through your garbage, causing disease and infections. He feels terribly odd about his special gift, often finding himself at the kitchen of human beings, experimenting his own cooking. After a series of unfortunate events, he finds himself lost and away from his family in the sewers--luckily, these sewers are in Paris, practically a food paradise for food enthusiasts. Eventually, he meets Linguini, a recently orphaned young man who turns up at the restaurant of a former famous chef named Gusteau, who happens to be a TV chef idol of Remy during the times he snuck out to the house of humans to get the spices he needed for his cooking. Unlike Remy, Linguini's knowledge of cuisine and food is close to nothing. After being assigned as a garbage boy in the restaurant, at one time, without thinking, he spoiled a soup being prepared for the restaurant's customers. Remy intervenes and saves the soup, which will turn out to be a big sensation soon. The rat is discovered by the young man, the head chef discovers the rat and orders the young man to get rid of the rat. Of course, Linguini cannot get rid of the rat because he needs to know how the rat cooked the sensational soup. So he decides to save the rat and the soup and eventually, everybody's saved. Though that's just the basic premise of the story.<br/><br/>The plot is solid, mixing a dash of vintage Disney archetypical hero in Remy (who reminds us of other Disney heroes who just think of themselves as different, who want to go out there, somewhere else where they will be more understood and where they are meant for greater things) and the Pixar's archetypal hero in Linguini, whose real heroism is found lingering among his inner values and natural kindness. But more than this, watching Ratatouille feels like reading a favorite bedtime story for people across all ages.<br/><br/>What really amazes me the most is the story's utter simplicity which exceptionally utilizes and combines realism and fantasy in the lovely world of Remy and Linguini. <br/><br/>The dialogue is extremely witty, the humor is not forced and most of the times delivered with taste.<br/><br/>I can't wait for a second, a third, a fourth helping of Ratatouille. Yes, an original DVD will definitely be worth the entertainment feast that this luscious film offers."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","8","8","12","6 October 2007"," The film that launched a thousand rats
","""Ratatouille"", to pick a culinary metaphor, is, like the curate's egg, excellent... in parts. That is, parts of it are excellent, some parts grate, and a good deal of it is good without being especially outstanding. The film has the disarming forethought to get its riposte against criticism in first, in the person of the critic Anton Ego.<br/><br/>But my feelings about this picture are on the whole approbatory, while undoubtedly mixed. I didn't like it as much as ""The Incredibles"", and, thinking back, I wonder how much of that stems from Pixar being simply less comfortable out of the familiar territory of the American suburbs. A good deal of what grated on me was the perceived Americanisms, from the gun-toting granny to the unsubtle nature of the self-help message (and just what is a 'patootie' or a 'burrito' anyway? 'Corn dog' was at least explained...) The use of accents is also somewhat scattershot: the villains (inevitably) are played by English actors, the rat-heroes (inevitably) are Americans, while the one female speaking role is played with a comedy French accent -- as if the characters were not all (presumably) talking French.<br/><br/>Pixar's animators have obviously spent a lot of time studying rats, as well as -- I would guess -- researching the professional kitchen. These aren't your classic Disney characters with gloved hands, human bodies, and a token animal head and tail. No-one except the owners of pet rats will care that the depiction massively downplays the importance (and size) of the rats' tails and whiskers: a rat's tail is as long as his body and as strong as an extra limb, while he doesn't so much sniff at things as feel them with his impressive 270-degree array of whiskers. My only other caveat would be that the rats in the film seem to spend an awful lot of their time with ears laid back: a real rat's ears are swivelling radar-dishes, high and round and on the alert, and relocating them for most of the shots to a more 'human' position, low down on the head, has a rather odd effect on the characters' expression.<br/><br/>But since I for one am a rat owner, I appreciated the way that Pixar have captured their heels-up scamper and their funny trundling walk, their habit of carrying things with their chins raised, their athletic climbing abilities and above all their superb sense of smell; if anyone could design a new dish for a restaurant simply by sniffing it, it would undoubtedly be a rat! I also appreciated the fact that the rats in this story can't actually talk to the humans -- in fact, there's one shot towards the beginning that makes it plain that all they hear is squeaking. This isn't, as it might have been, the story of a boy who can magically converse with animals; rats and humans have to learn to communicate without words. (It's a tribute to the plot that it didn't even occur to me until after the film was over that it was in any way odd that the rats, on the other hand, could not only understand but read every word the humans used!) The process by which Remy discovers that he can remote-control Linguini is, I suppose, ridiculous in a real-life context, but seemed to make sense at the time...<br/><br/>Plot-wise, I found the start of the film fairly slow, with all the emotional depth of your average Mickey Mouse, though I did like the concept of the rats' having an organised escape plan. The main picture was preceded by a brief short centred around the quintessential US theme of alien abduction, which had the young audience in stitches but which I'm afraid I failed to find funny in the least -- slapstick cruelties were never my thing -- and this may have jaundiced me.<br/><br/>Things looked up once Remy reached Paris, although I found the heavy moral emphasis on the theft of a crumb absurd from a rodent view: how else can a rat eat? Plough his own fields, sow his own wheat, set up his own bakery? In the context of the rest of the story, ""Don't foul your own nest"" might have been more apt than ""Thou shalt not steal"".<br/><br/>The turn of events by which Remy becomes an undercover cook is effective, funny and strangely plausible, and from this point the film's quality remains fairly consistent throughout. One bonus is that there is no quasi-obligatory zany sidekick character; the nearest this film comes is in the shape of Remy's brother, and he doesn't get much screen time. But then generally speaking I didn't care much for the 'family' scenes. They mostly seemed to consist of spelling out moral messages in letters a yard high, plus the usual father-son bond fixation.<br/><br/>Towards the end the film makes some brave choices, and it is at this point that it rises into the category of 'excellent' and gains some actual emotional depth. It doesn't stop with the fairy-tale ending of the rightful heir, nor yet with the victory over the ogre. The name of the film turns out to be highly significant after all, and our heroes are rewarded not by a pinnacle of magic inheritance, but with fruits of their own earning. A warning: there are some scenes at this point that may be genuinely distressing to young children... as opposed to the cartoon violence of the opening, at which they merely roared with laughter...<br/><br/>The pictures of dead rats -- far more realistic than the cartoon-type characters -- I myself found very hard to bear because one of my own pets had died the previous day; the half-open mouth and fragile, curled limbs were the last I'd seen of her, too. I didn't weep when I buried her body, but there were several places during this film about rats when I missed her horribly. Which is, I suppose, a salute to its success."

","In the country of France, the rat Remy has accurate taste and smell, and he worships the chef Auguste Gusteau. People uses to say that the best food in the world is in Paris, more precisely in Gusteau's, and Remy dreams on becoming a chef. On the same day that his idol dies after reading a bad review of the arrogant critic Anton Ego, Remy gets lost from the clan of his father in the sewers and ends in Paris in front of the famous restaurant. Remy does not resist and goes to the kitchen, improving the soap that is being prepared with ingredients and spices. The clumsy garbage boy Linguini receives the credits for the successful recipe; he is promoted to cook and starts a partnership with the little chef. But the greedy chef Skinner is not happy with the success of Linguini that is jeopardizing his future project for Gusteau's.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is a delightful animation, with a very funny and original story. It is inconceivable to imagine a rat in the fanciest restaurant of Paris; imagine a rat as a prominent chef, having a clan of rats in the kitchen helping him to prepare sophisticated meals for the upper-class of Paris and a harsh critic of restaurants. Only this sequence would be enough to make laugh. But the story has nice characters and good messages about the importance of making a dream come true and creativity in your work, friendship and loyalty. The story has many plot points and the resolution is great. In the end, I loved this animation. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Ratatouille"""
"mstomaso","9","10","16","1 July 2007"," The Rat in the Hat
","Ratatouille is a sweet little film about a Parisian rat with ambitions to become France's top chef, and a young dish-washer who may just be his only hope. The plot takes a number of clever twists and turns and delivers some unpredictable elements, which keep what could have been 'just another Pixar' quite fresh. Setting the film in France, and giving it just a pinch of French absurdist comedy for seasoning was a stroke of brilliance. The voice talent is also quite excellent - especially Ian Holm's ""Chef Skinner"" - who also does a mean Golem impression btw - and Jeanine Garafolo's ""Collette"".<br/><br/>I am generally not a big fan of talking animal movies, though purely animated ones are definitely preferable to those that morph real animals. But Ratatouille even does this very differently - the rats can understand our language, but we don't get theirs. And, other than their very military approach to getting things done, and the lead character's odd cooking talent, they generally behave like rats and have rat motivations.<br/><br/>The movie is fun and funny and, at times, quite heart-warming. The rats are absolutely adorable and even do their own stunts! The human characters, though less sympathetic, are some of Pixar's best! Recommended for family viewing - kids of all ages."
"Hitchcoc","10","4","5","4 May 2019"," Among the Greatest Animated Features
","The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level."

After a slight let down in 2006 with a story about race cars,(although beautifully animated (as always)) - a poor subject matter choice for a good story, Pixar are back on track with this stunning animation. I didn't think the captivating storytelling that was Toy Story could be topped; but it has been done with this, the chef-d'oeuvre from Brad Bird. <br/><br/>The initial concept alone of a rat wanting to work in a restaurant as a cook is pure gold, and it only gets better. The Parisian world's artistic detail, subtle references, expert animation, charming characters, and wonderful story make this a definite must see for everyone.<br/><br/>Praise the almighty Pixar!"

","I agree with the other reviewers here who said Ratatouille is by far Pixar's best to date: I adore this movie. It is brilliant, and it does indeed transcend age brackets. I'm a huge Pixar fan as things stand, and Ratatouille only confirmed this. I do hope they keep this up; the Pixar crew has raised the bar once again, setting higher and higher standards for themselves as they go along! What an admirable enterprise this is, when so many other movie makers repeat themselves in tired ways ... Ratatouille rocks! Do not miss this movie on any account. I don't normally rave about movies and have never written a review here either ... I regard it as my business to create excellent scripts, that does not actually mean I'm a huge movie goer.

I was extremely pleased with what I saw. The animation was great...the characters were cute. (What can I say? I have a fondness for rats, I had a pat rat myself when I was younger). It almost had an ""American Tail"" feel at the beginning. Delightful to watch, and some really funny parts in it.

But after the good words from the critics, I warmed up to the idea, but was skeptical.<br/><br/>So with my dad, I saw the movie, and boy, were my first thoughts wrong! The animation was spectacular. Some recent CGI films are just plain crud (I want to keep my review clean) in their animation. But this movie, each little bit of the animation was so professionally done. The food looked good enough to eat and the views of Paris were perfect! The acting was great too. Patton Oswalt did a spectacular job with Remy and Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego was one good decision! As for the rest of actors, they did a good job too! It's just that Patton Oswalt and Peter O'Toole stood out the most.<br/><br/>So, um, see this movie!

","Brad Bird really moved me when I saw The Iron Giant, a film I didn't want to see at the time. That little animated feature is simply beautiful and touching. Ratatouille takes that level of emotion to another point. Way higher. Don't think kids won't get it. They're not stupid. I remember going to the movies with my parents (they took me to Abel Gance's Napoleon) and being fascinated by the whole thing, even if I didn't understand the whole idea. This is not a comedy. There are some laughs and everything, but it's something more intelligent and dramatic. It's an astounding and complex film about longing for a different life and trying your own talents. About not to be content with the way things are and to go and challenge everything. Even if you end up empty-handed. Gorgeous animation, great script, wonderful characters.

I had my eyes wet all over the film, not by nostalgia or whatever, but its brilliance amazed me so much I felt like in heaven... It was a feast to the eyes, those colors and those views were amazing, perfect, flawless... Best in animation ever seen, not even the colorful Pacific Reef in Finding Nemo could beat the elegance and perfection of Paris in Ratatouille. The characters, oh the characters! There were so many! But the difference with so many movies was the REALITY of them, I loved those to love, and hated those to hate! They were so multi-dimensional! The story, sooooo perfect! I must say, there are some films that are stressing with so much problems and conflicts with characters that last for the whole film, but in Ratatouille every problem was solved quickly so i enjoyed EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of it!!! The action was also incredible! I wanted to run along with Remy, very impressive. To finish, the conclusion was incredible! I can remember when the critic tells the chef to surprise him, I could see myself telling that to Disney Pixar, and they absolutely followed my wishes! They really really surprised me!!

","Disney did a great job capturing the feel of Paris, the animation is beautiful, and I loved the music. That being said...<br/><br/>Disney has been beating us over the head with ""self realization/being true to oneself"" movies for years. The formula for this one is no different. The difference is many of Ratatouille's predecessor's have actually been entertaining. This wasn't.<br/><br/>The protagonist in this movie is a rat named Remy. He's a gifted cook who grapples over following his cooking aspirations and being true to his little rat roots. He's likable enough, but neither interesting nor humorous. The human protagonist of the movie is named Linguini. He is, in a word, a moron. I disliked him in the beginning of the movie. I disliked him at the end of the movie. The physical comedy they try to pull-off in the kitchen sequences (when Remy first tries to control Linguini's movements), pay a nod to a physical comedy genius: Goofy. Unfortunately, Goofy is lovable. Linguini is not. The comedy fell flat.<br/><br/>Before the middle of the movie I'm completely bored (and so are my kids). There's legality and DNA conversation, too much Linguini, not enough characters who are interesting.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie is choppy and it's hard to follow the action. I lost all sense of time, with more than one time-passing sequence occurring. It seems the first 45 minutes of the movie is just filler, building up to something happening. -And believe me, after 45 minutes you're ready for something (ANYTHING) to happen.<br/><br/>***There is one transcendent moment in this movie; the reason for the three stars I gave it. It's a wonderful scene that is poignant and full of truth: the scene where Ego (who is the most interesting character in this movie) first tastes the ratatouille. I laughed out loud, as did most of the adults in the audience. The irony was that none of the children in the audience got it...because they are children! They are currently IN CHILDHOOD! Odd that the only moment of humor in this dismal little movie was directed at the adults.*** <br/><br/>In conclusion, the major themes of this movie are be true to yourself, even an incompetent loser can still succeed if he rides the coattails of those around him, and don't steal. Deception, using those you love for your own purposes, kidnapping, taking credit for others work...these things are OK; but DON'T STEAL.<br/><br/>Disney needs to get it's marketing and creative department in order and on the same page. It is unclear what audience this movie was intended for: children or adults. It was way too uninteresting for children and way too childish for adults."

And Paris is recreated with Pixar's amazing animation--the chase across the boats on the Seine is particularly stunning. Scenes with cooking and dancing rats are also enjoyable.

The animation and cinematography is amazingly sensitive, not showy at all but instead well motivated, effectively giving the audience a feel of what it's like to be Ratatouille's star, Chef Remy, who just so happens to be a rat.<br/><br/>It is difficult not to be smitten by the range of complex emotions and situations as he is torn between his family and his passion for creating culinary masterpieces in a human world where he is despised in by default.<br/><br/>Just like the movie's fiercest critic, The Grim Eater, it will be close to impossible not to fall in love with this movie. His character provides a pleasantly unexpected but fitting ending with his final review, and what he says is sure to resonate with critics everywhere. It sure hit the food and film critic in me!

Where he finds a restaurant that was once grand and has slipped up when it comes to good food. An ordinary garbage boy messes with a stew in the kitchen, when Remy sees this, he helps him out. Linguini, the garbage boy, accepts Remy and together they create masterpieces and bring the restaurant back up. They must keep it a secret how they create these fantastic foods; but that gets so much harder when people try to find out how he's so talented.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is such a charming Disney/Pixar film, the animation is great, and the story is just terrific. The actors voices were so great and fit the characters well. If you are looking for a film to see this summer, Ratatouille is definitely a recommendation, it's good to know that Pixar is going to keep giving us these great animation films that I know will be considered classics for a very long time.

Despite peer pressure from his (fairly large) family, Remy just cannot accept the fact that he, as a rat, is condemned to eat whatever garbage he can scurry up, and is utterly fascinated by the world of cookery. Fittingly his hero is France's foremost chef, Gusteau. After being chased off their farm home, Remy is separated from his family and ends up in Paris, where Gusteau owns his restaurant (""Gusteau's"", amazingly). There, Remy sets up base and eventually befriends a lowly kitchen hand, named Linguini. Together, they set out to change the face of ""Gusteau's"" for ever.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is quite simple. Essentially it states that you can succeed, providing you have the talent and the tenacity to stick by your dream. <br/><br/>When I went to see Ratatuille, I went in high hopes. Brad Bird, with ""The Incredibles"" under his belt, sets the bar high in his second computer animated movie, and he delivers the goods bar-none. Frankly it is among the best animated movies ever to come from the US. The story is very charming and heartwarming. And while the film is very funny, it uses a variety of comedic elements ranging from subtle humor to outright slapstick, there is an element of drama and tension ensuring that viewers of all ages will be kept entertained. The dialog is witty and absorbing, the story will provide some twists and the animation is beautifully executed. Even the supporting ""cast"" are lovingly portrayed (I especially liked the chef who once ""killed a man with his thumb"") adding to the dept of the narrative. The voice acting is done very well in general. O'Toole, portraying the menacing food critic Anton Ego, and Ian Holm as Skinner, the choleric Head Chef, provide for the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>This film, very much like the ""Incredibles"", is not specifically aimed at young viewers. It provides a mature tone adding to the movie's credibility, which is good, since it will keep parents from falling asleep while their kids are having a good time. Actually, falling asleep will be the last thing on the viewer's mind as Bird again masterfully showcases a piece of cinema, in which the captivating story comes first, and the animation a distant second. <br/><br/>Take your kids, take your spouse/girlfriend, take you neighbors, but go watch this film. And visit a nice restaurant after that. Bon Appetit"
"timayd","10","13","24","17 June 2007"," Pixar maintains its spot in the industry with another winner
","Very Minor Spoilers Ratatouille is the next film from acclaimed director Brad Bird, with The Iron Giant and another praised Pixar film already on his resume he clearly had a lot to live up to in Ratatouille. Like The Incredibles Bird came up with the story and then penned the screenplay, if the film failed it would be put squarely on Bird, after all the plot seems ludicrous a Rat who is a gourmet and an excellent chef, the film could have easily fallen on its face with a less competent director but Bird crafts it masterfully and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>Lets start with something that seems obvious the animation, its Pixar of course would it be anything less then perfection, and of course it is not. However it is hard to gauge just how good it is without seeing the movie. When it is raining (which oddly enough happens a lot) every hair on the rats will stand up and appear just like it should. Pixar obviously has an animated look in their animation, its not the eerily realistic animation of the Polar Express and soon Beowulf, you know at all times some one didn't go out and film a rat colony, but where Pixar really gets it is in the detail put into every shot so the viewer is looking up in awe at the screen. Which will happen in the pan outs on Paris itself with the lights and famous landmarks it is truly beautiful.<br/><br/>Even though Ratatouille looks amazing even for a Pixar film that isn't enough the story has to be good and in this movie it certainly was. The story begins with of course Remy, who introduces himself dubiously as a rat with a highly defined Pallet, who is reduced to be the poison checker for the rat colony, through some misadventures they are forced to leave the house they currently inhabited and move to the big city. Remy eventually finds out he was not far away from his ""mentors"" resteraunt Gusteau's. When Remy see the garbage boy Linguini mess up the soup he feels the urge to fix it, which he does until he is caught and Linguini is forced to dispose of him, however Remy's soup is a hit and Linguini is given the praise, realizing he can not make it again he decides to keep Remy to help him cook. Throughout the rest of the movie they face different challenges with a crazy head chef and the frightening critic Anton Ego.<br/><br/>The voice work in Ratatouille is also exceptional. When I pass by a Rat now, I'll probably expect to hear Patton Oswalt's voice, though maybe a little higher pitched. Lou Ramono who never has had a role this big (he was Dash's teacher in The Incredibles) is in fact incredible. Also have to give props to John Ratzenbeger to still have his trademark voice even with a french accent. Also I say give Peter O'Toole the Oscar for this, his voice is pitch perfect for the most feared critic in all of Paris Anton Ego.<br/><br/>So where does this land in terms of Pixar, it is much better than last years disappointing entry in Cars and 1998's A Bug's Life. Narrowing it down from here however is much harder all of the rest are masterful films that all deserve awards, but I would put it past Nemo and Monster's Inc. and The Incredibles. With that only the original franchise is left the original Pixar and the sequel that managed to be just as good. It would be naive to proclaim Ratatouille the best Pixar ever while only seeing it once, so far now I'll make my favorite Pixar a three way tie.<br/><br/>Before the Review ends however I must mention one last thing, with Pixar movies we always get a short film at the beginning. Some times there only OK (The Incredibles Boundin') and sometimes there better than the movie itself (Cars' One Man Band). Lifted is the one shown with Ratatouille and it is an excellent short film, probably my favorite though I have seen some of them in a while.<br/><br/>A+<br/><br/>Lifted:A"

"waylonho","10","2","2","13 October 2018"," Pastably The Best Animated Movie Ever
","Fully animated film projects were once considered childish and appropriate only for kids. Cartoons would never have the same meaning and plot as live action films. However, in recent years, producers have proven this belief to be incorrect, elevating the standards of animated films and dispelling the rumor that movies without real cameras were inferior. Now, graphic designers and artists compose widely popular projects that receive widespread praise. However, as there is competition in every industry, the movie industry is largely based on critics and reviews. There are disagreements as to which movies are better than others. Disney's ""Ratatouille"" stands as the best animated movie ever created, perfectly utilizing relatable struggles of everyday life, rocky relationships, and the power of food in order to show human consideration and compassion for others.
 Ratatouille is the story of a rat who helps a human find his purpose and during that process, learns about himself too. The movie is based in the beautiful country of France, where food is a big part of their culture. However, in the beginning, the movie starts out completely differently, with Remy, the rat, running in the rain to an old lady's house. Remy and his family are stealing food, but when the old lady finds out, she tries to kill them all. This leads the crowd to panic and run down a drain, but as Remy is the last of his entire family to go down the drain, Remy reaches a fork in the piping system. Here, he's forced to choose a path, and when it turns out to be the other path his family went down, he loses everybody he counted on and is left by himself. Eventually, he crawls through the sewer system and finds himself on a rooftop above Paris. Amazed, he starts roaming the city, eventually meeting Linguini, the human main character. Linguini works for a restaurant but can't cook, and Remy is a rat who can cook. Together, they come up with a hair pulling control system where they quickly receive praise (and trouble) around the kitchen. The restaurant, after getting a bad review from a critic, is expecting another highly esteemed critic and depends on Linguini's incredible dishes. However, they don't know that there's a rat in his hat cooking for him, and Linguini is still a shy, insecure cook who was initially hired to be a garbage boy. This entire adventure goes through ups and downs as Linguini's and Remy's friendship develops. The pair discover their motivations, passions, and how they need to work together despite being different species.
Compared to all over movies, ""Ratatouille"" builds up the most relatable main characters despite one not even being a human. Remy, the rat, is able to show a completely different life while still having human emotions and feelings. Alfredo Linguini is the new, cheaply paid employee who can't seem to find any significance to his daily life. Both of these characters have personalities that revolve around conflicts we all have encountered. In the beginning of the movie, Remy and his family are forced to steal food, and when he is separated from them due to escaping down a drain, he's completely lost. Remy doesn't know who he is, and nobody can help him except himself. This struggle of self identity and the idea dealing with the unknown hits home for all of us. Linguini, after being hired as a garbage boy, gets into a mishap with the owner of the restaurant and is constantly picked on for not being anything more than his job. His life is miserable and he lives without much meaning, which we've all gone through at some point. The struggle, confusion, and fear displayed by both main characters connects with the audience deep down, bringing an all too familiar sentimental feeling to everyone in the theater. 
 Some say that, despite its high reviews, ""Ratatouille"" is a weak attempt by Disney to use European values for interest and money. They say that the ""French"" culture of Ratatouille is filled with American workers with awful examples of cliche French language. Others say that the whole idea of having rats interact with humans in a plot about food is simply disgusting. However, if you look closer, you'll see that Disney really pushed the French culture aspect in the movie, molding the setting, side characters, and streets like something out of France. In fact, when drawing the food animations, the production crew consulted actual French chefs. Also, as disgusting rats are, the producers used this to show how animals can have good values too. They can help humans, and simply seeing animals as dirty inferiors isn't right.
When the movie first came out, I immediately loved it. There's charm, excitement, weirdness, comfort, and relatability in the movie. The lessons taken from the scenes are down to earth, important lessons that everybody should know, and just the idea of having a meaningful dialogue with a rat in it is incredible. When the producers were creating the movie, they blended French culture with a plot that revolved around French cuisine. Bottom line, I believe that everybody should see ""Ratatouille"" because it's unique plot and animation provides such a range of emotions that only a few other animated films have accomplished. No matter your age, you can find humor, a good cry, a heartwarming message, and everything else from the movie. ""Ratatouille"" is one of the best animated movies ever, and it's a masterpiece of cinema history."
"MihaiSorinToma","10","2","2","5 October 2018"," Animation masterpiece
","Remy, an apparently ordinary rat who lives with his pack in a remote house, discovers that he has an extraordinary gift. He is able to smell all flavors and poisons, thus becoming very useful for his kind, but this new ability also comes with a lot of curiosity regarding food and cooking. This curiosity, bound to get him in trouble, ultimately sends him to Paris where it was thought that anybody can cook. There, he teams up with a very odd human with a ""special"" life of his own, in an attempt to prove his extraordinary abilities. He has a lot of work to do and many obstacles to overcome but his determination and skill will help him in many difficult situations.<br/><br/>It's a superb animation which presents a beautiful, interesting and suspenseful life story which ultimately ends with style besides all problems the main characters have to face. It's beautifully animated, it has everything you can want from a movie, drama, suspense, romance and action while keeping your attention and interest all the time. Simply put, it's an animation masterpiece and a very good movie which I warmly recommend to anyone looking for a good time. Simply brilliant!"
"powermandan","10","2","2","18 September 2018"," Magic. Plain and Simple.
","The critically acclaimed Disney animated film by Brad Bird has more humanity and originality than most films of the 2000s. It may be led by a rat and hundreds of other rats in his colony, but do not let that fool you into thinking this is a silly movie for boys who like gross things. If you are unappreciative of this, then you do not know much about the art of cinema.<br/><br/>Patton Oswalt is pretty funny in general. He provides the voice of the star of this picture: a rat named Remy. His family lives in the country where he peaks into a house and gets inspired by the world's greatest chef, Auguste Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) to become a chef himself. Remy's perseverance causes him to become an expert on making excellent food. But he's a three-inch rat. What could he do? This sounds like a very unoriginal underdog story. Just stay tuned for the story to unfold.<br/><br/>The owner of the house blasts the rats which causes Remy to get separated from his family and wind up across from Gusteau's restaurant. Remy was in Paris the whole time but never even knew it. Now that he is in the city, he can be close to he idol's work. Gusteau recently passed away and mean food critic Anton Ego (one of Peter O'Toole's last performances) has made the restaurant lose its prestige. Gusteau has been appearing to Remy as his conscious and motivator.<br/><br/>Imagine the most elegant and fancy restaurant you can. An appetizer the size of your fist costing over $100. That is this restaurant. Sure there are other animated films better looking than this, but the overall value of the look should not be overlooked. Once we see it, we fall in love and want to go there ourselves.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a useless janitor at the joint and total geek named Linguini (like the food) sees Remy and a bond between the two is formed. Although they speak different languages, Remy gets on Linguini and pulls on his hair which causes his body parts to move as a reflex. Linguini is now Remy's puppet. Back at the restaurant, Remy hides in Linguini's hat, puppeteers around and great dishes come about. Linguini doesn't know what he's doing, it is all in the rat. Head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) is really mean and tries to find the secret behind this wimp's success.<br/><br/>'Ratatouille' is a relatable story about passion. We feel Remy's love for cooking as much as he does. In fact, the entire food aspect of this is rubbed off onto us. In the duration of the film, we feel like cooking is the best job in the world. Job well done.<br/><br/>It is also one of the very few animated movies where the peril and action is limited. The biggest scene of danger is near the beginning when the old lady empties her shotgun on Remy's clan. The biggest obstacle is understanding. Who is going to believe that Linguini is being controlled by a rat? How will Ego find the food that Remy creates? These gentle and modest things are handled with such care and precision so that it stands out among other recent Pixar films.<br/><br/>And, of course, the animation is excellent. The real looking rats and fancy setting do not clash. It is simply perfect.<br/><br/>One thing that gets overlooked is the music by Michael Giacchino. He is one of the best music guys working in film today and he has made his best soundtrack in this film.<br/><br/>'Ratatouille' is a delicate, delectable piece of cinema to forever be cherished.<br/><br/>4/4"

I knew within a minute or so that this movie was going to be superb. I thought Ray Liotta's casting as 'The Little Chef' was perfect.<br/><br/>Also liked Brian Dennehy as the voice of Django.<br/><br/>The likes of this and Toy Story had such a positive an effect on me, I make a point of seeking out any new Pixar Titles."

","I very rarely have any sort of major appreciation for computer graphics even though they are a high and masterful achievement. The graphics are wonderful, but that's not why you should see this movie. The dialogue is perfect and moving, yes, to the point of tearing up your eyes. It's clever and sweet. The critic in this film (voiced by Peter O'Toole, no less) is a wonderfully hysterical as the archetypal villain. All the characters will charm you and make you laugh and cry with them. It is VERY poetic, without being convoluted, too deep, or forgetting it's a family movie. Definitely the best I've seen from pixar or Disney in an extremely long time... probably since Aladdin. Anyway, go see this one quick."

"victor-paereli","3","23","50","22 October 2007"," Botched up opportunity
","Pixar took a great theme - cooking - and botched it up. There is so little film work done on this subject, less funny work, that one would have thought of a kitchen-based cartoon as a, well... pot of ideas.<br/><br/>Well, they did it, didn't they? The movie starts with a rat learning of the pleasures of good food and running into the dilemma of ""creating vs stealing"". The plot is vague about what exactly makes him a gourmand and how creating food is ethically counterpoised to stealing it (after all, as a rat you still can't get away from stealing the ingredients for your cooking), but we are presenting with both as facts. After a bizarre incident involving a gun-toting granny and an underground sewer pipe he gets separated from the rest of the colony and relocated to Paris, where he takes refuge in a restaurant, previously owned by a now-dead chef, whose ghost is haunting him. He also runs into a kid of little apparent intelligence, who has no clue and no interest in cooking, and whose ambitions are pretty much limited to keeping his job sweeping the kitchen floor. The rat eventually manipulates the kid (through a combination of reflex hair-pulling and blackmailing) to create the best soup ever. The rest of the movie, the rat - through the zombie kid - is battling against the evil manager, ugly food critics, and the rat colony that resurfaces in Paris, to reach culinary stardom.<br/><br/>Theme: Cooking is presented as some kind of magic with boolean outcomes: a little less marjoram - disaster, a little more - culinary sensation. Anyone able enough make scrambled eggs will tell you that this nonsense neither helps add realism to a movie centered on a very realistic subject, nor presents cooking as a fun theme.<br/><br/>Plot: Confused at best. Stupid at worst - talk about zombying the kid by pulling his hair. The love affair between the kid and the assistant chef girl is ludicrous - neither was even looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Character development: Poor. At the end of the movie we are left with a rat who likes cooking, and a host of other characters about whom we know absolutely nothing other that some are ""good"", some are ""bad"" and some are neither. Critically for a cartoon, none of them is funny.<br/><br/>Language: ""Little chef""??? Who came up with this? The French accent imitation is the worst of so many a French-inspired movies.<br/><br/>Animation: Quite good, but what is animation alone in a movie that lacks in so many other respects? The movie earns a generous ""3"".<br/><br/>In the future, how about coming up with a decent plot and hiring a bunch of French comedy actors who actually know stuff about cooking? Gerard Depardieu (he just came up with a cook book of his own) or perhaps Jean Reno?"
"toclement","1","54","135","7 September 2007"," 85th best movie of all time? Gimme a break...
","Geez, IMDb has become incredibly unreliable. There used to be a time that a high rating for a movie meant something. Nowadays it's pretty much standard fare for anything that's popular. This movie, while I can see why many would like it, is average at best. Too many people with undiscerning taste coming in here and giving 10s to every movie they watch.<br/><br/>As fort he movie: Predictable, formulaic American/Hollywood approach to animation. Not very funny either (I think I gave a minor chuckle once). I'd give it a 3 or 4, but given all the 10s given by people who probably don't even watch many movies outside the Hollywood establishment.<br/><br/>Oh a cute little rat! He acts like people! He talks! He has emotion! He loves his family! Give that baby a 10! And let's give American accents to all the main characters, so that the movie doesn't feel like it's really set in France."
"Mozz_Mendez","9","7","12","30 June 2007"," Should be an Easy BEST PICTURE nominee
","I'm going to keep this short. Back in 1991 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences broke new ground by nominating Disney's Beauty and the Beast for Best Picture of the year. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated films of all time.<br/><br/>Later to get around not having to nominate Animated movies in the Best Picture category; the academy drew up the Best Animated Picture Category. And that's great, because it allows them to spotlight the great Animated Pictures of the year.<br/><br/>Still, just as movies that are nominated for Best Foreign Film are also eligible for Best Picture nominations; I see no reason that Ratatouille would not be running in both categories at next years awards.<br/><br/>It's that good! No, I'm not going to say it's that good; I'm going to say it's better than that. It is the best movie I have seen this year, it may be the best movie I will see all year. It not only pulls at your heart strings and makes your eyes bulge out in absolute wonder. It also has one of the best crafted stories I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood always forget the importance of a great story and a well crafted screenplay? I think they do it on purpose, so when movies like this come out, you wonder ""So this is what good story telling is!"" The writing in this film is so good, I want to give it the Oscar, The Tony, The Pulitzer Prize and all other writing awards it is completely ineligible for, just because the movie is a reminder of what all movies could be, given the proper time to have the tightest story, and best screenplay possible.<br/><br/>I'm definitely going to see it again, I'm going to tell everyone I know to go see, and honestly, I can't wait till the DVD comes out, and best of all...

I never imagined I would be convinced to eat (or at least find edible) food created by a rat. Remy is gorgeous and the city of Paris is breathtaking. Linguini and all the other characters are just truly marvelous, especially Anton Ego. His monologue at the end of the film, might just be one of the greatest voice performances in CGI animation history. By far the best animated movie of the year, and pretty much one of the best films of the year. Just shows that Pixar Animation Studios is simply the MVP at this game. This films goes into the books.

","Another spectacular entry from Pixar... and Brad Bird is 3 for 3 in my book. From a foodie point of view, they hit exactly upon the joy and excitement of invention and creation in a kitchen... not to mention the pure energy and atmosphere of a busy restaurant. <br/><br/>One of Bird's beliefs is that animation does not necessarily equal children's entertainment, and this is true here... I don't think Ratatouille is going to be the breakout children's movie that The Incredibles was. Don't get me wrong; I think kids will enjoy themselves. The pace is brisk and the humor continual. But there are so many layers to experience here... this movie will definitely bear up well through repeated viewings.<br/><br/>The visuals are tremendous, especially the views of a rat running through walls and underground. The music was also memorable, although there's no Randy Newman-ish lyrics here. <br/><br/>I recognized the name John Gilkey in the credits, and indeed the loose-limbed flailing of the young chef is reminiscent of Gilkey's physical comedy... although a 100% Animation disclaimer at the end of the movie stated that no motion capture was used. Still, i would have loved to be a fly on the wall the day Gilkey was modeling movement for Pixar's animators! (Gilkey was the lead comic figure in Cirque du Soleil's Qidam)<br/><br/>Even if you aren't a Francophile or foodie, you will surely enjoy this delectable morsel of film-making and storytelling. But if you dabble in the culinary arts, your experience will be all the better. Or perhaps you too might become inspired to ""get fancy with the spices."""

","I saw this film on June 15th, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>Pixar has an incredible streak of commercial and artistic animation successes. This is their 8th in a row, and their riskiest. Toys and cars and bugs and fish and monsters and superheroes are easier to make endearing than a RAT. But, PIXAR pulls it off.<br/><br/>This is a story of a French rat, Remy, who dreams to be more. Instead of eating garbage like his family and friends, he aspires to create great food like his hero Gusteau. Gusteau is a famous chef and cooking writer and television cooking star and restaurant owner. Gusteau's motto is ""Anyone Can Cook."" The bad news is Gusteau dies, but the good news is he comes back as a ghost or a figment of the rat's imagination to aid our rat in his dreams. <br/><br/>The rat arrives at Gusteau's restaurant and uses the body of a lowly garbage boy to follow the rat's instructions and to create great food. The rat even moves in with the garbage boy.<br/><br/>The animation is stunningly good. PIXAR has made the animation more detailed and more nuanced for every one of their succeeding films and this tradition continues. You learn about cooking and your mouth waters throughout the film. The Ratatouille, a French vegetable stew, can be tasted and smelled in the theater. By the way, the ""Rat"" in Ratatouille has nothing to do with a ""rat.""<br/><br/>Remy is inspiring. Here is a character that will not settle on his expected life, but strives for greatness and to add to the world. And he will not give up or be discouraged. The ugly(?) rat becomes beautiful.<br/><br/>FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."

","One of the most wonderful things about a Pixar movie is the sense of discovery. The sense that, no matter how many commercials you've seen, no matter how much you've heard about the plot, you're going to discover hidden layers with each viewing that make the experience more of an event than a movie. Ratatouille fits this description to a tee. I went to the special sneak preview tonight and, honestly, I have not heard an audience this involved in a film since Finding Nemo four years ago and I would be thrilled if this movie found that large of an audience as well, because it certainly deserves it. There is a grace and a beauty to this movie that is present even in the physical comedy sequences. After a summer of sequels, how refreshing to see such a startlingly original story told so artistically with such a high level of humor and warmth. When it opens on June 29th, go see it.

","The best moment for me in this movie came when it was over.This is a boringly bad movie from Disney-Pixar.<br/><br/>A rat named Remy yearns to be a chef and he lives his dream by giving advice to an ungainly dishwasher in a snooty restaurant in Paris.The restaurant becomes the hottest place to eat and the young man becomes the toast of Paris.<br/><br/>Now the animation is top notch,perhaps the best Pixar animation ever but what kills this film is the script.It isn't funny at best and is just plain dull at worst.<br/><br/>I was wanting to like this film.Patton Oswalt,who voiced Remy,is a awfully funny stand-up comedian and I was hoping some of that would be displayed in this film.But it wasn't.You might as well had some Joe from off the street voicing Remy because there was no comedy to be had in this film.Oswalt was stifled by the terrible writing as was all the other people who gave voice to the characters.<br/><br/>I never laughed once during this film and actually don't remember even smiling either.I wasn't alone.Very few folks in the sparse audience found anything to laugh at either.<br/><br/>How this film is getting all these great reviews I haven't a clue.It must be folks who are grooving on the animation and aren't paying attention that the storyline and script are terrible.<br/><br/>If I hadn't been bored to near sleep by this movie I would have gotten up and left before it was over.This movie stinks like bad cheese."
"JaneanC","2","28","67","8 July 2007"," beautiful animation and a few cute moments, but . . .
","Two stars for two reasons to see Ratatouille <br/><br/>1. The animation is really beautiful, particularly the scenes of Paris. <br/><br/>2. The film had a few cute moments (Remy in a jar, the breakfast, the 3 knives in the sleeve, etc.).<br/><br/>Reasons why I was terribly disappointed: <br/><br/>1. Pixar decided to do both cute fantasy rats and to show off their incredible skills by doing ""real"" rats. A cute cartoon rat is enchanting, but the realistic rats swarming, raiding garbage, ravaging farm crops, nesting in attics, burrowing in food, slinking through sewers were DISGUSTING! Ewwwwww! <br/><br/>2.The movie was waaaay too long. I was not swept up in the film, was very conscious of the time, and could not wait for the film to end. The kiddies in the audience squirmed throughout. The mother in front of me, when she wasn't dealing with her bored kids, spent the whole film text messaging. The film should have been more tightly edited, which leads me to . . .<br/><br/>3. The plot was ridiculous and all over the place: Remy's conflict with his fellow rats, the chef ghost, the critic, the lawyer, Linguini, the evil head chef, the granny, the health inspector, yikes! I particularly hated the granny who destroyed her home with a shotgun, the ENDLESS chases, and every time Remy's family appeared on screen. I could probably list some additional tedious scenes, but the movie was NOT memorable in any way, except for the ""yuck"" factor.<br/><br/>4. Completely missed the point of ""Anyone can cook."" Linguini could not cook; he seemed to be a nitwit buffoon throughout.<br/><br/>5. Why not just have Moses appear and say ""Thou shalt not steal"" instead of the pointless ghost chef? <br/><br/>6. I only liked Remy when he was silent. I HATED his voice!!! Every time he opened his mouth to narrate or to engage in dialogue, he completely lost me.<br/><br/>7. I love to look for the deeper meaning in films, love the use of metaphor and symbolism, but as hard as I tried, and no matter how breathtaking the animation, I could not get past the idea of swarms of rats in restaurants. (I remember some time ago when a bakery in my city went out of business after someone claimed to find a rat in a loaf of bread.)<br/><br/>Extremely disappointing, especially as I had really looked forward to this film and had entered the theatre prepared to be enchanted. I wish I had waited for some user comments before I wasted my money and time. It is a shame that the beautiful and brilliant animation was wasted on this story line.<br/><br/>If you are an animation geek and you have no problems with seeing rats swarming, then by all means go and see this film. I do have to hand it to animators who cam make my skin crawl with these rats. But do not be carried away by the rave reviews. This film has a lot of weaknesses. <br/><br/>BTW, this film is definitely being ranked way too high on the ""Greatest"" list. There are many truly great animated films out there, but ""Ratatouille"" is definitely not one of them, unless rated on technical wizardry alone."
"Monotreme02","9","5","8","21 July 2007"," Pixar's best, most subtle and most beautifully animated yet
","Firstly, in almost all of the Pixar films before it, the creators had to create and establish a very specific world: in A Bug's Life it is the world of the anthill, in Monsters Inc it is the alternate monster universe, in The Incredibles it is the sort of retro 1950's-throwback-style world populated by superheroes, and the same can be applied to their other works as well. Ratatouille, on the other hand, takes place within the real-life, contemporary ""human"" world, and thus does not need to establish the physics and dynamics of its own alternate universe  much humour is usually derived from the parallels between it and our real world and from the absurdity of the mechanics of these universes.<br/><br/>Another major difference is how Bird treats his themes. Major, educational themes have been the center of most animated movies since the oldest days of Disney and right up through the contemporary Pixar age. But what can more than certainly be said about pretty much all the rest of the Pixar movies is that they never try to hide their messages  in fact, I thought that the over-obviousness and simplicity of the message that appeared in Cars was what made it slightly less-appreciated among other Pixar projects. In Ratatouille, not only is the film absolutely brimming with overlaying themes and messages, but Bird at the same time never lets them take the wheel, and always keeps them looming overhead the actual plot and storyline. Themes such as friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and accepting the different and the unexpected can all be found in the film, but never once does Bird force-feed us his message, and for that I appreciate him all the more.<br/><br/>The story itself is of course fantastically executed and an absolute wonder to behold. It's touching, original, extremely clever and just plain fun. It's crazy but never enters the territory of absurd, and we always believe in it. The dynamics between Remy and Linguini are also brilliantly carried out, and they work together so incredibly well. But ultimately, the key to the film's success is the utter believability and realism of its characters. We totally believe in the dynamics between the two and in their own particular character traits and quirks. It's just so well done; and I must also mention that the character of Remy was designed in the most absolutely and utterly adorable, eat-you-up way possible! He just puts a smile on your face every time he wiggles his little nose.<br/><br/>The animation in the film is nothing short of revolutionary. It is easily the most incredibly well done and the best looking computer animated film made yet, in every aspect. Images that were once flat back in Toy Story become so realistically alive, it's quite mind-boggling to tell you the truth. The use of focus in the animation is so incredibly spot-on perfect and works so realistically in comparison to how it would actually work in real life, its almost hard to believe that this isn't done in real cameras. Add to that absolutely stunning lighting, colouration and textures, and you get some elements of the film that almost seem completely real  just look for example at the piece of bread near the beginning of the film, or the water in the river or the texture of the cobblestones on the street. It's unbelievable! I usually don't refer to the voice acting in a movie because I feel its redundant, and I'm also not a fan of using big celebrity voices just for the sake of having them, unless they are actually used dynamically in the animated character itself or if they are seamlessly integrated, as they are in Ratatouille. But I must bring up one particular vocal performance in this film that just had me grinning every time his character came on screen and his voice started booming: Casting Peter O'Toole as the voice of food critic Anton Ego was a stroke of genius quite unlike any other voice casting decision in ANY other animated film ever  or at least since the casting of Robin Williams as the voice of the Genie in Aladdin. His voice, instantly recognizable, fits the character of Ego so incredibly well, it's almost eerie. And he of course gives a brilliant performance, creating one of the most humorous characters in the entire film.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is another five-star success added to Pixar's already high-standard repertoire. It is just as touching, human, real, convincing and emotional as any other Pixar film, although to its credit Bird makes sure that its major themes and messages aren't too obviously or prominently featured, keeping everything subtle and putting the plot and characters first  which are all equally brilliantly done. The animation is the most vivid, perfect and absolutely beautiful in any animated movie yet, and it all fits in together perfectly with the very sly and unique Pixar sense of humour. I of course expected nothing less from the studio, and am now even more brimming with confidence about their next project, Wall-E, after the slight stumble that was last year's Cars. Easily the best movie yet this summer."
"DudeFromDetroit","10","5","8","17 July 2007"," Ratatouille Is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen!
","This Movie in my opinion, is the best movie Pixar has created to date. If not the best Animated movie ever, ONE of the best movies ever made. Now why do I make this statement? Is it childish at parts? Yes! Is it silly at times? yes! Is it a work of great movie making on just about all levels? YES! If you don't get ""IT"" then that's a shame. If you do then you will be entertained! Regardless where your from or background. The nuances of everything was really very intelligent and well put together If you don't laugh or find some kind of humor in this movie. You either have no sense of humor. OR...You have a giant stick up your butt! And your probably going into the theater wanting to hate it in the first place. If you don't find this film heartwarming then you must be a very sad person :( And if you can't find anything positive at all to take from this movie then your just a plain Ol' ""Hater"" as its said. <br/><br/>Mr. EGO's (Peter Ol Toole) Narrative at the end was perfect that summed up exactly what I was thinking. And there was not one Over the top stereo type personality. But yet you definitely knew who was the antagonist and protagonist. <br/><br/>Now this kind of story has been told before. The ""You can be more in life then what every one says your lot in it should be"" But I have to say it was told this time in a new and very clever way. A Rat chef! If you were a rat, How far removed would you be from that? Now If you hate the writing. You all know if most other writers that were going to make this film were just looking at how much money it could make. They Would have played it safe and It would have ended like this. (The guy would not have gotten the girl until the very end when he saves the restaurant that didn't get shut down. And the restaurant became a huge success) That's one of the things I liked about it. It didn't have THE PERFECT happy ending. There's nothing wrong with that though. But It did end happily. And there's nothing wrong with that either. I prefer a happy ending personally. But it showed you not all things turn out how you think they were going to. But then doe's anything every really do. <br/><br/>Now I could go on about Ratatouille. OH I could go on about how much I liked this movie and why. But I think you get where I'm coming from. And one last thing the animation and directing were Fantastic. About ten Minutes in I stopped thinking about it being an animated movie. thoroughly delightful."
"ajja9440","8","5","8","11 July 2007"," Third Best Pixar Movie
","I may get some flak for this, but here goes. I ranked Ratatouille third best ever in Pixar movies. It may be because I'm older, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The voices are good, the animation is stellar like all Pixar movies, and the jokes appeal to me. But it doesn't have the hilarious supporting actor/voice, like in Finding Nemo with Dory (my absolute favourite Pixar movie ever), and The Incredibles (E). Emile and Linguini just don't have that funny flair like Dory and E did. In Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, I found myself saying memorable quotes a lot (Dory speaking whale and E showing Helen the new suits). Ratatouille had me with none of these, except for the one from the trailer (Don't just hork it down!). Overall, 8/10. To rank it perfect is not true, and to give it anything less than 8 should be a sin. Also, what may have made it bad, was this annoying woman behind, laughing at the most unfunny things in the movie."
"LuxoJr","10","5","8","3 July 2007"," Ratatouille is a tasty winner! Go see it now!
","You know that feeling after you see a really good film that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and you laugh because you just spent the last two hours laughing at some real smart comedy, and you smile because you actually care about the characters? Ratatouille is one of those films.<br/><br/>Pixar is, and will always be, number one in animation, storytelling, and film-making. If all major Hollywood studios made films as good as Ratatouille, I'd probably be broke right now from seeing all of those movies. I don't know how Pixar does it. They seem to score every, single time. And that's what I love about Pixar. They win, and they know how to make good films.<br/><br/>Ratatouille scores a creative, funny, heartfelt, and genuine script from director Brad Bird. I had the opportunity to see him at San Francisco's Wondercon a few months ago, and I could see his passion up close in his eyes and how much he cares about Pixar's films.<br/><br/>Each scene has a purpose in Ratatouille. Remy, the rat hero of the film, dreams of becoming a chef, inspired by his hero, Gusteau, a French chef who just died. Remy meets Linguini, the klutsy garbage boy, and together, they become the greatest chefs in Paris. With the help of Colette, the only female in the kitchen; Emile, Remy's rat brother who eats anything; Anton Ego, the premier restaurant critic of Paris; and Skinner, the greedy head chef who wants to bask in Gusteau's fame, Pixar creates some of the most memorable characters. Laugh out loud scenes reveal new details about the plot as Linguini interacts with Remy. And to top it off, the finale of Ratatouille may be the most satisfying finale of a Pixar film ever (but I shall not spoil it here). For such a simple plot, some may think that Ratatouille scores low. But the heart and genuine humor bring Ratatouille to rival the greatest films ever created.<br/><br/>The look and sound of Ratatouille is incredible. Ratatouille boasts one of the most visually brilliant films, animated or not animated. Streets of Paris are marvelous as Remy gets chased from the chef. The kitchen of Gusteau's is full of energy. The sewers, from human perspective, are dark and gloomy. But when the camera turns to the rats' perspective, the sewers look and feel like heaven. And let's not forget the incredible score, which should and will get an Oscar nomination for original score this year.<br/><br/>In some ways, the story of Ratatouille mirrors how Pixar runs its company. Gusteau, I would imagine, is Brad Bird and all the geniuses at Pixar, because Gusteau carries those values of being able to showcase your talents. Gusteau addresses the mediocrity of society but also reminds us the importance of finding our talents and passions saying, ""Anyone can cook."" Remy, I assume, is Pixar, because Remy has a dream to be the greatest chef, just like Pixar is the greatest film studio. Just like how Linguini uses Remy to help showcase their talents together, Disney uses Pixar to gain fame and fortune.<br/><br/>If you ever get the chance to meet someone who has already seen Ratatouille, go strike a conversation with them. I bet you a free movie ticket that the person only has things to rave about the greatness of Pixar's Ratatouille.<br/><br/>""Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great."" Ratatouille is a winner!"
"VincentVega89","10","5","8","1 July 2007"," Just when I thought the Golden Age of Pixar Was Finished.
","After the disappointment that was Cars, I thought that Pixar's creative magic had finally depleted. It's not that Cars was a bad film, it was good, but it wasn't up to par compared to the other Pixar classics. Now with Ratatouille I have to say that the magic of Pixar is alive and well. <br/><br/>The film plotwise is just terrific. The story is well done and the characters are all hilarious. The humor is smart, funny, and original. The humor is one of the reasons that sets Pixar apart from Dreamworks and it's competitors There are no fart jokes in Ratatouille, and some of the best jokes reside in the dialogue. I would give an example, but I wouldn't want to ruin one of the brilliant scenes in the film. The characters are all interesting and lovable. <br/><br/>Technically Ratatouille is amazing. While the characters are cartoonish the actual backgrounds are nearly photorealistic. This is truly a film to see on the big screen because the film has outstanding particle effects. The water looks like real water, and the fur on the rats look real. It is true eye candy and perfectly complements the story.<br/><br/>One of the major themes in Ratatouille is the combination of tastes. And with the juicy plot and sweet effects Ratatouille is a scrumptious treat. This is a work of art and is a true classic. To call this film Best Animated Feature would be an insult. For this film isn't the Best Animated Feature of 2007 but the Best film of 2007.<br/><br/>Pixar has always been the leader in CGI films, and Ratatouille just shows that Pixar is still the best."

I'm a rat lover myself, but I could see people who hate rats finding the characters to be adorable. The voice acting was really good and I found myself very attached to the characters during the film. The music was also wonderful and I would love to have the soundtrack! Oh, and the story... it's very cute and heart warming. I won't say much more, because you need to go SEE it!

"jfizzlefan12","1","52","136","4 July 2007"," Extremely Disappointing
","I am no Pixar hater; in fact, quite the opposite. I would count Finding Nemo among my 5 favorite movies, and I loved all the others- The Incredibles, Toy Story, etc.- as well. After reading the glowing reviews, I had nothing but the highest expectations from Ratatouille.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is terrible. I can describe it no other way. It takes the poignant morals of nearly all the other Pixar films and combines them into an aimless, boring, and most importantly unamusing movie with about twenty unpursued themes that emerge out of nowhere at random points.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: What was the point of this film? I suppose something democratic like ""anyone can cook,"" but honestly, was that really the point? What the hell are we supposed to think about Linguini, who turned out to be a useless puppet whom I truly disliked in the first place? HE could not cook- really, the message should have been anyone with talent can cook, but if you're useless like Linguini you always will be. In that way the ""moral"" seems to share much with Bird's ""Incredibles,"" but the movie doesn't actually pursue that... for some reason, we're supposed to like Linguini and feel happy that he gets the girl, but he is a nobody who SHOULD have been fired for messing with the soup- why did he try to cook in the first place? Beyond quibbles about ""message,"" the movie was not enjoyable on any superficial level, and I can't imagine any child liking it. There are no enjoyable characters, the voice-overs by Patton Oswalt come and go, and the voice acting is pretty poor- though I will admit the food critic is memorably voiced by Peter O'Toole, no one else adds character through their voice, especially Linguini (Jeanine Garafalo, or however you spell her name, is especially terrible- often she sounds more Asian than French). The plot has plenty of holes, and while I am willing to accept a far fetched plot, I can not swallow the inconsistent logic that abounds here (how can Remy read, for God's sake? Couldn't he just talk to everyone? Maybe his voice is too quiet, but if he can read he should know that he just needs to find a microphone and everyone will be shocked that rats have evolved right beneath our noses to the point where they can speak, read, and cook...). Most significantly, the central plot point, that somehow Linguini is controlled by his hair, is very hard to swallow.<br/><br/>The movie is frustrating because not only does Pixar have such a great track record, but Brad Bird is clearly a genius; The Incredibles and The Iron Giant were movies that transcended their status as animated children's films. Yet, I can not even see a child enjoying Ratatouille- the only moment anyone in the theater laughed was when the Health Inspector and Chef were bound and gagged and thrown into the closet.<br/><br/>Of course, that inspires more questions about just how rats are capable of doing that at all."
"paul2001sw-1","5","8","15","12 December 2007"," Surprisingly conventional
","Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death 'Toy Story', 'Madagascar') or by hip references to popular culture (the 'Shrek' movies). But 'Ratatouille', this year's smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of 'Wallace and Grommit', although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O' Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life."
"kkachurak","8","8","15","17 June 2007"," One of Pixar's Better Films
","I rank The Incredibles and Monsters Inc. up pretty high when it comes to Pixar films. So when it came to Ratatouille, I was skeptical - especially after the dismal disaster I thought Cars was.<br/><br/>I caught the sneak preview on June 16th and really enjoyed Ratatouille. Unfortunately though, most of what could be considered the true comedic moments of the film were already given away in the never ending onslaught of Ratatouille trailers that we've been blessed with. It was frustrating to go through fairly large chunks of the movie knowing exactly what would happen.<br/><br/>The animation, however, was absolutely brilliant. No Pixar movie has ever looked more amazing. The city of Paris was stunning, the textures were incredible detailed, and humans keep looking better and better in every Pixar film. Not to mention, there were times when the rats just looked real. (Keep an eye out for an announcement in the credits declaring this movie was, ""genuine animation, no motion capture was used.""<br/><br/>Overall, a better Pixar release than Cars or Toy Story 2 (in my humble opinion), good storyline, wonderfully animated, and memorable characters. 8/10"

"Jery_Kilker","9","3","4","21 February 2008"," Personal comments
","How can I fail to comment on this delightful film? Not only is it wonderful entertainment and pleasant to watch, it is about a country in which I currently live, about a subject very close to my heart  food, that is!  and contains seemingly extraneous elements of personal importance.<br/><br/>The basis, if not the model, of the film's centerpiece is a restaurant near my home town, Napa, California. Thomas Keller's famous 'French Laundry' occupies a building that was once a real laundry in the 19th century post-Gold-Rush days of Yountville, in the center of the Napa Valley. His restaurant is now one of the most famous in America and a feature of the Valley's colorful late 20th century renaissance.<br/><br/>Another nostalgic connection is a real version of the automobile belonging to the character Skinner, an 1960s Facel Vega, belonged to a colleague of mine when we worked in Geneva, Switzerland. He took it with him when he returned to America to live near Washington, DC. Not only did this elegant French automobile have an American engine but also had the distinctive Chevrolet wraparound wind screen of the era. I don't know that the US components kept it from being more popular; I think it was simply another example of the many makes produced in small numbers that did not differentiate themselves and survive in the marketplace.<br/><br/>All-in-all, 'Ratatouille' is both a charming film but also a nostalgic reminder for me of pleasant times."

I love Disney / Pixar films and they have never made a bad one (unlike Dreamworks who insist on producing tripe such as 'Bee Movie'), anyway, I was slightly worried after hearing that people were put out by it's lack of humour or it's lack of action. If you see this film expecting another 'Incredibles', 'Monster's Inc' or 'Cars', then you will be, but if you watch this film without any preconceived ideas about what a Pixar film usually contains (think of it as a normal film and not a cartoon), then you will see one of the best performed, well scripted and technically perfect films around (the water looks so real!) As for the humour, there is a small amount of slapstick stuff for the kids, but quite a lot of grown up themes and jokes... vegetables anyone?? Enjoy."

The animation is remarkable, the music blends with the movie, the entire plot is original, entertaining and much, much more. I never ever thought an animation could have such an intense message! It just erases all of your worries, concerns and problems and replaces them with hope, ambition, or simply happiness.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate, see this movie whenever you get the chance, be it with your friends, your children, your parents or just by yourself.

Indeed, this film seems to have a far better chance on winning an Oscar this year than any other animated movie. It has been a great success world-wide, and I really enjoyed it, just as I enjoyed The Incredibles - Brad Bird's last movie. I will be very disappointed if Ratatouille doesn't win best animated feature at the Oscars this year, that it will lose to a less truthful title like Shrek the Third or being second best to Bee Movie."

","Some of the best animation I have ever seen, and the characterizations, the voice talent, the story .... all first rate. I don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much.<br/><br/>At first, I'll admit, I was so focused on the detail of the animation (the water on Remy's fur, actually, the animation of the water period), but I soon got so sucked into the story that I stopped being distracted.<br/><br/>I especially liked that the character of Remy (although he could read) did not have the ability to speak to the humans. That one fact added so much to the humor, but also to the pathos and the misunderstandings between the two.<br/><br/>I'm glad I took a little something from the budget to buy this on DVD. I didn't go see it in the theater (and now I regret that decision), but I know I'll watch it a few times a year from now until I breathe my last.<br/><br/>I'm 55 and don't have any children, so I have nothing to go by, but I didn't see anything in the film that would upset a child. Remy ends up in some peril, but it never lasts for long, and at the very least this isn't one of those films where we have young Remy blamed for and dealing with the death of a parent. That's a plus in my book.<br/><br/>I just plain loved this movie. I can't think of a bad thing to say about it."
"morten-vehlewald","10","3","4","6 October 2007"," Excellent and funny...
","When the German version of this movie came out at 3rd October (national holiday in Germany) I saw it right at the first day. The room in the movie theater was full of course. There were also some little kids watching it. I must say there are not many movies where I laughed as much as during Ratatouille. At some parts all the spectators giggled. It's very, very funny, but not silly or childish. There're also some serious parts in the movie, although it's not too unsmiling or too emotional for being fun. The only thing I have to say against Ratatouille is that I don't think it's qualified for general audience and should be rated higher than G. I would rate it PG (6 in Germany). In my opinion Pixar created a very good mixture with much funny, some serious and a few action elements and the result is this moving picture. <br/><br/>Furthermore I've never seen a movie at theater before where the entire audience applauded during the end credits. I think the movie Ratatouille is the best flick Pixar ever made. It's really worth to be seen. And I hope it will make more money than other Pixar productions like Finding Nemo. I've seen it only once now, but I promise I haven't seen Ratatouille the last time. My rate: 10 of 10 stars!"

The demographics show that women above forty five for some reason give it a lousy average of 5.5. Let's just hope they don't ruin the film experience for their kids, who probably love it."

","After the partial disappointment of Cars, which was good but not enough by Pixar standards, it is a joy to see the company return to form. In fact, Ratatouille could even be the best picture they have produced so far, beating The Incredibles, Nemo and even Toy Story.<br/><br/>The film wasn't actually as heavily marketed as previous Pixar achievements, possibly because audiences, both young and adult, wouldn't really know what to think of this peculiar movie, which stars a rat. Yes, that's correct, a rat. The rodent's name is Remy (Patton Oswalt), and he is endowed with a particularly powerful nose, which allows him to tell what kinds of food are good or bad based on the smell. This has made him extremely picky when it comes to his diet, and during one of his culinary expeditions he is accidentally separated from his family. After traveling in the sewers for a while, he finds himself in the middle of Paris, the capital of excellent cooking. His joy is only temporary, though, as he discovers that his favorite restaurant (he has seen it on TV) has lost three of its five stars, the first because a nasty food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O' Toole) gave the place a more negative review than usual, the second because the leading chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett), died of grief. Now the restaurant is in worse shape than ever, as new boss Skinner (Ian Holm) is simply interested in business and doesn't care about the food's quality. Fortunately, Remy, despite being a rat, has taken Gusteau's motto (""Anyone can cook"") to heart and, guided by the great chef's ghost, he tries to bring things back to normal, finding an ally in the clumsy but good-hearted Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he manages to prepare one delicious dish after another, restoring the restaurant's reputation.<br/><br/>The premise might sound far-fetched even for a Disney/Pixar movie, and yet Ratatouille has the best script made for an animated feature in ages: staying faithful to the company's belief that story and character come first, not celebrity voices and pop-culture references (as is the case with Dreamworks' cartoons), writer-director Brad Bird, the man behind The Incredibles), has crafted a screenplay of rare (for a 'toon, that is) sharpness and intelligence, consisting of an intriguing plot, smart gags (including one midway through the movie that should be inappropriate in a G-rated picture but somehow fits neatly into the pitch-perfect narrative) and, most of all, fully developed characters. Whereas most animated films focus on a limited group of people, Pixar has always been famous for giving everyone a moment in the spotlight, and it shows the most in this film: the bond between Remy and Linguini, which is every bit as solid and compelling as the ones between Woody and Buzz or Mike and Sully, is of course at the center of the picture's events, but the initially awkward, then tender relationship between the inept aspiring cook and his coworker Colette (Janeane Garofalo) is equally well built and moving; supporting characters such as Remy's brother and father, who are incapable of understanding his love for proper food, the mischievous Skinner or psychotic cook Horst (voiced by Will Arnett, best known for the hilarious, prematurely canceled Arrested Development), who always has a different explanation for why he used to be in prison (it ranges from ""I created a hole in the Ozone layer over Avignon"" to ""I killed a man... with this thumb!""), provide most of the situation's foolproof humor; as for Ego, to whom O' Toole lends one of the best voices ever to have been used in animation, he stands out as one of the best villains in animated film history (that the makers of such critically adored movies decided to use a critic as the bad guy is another stroke of genius).<br/><br/>Also fundamental is the originality: apart from the obviously unusual pitch (rat turns out to be best chef in France), Ratatouille is a gold-mine of superb material from the splendid start to the exceptional ending, which revives Pixar's trademark surprise element that was missing in Cars. The real surprise, however, is the amount of stuff Bird comes up with in between: most movies, especially action flicks and comedies, run out of ideas at a certain point but keep going because otherwise the running time would be too short (this is evident in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels which, albeit funny and exciting, were famously, and obviously, written as the shooting went on); in Ratatouille, whenever a joke has run its course it is immediately followed by one exactly as brilliant, thus making the film a seemingly never-ending flow of wit at its sharpest.<br/><br/>Bottom line: after a a partial misfire, Pixar is, thankfully, back on track with the only film that is capable of rivaling The Simpsons Movie as the best animated feature of the year, and that is really saying something."

Now, a new one seems to come every week and the stories are all so similar. Ratatouille though, was very original.

","In a season virtually filled to the brim with disappointing follow-up installments, Pixar Animation Studios and director Brad Bird cook up yet another winner in ""Ratatouille,"" a story of a rat named Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who hankers to hone his improbable talent of mixing the right ingredients to make a delightful fare. The members of his colony don't recognize his passion, if not entirely against it, especially his father (Brian Dennehy) who constantly reminds him that humans are dangerous. But as someone who looks up to the late Chef Gusteau, Remy believes what the celebrated culinary expert believes: anyone can cook.<br/><br/>But an attempt to prove this to his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) causes him to separate from the other members of his colony, eventually ending up in Paris, and in Gusteau's once five-star restaurant. Now reduced to three stars, it's run by Chef Skinner (Ian Holm), a collusive restaurateur who plans to use Gusteau's prestigious name to sell mass-marketed frozen foods. A series of events bring Remy and Linguini, a bumbling garbage boy working at the restaurant, together. Driven by Remy's desire to cook and Linguini's desperate effort not to get fired after a kitchen mishap, the two team up to prepare the restaurant's new menu items that has the elites of Paris appreciating the restaurant again.<br/><br/>Soon, Linguini gets all the credit Remy deserves and Remy's loyalty to his family members are questioned, eventually leading to some sort of a falling out between the two even as renowned food critic Anton Ego is set to do a review of the restaurant.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is firstly a sight to behold (ah, Paris!) and praising Pixar for it seems as effective as calling a fast food restaurant unhealthy. It just is. What really sets the studio's projects apart from other films of its nature (I'm consciously trying to keep myself from labeling animation as a genre; you know, Brad Bird... ) is how their stories successfully embed genuine motivations to their characters while adding nice blend of drama and humor, without resorting to an overkill of pop culture references.<br/><br/>I understand Disney's dilemma, though, in marketing this film. Save for the fact that it's an animated movie featuring a talking rat, Bird's follow-up to his equally laudable ""The Incredibles"" is placed in such a sophisticated setting with a tad too many culinary jargon which younger audiences might not easily appreciate. In fact, it seems it might appeal to parents more than to their kids. But it's paced well, is thoroughly engaging, and the cast provides memorable voice performances that the movie overall is a, well, delicious experience. <br/><br/>In the end, ""Ratatouille"" is a visually pleasing, touching and humorous tale that further proves Pixar and Bird a formidable combination."
"manhattanmoviemaniac","8","3","4","16 July 2007"," This is one talented rat!
","Pixar (The Toy Story people, for you cave dwellers out there) has scored another animation hit with this uneven, but still enjoyable feature about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Well, safe to say that we have an original idea there. The animation is, of course, superb, regardless of whether we are watching a surging storm drain, precise human hand dexterity or the Paris cityscape. There are several sub-plots going on and a little more focus would have been of some help here. There are also several overly long scenes of rats scurrying away from dangers that get a little wearisome, but a fairly charming story does emerge soon enough. <br/><br/>This movie surprised me with a funny, little, seven-minute short feature, called Lifted, which was about an inept alien screwing up an apparent human abduction test. This was a nice start and lead up to the main feature, in which Patton Oswalt reads the part of Remi, a very bright rat, who is also gifted with a very powerful sense of smell. This prevents him from enjoying the usual rat fare of, well, mainly garbage. Remi, who also knows how to read (this really is one talented rat!), learns about cooking from the book of the late, great, French Chef Gusteau. After escaping a shotgun swinging senior, as well as other dangers, Remi finds himself teaming up with a lowly, clean-up guy, Linguini (read by Lou Romano). With Remi's talent and Linguini's more acceptable kitchen presence, the two soon form a team that takes the French restaurant team by storm. Linguini finds love, while Remi finds a perfect soup, but there are complications aplenty, including evil Head Chef Skinner (well read by Ian Holm), who has an interest in seeing the young boy fail. Peter O'Toole, as well, does a great job reading the small, but important part of the feared restaurant critic, Anton Ego. The story, which takes a little time to get rolling, is quite warm and enjoyable, is capped off with, of course, a nice feel-good finish. <br/><br/>Well, if nothing else, this film could be used as a recruiting tool for culinary school, but that shouldn't be necessary, since, besides glorifying the art of cooking, it should be enjoyed by all ages. I found issue with a very brief scene that showed a gun being used in anger in a domestic setting (besides our Shotgun Sally senior mentioned above). I found this scene to be completely out of place and inappropriate. I don't understand why it was included. Ratatouille also has few less giggles than I hope to see in a feature of this type, but does serve up a very heart-warming story with a tiny, side dish scene about critics (like me), who create nothing and only attack those who do create. On behalf of critics everywhere, I take issue with this completely unfair assessment of the critic's place in society! Let me just make a few points in our defense. First of all, I'd like to say....ummmwell; I guess I don't have any points to raise. It's pretty much true. <br/><br/>(This ManhattanMovieManiac work was first featured on realmoviereview)"

Definitely Pixar's best work yet in this department, hands down. Everything is warm, soft, very realistic yet painterly. Animation is topnotch, special effects like liquids are natural, and the ever-so-important fur was realistic. Colors were rich and deep; makes me wish that the world was that pretty.<br/><br/>The sound was great, not one thing stood out as imperfect. The voice actors breathed life into the digital dolls and no voice actor sounded forced or unfitting for the character.<br/><br/>The story was enjoyable, with many hilarious bits scattered throughout the otherwise heartwarming script. The main themes were not entirely original (being different, overcoming differences), but this was perhaps the most enjoyable presentation I've yet to come across.<br/><br/>The film left me feeling very satisfied, a smile stretching from ear to ear. The story did seem to wind down at points, but the ending was very fitting and had me cheering the lovable characters. I was more than impressed (even with my high expectations), and might even consider this as the best Pixar film yet.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-see; bring your family (or a date)!"

","RATATOUILLE<br/><br/>**** stars out of 5 (8/10).<br/><br/>I can say, with little doubt, that ""Ratatouille"" is the best film I've seen all summer long. It mixes brilliant animation with good, old-fashioned film-making.<br/><br/>Remy (PATTON OSWALT) is a strange rat. He prefers fine cuisine to the trash his family usually eats. He is also different in the fact that he can read, and cook the food he loves so dearly. Remy is eventually separated from his family, and he must find his way to survive in Paris, the fine food capitol of the world. One day, he is caught in a famous restaurant by Linguini (LOU ROMANO), the new garbage boy. Before he's about to dump Remy in the river, Linguini sees that the rat understands his words. Earlier, he saw the rat cooking up delicious soup, so he puts his head to work. The two unlikely friends begin to work together, so Remy can be a cook, and so Linguini can move up in the world of the restaurant business.<br/><br/>This movie is smart, witty, and stunning to the eye. Brad Bird is a master of animation, and this is his best film to date. The movie can be quite funny, without going over the top on pop-culture references. It's so well-made that it makes some of the other summer pictures look like nothing. The animation is intricate, colorful, and comically realistic. It's scary the amount of detail the filmmakers went into. ""Ratatouille"" is a feast to the senses, and it finds a way of entertaining you throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>I won't do much complaining, but there are some little things I wasn't happy about. For once, I would like to see an animated movie without this kind of villain, and the stages of predictability he/she goes through to find out the scheme. Don't get me wrong, I liked the character Skinner (IAN HOLM), but the process has been in nearly every animated movie of late. It was directed well, but I guess I just want to see something new.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this film reaches a certain amount of greatness. The voice casting is perfect, and it will associate with all kinds of audiences. It's a flavor explosion, and you would be without taste not to enjoy this great Pixar dish."

"ingres77","10","3","4","7 July 2007"," Simply fantastic.
","If you love quality films, and think Pixar is leading the industry in innovation and storytelling, you owe it to yourself to see Ratatouille. In fact, you owe it to everyone. Pixar will only maintain creative control over it's product so long as they are earning money for Disney. Unlike it's predecessors Cars, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille failed to earn even $50 million in it's opening weekend. A lot of money, yes, but not a good sign for the investors.<br/><br/>Money aside, Pixar has proved once again that they can do what no one else can: create fully realized CG worlds that are only secondary to the story being told. The CG here is simply marvelous. Paris comes to life, the food is so realistic you want to reach out and eat it, and the rats move with a delicate grace that is at the same time cartoonish and believable. But what truly sets Pixar apart from every other animation studio is that they can walk that line between animated reality and cartoon absurdity. The key, here, is the people that inhabit the worlds they've created. They don't look remotely realistic. They look, in fact, much like the humans in The Incredibles. Overlarge heads, exaggerated limbs, and a fluidity of movement that can only be recreated in a movie. Unlike Shrek, or Ice Age, or any other CG movie, Ratatouille allows it's humans be to be cartoons, but they surround them with the most realistic world imaginable. This effect isn't disconcerting, it frees the viewer to sit back and simply absorb everything.<br/><br/>Like their previous efforts, the story is everything. Remy is a rat who loves to cook, and he befriends a young man who can't cook, but works in the kitchen of a famous restaurant. The story is both hilarious and exciting. It never falls into melodramatic traps, and the characters act in believable ways - they don't simply do what the writers think they should do to advance the plot to a happy conclusion.<br/><br/>In short, this is not a formulaic film. It balances ingenuity, wit, and skill, and produces one of the finest films of the year. I don't know if this is the best Pixar film yet, but it's at least the equal of Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. In fifty years, we'll all be looking back on Pixar as the finest example of a creative force in Hollywood. Let's hope Disney allows them to continue making films their way.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I have no problem with this movie. And I can find fault with just about every movie I see."
"bob020787","10","3","4","7 July 2007"," One of the Summer's Best
","When I first heard about Pixar's Ratatouille, I thought it sounded incredibly lame, and that it would signal the beginning of Pixar's demise. Not only was I wrong, but in a big way. Ratatouille was not only one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year, but it might possibly be the best film Pixar has ever made, and that is saying quite a lot given their previous offerings.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't heard of it, Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who has a penchant for cooking. This poses a problem for Remy because if a rat is seen anywhere near a kitchen it is attacked and killed. However, through a chance encounter, Remy teams up with an incompetent human chef to become the greatest chef in Paris.<br/><br/>While the story might seem juvenile, director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) exceptionally creates a story which all audiences can enjoy. On one hand it is the tale of an outcast, who despite tremendous adversity is able to achieve great success. At the same time, it is a coming of age story; where the son must leave his family behind to do something truly great.<br/><br/>This story never fails to entertain the audience, not only with its laughs, but also with its characters. These characters are voiced superbly by performers which were perfectly for their roles. Bird didn't pick his actors to have names to put on a poster (as Pixar has done before with Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Goodman, and Billy Crystal) but the actors were specifically selected for the characters they played.<br/><br/>Standing out amongst these actors was Peter O'Toole who played the evil food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole delivers the finest lines of the film, as well as the climactic monologue in which his character critiques the food of Remy. This monologue may stand as one of the best ever, and it was spoken to perfection by Mr. O'Toole.<br/><br/>Not only does the film have a wonderful story, but its animation is as delectable as the food that Remy creates. The world which Remy lives in was complete to the slightest detail, making earlier Pixar films such as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. look amateur. Every scene in the film was visually stunning, a fact which made the film considerably more entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Ratatouille 10/10 salty stix. In a summer that has been oversaturated with disappointing sequels to some of my favorite movies, Pixar has again created one of the most original, enjoyable films of the year, and I recommend it to everybody.<br/><br/>Google SaltyStix for more film reviews"

"RoChamBeau","10","3","4","5 July 2007"," The Best CGI Animated Film Ever Created
","As everyone knows, Pixar set the industry standard for CGI feature films when it released the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" in 1995. In hindsight, it's quite astonishing how high they managed to set the bar for all such future films. There have been other commercial successes that have come close to matching the irrefutable charm and appeal of ""Toy Story""  ""Finding Nemo"", ""Shrek"", ""The Incredibles""  but, however formidable these films proved to be, it's hard to beat a true original.<br/><br/>But it's not impossible. If you liked any of the above-mentioned films, you'll absolutely love Pixar's latest masterwork, ""Ratatouille"". If you saw a couple of CGI films that were real stinkers and gave up on the genre, give this one a try. It is guaranteed to refocus the entirety of your misconceptions.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is about, well, a rat  Remy (Patton Oswalt)  whose ambitious culinary aspirations challenge the rat world's status quo, it being that rats are meant to live in fear of humans, make their homes underground, and sustain themselves on garbage. After being separated from his family and friends, Remy happens upon an unusual opportunity to scratch his itch. He teams up with a hapless, incompetent, aspiring chef, Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he discovers a way to create dishes with a clever, complex hair-pulling control system underneath Linguini's chef hat  a very fascinating mutualistic symbiosis wherein Linguini appears to be a top-notch French chef and Remy gets to live out his lifelong dream.<br/><br/>Writer and Director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"", ""Iron Giant"") removes any doubt as to his ability to tell his stories through strong character-driven, detail-oriented tapestries that venture well beyond what one might expect from an animated children's story. Through subtlety, he infuses the story with charm and heart, such as when Remy, when asked by Linguini whether or not he can cook, responds by shrugging his shoulders sheepishly yet conceitedly  a simple but nonetheless telling gesture. Bird's fantastic script is executed brilliantly by a talented array of actors who all give strong performances.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" has a very particular and appealing sly, refined sense of humor delivered admirably through the use of heavy slapstick and expression. It's a fish-out-of-water tale to be sure sure, but a delightfully original and entertaining one, and certainly not one to be defined by only one such constraining designation. The story's heart and soul stem from the facing of new challenges  looking beyond one's own horizon and gathering the courage to pursue new things. It's concrete proof that a kids' flick can be accessible to its target audience while also being cerebral and unpredictable. My main qualm with the preceding animated feature  ""Surf's Up""  was that despite nice visuals and great voice acting, there was little originality in the storyline. That is, it lacked unpredictability and there were more than the acceptable amount of kids'-movie clichés, whereas ""Ratatouille"" noticeably lacks such clichés as, for example, weird, accessory-sidekicks or just-a-little-too-perfect protagonists. Flawless protagonists are one-dimensional for the most part, and it's difficult to ignore such blatant disregard for the storytelling process while watching such a character carry on. Remy, in contrast, is cute and likable, sure; but at times he is also, among other things, abrasive, apprehensive, and retributive  attributes that in and of themselves give depth to his personality and contribute to the vitality of his character.<br/><br/>There's always at least one movie that really sticks in kids' minds throughout their lives. ""The Lion King"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Cinderella"", or ""Toy Story"" are all clear possibilities, of course. In this, the age of budget-busting CGI fests, gore movies, and monotonous kids' flicks, it's more than a genuine treat when a picture like ""Ratatouille"" hits the big screen. A charmer for all ages, it's a one-of-a-kind, can't miss experience. Pixar has finally  *finally*  outdone themselves with this one. ""Ratatouille"" has set a new standard for family-oriented CGI romp movies and kid-based storytelling.<br/><br/>It is rare for a reviewer to endow an animated feature with the word ""masterpiece"". The last time that description rolled off my tongue and into a review, I had just finished watching the wonderful ""Pan's Labyrinth"". No animated movie I've ever seen has deserved such a prominent title. Until now, that is. It's not really that shocking when you think about it. Truly fine art deserves the highest recognition, and this reviewer encourages you to go and see why ""Ratatouille"" is the best CGI animated film ever made.<br/><br/>Grade: 6/6 (""Transcendent"")"

Another masterpiece from Pixar who have proved that they can make technically fantastic movies (good animation) that also have a deep story within (this is in the line of, e.g., Cars).

","Generally, Pixar has shied away from the realm of humanity in previous films, but Ratatouille finally marks their entry into human relationships and instead of focusing on the fantasy world of little critters, they provide a remarkably balanced picture of both (completely lovable) character ensembles. This is the essence of movie-making, people. The comedy hearkens back to ye olde days; this movie could have worked just as well as a silent film. Camera angles (if you'd like to call them that) are top-notch and provide an invigoration to the action that never gets old. The acting and writing are very smart; this isn't just a kiddy film. There are strong plot ties to egoism, relationships, and a rather Burton-esquire approach to critical cynicism, not to mention references to religion (*gasp*), alcohol (*gasp*), and illegitimate children (*gasp*) which are unfairly taboo in today's family films. My true thanks go out Pixar for making what is perhaps the best animated film in a very long time, one that can easily contend with Disney classics, and my new personal favorite animated feature."

","""No! You waste energy and time! You think cooking is a cute job, eh? Like Mommy in the kitchen?""<br/><br/>Who knew that a movie about rats could be so charming and visually beautiful? Mice? Sure, The Great Mouse Detective and An American Tail did it years ago. But leave it to Pixar to make a lowly rat lovable, and even make him someone that we'd want fixing our food! Now, that is quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Visually, this is one of my very favorite Pixar movies. The character designs are very appealing to me, and the technical detail is outstanding. The look of the characters themselves are only outshone by the marvelous Parisian backdrops that we get glimpses of through windows and from sky shots. The music is great, the message is good, and the story is entertaining for kids and adults. I put Ratatouille on that second Pixar tier. Not quite up to the brilliance and cleverness of Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, but a great animated movie in every regard."
"tieman64","Null","4","6","20 February 2008"," The Artist's Journey
","Like ""The Incredibles"", Brad Bird's earlier film, ""Ratatouille"" celebrates the passionate, sometimes aggressive, pursuit of excellence. But while ""The Incredibles"" dealt with superheroes pushing aside mediocrity and embracing their powers, ""Ratatouille"" paints a lowly rat as a budding artist who must, in the quest for greatness, rise above those around him.<br/><br/>The plot, a thinly disguised rift of Plato's ""Ion"" (in which Socrates and Ion discuss everything from art to art criticism), unfolds in an unpretentious but profound manner. Rats (ie humans) are dirty, uncivilised, pack animals. They eat garbage, live in filth and are generally stupid. But Remy is different. He dreams, he reads, he dares to experience different tastes. In short, he's an imaginative little rat and completely out of place amongst his barbaric brothers! <br/><br/>And so Remy leaves his family behind and embarks on a quest to become an artist. But like all great men, Remy first needs a mentor. In this case, his mentor is a dead chef by the name of Gusteau. Gusteau is Remy's hero, his role model, and so Remy shall live his rodent life by Gusteau's ideals! <br/><br/>Of course, being a rat, Remy can't accomplish anything on his own. To rectify this he enlists the help of Linguini, a bumbling kid who lacks ambition, drive and direction. By living in Linguini's hat and ""pulling his strings"" - like a film director takes control of his crew, or a puppeteer controls a puppet - Remy uses Linguini to create and make art, which the film equates with fine French cuisine.<br/><br/>The film is so determined to examine art's function on the collective and the collective's role in the creation of art, that later in the film Remy's family comes to the rescue and likewise helps him create. Though they do not understand his artistic view the world, though they do not respond as he does to fine art and sophisticated food, they nevertheless love Remy enough to band together and help him create and fulfil his dreams.<br/><br/>And so Bird stresses the communal aspect of creation. No artist, especially a filmmaker, no matter how independent he views himself to be, can accomplish greatness without help. And though a budding artist must (somewhat naively) break away from his family, at times ridiculing their lack of understanding, Remy can not realise his dreams without their love and support.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that Remy has no mother in the film. His family is all male. Historically, most mothers embrace their son's artistic desires. It's the practical father figure which the artist must overcome and prove himself to. What's sweet is that Remy shrugs his father aside, dares to be independent, but then needs his father to accomplish his dreams. Brad Bird, and many film-makers, likewise started off with sceptical family support and funding.<br/><br/>Eventually Remy rallies a band of artists together (one character called Colette makes a point to label each of the chefs as artists and bandits). These are not cooks, they're rebels and outlaws! Of course none of these artists want to dream or take risks. Like Remy's dad, they've become stagnated. They follow Gusteaus recipes by the letter, not daring to step out of the box and create for themselves. But Remy is different. He has a vision! He has that creative spark! ""Change is nature, Dad,"" Remy says to his father, ""we can influence when we decide to!"" <br/><br/>But Remy's father doesn't understand. He thinks his son is a wide-eyed dreamer. But when Dad sees little Remy commanding a kitchen full of humans like a maverick film-director, a smile creeps across his face. He understands his son, sees the strength in him, and promptly rallies behind the kid.<br/><br/>The film's message is summed up best during a final-act monologue. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. To be a great artist, one must be willing to fight for change. And so Remy lifted Linguini and his tribe of rats out of the gutter. He believed in himself and they believed in him, and together they all prospered.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Rattatouille"" is one of PIXAR's most mature films, thanks largely to Brad Bird's simple yet sophisticated scriptwriting. The film advocates creative independence, yet stresses the importance of community. It celebrates the artist, but destroys the artist's condescending and pretentious view of ""non artists"" as ""simpletons"". It praises high art and refined tastes, but sings hymns of praise to the simple pleasures of the common man.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film examines the role of the artist and the importance of those who support, finance, inspire, and critique him. It touches upon the artist's ability to inspire the heard through his own actions and how the power of the one and the needs the many inter-mesh. The film has several cute relationships, but director Brad Bird is smart enough to recognise their darker underpinnings. There are symbiotic relationships here every bit as dark as Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".<br/><br/>Finally, the film ends with a beautiful monologue by an egotistical art critic and is packed with both gorgeous virtual camera work, and romantic architecture, the Parisian landscape rendered in loving detail. As CGI allows animators to play with space, refine their shots and fine tune their virtual landscapes, there are scenes here which push camera work and composition to perfection. Here, every shot is perfect. Every camera move, intricate and precise. The long tracking shot which follows Remy as he navigates the catacombs of Paris is particularly beautiful.<br/><br/>10/10 – A smart film and a beautiful love letter to artists. Visually, the film is also divine. Pixar created realistic CGI plastic with ""Toy Story"", hair and wind effects with ""Monsters Inc"", water effects with ""Nemo"", metal and reflections with ""Cars"" and now here, with ""Ratatouille"", they tackle food and architecture. What next will they try? Air and vacuum?<br/><br/>Worth multiple viewings."

","There's a rat in the kitchen, what am I going to do? I am going to kill that rat thats what I am going to do! That is a line from a UB40 song. It is probably what I would have said before I saw this picture. However, Remy is such a cute little blue rat. I would never think of hurting him. However, in the kitchen of a restaurant maybe another story.<br/><br/>You could tell I was no débutante. Anyhow, my review of this film. I love Pixar animation films. I think they are great. This was no exception. The film had an excellent story with some great themes. Determination, follow your dreams, anyone can cook,hope, friendship,being creative. Cooking is a type of art form. It is wondrous to watch as chefs put together these ingredients in such a way as to make something the is both pleasing to the eye as well as the pallet. Ratatouille is very pleasing to the eye. We are introduced to Remy, the young determined rat, as he is trying to combine ingredients in a farm house that he is soon roused out of (see the movie , I am not giving it away). After sometime in the sewers of Paris, he finds the place to be able to express himself. There is such heart to this film that it is one that I have enjoyed watching over and over. I saw it 5 times in the theater. I thought it was head and shoulders above the Simpson Movie. Great movie. Go see it"
"TwentyCalls","9","4","6","29 October 2007"," In the league with ""The Incredibles""
","Another incredible movie from Pixar and Disney. It's a moving story and I would like to classify such movie as fairy tale. If you put in too much logic and expect something close to real life, then you'll probably not enjoy it. As a fairy tale, the story has an amusing start, an intriguing middle and an happy ending. No excessive rib-ripping laughs here. The emotions of all the characters in the movie are nevertheless very human. Perhaps too many sad moments. Never childish; so may not appeal to the very young. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and so did my wife.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that it is the powerful story that makes this movie stands out among the rest. I rated ""Ratatouille"" a notch below ""The Incredibles"" because if asked which would I watch again, I'll pick the latter."

","I will never look at the humble title dish the same way again. Beautifully artistic, non-cutesy animation, charming music and vocal characterizations, witty, snappy dialogue that is MUCH too sophisticated for children, TWO simultaneous success stories (1: true talent will out; 2: oaf makes good), a rocky-road-to-love story starring a very gutsy female, a terrifying but ultimately soft-hearted food critic, a cultured arch-villain, the mad competition for restaurant star ratings, overcoming the barriers of inter-species mutual mistrust and — above all — a celebration of those greatest of human inventions: good food and wine. What more could one ask? (A film of deeper social significance, perhaps, which explains my 9 instead of 10 rat-ing.) If you don't love this film you probably are dead.<br/><br/>One thing I haven't figured out: why did the rats come in two colors, brown and bluish-gray?

","In the last decade or so, beginning their incredible run with 'Toy Story,' we've come to expect nothing less than masterpieces from Pixar studios, and they've rarely  if ever  disappointed us. My favourite Pixar animated feature to date would probably be 'Monsters Inc.,' followed by 'A Bug's Life,' with the remainder of their CV not dwelling too far behind. Nobody in their right minds would consider producing a children's film that featured rats lurking around kitchens, and yet, not only is director Brad Bird in his right mind, but he's also made it work. Welcome to the beautiful city of Paris, France  the food capital of the world - where a young and aspiring rat named Rémy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) dreams of becoming a first-class chef, despite the complete lack of support from his family and human beings' natural aversion towards rodents. Welcome to 'Ratatouille.'<br/><br/>At the heart of every great Pixar film is a fantastic story, often simple but always funny and touching. 'Ratatouille' (pronounced, we are told, ""Rat-a-too-ee"") teaches us to always pursue our hopes and dreams, whatever obstacles or limitations are placed in our way. It was directed by Brad Bird ('The Incredibles'), who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. Though the plot is perhaps just a tad predictable, the screenplay is beautifully written, with an abundance of funny one-liners and colourful characters. Whilst Rémy refuses to eat nothing less than the best, his older brother Émile (Peter Sohn) will gobble down any garbage he finds, and his father (Brian Dennehy) assigns Rémy  due to his uncanny ability to smell the ingredients in any food  to become the colony's resident poison-sniffer. When Rémy fails in his attempt to steal fine herbs from the kitchen of a crazy old lady, he becomes separated from his family. The legendary but recently-deceased chef, Auguste Gusteau (Pixar regular Brad Garrett), who had inspired Rémy with his motto ""anybody can cook!"" appears before the rat as a shadowy figment of his imagination, offering him guidance and advice.<br/><br/>Thus, Rémy stumbles his way into Gusteau's fine-dining restaurant, now managed by the devious Skinner (Ian Holm). A lot of the physical comedy in the film comes from Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage-boy at the restaurant, with whom Rémy reaches a tentative arrangement: by hiding himself beneath Linguini's hat and controlling his movements by yanking at tufts of his hair, Rémy will be able to demonstrate his expertise for food preparation. But will he be able to accomplish this without arousing Skinner's suspicion? And can Linguini successfully win over meat and poultry chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), the most aggressive cook in the kitchen? Of course, they must then contend with Paris' most-dreaded food critic, Anton Ego, voiced with great relish by cinema legend Peter O'Toole.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Ratatouille' is a masterpiece. Of course, there still remain huge innovations to be made in the field of human animation, but the rodents themselves look absolutely fantastic. An early scene, in which a huge group of rats charge frantically towards the river, looks so incredibly realistic that I pity any audience member suffering from musophobia. Additionally, the nighttime panoramas of a brightly-lit Paris are nothing less than magnificent, with every minute detail of the city painstakingly translated onto the screen. The film is an exciting blend of comedic and dramatic scenes, and elaborate action sequences, each executed with care and patience. The foods all look delicious, as well. The scene in which the ruthless Anton Ego is rendered speechless by Rémy's delicious serving of ratatouille niçoise is handled exceedingly well, and I must admit that a tear came to my eye when the ""peasant dish"" swept the sullen critic back to his glorious and almost-forgotten childhood. I don't think the friends I brought along to the cinema would agree with my assessment, but 'Ratatouille' is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year."
"thinklogically","10","4","6","20 August 2007"," Make a new history and new future for Pixar and Disney
","I watched it a few hours ago and I could not help to stop thinking about this movie. Every scene was beautiful and incredible story and it was really funny movie. I believe I laughed almost an hour or more. Plot pace was quite fast so I felt that movie is more than 2 hours movie and enjoyed it very and very long.<br/><br/>Reason for saying this movie is make a new history and new future for Pixar and Disney. Because when people talk about the animation is for child only and then movie was not good enough for adult, this movie can shut them up. Most interestingly, when I watched movie in Malaysia cinema at 4.40pm show during weekday, I heard that adult are laughing around (let's just say) half an hour and kids are laughing around half an hour and they are laughing together around half an hour. It was very interesting experience. I watched movie alone so sometimes I felt bit sorry for kids beside of me because I laughed a few times when their not laughing so they did not understand why I am laughing at. So my point is adult can enjoy movie very much and kids, too. Adult should not have to lower down their expectation from the movie.<br/><br/>I do not know about what happen in the native English speaking country's cinema but I think it probably have same happen to them.<br/><br/>So I believe Disney and Pixar did it again for new generation of family movie.<br/><br/>There has one problem, maybe. Kids are not enjoy much than other Disney Pixar movie, maybe. I am not so sure about it. But, at least all the family member can enjoy it so it was good thing.<br/><br/>I highly recommended to anyone.<br/><br/>10.0 out of 10.0.<br/><br/>* added at 21 August 2007 I rated as 10 but it is possible to go down when I was watched it again. However, it will most likely stay at nine-point-something rate between 9.5 to 9.8."
"DonFishies","8","4","6","30 July 2007"," A great animated fable packed with enthusiasm and absolutely amazing animation
","After last year's horrendously average and overrated Cars, I was unsure how to approach Ratatouille. It looked impressive, and it looked like another great entry into the Pixar/Disney lineup. But then, so too did Cars. But something about Ratatouille struck me as immediate, as something that needed to be seen now and not simmered over later. And thankfully, albeit with a few minor flaws, the film comes out as being just as excellent as I could have hoped.<br/><br/>Ratatouille tells the story of Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who has a keen sense of smell. So keen, that he outright refuses to eat just about anything that his rat colony/family finds in the dumpsters or just laying around. He is put to good use as the poison checker for the colony, but still chooses to search out good food, and not just anything. He dreams of being a famous chef, but is hindered by the fact that he is a rat.<br/><br/>What follows is a bitter sweet story of just finding the place to belong. I will forego the mention of the various subplots and surprises, but I will incur that Remy does meet up with the lousy cook Linguini (Lou Ramano), and the two become partners in cooking at the famous Gusteau's Restaurant (as just about anyone who knows anything about the movie can tell you).<br/><br/>Even with its bizarre storyline, and even more bizarre main character, Ratatouille is a treat from start to finish. Never once did I not feel like I was watching something from anyone other than a master storyteller, and even at its most fantastical moments, Ratatouille warms with animated joy at just the thought of continuing the storyline. Unlike many other animated films that go around in circles over its simplistic plot and overused morality tale, Ratatouille takes its moral tale, and wraps it around all sorts of plot elements. Children will love it for how comical and cutesy it is, but the adults will love it just for how layered and dense the story is.<br/><br/>What it also packs is a wallop of enthusiasm totally devoid from almost the entirety of Cars. While the former moved along slower than animated movie I have ever seen, and was dull right to its very core, Ratatouille is exactly the opposite. It runs at just the right pace throughout the film, and each and every actor delivers their lines with finesse and conviction. They are devoted to these roles wholeheartedly, and are putting some actual effort into their lines. It may help that the majority of these actors are not big time Hollywood superstars, but what also may help is the fact that they all seem to have an interest in these characters and this story, and are not just in it for the paycheque at the end of the voice sessions. They are all clearly having fun with it. Even Peter O'Toole, who plays the menacingly wicked food critic Anton Ego, seems to be amused by his role.<br/><br/>In fact, all of the voice actors do great with their roles. Oswalt gives a great balance of naivety, desire and pathos to his main character. I know there was some trouble trying to market the idea of a rat trying to make it in the human world, but I think Oswalt's voice skills helped greatly flatten this idea out into something great. Ramano also does great as Linguini, giving just the right amount of struggle in his voice to truly make his neurotic character truly interesting. Supporting turns from O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofolo, James Remar, and in particular, Ian Holm, are all very well done, and help make the film truly wonderful. Their French accents are all quite amusing. I also liked the small addition of John Ratzenberger, always a great voice to hear in a Pixar movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that harms the film is that it runs too long. Director/Screenwriter Brad Bird had this same issue with his other excellent Pixar film (and Oscar winner), The Incredibles. Both pack in so much, and as a result, drag in places that should be more fairly fast paced. Here, these dragging scenes take place near the beginning (Remy does not meet up with Linguini until at least a half hour into the film), and part-way through the middle. All the elements are there, they just do not all add up into something blazingly fast paced. I can appreciate all of the little things Bird is doing to make the film appeal to more than just the children in the audience, but he almost lost me a few times doing it. A little bit of extra trimming could have helped avoid this problem.<br/><br/>The animation on the other hand, is brilliant. There is no other word to describe it. Just the one scene where Remy realizes that he is in Paris, and overlooks the entire Parisian skyline, is enough reason to see the film. It looks fantastic in every scene, and never does the beautifully rendered scenery or characters look any less amazing than they did in the scene before. Pixar has really fine-tuned their style over the years, and it shows in how astonishing these characters look, even down to the minuscule little details like a few stubbly hairs on Linguini's chin. It just looks that realistic.<br/><br/>On the whole, Ratatouille is not a perfect film, but it is still far greater than the likes of Cars or even this year's Shrek the Third. It was clearly put together so lovingly, and created with so much care that it cannot be seen as anything less than great. The animation, the story and the voice acting all come together to create what is probably going to be one of the best animated films of this or any year.<br/><br/>8/10."
"jdkraus","9","4","6","28 July 2007"," A new look at animation
","Since ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"", I haven't' seen a highly dynamic 3-D animated film. I entered the theater with an open-mind for ""Ratatouille"", and I have to say that this animated film has redeemed the name of animation.<br/><br/>The quality of the animation was absolutely awe-inspiring! The details of the characters were very creative and authentic; the fur on the rats looked like fur rather than computer-animated figures and the humans were in a very retro-styled fashion, matching Brad Bird's past ""The Incredibles"". But the thing that fascinated me the most with the animation was how well the action sequences were choreographed and how amazing they were to watch, especially with the scooter chase with Skinner and the rat Remy.<br/><br/>The voices were distinctive and talented; having no feel of a celebrity's voice being attached to them like Shrek. The story is on the childish side of the irony of a rat having a sudden, but beautiful passion of being cook of fine food, but like all other Pixar films, it has a good moral to it. The approximate time of the film maybe almost two hours, which is long for an animated film, but it, does not drag.<br/><br/>But the thing that bothered me with this was that it had two unnecessary scenes of guns. Personally, for a G-rated film, that's a bit over the top. And there were also some minor scenes of unpleasant death threats that some of the character's made to each other, as well as some inappropriate innuendos. It should have gotten a PG rating in my mind.<br/><br/>Otherwise, great fun and ""wow"" to Pixar animators. 9/10 -I'd be a little suggestive for your younger kids parents."

It's not just a kids movie.<br/><br/>Pixar does an amazing job with this movie, it's up with the original Toy Story. The character are entertaining and easy to relate to. Everyone can relate to wanting to do something and having someone tell you that you can't do it; everyone can relate to just wanting that one shot. Ultimately that is all Remy and Linguini want. The characters are also well flawed, Remy's desire to be a great chef almost gets in the way of his family and friends. Linguini has to lie to protect Remy.<br/><br/>This movie was more than I was expecting. A good story, well crafted characters, and comedy around every corner."

","The best comedies are not the funniest; the best songs are not the most melodic; the best actresses are not the prettiest.<br/><br/>I bring this up because there seems to be a criticism that RATATOUILLE is not the funniest movie Pixar has put out. It does, however, have the biggest heart (not the ""aw"" factor like ""Isn't that cute?"", but in the truly moving moments that connect to something deep, deep down inside us all).<br/><br/>For anyone to find a talent, a passion, and to be able to pursue it without having to hold back -- that is achievement at the highest, most godly manner, as if he or she has connected to God intimately because he or she has found his or her true calling and happily gives his or her life to it. We all dream of finding our purpose in life, and dedicating our lives completely to it...but it is rare that we do -- rare that we find it, rare that we pursue it, rare that we dedicate our lives to it. And for someone to be denied that chance -- not because of lack of talent or passion, but by being told ""you can't"" (for any reason) -- is among the saddest things in the world. It hardly makes life worth living. THIS is the real story of RATATOUILLE. <br/><br/>(Confession: I am a 45 year-old guy who shed a couple of well-deserved tears at this film. I am a sucker for someone connecting completely to his or her life.)<br/><br/>It is clear that Brad Bird lives for this message; THE INCREDIBLES touches on it equally well. His artistry indicates (to me) that he, too, has found his true calling. His life's mission seems to be to spread the Word."
"MacAindrais","10","4","6","3 July 2007"," A Feast For All
","Ratatouille (2007) ****<br/><br/>I'm not sure why, but I just can't allow myself to give Ratatouille anything less than full marks. As far as creativity in roles goes, its pretty standard dealing with humans (nothing new to animation there) and talking rats (linguistic rodents, been there done that). There are no talking cars or monsters or fish or super heroes. Ratatouille is an example of a classic storyline overhauled and directed at adults and children all the like. This IS a movie for everyone, young and old, rich or poor. To top it off, its without a doubt the most brilliantly piece of animated work I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The movie is at once elitist and proletarian. It takes the lowest of all creatures, rats, and uses them to defend intelligence and quality and at the same time ridicules snobbery. It makes the rats cute, but at the same time still unsettling, especially when seen in packs. <br/><br/>The film opens in the French country side, with a rat named Remy, our hero, jumping out of a window and then a freeze frame of him with glass smashing around him in mid air. Sound familiar movie buffs? It should. A direct homage to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is just the first of many salutes to other films right up to Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Remy gets separated from his clan and ends up in ol' Paris, which is stunningly animated right from the Eiffel Tower to the rotary and the cobble stones. To make a long review shorter, he meets up with the imagined ghost of the great Gusteau, who's motto 'everyone can cook' inspires the young rat. He is lead to Gusteau's restaurant, which has faded since his death, and is now run by a short temperamentally authoritarian chef. Remy manages to befriend a new kitchen worker named Linguini, who may or may not be Gusteau's son, who cannot cook unless Remy hides under his hat and uses some very interesting puppetry. Ratatouille takes classic character types and strips them down and removes the clichés and manages to deliver the unexpected. The film also takes those characters, their surroundings and the food they use to create their meals and animates then in absolutely stunning fashion. Every little detail is noted, from the look of a wet rats fur right down to the beats of water on fresh vegetables. The animation is nothing short of incredible.<br/><br/>Yes, Ratatouille uses big words that kids won't get - they will however get the point - and that is because this film is first and foremost, I think, for adults. The kid factor is just a side pot. The films defining monologue comes from a critic, who acknowledges the ultimate insignificance of a critics work, yet retorts that their work is made worth while by being able to influence people to try something, if even only a few. It also acknowledges that though not everyone can be great, greatness truly can come from anywhere. This monologue is perhaps the best ever given in an animated film. Like the rest of the movie, it delivers its point in eloquent fashion, but does it easily enough that a child can understand what its getting at. The movie is not overly hilarious . Its not always going for those big laughs. It finds joy in going for big payoffs in quality. Its a great story, and it never forces itself to be funny. That said, don't think that this movie isn't a laugher, there are lots of good little jokes that will have you smiling. And after all, its often more pleasant to just sit there smiling from ear to ear often than busting a gut occasionally.<br/><br/>And that is what makes Ratatouille so great. It truly is a film that manages to be ageless; defend quality through the lowest ranks while damning elitist snobs. <br/><br/>The critic's monologue was right: We can't all be great, but greatness can come from anywhere. And Bird and his team at Pixar chose the least likely of creatures to carry out that message, and I'll tell you, those rats get the job done.<br/><br/>4/4"

","Leonard Maltin in his glowing review of this Ratatat film calls Pixar, ""a class by themselveswho have carved a niche for itself like no other."" I agree completely. Every one of Pixar's films have an amazing quality which haven't been broken so far as yet. On top of being an animation studio at the pinnacle of greatness, Pixar also has to offer the best time at the theater with their shorts always preceding their films. Thus they offer a full night at the movie theater not seen since the classic days of cinema.<br/><br/>Ratatouille did practically the impossible for me. It matched and even exceeded most of my expectations. It had humor, a great story line, and moral message about being all that you can be and not being afraid to succeed or tell the truth. On top of that, it had some of Pixar's best animation to date. The views of Paris are exquisitely detailed and the details of the kitchen fantastic. But even more so the characters most especially the rats have a great look and feel to them that make them lovable even though they are well rats.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Remy, a rat with a keen sense of smell and taste who can't stand his life as rat which in his mind is equivocal with a thief. Remy draws strength from ads he sees of a famous cook named Gusteau. Although Gusteau is dead, he draws strength from him and even has an invisible friend in this Gusteau in his own mind. Gusteau then becomes basically a way for the audience to see the inner workings of the mind of Remy. Things really take off for Remy when he is separated from his family of rats and runs into the garbage boy of Gusteau's who can't cook, but is willing to work with the talented Remy to gain a name in Gusteau's restaurant. Neither have it easy as Linguini, the garbage boy, is looked down upon by the scheming master cook of Gusteau's, but a good villain is always needed even if he isn't a completely bad fellow. Another antagonist for our heroes is Anton Ego, a critic of the highest quality who sunk Gusteau establishment in the first place leading to Gusteau's early death. Ego isn't a true villain and has interesting depth, but what else can be expected of a character voiced by aging legend Peter O'Toole.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is another gem from the Pixar studio and not likely to unsaddled as the best animation the year. In fact this is among Pixar's best ventures yet.<br/><br/>Note: Fantastic exotic score by Michael Giacchino which evokes that Paris style."
"diac228","10","4","6","30 June 2007"," Much more complete than the average movie, Ratatouille is a 7-course meal providing nothing but the best in animation and storytelling
","The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if you watch it on an empty stomach. The folks of Pixar deliver what just might be the most complete animated film since Toy Story 2. By complete, we are talking the full course, not just story and humor. With flawless animation, a brilliant score, the best voice talent in ages, an excellent script, a nice story, plenty of humor, a dosage of romance, and a rather surprising amount of realism, and a heartwarming ending, Ratatouille is the best Cinderella story from Disney sinceCinderella. From the director of The Incredibles and from a studio that has delivered hit after hit after hit, it is no wonder why Disney spent so much money purchasing them. This was a tough-to-sell concept executed beautifully, poetically, and just might become the best film of the entire year. The only problem is that this movie sets the bar even higher for animated films from here on out.<br/><br/>Ratatouille follows Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat who wants to become a good cook instead of a good food thief (like his father and co.) and will attempt to do so with his special smelling abilities. After a mishap where he lives, he winds up underneath Paris, close to the restaurant of his mentor, the recently deceased Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Using the garbage boy of the ex-5-star restaurant Linguini (Lou Romano), he attempts to spread his talent of cooking. Conflicts arise when the head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) suspects the sudden rise of fame in Linguini's cooking and realizes his true worth. More conflicts arise when the only female chef becomes romantically involved with Linguini; Remy is having trouble returning to the lifestyle of a rat, and a well-known yet stern critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) decides to make a return into the spotlight.<br/><br/>What makes Ratatouille stand tall with some of Pixar and even Disney's best works is the heavily detailed animation, that results in some of the most breathtaking chases and scenes and also results in plenty of concealed visual humor (Check out the structure of Ego's office). From the hairs of the rats to the water flowing to the food that looks good enough to eat, this is Pixar outperforming itself in terms of computer animation. Then we have the best casting since Finding Nemo. Once again focusing more on talent rather than star power, we have an excellent cast of actors and actresses providing the voices. The standout performances come from Peter O'Toole (almost Oscar-worthy), Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Ian Holm, and Janeane Garofalo.<br/><br/>The problem with animated films nowadays is their inability to present a story without having to aim low for a joke or referencing the pop culture of the times. Ratatouille is a living, breathing storybook come to life, and this is thanks to the excellent writing of Brad Bird. Bird combines plenty of conflicts with humor, and also a dosage of realism in terms of the way things are run behind the scenes of a restaurant. Unlike previous summer flicks, Bird perfectly handles the multiple villains in the Cinderella story, which nowadays is a complete rarity (Yes, there is more than one ""villain"" in the tale). Clocking in at just less than two hours, it might be a bit long for tykes but after the rather slow beginning, the movie almost instantly picks up once the setting changes. While the humor isn't as sprinkled as in Nemo or Toy Story, it provides plenty of laughs as well as action, drama, and even a little hint of romance. Linguini as a Pinocchio-like chef provide some of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.<br/><br/>There just aren't enough words to describe just what makes this movie work, it is presented and handled with such delicacy, it keeps Pixar at the top of the animation kingdom, much to the disdain of Dreamworks, the other competitors, and even the animators at Disney. To craft a movie this good requires time, patience, attention to detail, and a desire to push the limits of animation and storytelling. There is no harder-working company in the movie industry than Pixar, and it shows with each and every single movie it has come out with since 1995; including some of the best films of all-time like Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Finding Nemo. If the competitors aren't taking notes right now, it is because they don't desire to be the best.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: You can only raise the bar higher so many times before not even yourself can reach it. This is what happened with Cars and Monster's Inc., and movies like Ratatouille are the reasons why. While the pacing and running time may be a turnoff for some, the excellent visuals and flawless storytelling more than make up for it. Like a full course meal, Ratatouille has a little bit of everything and much more. The Disney magic that was present back when Disney was alive is in full blast here, which is something that non-Pixar Disney movies lately have not been able to provide. Stop reading this and go enjoy the movie. Ratatouille just made Cars look a bit inferior as it becomes the best animated movie in years, and is potentially the best movie of the entire year. In a summer of sequels, a charming story about a rat with a crazy dream rises to the top of the quality heap."

And celebrate is what I'm doing after seeing Ratatouille. I cannot think of another film that was so full of life and emotion presented in such a stunningly beautiful way. Whodathunk a rat in a kitchen could be a promising premise for a movie? But with this particular rat in this particular kitchen in the hands of this particular film maker in this particular studio it WORKS! Ratatouille teaches us about fulfilling your potential and following your dreams, and ultimately shows us the joy that comes with excellence (which could be the story of Pixar itself).

I caught an early showing because I work there and went in with the feeling that it might be like Shrek: The Third or any of the other ""okay"" animated films I have seen in the past year. This movie is so different. It feels like you are watching a live action movie that has been painted with cartoon colors and textures. Everything is meant to look real and at the same time fictional. The characters seem more human than in most cartoons and more time is spent developing the attributes and emotions of each character. The part where they learn how to cook with each other is quite hilarious. You see the bond forming between the two, not like most cartoons where the characters seem to just get along out of nowhere. I recommend this feature to everyone, with the exception of really little kids(ages 4 and under). This has nothing to do with content, but it seems more mature than most Pixar/Disney films and they might lose attention quickly. Also the film is almost two hours long.....so prepare for a lengthier adventure than most!!!!"

","Finally an animated children's flick i enjoyed. The visual experience alone, makes up for a great time. Remy, the main character in the movie, has to be one off Pixars best animations. That being said, the entire movie is some of Pixars best work.<br/><br/>Over the past few weeks, different movies have come and gone, from all the 'threequels' to the 3rd penguin related movie in 2 years, Ratatouille is by far my favorite.<br/><br/>With a beautiful story, a tight plot, and incredible voice offers, the movies is a refreshment from Hollywood's incredible unoriginality in the past few years. I was particularly surprised by the joy and even amusement I received from watching this flick. More often then not, children's flicks, incorporate the typical fart joke and other assortments of toilet humor that children find oh so amusing for reasons unbeknownst. Ratatouille manages to stay amusing with out having to use fart jokes, but still uses humor that children can appreciate and enjoy. A happy ride all the way through<br/><br/>Part of the films originality comes from the wonderful use of animation to tell the story, from the various chasing scenes (you'll know them when you see them), to my favorite scene involving an incident with the health inspector, the movies animation takes you in and never lets go.<br/><br/>An original, amusing and extremely well done animated children's film. For those of you with kids, this is the must see movie of the summer. And if you don't have kids, watch it anyways, you'll definitely enjoy it.<br/><br/>10/10 - go see it."
"KeyonTate","9","4","6","17 June 2007"," A wonderful movie for the whole family. Intelligent fun for the parents, too.
","The film is a complex and skillfully executed animated movie. Editing is perfect, and of it would be impossible to cut anything - it all belongs there. The plot progression is gripping, and transitions smooth. Writing a detailed, complete review that does this little gem justice is close to impossible, since it would have to give away not one, but several, not entirely predictable, plot twists. So here is the short version.<br/><br/>On the surface, Ratatouille is a children's story (and kids in the audience were enjoying it, judging by their reaction) with a fairly ridiculous premise: a rat in the kitchen might be a good thing! But on closer inspection its numerous, layered themes run much deeper: it's a kid-accessible, sincere narrative about pursuing one's passion for something, about talent and its clashes with reality (credit and accolades do not always go to those who deserve it), about discovering one's own identity and having the resolve to assert it, about prejudice and how difficult it is to overcome, and, above all, about that old-fashioned virtue, honesty, even if it comes (as it often does) at a price. Ratatouille truly is a family-values film par excellance.<br/><br/>The tale recounts a story of Remy, a young rat, who has a passion for food and for cooking. He also has an incredibly discerning palate and nose, a talent which in his rodentian predicament, has very limited uses. Remy dreams of something more. In the great tradition of ""unlikely friends - yet best friends"" (Elliott and ET, Charlotte and Wilbur, Nemo and Dory) Remy's path will cross that of Linguini, an orphan boy in a desperate search for a job, and the two will have to battle adversity against all odds, sometimes with each other, and at times, despite of each other. Although it sounds like a typical stock plot, Ratatouille is not as predictable as might seem from movie's trailers available online, and (like Charlotte's Web) is by far darker than usual children's stories, which in this case is actually a good thing. Early on, for example, Remy (the rat) has to deal with death and the pain of personal loss. Linguini's life (the boy) too, has had its dark moments. Even the ending (without giving the details away) is a surprisingly reasonable, low-key compromise, rather than a straightforward ""happy ending triumph"" that fans of more traditional Disney solo productions may be accustomed to (think the triumphant endings of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and even Finding Nemo; not here).<br/><br/>The story itself is a canvas for a surprisingly progressive (for Disney / Pixar) social commentary, and poses numerous questions which parents will find themselves hard-pressed to answer easily (but it might be a good exercise). I suspect that many of the questions are there more for the parents, than for the kids. For example, Does one owe loyalty to one's family and clan, or to one's dreams? Which one should one give up, if decision has to be made? Is it OK to have friends who are ""different,"" despised by people in your social circle, and is it always easy? Is there a price to be paid for being faithful to oneself, one's friends, and being honest, and why one must choose to pay it. Ratatouille's numerous characters also tend to be more dimensional than in usual children's narratives. The ""good guys"" are charming and likable; and the villains (there are two), are cleverly drawn. For the kids, there is the more traditional stock villain (greedy, jealous and conniving), but for the amusement of grown-ups there is also the more complex, Anton Ego, a mordacious food critic, whose brief, but significant appearance contains a wonderfully humorous tribute to Proust's famous madeleine cookies scene in In Search for Lost Time.<br/><br/>There is a good measure of fast-paced chases, races, rescue-and-escape sequences, and rides which seem to be deliberately designed to be easily converted into interactive games and Disney theme park rides. The motorcycle-and-boat race, a clever, humorous pastiche taken right out of recent Bond movies, is a real tour de force of timing, and a dazzling display of computer animation, as is Remy's bumpy ride on turbulent waters of Paris sewers. My absolute favorite among the fast-paced sequences, is the ""coincidences"" kitchen scene, in which creative and clever use of kitchen tools and appliances evokes the bravura sequences from Michael Frayn's play Noises Off. Last, but not least, there are the visuals, and here too, Ratatouille delivers: the suddenly revealed, sweeping view of Paris rooftops and the Seine at dusk cannot ever be matched by mere reality; the image of a tiny rat contemplating this breathtaking view from the roof, in unison with the awed audience, adds the requisite poignancy. As far as children's films go, Ratatouille's ""magic moments"" are as magically wonderful as they get. This is a great movie for the whole family (for a longer version of this review, see my blog)."

","I have long been a fan of Disney/Pixar, and each new movie is better than the last. Although I thought it would be impossible to top Cars The Incredibles, they have done it again. Ratatouille takes the somewhat offbeat concept of a rat who cooks, and turned it into a truly enjoyable movie. As has become their trademark, Ratatouille was able to balance entertainment aimed at children and adults. There were many moments the children in the theatre found enjoyable, and many moments intended for a more sophisticated audience. Ratatouille also excelled at holding the audience's attention. My family and I laughed until we cried, but more importantly, it was a movie with heart."

","This is certainly a technically excellent and visually rich film. However, that's not a good enough reason to rate this film so high. 10/10? 9/10? It's a good film, I agree, but it's certainly not one the all-time greats.<br/><br/>It's a film about a rat who is a top chef because he learnt how to cook by reading a book. It's therefore a film for children. Unfortunately, my children, and many others sitting around us in a packed cinema last weekend, were restless by the mid-point. Despite it's great visuals, Ratatouille is just a bit boring. It lacks the excitement and humour of The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and Toy Story (1 & 2). Given this children's film struggles to maintain the attention of children (a recurring theme in many reviews on this site), it's got to be rated down.<br/><br/>As an adult, meanwhile, I was left cold by the unsubtle moralising, the ludicrous mix of accents, and the fact the restaurant, outside the kitchen, looked nothing at all like a top Paris restaurant.<br/><br/>Sorry.

"misssna01","10","7","13","18 June 2007"," delightful and fun film.
","One could easily imagine that pitching a film with a cooking rat as the main protagonist is not an easy sell. I can confirm this, because as much as I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of Pixar's fantastic offerings thus far, the idea of a sewer rat preparing French cuisine sounded... unappetizing. However, from start to finish, this unique story surprised me as I found myself drawn into the world of the intriguing characters fresh out of the imaginations at Pixar. A creative mixture of true-to-life elements and fanciful creativity, the journey contains the predictable moments one would expect of a tale of mice and men. But the added humor from the mind of Brad Bird (Writer and Director) and his colleagues provide the unexpected moments that make the story not just the run-of-the-mill cartoon about a rodent. The best element of the film however, is the running theme provided by the title of Chef Gousteau's cook book. The book that began the journey of our favorite rat Remy: ""Anyone can cook."" Leaving the film you will want to hit the nearest restaurant and sample something new off the menu, and feel inspired to reach for the unreachable - no matter who you are."
"thejoshualee","10","7","13","16 June 2007"," Good cartoon that breaks the rules
","Just got back from seeing it, a few things first to note:<br/><br/>1. As mentioned, the visuals in this movie are amazing. But more than that, for me anyway, was the audio. It's very rare when the sound in a movie impresses me, but everything from the skitter of the rat's feet to thunder to sauces boiling, it sounded fantastic, more realistic than real life. The music was very nice as well.<br/><br/>2. I don't know if a lot of people are going to like this film. The story has several threads and layers that the average ""Let's go to the movie and turn off our brain"" person won't understand or care for. In many ways the depth of this film has more in common with a graphic novel where subtle details are used to give large hints to character development, setting, and the like.<br/><br/>3. The food looks amazing. It's interesting that we accept so much in animation, but that's because the characters and cars and many of the settings have a stylized, cartoony look, but the food looks like real food from the way cheese crumbles to the oil shimmering on the surface of a sauce. It made me so hungry. Now for the story:<br/><br/>Remy seems to be the typical ""I have an impossible dream that I'll achieve through pluck and determination"" that's been seen in tons of Disney Cartoons, but there is a emotional and moral depth to him that makes him stand apart. The ideas of family vs dream are brought up, including the ethics of abandoning either side in favor of the other. Neither side is seen as good or bad entirely as Remy's responsibility to family is tested against his love of cooking. His father's worry and distrust of the humans is completely justified, while his dream being a chef is also justified, and the two seem incompatible. Cooking makes a surprisingly appropriate analog for a story about following dreams. The conflict between Remy, who has the talent, and Linguini who has the face is, again, morally deep and the stuff of good stories. Also, the question of selling a talent out for the cheap buck is brought up. There were a few times I wondered how they would provide a happy ending, but they did. Many characters go through an appropriate change that has you rooting for them, though not all of them do. A realism that sometimes, when the chips are down, people you thought were your friends will leave you, which makes the undercurrents of the importance of family much more pertinent. Much like the subject of the movie, the movie itself seems to break a lot of rules: There is an abundance of internal dialog, which is suppose to be a no-no, the main character is not only a rat, but a rat that makes some questionable decisions. Linguini starts out as an apathetic wannabe who transforms into a power crazy jerk, (before learning the lesson), there are a lot of very drastic moments of suspension of belief (pulling hair being able to manipulate the body for one). But like the food Remy cooks, it works and it works well. <br/><br/>bottom line, I loved it. one to ten I'd give it a 9.5. Not only one of Pixar's best, but one of the best cartoons I've ever seen. I hope that future cartoons can break out of the ""Shrek"" rut of simple gags and stock characters to present a more complex and entertaining show like this, but, again, I doubt it will do very well. Too complex and leveled for the average cartoon lover, but it will be part of my movie collection for sure (and I don't buy many movies)."
"nickdesigns","2","15","35","28 November 2007"," Another paycheck for Brad Bird
","So I just watched Ratatouille on DVD. Like Incredibles, I dismissed this as another lame Pixar movie and saw Spidey 3 instead(big mistake).<br/><br/>But I gave Incredibles a chance and ended up enjoying it a little more than I thought. So I thought the same would happen with this movie. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The story was boring. Really boring. Boring and predictable. Boring, predictable, and way too long. Incredibles had a deep engaging story that kept me hooked. Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere. Remy trying to realize his dreams of being a chef, and Linguini trying to realize his dream of not being a tool. It seemed like a good formula, well it would have if we haven't seen it in 2000+ other movies. And every 10 minutes they had to keep reminding us what's the plot of the story, because they were that bad at showing it.<br/><br/>The characters, oh god the characters. Flat and dull. They had no charisma, nothing unique about them, nothing that will make them stand out and join the ranks of greats like Bugs Bunny and Homer Simpson. Remy was just another big dreamer type. He works hard, get's knocked down, gets back up, and achieves his dream. Good for him, now what? He has the same backstory as about 1400 other Disney characters. And Linguni, the dude was a loser. A total loser, and he's stays that way through the entire film, and yet somehow he still get's to make it with the big-nosed chick. What was he there for? His only purpose was to make Remy look good. People say Linguini had very unique movements, but all he did was spin around a lot. What's unique about that. He had no personality, and he flaunted it. And obviously his voice actor didn't even care enough to try to make him at least sound interesting. Colette, she claimed to be a tough and sassy girl in a""man's kitchen"", yet all she did was fall for the biggest loser in France. Where's her self-esteem, they did absolutely nothing with her character. It's like Pixar isn't even trying to make us care about these characters. They're one-note and easily forgettable, soon to be pushed aside for the next bland set of characters, then the cycle begins anew. And my apologies to Patton Oswalt, he's one of my favorite comedians and people in general, but the voice acting was terrible. Flat and emotionless. They honestly couldn't just get guys like Billy West and Rob Paulsen. They would have made the movie 10x more interesting.<br/><br/>Even with the great story and characters of the Incredibles, the animation still kept the movie bogged down. Ratatouille was no different. Everything felt so mechanical, so chained down. It didn't feel fun and exciting. It just made me wonder if they weren't gonna put any effort into trying to make the animation fun, lively, and surreal, why the hell didn't they do it in live action. All it had was just some fancy camera angles, thinking that would compensate, well, it didn't. Pixar strives too hard to make they're animation look more realistic, so much so that it loses another key component, believability(spell check). They have these uber realistic atmosphere and these ultra-fake looking humans, that it clashes and makes the movie look even more fake than it is. It doesn't suck you into the world they've created, it spits you out maliciously. One of the things I liked about the movie TMNT, they built this dark, gritty, comic style atmosphere and built it around the characters, and it worked, you were in that movie, it was believable. Ratatouille wasn't.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I'm not surprised little kids like the movie, it was geared toward them, and they're the only ones who could enjoy it. All the adults that are saying this is the best movie ever, needs to retrieve their souls from Walt Disney's cold dead hands"

This movie has little of what Pixar movies great, and seemed more like your average, run-of-the-mill CGI flick.

The villain, the man of an ambiguous but definitely foreign race, has absolutely no development at all. You're originally lead to believe the other cooks with be developed with their own personalities, but they have absolutely none. Previous Pixar movies were greatly enjoyable because they were full of distinct, unique, hilarious characters, each with a definite personality. It would be hard to say anyone in this movie had a consistent or recognizable personality at all. <br/><br/>Furthermore, some plot points made little to no sense. When Remy becomes infuriated at Linguini taking credit, for example, he takes thousands of his rat friends and totally trashes the restaurant. I'm sorry, but what the *%#$? Did Remy actually expect Linguini to give him credit? Remy wasn't even showboating that much, he was flailing his arms trying to come up with an excuse that didn't involve ""A rat is the cook."" <br/><br/>Ego furthermore is a character that seems very unrealistic. The plot in the movie didn't ""develop,"" it just happened. It didn't try to pass itself off as believable, it just says ""okay, this is what happens, even if it makes no sense considering what we've told you so far."" The movie's heart is fake and shallow. It really doesn't make any real points. Full House made deeper points on Family, even at its worst. <br/><br/>I don't see how people can see this movie as fantastic. It's not bad, but it is completely and utterly forgettable. I was disappointed leaving Cars, but now I see that Cars wasn't that bad. It still dripped of hilarious, witty Pixar charm. This movie's writing seemed very unprofessional, sloppy, and lazy. The movie was rarely funny, never hilarious."
"jackbrugts","2","17","42","21 October 2007"," Technical perfection completely out of place.
","Let me get right to the point, i think this is one of the worst animation movies i've ever seen. Why do American movie makers think that things in Europe work like they do in the US. The theme is French, the people are too, it plays in a restaurant in Paris. Yet it has not even the remotest European charm due to typical American moralism and blandness. So i wasn't even surprised that everybody is speaking with an Italian accent, behave like they in a sort of mafia movie an orders get screamed around like in some kind of cheap American diner. This movie is technical perfection, but does not go any further then the outside of nice graphics. It does strike me that the voice acting of the linguini caracterer is completely out of place and not suitable. A comparison to flushed away needs to be made, cause of the European rat theme, but there's really no need, flushed away is funny, very smart, intellectual and for all ages, where ratatouille is probably only for children, and boring, stupid and way over the top for adults. O yeah the story........there isn't any, apart from a vague cliché. The botomline is that i left after watching this rubbish after 45 minutes."
"mikezexcel","2","18","45","3 August 2007"," Way overpraised ...
","What is it with the excessive overpraise for movies under the Pixar banner? I'll admit the company reinvigorated interest in animated movies a decade ago with photo-realistic visuals, clever characters, witty scenarios, and decent stories. Little of that was evident in RATATOUILLE. This movie was stale, uninspired, overlong and lacking in creativity.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that ""anyone"" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two ""human"" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>About the animation: Done in CGI hyper-realism, it elicits a ""wow, that bubbling pot looks just like a photo"" admiration that lasts about 5 minutes. By contrast, the end credits are accompanied by '60's-style Disney animation, and it is much more interesting. Maybe it's time for Pixar to turn the clock back."
"danjakubik","10","5","9","4 July 2007"," A unique and sophisticated animated film!
","""Ratatouille"" (2007) / Directed and written by: Brad Bird <br/><br/>****(Excellent) <br/><br/>This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Though it's largely a comedy, it ranks up there with some of Disney's best work, including Snow White, Bambi and Pinnochio. As usual, the Pixar digital animation is excellent and always improving in some small way with each new film. The step forward for this film, is water and how it's depicted in a very realistic manner. That's the small technical leap here. However, this is a rare film (of any genre), where all the right elements are done very well and all come together to make a unique and special film.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is a film with some surprisingly sly, sophisticated humor that goes beyond the expectations of the usual animated film. There's a surprisingly well written, humorous and touching story here, that probably connects better with adults than with children. Though there's plenty of action and humor children will find appealing, the humor and finer peaks of the story are more aimed at adults. I've rarely seen a film rated G that contains with such creativity and sophistication.<br/><br/>A young man begins work in a famous restaurant in Paris. Here he accidentally meets and befriends a unique rat that was discovered in the restaurant kitchen. This young man has a secret connection to the restaurant. This unique rat has an affection for fine food and a talent for food preparation. It's a story idea that doesn't seem to hold much promise to hold adult attention and interest for the length of a feature film. However, there are a number of factors that strengthen the story, such as well conceived and voiced characters and a fine attention to visual detail. <br/><br/>The look of Paris and food preparation is done with remarkable authenticity. The distinguished actor Peter O' Toole provides the voice of a hard hearted and egotistical restaurant critic. This character looks and sounds like a villain, however the real villain of the story turns out to be the current chef of the restaurant.<br/><br/>Two of the best scenes of the film are when the current chef is getting the young man drunk on wine, in order for him to divulge his secrets of success. The other scene is when the hard hearted restaurant critic suddenly has a childhood flashback upon tasting one of the restaurants famous creations prepared in a new way.<br/><br/>Though I think children will generally find this an entertaining film, it's adults who will most appreciate it's sophisticated, sly humor and amazing visual details. In an audience largely of families, I noticed a sometimes bewildered look on the face of a young girl sitting next to me during the film. It was at this time that adults better connected with the film than children.<br/><br/>Not to forget the lively music score, which really supports the humor and dramatic moments of the film. The film editing provides the right pace and rhythm all throughout the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ratatouille"" celebrates the preparation of and enjoyment of fine food with a surprisingly well conceived and written story and characters. This film deserves two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature Film.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended."
"staindslaved","10","5","9","17 June 2007"," Pixar cooks up another delicious entrée in an already impressive menu
","Pixar has definitely leveled off from there grand epics Finding Nemo and The Incredibles to the more simple story lines of Cars and Ratatouille. However while Cars offered little new to the ""fish out of water"" story, except for some fantastic animation, Ratatouille has many new things to bring to the table about chasing ones dreams and discovering your inner person.<br/><br/>As the story begins we follow the antics of a rat named Remy whose acute scene of smell gives him a very refined pallet for food but unfortunately his family only wishes to use him as a rat poison detector. In defiance of his father, Remy often enters homes to discover new foods and learn to cook. It is here where he idolizes the chef Gusteau and lives by his motto of ""anyone can cook"". Remy eventually becomes torn between his family and his dream's of becoming a chef and also struggles with the moral question of whether rats are thieves because they steal food from people. When the ""gig is up"" at the home the rats have infested they must flee to the city and Remy becomes separated in the confusion. Finding himself lost in Paris he discovers Gusteau's Restaurant which has had 2 of its 5 stars removed after the tragic death of Gusteau and poor reviews from food critic Anton Ego. This is where Remy befriends Linguini, a garbage boy of the kitchen who accidentally ruins the soup moments before it is served to a food critic. Luckily Remy's ""nose"" for spices salvages the soup and it becomes a big hit, potentially being the saving grace of the restaurant. The two decide to work out a system whereby Remy makes all the cooking decisions and Linguini...well...passes the two for human.<br/><br/>Though the animation here is impressive I fear it will be lost will the common audience. There's nothing big and flashy this time around, instead the animators at Pixar bring the city of Paris to life with wide scenes that have incredible depth and detail. Also the water effect which has plagued animators for years seems to have been perfected and for one reason or another they really want to stress that point. Watch how almost every character becomes absolutely drenched in one way or another. You will also love the creative points of view that are shown while Remy scurries through the walls of buildings.<br/><br/>The true breakout roll here is Peter O'Toole giving a tremendous performance and incredible depth to the character Anton Ego, a menacing food critic with dreams of closing down Gusteau's restaurant permanently. The character is both sinister and likable, stealing the show towards the end, and the emotionally poetic overture of his final review on Guesteau's ""little chef"" Remy is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>For such a simple story there are some welcomed surprises and the film bravely avoids a lot of family movie conventions and familiarities, daringly sending the audience to an unexpected, though entirely enjoyable conclusion. I cannot recommend this stunningly superb achievement from Pixar any higher and although few could defend this as Pixar's greatest work I bet a lot of viewers will comfortable discover it as one of their favorites, this reviewer included."

There are times you think you're seeing a real rat trounce down the streets of Paris. But what Ratatouille lacked that other Pixar cartoons didn't was a fun story line & great voice actors to compliment the animation.<br/><br/>The best part of the night wasn't actually part of Ratatoiulle.....it was the 5-minute short cartoon that preceded it. The alien characters in the opening short didn't say a word but conveyed so much more personality. In Ratatouille, Peter O'Toole was the only actor to bring life to his character. The other actors & writers failed miserably. That's usually where Pixar shines....making cartoons funny for adults & kids. Ratatoiulle didn't come close to capturing the personality of The Incredibles or Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. Kids all over the theater were bored out of their minds.<br/><br/>I don't know how in the world this has been so revered by viewers & critics. It's the worst Pixar movie to date....BY FAR."
"steverino171","7","6","12","3 July 2007"," This First Quality Film of the Summer
","Brad Bird's ""Ratatouille"" is a rich, textured film that explores several important themes while sustaining a strong moral core. The lead character, Remy, a rat with ironically refined tastes in matters culinary, embodies the film's adamantly pro-democratic theme of ""anyone can cook"" while overcoming anxieties about himself and his relationship with the humans of the restaurant that despise him (because he is a rat) or distrust him. Bird handles these matters with care and deliberateness, thus providing a powerful primer for the film's target audience on American democracy and the egalitarian can-do notion at its core.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille's"" ideas about democracy revolve around Remy's relationship with humans. As it were humans are a necessity for Remy. He needs them to do what he does best: cook fine cuisine. He needs them to provide the ingredients. He needs them to handle the chores of cooking. He needs them to appreciate the food he creates. Thus, he forms a reluctant partnership with a young kitchen worker named Linguini who can provide a link to the world of fine cuisine and do his culinary buddings. Since their relationship must be kept secret (for obvious reasons), they become close friends, depending on each other for their dreams.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Remy's relationship with humans is not always so positive. In one particularly revealing scene, Remy's father tries to scare the prodigal rat into returning to the nestwhere he belongs. He brings Remy to a rat extermination shop where several rat corpses are displayed in the front window as advertisement. The scene frightens Remy into seeing that humans are indeed a threat to him and his kind. However, Remy soon sees through his father's intimidating tactics and recognizes that fear is a tool that imprisons us and keeps us from growing (an apt thematic turn considering the current culture of fear our news and broadcast media conveys). Remy refuses to succumb to his father's mistrust of humans and bravely confronts them in order to bring his dream of cooking wonderful foods (of giving something to the world rather than taking) to full fruition. He is an intrepid little rat with the courage to pursue his selfless dream.<br/><br/>What a beautiful message this is. What a wonderful lesson for a child to learn. Unfortunately, ""Ratatouille's"" box office draw will undoubtedly pale in comparison to Michael Bay's ""The Transformers"" and its ilk. This is unfortunate. Of course, ""The Transformers"" serves a purpose too. It initiates its young male audience into the world of consumerism, materialism, chauvinism, and violence. It reminds us that there are terrible threats to our world and they must be conquered through violent action. It also teaches us that young men can and should find contentment in consumption. These are all important parts of American culture as well. So, I guess it's up to you as to which kind of ideals you want your child (and yourself) exposed to. That's the beauty of a democracy I suppose."

He often sneaks in to an elderly woman's house to get the only food thats good enough for him but soon find himself in trouble. While escaping with his fellow rats, he gets lost and ends up at a restaurant in Paris. Remy gets in touch with the restaurants garbage man who is very untalented and learn how hard it is out there for a rat with ambition.<br/><br/>I used to hate rats but no more. Ratatouille touch me like no other animated movie. When a cartoon masterpiece is celebrated, it is often only the special effects you remember, but this time, the amazing script is the key to pixars latest masterpiece. The effects is still brilliant thou. When i read that the director Brad Bird only was an executive producer of The Simpsons, it makes me realize why the show blew me away under ten years. Ratatouille makes you sympathize with the rats, only a genius can do that."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","7","2 August 2007"," Why an animation feature deserves inclusion in IMDb's top 100
","Before I saw this movie, I kept telling myself there must be a reason why an animation feature can attain such a high ranking in IMDb (has actually dropped slightly since then, to #65 and 8.5/10). Having now seen it, I do see why, although I still don't see any sense of ranking animation together with ""real"" movies that have human actors. But I would certainly give this movie a #1 among all the animations I've seen.<br/><br/>First off, Pixar is indeed impressive as ever. With the depth and light-and-shade, some scenes look more real than real scenes shot with a camera. Facial expressions are also just as good as real. And there are so much admirable details in each frame that you'll miss more than you can take in.<br/><br/>Behind the astounding visual are characters and stories rich in creative imagination. It is a cartoon and the movie never pretends to be otherwise. But it's impossible not to marvel at the ingenious plot -the ghost of a top chef, or just a fragment of the hero's imagination, helps that hero, a rat, to become a top chef by working, in turn, through a young floor-sweeper who does the actual cooking. How? Through hiding in the young man's chef's hat and pulling his hair as one manipulates the strings of a marionette. Now, why didn't I think of that! And then, there are many layers in the plot, not contrived or pretentious, but just offered to you naturally as part of the story: family value, office politics, aspiration vs reality, peaceful co-existences between races (in this case, humans and rats). There are of course poignancy and uplifting moments, which are, however, never over done. This is a sensible movie that entertains you hugely, moves you gently, and makes you think a little as you go along.<br/><br/>I am not an animation person but this one gets my vote"
"RandomPerson123","10","4","7","30 July 2007"," A Tour De force for Francophiles and Pixar fans everywhere!
","After last years somewhat disappointing Cars, Pixar and Brad Bird have renewed my faith in movies with the delightful Ratatouille. The title itself is an actual French vegetable soup, and also that the narrator is a rat! Unlike other movies featuring rodents, the rats are realistic, and Remy actually washes his paws before cooking, unlike many Americans chefs I'm sure. Because many people on the forums are grumbling about how bad this movie is, let me tell you something; European culture is much different and sophisticated than here in America. There is a tender subtlety to this film that makes it speak to an older audience than previous films. So there isn't any violent action and anything of that kind, who cares? This a sweet, soft-spoken movie that hearkens back to when movies could be nonviolent and just as good. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking."
"ntsci","Null","4","7","25 July 2007"," a delight
","This film was a pure delight. <br/><br/>I loved the juxtaposition of garbage eating rats and fine french cooking. I loved the idea of turning the nasty reputation of rats on its head and making one rat's quest to create the center of an amusing story.<br/><br/>It was hilarious. Yes it was absurd, but then most of the funniest jokes are absurd -- what Disney used to call plausible impossibilities. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'd group it into the top 250 films of all time... too many other great films, but it was a pure delight for a Sunday afternoon at the movies. It is by far the best film I've seen this year so far. <br/><br/>My children (boys ages 8,11 & 14) all enjoyed it very very much."
"Polaris_DiB","10","4","7","17 July 2007"," More scrumptious than eye-candy
","Okay, first things first: scratch ANYTHING you've read in any review, private, published, online, or otherwise, that worries that children might not be that interested in this movie; the presentation I went to was filled with people of all ages, and they all sat right through the end credits. I'm getting really offended by reviewers' habits of passing off successful character development as something children wouldn't be interested in, as if children don't have the basic cogent powers to understand stories, but even if that were the case, this film is remarkably kinetic and exciting--it even is a little slapstick.<br/><br/>But that's just the spice. The meat of the matter is that Pixar has followed up their still-good-but-somewhat-formulaic Cars with something really special, a pretty original movie about a rat named Remy who wants to be a cook and all of the things that get in the way--not just a world disgusted by rats, but a personal life that doesn't support his dream. In positive Pixar land, that means Remy will have to make new friends and discover the value in himself before he's able to ultimately work it all out, but believe me, it's all enjoyable and fun in the process.<br/><br/>I've written a few and read a million reviews on various Pixar films, and there's just no way around mentioning the animation. Though computer animation has vastly improved over a very short time and other companies are beginning to reach Pixar's level, Pixar's animation is still distinct and original, and a great mainstream marker with which to base any other animated endeavor. In this case, the motion and energy seems to fill the frame as much deep and far as it does close and personal, and the team has built a world of details. Every Pixar feature seems to be an improvement on the last, and at this point the production company is getting uncannily... real...<br/><br/>But what I think I like the most about Ratatouille is the use of Anton Ego, the bleak food critic who presents one of many major challenges of Remy's culinary skills. I can't help but read this as Pixar's comment on criticism itself, and the twist is that when something like this work is made right, it not only pleases the adult sensibilities but gets into the true heart of what entertainment like this is meant for: the child inside. The moment of Anton's food taste is a perfect moment of epiphany, handled well by every trick these master craftsmen know.<br/><br/>Ratatouille pleases, and also leaves enough to tidy us over until next year's Wall-E. It's hard to imagine it getting any better, but these guys are strangely good at that.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"blueshortguy","10","4","7","2 July 2007"," A Great Animated Story, Well deserved rating
","When I first had heard about Ratatouille, I knew I had at least wanted to see it, but whether that meant in theaters or to wait for it on DVD, I was not so sure (I was not going to go out of my way just to see this film). I was definitely not as excited about this movie as I was for previous Pixar films.<br/><br/>Well, an opportunity had come for me to go see it with a friend of mine and we chose to see at a matinée time, which not only meant cheaper tickets but also the pleasure of watching an animated film with a theater full of families and their little children.<br/><br/>First, the animation of the film was as good as ever for Pixar films. The stylization of the characters really adds to the experience as a whole, as it helps to immerse the viewer into the film.<br/><br/>Second, the voice acting of the film is really tremendous. I felt that each of the characters had their own voice that were unique and real. The voices weren't forced upon me as celebrity voices (as what happens in other movies such as Shrek and some of Pixar's other movies {Toy Story, Monster, Inc., etc.})<br/><br/>But, it is the story that really makes this film. If you think about it, this film is closer to a two-hour film than most of Pixar's other animated films ( The Incredibles and Cars run about the same time as well). Yet, despite what I think can be a long running time for an animated film, I never got that feeling that I do with some films, which is ""When is this film going to end?"" or the occasional muttering to myself, ""This movie needs to get to the point."" The story hooks you in from the beginning and never lets you drop throughout the entire film. The ending is highly satisfying, not disappointing, what I consider to be a perfect ending, and leaves you walking out of the theater repeating, ""That was a good film."" <br/><br/>All in all, Ratatouille is a superbly animated film with tremendous voice acting and a story that hooks you to beginning to end. I loved it, my girlfriend's mom loved it, and all the children I saw loved it as well. It is a film for all ages and one that will leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>While I don't consider this film to be as meaningful nor epic as films like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Godfather"", ""Ratatouille"" is in a different genre and as such it seems to be the top of its genre, bar-none. It is my favorite Pixar film to date and I can't wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD. With that it deserves the 10 out of 10 stars."

","As a critic, when i saw the trailer for this movie I thought it would be terrible and that it had no story. Now i've learned to never judge a book by it's cover. I sat down in the theater, hoping to be paid a little extra to see this. I really despised this flick and that went away with the first scene.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is the best, and i mean the BEST, animated movie to come out this year. Shrek 3 isn't even in the same class as this movie. Ratatouille is very enjoyable and keeps you watching the whole time. The rat was very interesting on its opinions on humans and how his clan though humans were. It was very interesting movie and Pixar even added in a little short before the movie begun, as they always do.<br/><br/>Let me start with the bad. Let me say this is not a movie for LITTLE kids at all. I sat in the theater and about 15 children were crying the whole film, and not one laugh and most of them starred at me when I laughed at the stuff they didn't understand. This movie has a lot of scary scenes in it and a lot of sadness that your 5 thru 10 year old wouldn't be able to take. So i want to advise you not to take a child under the age of about 12, not because i dislike little children, just that you don't need the drama of your kid crying.<br/><br/>SOME GOOD. The movie is for mostly adults as the jokes are not much as slapstick but merely adult actions and sayings. Young kids wouldn't apprehend half the funny stuff.<br/><br/>In the end, Ratatouille made my day and I love it and i cant WAIT till it appears on DVD.

If you are looking for a movie for the whole family to watch, this is the movie you are looking for. Its heartwarming, and its a good laugh even for adults. The animation was outstanding, and the characters really come to life and touch your heart. After seeing this movie, you will think of rats and cooking in a whole new way.

","I also had the fortunate opportunity to attend a pre-screening yesterday at Century City, CA. I was very impressed and moved by this film. It's definitely better than Cars, Monsters Inc, and A Bug's Life.<br/><br/>The screenplay was brilliant, as was the comedy, animation, the Frenchish musical score, and the voice acting. The movie, most importantly, also had the heart and soul that we've come to love from all the Pixar films.<br/><br/>When you read reviews about people going into tears by the film's end, it's not because the movie was dramatic and tear jerking. It's because the movie was just so utterly satisfying. The mouse was also the symbol of happiness that we, as an audience, can identify with. He represents our universal love for food, art, and also giving back to the world with a generous heart. So in many ways, it was like a Rocky or Cinderella story for Remy. By film's end, he spends the rest of his life doing what he loves to do, no matter how dumb it may appear to be. And that is why the film was pretty moving.<br/><br/>By far, I felt a bit hesitant whether to give the film a 10 because the story, although marvelously written, is a bit lighthearted compared to the urgency and scope of the ones in Toy Story 2 or The Incredibles. But at the same time, the film is so sophisticated and has a universal feel that it seems like it could be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Either way, I fully recommend it. I'm sure by the time the 200 or so critic's reviews come out, the film will at least average in the A- category. That's how good it really is. =]"

","Ratatouille reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Last year, when penning out the review for Pixar's last film, Cars, I wrote, ""Let's decide that this can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one."" I finished with a suggestion for ""Pixar to go sit in the corner where it can hide beneath its dunce cap."" Well Pixar can come out now, because it has redeemed itself with Ratatouille. <br/><br/>Pixar's return path to the throne is led by the likes of a sewer rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). Remy has a taste for the finer things in life, shunning the scavenged garbage horded by his father and the rat colony. He steals away to the kitchen and the French chef, Gusteau's, cookbook, ""Anyone Can Cook"", whenever possible, sleuthing gourmet cooking in secret. This, however, leads to the rightful owner of the borrowed kitchen discovering Remy red-handed with the cooking utensils. Havoc is wreaked and suddenly a rifle appears, ousting Remy and his rat colony from their country living for good. But in the chaos of evacuation, Remy is separated from his family and marooned off to the city of Paris, popping out of the sewer to arrive at the very restaurant of his most admired chef, Gusteau. <br/><br/>Here the tales of Remy the rat and Linguini the garbage boy (Lou Romano) intertwine. On Linguini's first day at Gusteau's, he collides with the soup pot, sloshing half of it to the ground. Before any of the chefs notice, he starts refilling the pot with any and every ingredient within reach. Admiring the kitchen from his minute, mouse-sized hiding place, Remy witnesses Linguni's frankensoup. He maneuvers to the scene by means of acrobatic rodent scurrying and puts his culinary instincts to work. It isn't long before Linguini notices, watching as Remy dices at vegetables and tears at the herbs, sprinkling them with zeal into the now delicious soup. An idea is hatched between the two after the night is through. If Remy could somehow cook for Linguini in secret, then Remy could play out his dream of becoming a gourmet chef and Linguini could hold his job. <br/><br/>Of course, as when Mr. Incredible attempted to relive the superhero glory days in secret, hiding a sewer rat in the confines of a gourmet kitchen is no easy task. Though Mr. Incredible was dealing with much more weighty circumstances for an animated film, which is the limb found lacking in Ratatouille. The Incredibles, the animated benchmark in mastery and Writer/Director Brad Bird's first attempt with Pixar, handled more solemn themes than the chasing of one's dreams. Its characters juggled middle-aged crises and marital boredom. They felt trapped by a beaming postcard family. Such themes appeared in Little Children, where adultery and sexual catharsis reigned king. But Mr. Bird managed to channel such discontent into a whirling, comic book world of superheroes. The colors, adorable animation, and Oscar-winning sound jostled the little audiences into soaring contentment, while the adults were offered an honest, smart story to sink into. Ratatouille isn't lacking in either of these categories, as the animation is as adorable as ever, the sound as bombastically rousing as before, and the story clever and humble. But it's the maturity of its themes that's absent. This isn't a middle-aged crisis; this is a rat playing puppeteer to a freckled teenage chef. <br/><br/>But disappointment over Ratatouille not surpassing the likes of the best in animated film-making is hardly a criticism at all. It very nearly is a compliment. Mr. Bird has proved that he has a supreme knack for finding the animated in the droll. Ratatouille could very easily be filmed using live-action counterparts. Think Garfield in the kitchenick. But by dreaming up the entire affair through the computed neurons of CGI animation, a liveliness is achieved that would otherwise be ignored. Mr. Bird has made rats adorable and French cuisine not annoyingly pretentious. Such feats are magnanimous. And along the way he managed to tell a warm tale of friendship, romance (not between the rat and the boy, mind you), and the joy of cooking. <br/><br/>-Samuel Osborn"
"Illymovies","4","7","16","24 August 2007"," Whose Paris is it anyway?
","I recently saw this movie because I thought it would be cute movie, rats, mice, pigs, fish...monsters...they all can be so cute. I thought the movie was far from magical. This movie had problems because it tried too hard to combine things that are hard to combine such as: Rats, cooking, Paris, the English language and in the same time humor. Biggest overall disappointment was how Paris was introduced, unfortunately in a very American manner as the so called city of lights and high cuisine. I don't think the essence of Paris was captured in a nice way, and since the setting was in Paris, this influenced the whole movie in a negative manner. Also, speaking French-English doesn't help much with creating a french atmosphere at all. I liked the rat, because as always, humans look a bit creepy when animated in this manner. At one point, I was a bit grossed out by the rats because although it's just a cartoon, and it's supposed to be cute, I think I find mice sort of cute, but rats can be very big, and as cute as you try to make them it may still gross some people (like myself) out. The humor was poorly done: it borrowed a lot from other movies, and I found the jokes forced and not so funny. So, Pixar ran into a little bit of trouble in this movie because they tried to go in unfamiliar waters so to say. They tried to find an original story, and I guess with all the popularity of cooking shows they thought it would be a good idea. However, they could've tried harder if they wanted to capture Paris in a good, romantic manner rather than an American cheesy manner (no pun intended cheese-rats :)) Make it funny in a more subtle way make the characters less boring and more dynamic. Paris could be a great setting for a cartoon if done properly. Unfortunately, this was not accomplished and the result is thus mediocre at best. If you want to see a beautiful animation in a very Frech spirit then I recommend the Triplets of Belleville."

","Ratatouille is the kind of animated movie that mesmerizes you with its details, inventiveness, and story.<br/><br/>The subject matter is simply a genius idea.

The dialogs are strong and well thought out. The scenario impeccable and won't let you go once its starts. The voice acting is superb. All of it, pure Pixar.<br/><br/>On an interesting note: apparently, they finally got the hang of animating wet fur, and seem pretty close on getting it for wet hair.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can find is that Skinner and Anton Ego are both designed a bit too strongly on the ""evil"" side, which is not a habit for Pixar.

Remy meets a young wannabe Chef at a restaurant who find out Remy is a cooking rat and has him help him in becoming a master chef. Linguini's boss Skinner knows something is up and sets out to expose him Skinner also exploits and commercializes Remy's late idol Auguste Gusteau buy selling many different products with Auguste's image on it. It's not so much a comedy but it has a great story like many other Pixar movies it proves that animated movie don't have to be that funny to work it' one of the few pixar movies i have seen in the theater. The ending is very happy and it show rats in a good light something that almost never happens there's also a subplot of Remy's family's who don't think rats should be clean or coexist with humans. It is a great family movie that shows how it's not bad to be different and unlikely friendships can work out. This was originally not going to be a Disny movie it was going to be Pixer's first movie without Disny before the company's got back together. Ps. there is also a mock buster movie called Ratatoing that i haven't seen yet but i plan to and review."

"ConStar8788","7","3","5","2 August 2008"," Visually stunning, but story was a flat soufflé...
","My wife and I, huge Pixar fans both, came into this movie with high expectations given what critics had said about it.<br/><br/>Visually, the critics were spot-on. Much of the movie feels as if it is not animated at all. Within 10 years of so, Pixar will have us believing they work work with live actors, I'm sure.<br/><br/>But technical proficiency does not a masterpiece make; there must be a good story to tell. And this movie teeters on the brink of not having that story.<br/><br/>Assuming ""Ratatouille"" was made with children in mind, most children below age 10, maybe even age 12, won't get this movie. They'll love the cute rats and cheer for the heroes, but will miss the nuances of the story.<br/><br/>What hurts this movie's accessibility is a soup with many ingredients: Thick accents, an uninteresting secondary hero (Linguini), a villain (Skinner) who is not adequately developed and back-storied, and a plot scenario that never seems to be able to create a sense of urgency. I can easily imagine a lot of youngsters wondering what exactly the big deal is.<br/><br/>It doesn't help matters that the role of Linguini is fitfully written and voiced by an actor without much experience; Lou Romano was just a bad pick. Ian Holm's turn as Skinner could have been done much better.<br/><br/>Janeane Garofolo's Colette isn't properly back-storied, either; it's amazing that this movie can run for nearly two hours yet still leave so much on the table in regards to its characters.<br/><br/>There is some good, however. Patton Oswalt is great in the title role, and Peter O'Toole's exceptional turn as Anton Ego left me wishing he'd had a bigger role. Brad Garrett's Gusteau also gets too little screen time.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie doesn't rise to the level of greatness found in some of Pixar's best films (""Toy Story 2,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars""), but it isn't a total bust, either. The word ""charming"" has been used to describe it before and I guess it fits. Better for grown-ups than kids, and definitely for a time when you're not needing to get an adrenaline rush from your movie."

"Pavel-8","9","3","5","4 August 2007"," Pixar does it again, for everyone.
","""Ratatouille"" is the latest computer-animated release from Pixar, the company that has produced the best animated films over the last decade. The odd title is the name of vegetable stew and doubles as a pun on the main character, a rat named Remy.<br/><br/>Remy is no ordinary rat though. He resides in France amidst a colony that lives as rats do, thriving on the garbage and remnants of others, Remy is the exception because he has a finely-honed sense of smell and loves cooking. Through a series of fortunate events, Remy finds himself in Paris at a fine restaurant, where he learns how to interact with a kitchen boy named Linguini to create magnificent meals. Things of course get complicated, as Remy attempts to balance his passion with his family, and Linguini must handle being a celebrity through no talent of his own, while dealing with a sinister restaurant critic.<br/><br/>Like all of Pixar's work, ""Ratatouille"" looks phenomenal. The rats in particular look good, with fine detail paid to fur in various states. The humans are not the most hyper-realistic creations seen on screen, but neither are they intended to be. This is a cartoon, and the artists seem to know that, because most of the characters border on caricature. The slimy French chef is ridiculously short and sports a pencil-line mustache. The critic has long and angular features that scream evil. Even though the movie is made with the most modern of technology, it is a throwback to the classic days of Disney and Looney Tunes, when merely a glance at a character would explain everything about a character. The bad guys look bad; the good guys are goofy but likable, and the gray characters share attributes of both, leaving the viewer guessing for a while.<br/><br/>One thing that separates ""Ratatouille"" from most of its Pixar brethren is the pervasive kinetic energy. Plenty of other movies, like Cars and The Incredibles, were drenched with action and movement, but it feels different here because the scope of the movie is centered on a rat. When you watch Remy race through a kitchen or up a building from close-up, it feels much wilder and more dangerous than watching a human make the same thirty-foot trek, which is appropriate since it is more hazardous for a rat to make that trip.<br/><br/>The question about all Pixar movies is twofold: how well does it play with kids, and how well does it play with adults? I suspect that Ratatouille may not be as accessible to kids as most of the rest of the Pixar library, because many of the characters are rats. Rodents are not as marketable or over-the-top memorable as a giant furry blue monster or an innocent little clown fish. Nor is the story quite as simple as some others. But the pace is brisk enough, and the story is understandable enough, thanks in large part to the brilliant animation, that kids should still enjoy the movie. Adults should enjoy it too, with the fine images, clever humor, and various twists and turns of the story. On the whole, ""Ratatouille"" is not as memorable as ""Finding Nemo"" or either ""Toy Story"", but it is good enough to be tucked right behind them with ""Monster's Inc."" Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for the best family film of the summer. What the heck, call it 8 of 10."
"mirosuionitsaki2","9","3","5","23 July 2007"," Something Smells Ratty? Never Thought I Would Had To Say That
","During the first few minutes of the movie, perhaps ten, I thought, ""Looks like this is going to be a dull movie of the life of a rat."" Viewing more of the movie, I think, ""This movie can be believable. Anyone can cook."" This movie does kind of give you that message. That's what the movie is basically about, showing a rat cooking.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic movie to see! I really love how the setting is widely based in Paris, and all the characters have a French accent. Everything seems better that way. You can tell someone lives in Paris instead of speaking English without the accent. If that were to happen, it ruins the entire movie.<br/><br/>It's funny how the rat didn't know that he has been living under Paris the entire time. Since at first, he and his clan lived in the house of an old lady, who seems to be having a lot of plants near her which could have given you the idea she was living somewhere in the country. Now that I have seen more, that idea is lost and they're living in Paris.<br/><br/>I thought it was clever how the rat could control the guy with his hair like a joystick. It seemed so original. I also love this human and pet relationship. It's cute and heartwarming. Other than the typical movies about a dog and a boy and the boy passes up a one billion deal just so he can keep the dog because he's family. If that were to happen it would be so pathetic I would cry.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for everyone, young and old! Unless you are offended or disgusted by rodents, then do not watch this movie because that's basically the main spice of the story. This movie is what you can say, a five star movie. Actually, a nine star since the personality of the chef is too similar, also the critic. Seems like something you would find in too many movies.. the personality."
"puffball97","8","3","5","22 July 2007"," Bon Appetit for ""Ratatouille""
","""Ratatouille"", Pixar's latest animated flick, may not rank in the same caliber as ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"", but it is a tasty, entertaining movie that serves a touching message, like all the other Pixar movies do.<br/><br/>If you think that movies about packs of rats are horrifying, then think again. Yes, you will see thousands of rats running wild, but these animated rats serve a far different purpose. These rats do not destroy mankind and eat people, and these rats are so benevolent. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), the gray, furry main character, is different from the rest of his clan, and is the most intellectual rodent of them all. Remy is so tired of scourging garbage, and wants to cook in a French restaurant after stealing legendary chef Auguste Gusteau's (voiced by Ray Romano)book, ""Anyone Can Cook"" in the home of an elderly woman that drove the rat pack away with a shotgun. His father (voiced by the ever-burly Brian Dennehy) does not approve of that, and wants him to accept the fact that he is a rodent unwanted in the human world. His brother Emile, the chubby, brown animal, approves of Remy's desires, but isn't nearly as picky as Remy is. Like the rest of the pack, Emile is only too happy to eat any garbage there is.<br/><br/>Once Remy gets from the sewers to the restaurant, Gusteau's, he sees Gusteau's ghost, which gives him guidance on how to be a great chef. You see, Gusteau died of a broken heart after the evil food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole voicing it with pure gusto)took away one of the five stars. Ego's scathing reviews can put any restaurant out of business. At the restaurant, Remy hides under the hat of bumbling garbage boy turned chef Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and Linguini can only cook well if Remy is around to pull his curly, red hair or gnaw at him under his clothes. Also at the restaurant is Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), the only female chef who is at first reluctant to reciprocate Linguini's romantic interest in her, but then they fall in love, and Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm), the venal head chef and owner of Gusteau's who wants to do away with Remy, his rat pack that invade the kitchen near the end of the film, Linguini's sloppiness, and market Gusteau's products as fast or frozen foods. And Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, as always, brings comic relief to his characters, here as the mustachioed maitre d' Mustafa.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, messages abound. For instance, Ego remembers eating ratatouille as a little boy and decides to give it a good review and then lightens up his dark image. Note that Ego is definitely drawn darkly. But the real message of the movie is that when you are a lowly rat, you can rise to your status, go beyond it, and your clan can too.<br/><br/>All the actors are in fine form for their voice parts. Oswalt is humorous and affecting as Remy. Garrett and Garofalo don perfect French accents for their characters. Dennehy gets into character as the tough father. Ratzenberger, as I said before, does his usual Pixar shtick. Holm brings menace to his role. But it is the reliable O'Toole who really enjoys the part as the dark, brooding critic, and does the best voice work of all, outdoing all the rats. <br/><br/>Although this a G-rated movie, I would not recommend this to very young children. Skinner tells Linguini ""Welcome to Hell"" as he hires him at the restaurant. There is a lot of wine drinking, and in G-rated movies, alcohol, smoking, and the aforementioned cussing are not used in such movies. And small children may be frightened at the sight of swarms of rats and then dead rats in one sequence. I did admire the upbeat messages of this movie such as what it's like to be a critic or rat, and I am being a critic right now, fair, but not lenient or evil like Ego. However, the thousands of rats together can be a put-off for many. Still, a good film, and the best part of it was the restaurant and the drawings of the City of Lights, and you feel like you want to travel there and eat at Gusteau's.<br/><br/>And hopefully in the near future there shall be a Gusteau's somewhere in Disneyworld, but don't count on rats cooking the meals."

","Ratatouille is, in my point of view, the very best of Pixar (and Disney's) work yet! It was funny, cute, astonishing, thought-provoking, wonderful, lovely, charming, and more.<br/><br/>The animation was, by far, the best of any animated film ever. The amount of detail on every pot or pan, the individual ripples on the water, the reflection of the river on the bottom of the bridge, the thousands of hairs on each moving rat...the list goes on and on of what they have perfected! The hair in this film is especially well done and flows better than any other. As I was watching this film, I looked for any bad qualities in the animation - and found none. Ratatouille is by far the most realistic and best-done of any of Pixar's work.<br/><br/>The beauty of the story is unparalleled in this film. By the first 10 minutes, you were already feeling sad for Remy as he struggles on his journey under the streets of Paris. The plot, although perhaps a little difficult to follow for some small children, was fluent and didn't jump around as some movies do. The dialog was also sharp and efficient, which is a cause for celebration!!! The voice work in this film is magnificent. Because they didn't use actors just because of their resumes, but for their actual voice work, the characters are more real and are easily related to. Linguini (Lou Romano) in particular didn't sound as if he was reading off of a script. If only all films could do that! The humor is quick and snappy and very well done. Brad Bird's genius is superb! Most of the humor is physical comedy, so both adults and kids will laugh at the same thing. I laughed out loud a lot of times, and I found it great that the audience was laughing so hard! Go see Ratatouille. You won't be disappointed, I promise!!!"
"eschetic","8","3","5","7 July 2007"," Wonderful mindless fun - awfully good mindFUL fun
","RATATOUILLE, the latest deservedly successful Pixar entry in the animation sweepstakes is effortlessly the best summer movie for families who want an outing that won't insult the kids and won't go over the heads of the adults. It really does have all the elements for cross-over cartoon success: cute fuzzy characters, front loaded (but ""comic"" - no gore and no one dies despite many shotgun blasts and talk of poison) violence, physical discomfort (as the ""little chef"" and his human counterpart work out their communication system), sexless romance (the human and the girlfriend he's desperate to impress) and a comic villain who the fuzzy character can defeat repeatedly in beautifully plotted farce choreography.<br/><br/>The capper, of course, is that the film also wants to be an allegory on people being judged on their ABILITIES rather than their appearances, being *honest* about those abilities (the fuzzy little guy is a great natural and self-trained cook, the human is neither) and the importance of TEAMWORK (the real trouble comes when egos get in the way). So far so good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it also has a massive caveat to the allegory and the enjoyment (knocking two points off the rating for me): rats in the kitchen. Well, um, yes, that will give some people pause if they actually think about what they are seeing (adults are inclined to do that). Rats are legally verboten in most places of food preparation - and it has nothing to do with anything that is their fault. They ARE cute and fuzzy, but they also may carry ticks and fleas which frequently carry disease. Living in less than cleanly places, they walk through places and things with high bacterial counts. Unhealthy.<br/><br/>The film is brave enough to realize they have to address this little problem - the baggage more sophisticated viewers who are flocking to Pixar's best work WILL being in with them - and so the film backs their comic villain (his initial defeat over ""the will"" is far to quick and ""tossed off"" to be as satisfying as it should be) with a restaurant health inspector who is comically dealt with temporarily, but since the authors couldn't actually kill him off or believably convert him, they were stuck for a predictably happy ending.<br/><br/>In a plot twist which young audiences will have to really scramble to follow (actually they may not care, but their parents who will have to explain it to them if they do will need to pay attention) they settle for a wise, if slightly melancholy one.<br/><br/>Does it matter? Not as much as you might think, but it does keep what comes very close to being a classic from true greatness and leaves the rightly enthusiastic audiences with just a very, very good film. Don't miss it - there is so much clever execution to revel in - but be prepared NOT to check your mind at the door. This is a film which might be more fun if you could, but will leave you with much more to think about when you don't, even if it undercuts the allegory and some of the fun. That in itself can be very satisfying."
"Argemaluco","9","3","5","7 July 2007"," This is Pixar's return to greatness.Excellent film
","I suppose Pixar had some pressure during the making of Ratatouille for two reasons:to recover some credibility the studio lost with Cars and because of all the animated films which attract little kids with the realistic animation,but without the creativity and imagination Pixar has showed from its first efforts.Luckily,the director of Ratatouille is the great Brad Bird,whose work in the TV series The Simpsons,The Critic and King of the Hill and in the movies The Iron Giant and The Incredibles is simply brilliant.Ratatouille is at the same level of that great works and it's very fun,funny and creative.One of the things I appreciate on Pixar movies is that they use voices they complement the characters without caring about the popularity of the actors.Patton Oswalt is perfect on the voice of Remy;Ian Holm is heard sinister on his villain character.The animation of Ratatouille is amazing but,on our days,we are accustomed to see wonderful animation,as we could see on Shrek the Third or Over the Hedge.But,the story this movie tells is so good that I could forget I was watching an animated movie,and that's something great for a kids film.The main character is a rat and this movie shows the nice and relative sight of that hated animal.Maybe,Bird put that as a challenge to the spectator to show that when the film is so fun and the story so good,the spectators forget their prejudices.Another great element this movie has is that some themes and narrative tones are much more mature than on another kids films.The only fail I found on this movie is that,near the ending,there's a typical cliché.But I can excuse that.Ratatouille is a great movie which is funny,emotive and never boring.After Cars,which was a little disappointing because it was not as good as the other films made by Pixar,Ratatouille represents the great return of an excellent animation studio."
"RCWjr","9","3","5","6 July 2007"," Computer animation taken up a notch
","It is one thing to take the animation up a notch, as the film does fantastically. But they have also increased the sophistication of the story telling.<br/><br/>Right on par with Bird's other films for Disney/Pixar, Ratatouille makes excellent use of characters and story. There is enough to keep the kids entertained (the usual Pratt falls, chases, etc), as well as an ever growing sophisticated humor and story telling that opens up the general audience to enjoy the film, not just the kids.<br/><br/>Back in the 2nd golden age of animation (mid-late 80's to late 90's) Disney was able to tap into a wider audience by providing state of the art animation with more complex stories. As the computer age was ushered in, once again Disney rose to the occasion a long with Pixar. Though with their last outing CARS, they took a step back, here with Ratatouille they regain the momentum again.<br/><br/>The strange thing about Ratatouille is there is no easily marketable tie-in toy. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Disney folks from trying to peddle stuffed rats. But for the first time a film of theirs has to totally sell itself by story alone and that makes this a very successful movie in my opinion. It does succeed without the tie-in.<br/><br/>Voice work across the board is spot on. There are no highly recognizable actors lending voice talent to remove you from the world. Ratatouille creates a world that you stay within. This could bring about similar voice casting in the future where some known voices are used, but the leads, as is the case here, are filled with mostly unknowns.<br/><br/>Great job overall!"

Ouch.) Animated films are getting hard to judge and harder to sit through these days. As the quality of animation gets higher, the pool of ideas gets lower. it seems we have more and more talking penguins, fish, and Shrek rip-offs (Heck, from what I've heard, Shrek3 was a Shrek rip-off). Ratatouille succeeds in bringing something new to the table. Brad Bird directs, so like The Incredibles, this one is more for the adults than the kids (Suprising as it is G rated) but that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's still talking rats and there are many well constructed prat-falls to hold their interest.<br/><br/>The movie was not as funny as I had hoped, though it still is genuinely funny at times, but what held me was how much the film sucked me in and had me really caring about the characters. I barely worried about the logistics of a rat being able to read and cook and control Linguini from under his chef's hat. The graphics, when I noticed, were breathtaking. The food and the ""tasting"" animation looks wonderful.<br/><br/>There is a great voice cast as well. Remy is well animated and I just love that little guy. Patton Oswalt did a great job. Lou Romano managed to convey awkward yet well-meaning in a way that borrowed a little from Jon Heder. He has some great scenes with Janeane Garofolo who plays hard-edged Collete. Peter O' Toole has a wonderful bit as the creepy critic (animation style straight out of Tim Burton) Anton Ego.<br/><br/>I was happy that there weren't that many digs at the French. There still are, and I'm a touch disappointed that both the leads speak in completely neutral American accents, but test audiences have to be pleased I'm sure. Ian Holm is nearly undetectable as the villainous super-stereotypical French head chef Skinner.<br/><br/>I like that Remy the Rat can't talk to any of the humans including Linguini, something that always bugged me in most of the other animated movies involving animals or people talking in different languages (most irritatingly Pocahontas). It's of little consequence to the review but it's a little personal preference note. Ebert includes those so why can't I? <br/><br/>The film meanders a little between the second and third acts but the conclusion is adorable and hilarious. I love the little touches to the animation and the story. This film was clearly a labor of love, not profit, though it'll acquire a lot of both to be sure. An A-"
"Astralan","9","3","5","2 July 2007"," Phenomenal
","This is an interesting film for a subject. First off, its a Brad Bird film, which is hard to compete with. Secondly, it's a Pixar flick. Third, it's rated G! How many films this year so far have this rating that all genres actually can find positive comments about? The crew that produced this is enormous. The money that went into this would probably is phenomenal (but I can't find a price on the total yet). Disney and Pixar know a cash cow when they see one.<br/><br/>However, something strange happened to me during my first viewing of this film: I found myself detached from it in some strange way. The color work was excellent, the texture and feel was superior, the characterization impeccable. So what was it? The movie works on all levels, but there is a subjective aspect that I think interferres with the total immersion in this instance: 1. Not many people have an affinity for wild rats (except Willard), and 2. A geek (with an American dialect) that ends up being a totally incompetent heir of a famous French chef. Sometimes it felt like Brad was attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole.<br/><br/>Not that its a bad thing, this is definitely a treat for all ages. The plot is simple: Sewer rat with his higher olfactory abilities applies it to garnishing food to achieve top honors with local critics. The pace doesn't leave you wanting; the continuity doesn't leave you wondering; the beauty of the animation doesn't leave you skeptical. Really, I can't recommend this enough for anyone with or without a family. I just can't put my finger on it though... it just leaves me curious.<br/><br/>Another thing... I alway like to comment on the audience reaction to it in the viewing audience: Even with all the kids, they were engaged and didn't squawk throughout the movie, but also there was a lack of genuine surprise or laughter at the more poignant comic events, which makes me feel I'm not alone in my thinking here. Rats. Food. Restaurants. Somehow, that just doesn't mix for me."
"lambiepie-2","10","3","5","1 July 2007"," Refreshing....Attractive....Touching...A wonderful film!
","Ah, to be an apprentice at Disney --- and to come full circle. Brad Bird is that person and for all of those who are out there that think the odds are against them in such a dog-eat-dog world of entertainment, just mapping Brad Bird's career and his latest installment of Ratatouille should make you get up and not allow anyone to stop you from what you can do! It doesn't matter how old you are, Ratatouille is the film you have to see this summer. It is cute, funny, refreshing...in this summer of big money sequels. And to coin a key scene from this movie -- watching Ratatouille took ME back to a time when I was six or seven years old watching Walt Disney Films on TV when Walt oversaw the studio. Ratatouille is a film done in the tradition of the Walt Disney Company -a well thought out, family film with hope, an unlikely hero, fun and heart. Ratatouille is right up there with the Walt Disney legacy films. Bravo.<br/><br/>Ratatouille's story is a story of prejudice, triumph and cheer about a rat with a talent in his keen sense of smell and in gourmet cooking, and a big dream and he gets lucky, and even though you might have a few reservations about ""rats"" in a kitchen (I did!), that's what makes this film so wonderful - it'll bring your 'imagination' and 'fantasy' back - and not the reality of ""hey, there are disease ridden RATS in the kitchen!"" Disney Animation was always on the forefront of that. Remember those days...those carefree, childhood, imaginative days? No? Then go see this, you'll be happily reminded.<br/><br/>Threre isn't enough praise to give to the animators at PIXAR here as well, the characters are well developed and drawn out and they have captured Paris wonderfully and puts you right there. You cheer and clap at this film but best of all, you laugh - with you and yours. This IS a family movie indeed that doesn't hit you over the head with that notion. And that's a good thing. Go see this....it's a lot of fun!"
"baseballfanjm","10","3","5","30 June 2007"," Brad Bird and Pixar's best, and that's saying a lot
","Ratatouille is the best animated film made in the US since Beauty and the Beast. Believe me, that's not a put down against American animation. Pixar has ensured that America has put out top class films for years now (ever since traditional Disney films have fallen in quality), and Ratatouille is the best one yet.<br/><br/>It is the most mature Pixar film yet. No, not in terms of mature content (it's G-rated through and through) or in thematic elements (there's nothing here that will frighten or confuse the youngsters). Its maturity comes in the form of how Bird is willing to acknowledge that, yes, audiences appreciate smart films. This is a SMART movie. It presents a situation that a weaker filmmaker would exploit for cheap gags and obvious plot turns, and makes a hilarious, touching, and all around extraordinary film out of it. The writing and direction are top notch. The animation is the most gorgeous, some of it the most creative, that Pixar has turned out yet.<br/><br/>Bird combines these elements into an absolutely wonderful film that is unconventional, beautiful, and just plain fun.<br/><br/>Edit- Jackhorrorshow, please watch movies before casting any sort of judgment. You are very, very wrong about this movie's originality."
"curlyman217","8","3","5","29 June 2007"," Amazing! A feat in animation!
","I love good animated movies. I love 'Finding Nemo', 'Monster House', 'Happy Feet', 'Monster's Inc.', 'The Incredibles', and 'A Bugs Life', but 'Ratatouille' blows them out of the water. Ratatouille was amazing. It didn't lack in story. It didn't lack in comedy. It didn't lack in amazing animation, and it was ruthlessly cute. This is one of the movies that you go to for your children, but end up staying at for yourself. It was simply astounding. I think that all the voicing was great, with a little exception for Collette's accent, which wasn't quite up to par for me, but who cares? The rest of the movie is great enough to make you forget about anything like that. The satirizing of the French is simply hilarious. It is just a terrific movie, and I will definitely be seeing it again."

","This was a great movie for my son and myself. I just graduated culinary school a year ago, and the terms were foreign to me back in the beginning of school. But, now that I am trained, it was refreshing to see a cartoon movie that properly used terms such as ratatouille, saucier, sous chef, etc. and to actually know what they meant. I actually suggested some peers from culinary school to go see it. What a great movie. I will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection when it's available.<br/><br/>Have a delicious day,<br/><br/>Chef Shiane"
"ElijahCSkuggs","10","3","5","29 June 2007"," Prediction: Pet Rat Sales Sky Rocket!
","Being a gigantic fan of Vermin and Gourmet Cooking I just had to see this. Pixar is back with another fantastic, funny, warm-hearted adventure that is really going to stand the test of time. So far the reviews for Ratatouille are unbelievable and I don't think they'll ever let up. And ya know what, this movie deserves all the praise it's gonna get.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is the story about a little rat named Remy. Remy is basically your regular looking rat. Though Remy is a little different. What separates him from his fellow rats is that he's got a special talent. Remy's little schnoz is incredibly fine-tuned. He can smell this from that with no problem whatsoever. Well, this amazing smelling ability gives him fantastic ideas when it comes to food, and eventually cooking. What follows is a timeless tale where Remy and his pal Linguini take to the kitchen to resurrect a once world re-known french restaurant. Will they satisfy the food critics? Or will they get fried?<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a perfect movie-going experience. I really can't find anything wrong with it. Entertaining situations led by unique characters with amazing voice work. Every environment be it the Paris backdrop, an Old Lady's backyard or even an awkward chef's pad is absolutely stunning. Ratatouille isn't just for the wee ones either. Pretty much all the jokes are adult-level humor. Obviously you got the slips and falls and one-joke characters that the kids will love, but so will the grown-ups. The writing is top notch stuff, some of the best writing around without a doubt. I can't recommend this flick enough. Bring the entire family and have a great time."
"michmovieguy","9","3","5","17 June 2007"," Another Pixar Winner
","I saw Ratatouille last night at a sneak preview. It was very entertaining. As to be expected with Pixar films, the animation was incredibly dense with amazing attention to detail -- particularly water -- but the script and story were also top-notch. Voice talent was great; Patton Oswalt is a funny guy and I can see him having a nice career in animation in addition to his stand-up. The nice cast surprise for me was Peter O'Toole as a food critic. He almost singlehandedly steals the show, but there's enough humor to go around. A fun, sweet movie.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed Brad Bird's other films, and Ratatouille is another feather in his cap."
"nightbiker-1","8","3","5","16 June 2007"," Slow start, but a VERY good movie
","This movie takes a while to get started -but to that note, there is a LOT of material imparted -its not boring, and what amazed me is that even in a theater full of children, they were obviously engaged in the movie -not the usual restlessness you generally see with a movie like this, and a very young crowd. The animation was (as expected by Pixar) excellent, the detail was the usual fantastic level we've come to expect. We went to the 'sneak preview' showing, and I must say that even though it started slow, the story was very fulfilling and had an emotional ending (which, while this would also be 'as expected' it was pulled off very well). It truly earned its 'G' rating -it wasn't loaded with innuendo like so many of them are these days, and while the dialog had a decided nod toward the adults in the crowd -not dirty, it just wasn't strictly aimed at kids, so you didn't see many adults just nodding off while they waited for the ending. Lastly, its been YEARS since I've attended a movie (and never in an animated one) where the entire theater burst into applause at the end. People sat all the way through the credits (my wife and I always do anyway -especially to catch the often included little 'bits' at the very end -and we're usually the only ones left by that point). Overall a very rewarding experience, and I look forward to adding this title to my DVD collection when it comes out."

","Okay, my employers keep a few pet rats in the office (caged of course). They're fairly cute (when they're not crawling over your food and stuff). Additionally, they subscribe to a newsletter for rat owners published by Debbie ""The Rat Lady"" Ducommun, one of the people Pixar consulted with to get a proper look for the rats.<br/><br/>As such, Ratatouille was a company outing for us. Hey, free movie preview, food paid for by the boss. Pixar. What's not to like? I found the film hilarious. Yes, it's about rats in a kitchen (blech!), but the way they handled it was great (especially the scene where the rats are ""cleaning up"" in the kitchen).<br/><br/>As to the storytelling itself, the film was good, but not great. It was a bit slow in some areas, then proceeded to jump around rapidly in others.<br/><br/>This is likely because of editing and timing choices for the film.<br/><br/>The film is still eminently watchable, it's just that in a few cases, the changes brought about by the story come up in a rather jarring way."
"don-554","1","34","111","3 July 2007"," Sorry to disagree...
","I've seen (and thoroughly enjoyed) every Pixar film - even the shorts - up until now. I was excited to see Ratatouille - as was my daughter who has devoured all the previous Pixar films via repeated, satisfied viewings. Ratatouille is horrible. My daughter was so bored that, while normally rapt with one of these movies, half way through she didn't want to watch it anymore. She hated it. And I laughed twice in the last 10 minutes and maybe once before that.<br/><br/>It's just not that entertaining. Please be prepared to look beyond the hype and see a film thats entertainment value comes from it's maker and not from it's story. If this was anyone but Pixar, it would be getting trashed."

","La ratatouille niçoise is a vegetable stew. Its name comes from ""ratouiller"" (""to shake"") and ""tatouiller"" (""to stir""). That Brad Bird tries to pass off ratatouille as a casserole should tell you exactly what he thinks of those silly enough to shill out their money for his latest ""masterpiece""!<br/><br/>But Bird-Brain lost me WAY before that! How does Remy know how to read? How can he identify foods he's never stuffed in his face? Granny blasts the holy hell out of her house to try to blast Remy and Emile to kingdom come?! Come on! And Remy just happens to wash up at his idol's restaurant? How convenient!<br/><br/>If someone doesn't claim to be Gusteau's progeny within two years of his death, the place goes to Skinner. Huh? Gusteau (or at least his ghost) is shocked to learn that he actually has progeny (given just how porky this pig is, that really IS a shock)! It won't take a genius to figure out that Linguini is The Chosen One, but why would his mother disclose this to Skinner instead of to Gusteau's lawyer?<br/><br/>When The Chosen One doesn't give Remy the credit he thinks he deserves at the press conference, he lets the colony have at the food! Having learned his ""lesson"", The Chosen One lets Ego in on who made his delicious ratatouille! All of this is beyond dumb!<br/><br/>Which brings up another plot-hole-you-can-drive-a-tank-through: after the press conference, Linguini forces Remy to take a ""time out"". Remy returns to the restaurant, but after it's closed. How did Linguini manage to cook that night without Remy? Don't ask Bird-Brain that, or his little pinhead will explode!<br/><br/>Ball-Busting-Bitch Colette falls for Girly-Man Linguini? LOL! The less said about the other idiotic clichés Bird-Brain tries to pass off as characters, the better.<br/><br/>I can't believe the praise the critics heaped on this given the pretentious screed Bird-Brain shoehorns into Ego's review. The film looks spectacular, but, as Uncle Walt's ghost would have told Bird-Brain, the ""100% Animated"" tag he obnoxiously tacks on at the end does not mean 100% CGI!"
"rptb","3","13","37","3 July 2007"," Worse Pixar film yet
","Let's start with a positive....The Pixar short before Ratatouille is brilliant! Now the negative, Ratatouille is definitely too long for younger children (trt: 1:50), and the story is certainly too ""deep"" for a 4-7 year old. Also, not that I'm a prude, however, a certain type of film is expected from Pixar/Disney when it is rated ""G"". Why my child needs to be exposed to an old lady running around the house shooting a shotgun at a ""living"" creature is beyond me. I'm sure the creative types at Pixar could have come up with a way to make the point that she wanted the rats out of the house without taking the easy way out and having her shoot at them with a gun. I also think that Pixar should stay with animating non-human characters (cars, fish, toys, etc), they seem to struggle with making the human characters ""human"". Bottom line, if you are a fan of Pixar, as I have been, you may be disappointed, with the price of taking the family to the cinema, I'd suggest waiting for this to be released commercially."
"cadfile","5","7","17","9 July 2007"," Very Disappointed
","I had a decision to make. I had time to see one movie on Sunday. Either Ratatouille or Transformers. I was never a fan of the Transformers show when I was a kid. So I read various reviews on the two movies on non-IMDb websites to get a gist of both films. Unlike IMDb, both films were getting positive but not great reviews over all. Ratatouille had far more positive reviews than Transformers so I picked Ratatouille.<br/><br/>Simply put, Ratatouille is just average at best. The animation was nothing spectacular. I guess the novelty of Computer animation is wearing off. It was pretty close it not the same as the old style cell animation.<br/><br/>No matter what tricks or special effects a film uses, it doesn't mean anything unless the story is good. The story in Ratatouille was just average. It was cute in spots but tedious in other places. A lot of the supporting characters were played up only to be discarded quickly and the main villain had no setup at all. You only knew he was the bad guy because he had the standard bad guy sinister look - that was it.<br/><br/>An animated feature film should have some truths inside it. It should touch on the real world with real emotions and Ratatouille missed it in a big way. Rats around food is just gross, even cartoon rats, especially if the animators spent months or years to get the look ""just right"". Maybe if it was dog trying to cook but a rat was just wrong.<br/><br/>The best animated features are those that contain at least a nod to the adults in the audience who brought their children to the show. Remember in The Incredibles, the superhero family had real family issues to deal with. You could turn to an adult sitting next to you and say ""Ain't that the truth"" or there could be the inclusion of jokes that kids find funny but adults really find funny because they were directed at them. Ratatouille had none of this. In fact the film wasn't that funny.<br/><br/>Brad Bird get credit for at least taking a chance with the characters and the plot but the execution missed for me. I was very disappointed."
"billion_mucks","5","4","8","19 December 2007"," Pixar's More Mature Tale: A Charming Travel for Identity
","""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's most intelligent, mature and delicate work of all it's way and experience. I had a laughing time with Nemo, I particularly didn't enjoy the Incredibles, but with Ratatouille Pixar reached new heights. Animation for adults, hidden in a package for kids.<br/><br/>¿Why would you explain love scenes, a cook that was in jail, a cook that ran away from home, a cook that is a gambler? Because adults can enjoy its subtleties and innuendos as kids enjoy the plain and open jokes. Besides the beautiful, vivid voice work, there is an excellent approach to food as art, food as passion. We enjoy movies, some enjoy video games, Remy enjoys food as an art, passion and identity, with different smells, countries and tastes. But the fact that a rat, filthy creature, enjoys this, makes the movie an interesting tale.<br/><br/>This karma of humanizing every little bit of what's inhuman gives a blatant irony: humans in the film are caricaturesque and are the less developed of all. The positivism of the film, the life they give to the characters is just one part of the story. Graphics excel in the movie: the fact that we want to taste that crumbly, hot bread or eat that elite Roquefort and cherries is impressive, going from the adjusted human expressions to the dynamic of the film, how people move and act.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is a nice, charming tale. With superior graphics and voices, and a nice message we can say that if Pixar continues this path, things are going to be very different in the Animation Industry and we adults can take our kids to the movies and be so excited like them as well."

","Pixar's latest animated entry should satisfy the most discriminating palate. It's critics will say it's just another fish out of water buddy movie. But I don't care. In a summer, so far devoid of any originality, this movie is refreshing and fun. The story is easy to follow. You know who the good guys are. You know who the bad guys are. You laugh because it's funny. Not because it's added humor to amuse the adults who had to take their kids to a Saturday matinée. I get a little tired of the targeted humor and having to stop and explain to the kids why I thought it was funny and they didn't get it. For the most part Pixar films have been void of ignoble humor. I liked this film as much as my boys, (10 and 13). This Rat has a quick pace, danger and intrigue. It's chock full of positive messages and family values. I didn't cringe and most importantly I didn't fall asleep. I read comics when I was young watch the Flinstones and Jetson's and Rocky and Bulwinkle and I feel this 3D animation is just another upgrade. At the root of every movie animated or not is the story and this story is solid. I give the latest rodent in the Disney family a meaty thumbs up."

"H_Spengler","3","6","14","9 December 2008"," I don't get why this is so popular
","I don't get it. After such awesome films like ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monster's Inc."" you think you could trust on Pixar to put out top notch animation, engaging characters and a great story. I'm not sure what happened with this movie, because only 1/3 of that equation makes it....the animation.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get too in depth with the story, which itself is pretty dull, because there's enough reviews that do that. Basically it's about a rat who can cook, and the human he uses as his puppet. <br/><br/>There are plenty of characters in this movie, and yet you manage to care about none of them. Pixar, Disney, heck even Warner Brothers have proved time and time again that it's possible to make a movie involving animals (no matter which animals they were) that you care about, along with a compelling story that holds your attention throughout the entire thing. They failed massively on both fronts here.<br/><br/>Enter Remy, the rat who can cook, but as you can imagine a rat cooking your food is disgusting, no matter how cute he may be. Linguini is an inept, dull, bumbling idiot and he never changes throughout the film. Colette is your stereotypical tough girl trying to prove something in a mans world. The rest of the kitchen staff are barely worth a mention as they serve as a dull backdrop and little else. <br/><br/>The voice acting is OK, I really was surprised as to why they decided on Janeane Garafalo (who I LOVED until recent years when she's seemingly gone crazy (political, etc..) Why not just get a French actress? And what executive looked over the story board and said ""oh yeah...Janeane Garafalo."" People like Will Arnett and Brian Dennehy are wasted and nearly invisible as it could have been anyone voicing those very minor parts. John Ratzenberger of course surfaces as it is his custom to voice some character in every Pixar film. <br/><br/>The ONLY interesting characters worth a mention are Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) and Skinner (Ian Holm) as a ruthless well known food critic/head chef and owner of Gusteau's (respectively.) They seem to be the only actors putting any effort into the voice expression of their characters. (O'Toole as usual is excellent whether it be live action or animated.) <br/><br/>Remy is cute. I'll give him that. Kids will like him, he's otherwise pretty boring. I'm sorry but the idea of rats in the kitchen no matter how cute is still unappealing to me. The small ghost of the deceased master chef Gusteau is just an odd addition, I never fully got why he was there other than to act as a sort of Jiminy the Cricket or ""shoulder angel"" to Remy and even then he didn't really do anything. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, just a real BORING movie for both kids and adults. The animation is excellent, but I would expect nothing less from Pixar. But the story and characters are pretty much complete crap (except for O'Toole and Holm's characters.) My advice, just skip this one and cross your fingers that Pixar's next venture is vastly better."
"saintorr","4","6","14","22 October 2007"," Disappointing
","Watched this my children (11 and 13) as a ""treat"". Sorry kids! <br/><br/>I have been a big fan of Pixar from day one, but this movie just didn't work. Without a doubt the animation was excellent but where was the storyline, the characterisation and (sadly) the laughs? <br/><br/>The strength of movies of the calibre of Toy Story is that within moments the audience forgets it is watching CGI and gets wrapped up in the story and characters. With Ratatouille the sole strength is the CGI.<br/><br/>I would have much preferred to watch a movie with OK animation that had an interesting plot but here all the energy had been put into making rat fur look realistic.<br/><br/>Gets 4 out of 10 for being visually stunning and beautifully executed. Would have grabbed a 10 if the script and characterisation had been up to expected Pixar standards."
"Zoopansick","4","5","11","10 March 2008"," Vastly overrated: Poor characterization, unfunny, and boring
","Spoilers...<br/><br/>First it isn't funny, for adults or kids. I especially think kids would be bored watching this movie, it has a mundane setting and characters. I think it tries too hard to try and put adult humor in the film (and not succeeding) at the expense of leaving out stuff for kids. I would have been more forgiving if it was goofier and aimed at a younger audience, but as it stands. I can't help thinking how bored I was now as an adult watching it and how much more I would have been bored if I was watching it 15-20 years ago.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie lack distinct personalities, especially the supporting cast. There is a scene in the movie where Collete is showing Linguini around the kitchen and tells him a little about all the other cooks. Beyond the 1 or 2 line oddly dark description of these characters there is nothing in the rest of the movie that makes them distinct. They are just the guys in the background and effectively are scenery instead of amusing or funny little characters. Much the same can be said about the rats who are just cartoon clichés who have very little to do.<br/><br/>The aforementioned Collete is a totally unbelievable character who is just there to be the love interest. When she first converses with Linguini she kind of blows her lid and almost stabs him with butcher knives while delivering some out of place speech about how she is the only woman in the kitchen. Then like a day or 2 later Linguini out of no where confesses his love to her and she kisses him right back. How did that happen? Is there any build up or reason for either character to love the other. I'm especially mystified as to why Collete's character, given her personality would be attracted to the dim witted Linguini. If this weren't an animated movie this particular relationship would be critically torn to shreds. But because it's animated, check that computer animated it isn't given a second thought. This is the definition of HORRIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. This is poor writing that operates only on the clichéd level that states there needs to be a smart independent female love interest for the generic often dumb male lead.<br/><br/>However I wouldn't say this is the worst bit of characterization in the film. That award falls to Gousteau. The deceased yet omnipresent chef whose message of ""Everyone can cook"" not only inspires Patton Oswalts' rat character but also provides ""the meaning"" or message of the film. Too bad that Gousteau's death totally undermines the entire point of the movie(!!!) Gousteau is established early in the movie as a jovial chef who loved to cook and firmly believed that ""everyone can cook"" and to be great you have to take chances and be creative. So one day the obligatory villain food critic comes to his restaurant with the intention of writing a bad review (since it is clear he is a snob and hates the notion that ""anyone can do it""). Gousteau then DIES because the review was so bad and his restaurant goes from a 5 star to a 4 star. WHAT!?! That is totally contrary to the message of the film...which is provided by GOUSTEAU HIMSELF! Gousteau should be the LAST character in the movie to be negatively effected by a bad review. He shouldn't care if his restaurant is only 4 stars; throughout the entire film his philosophy of cooking and good natured message of ""anyone can do it"" is hammered home. On an interpritive level his death completely undermines the message of the film. His death suggests that it actually does matter what other people think of you and not everyone can cook. Furthermore it suggests that Gousteau himself doesn't even believe that and his motivations aren't just cooking because he loves it. Of course over the rest of the movie the complete opposite is said and shown through the development of the plot. <br/><br/>The result is that Gousteau's death is merely a plot contrivance which has 2 purposes. First (of course) to set up the plot with Linguini going to the restaurant and second to introduce the critic as a villain. Oh, but then at the end the critic is so moved by the food that he gives the restaurant a great review. Once again a character is betrayed by Gousteau's death at the beginning of the film. Early in the movie it was established that the critic was determined to give the restaurant a bad review based upon the sole reason that he hated what Gousteau was preaching. Now all of the sudden he is affected by the actual quality of the food and is going to give the restaurant a good review? I guess no one has ever made great food that reminded him of his childhood before if that was all it took to make his character to an abrupt 180. Whatever. I can't say I didn't see that one coming, and like I said before it isn't the worst butchering of a character in this movie.<br/><br/>So basically Ratatouille is a bunch of unfunny, bland, lethally hypocritical characters cooking and talking about cooking in a restaurant in France. Oh and it's boring. But because it's computer animated it gets not only a pass but is lauded for being great. IF any of these elements were in a live action movie they would be criticized. The plot which betrays severely several of the characters (Collete romance, the villainous critic's motives, and of course Gousteau dying), the predictable outcome in all regards, the lack of jokes for kids or adults are all forgiven/forgotten. If you do decide to watch it try to look at it with a critical eye and try to look beyond the impressive computer animation."

","I just watched Ratatouille on DVD, and I am glad I didn't spend $10 to see it in theaters. I was really excited to see it after all the hype and great reviews I had heard and read. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised by Cars and was hoping to be just as pleased with this film. Unfortunately, my experience with Ratatouille was not as great. From the beginning, I felt that it wasn't going to be that entertaining, but I hoped it was just a slow start. Nope, the slow, boring, tedious pace continued. I found myself chuckling only maybe 3 times at most at scenes that weren't that unique. So many of the other Pixar films were truly hilarious in such creative ways. Also, I know that a film has made an impact on me if I can remember little quotes or parts that stood out, and are easily recognizable when someone randomly says them (such as Guido's ""Pit stop?!"" from Cars or Dory's ""I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy"" from Finding Nemo). There is nothing of that sort from Ratatouille, other than ""Anyone can cook""...lame lol. I was really expecting a lot more from this film, but it just didn't deliver like past Pixar films. It's probably one of my least favorite animated films ever. I just hope Pixar can rebound and produce more awesome films like they have in the past."

A lot of the kids at the cinema got bored watching this and were looking behind them and trying to find something more exciting to watch, while parents and other adults alike were falling asleep, so thats not very positive. the makers did try hard with some great animation and some exciting parts! the rats were really cute! but it just lacked the usual I LOVE THIS MOVIE attitude Disney-pixar animations normally have, it's OK but your missing nothing here.

","Like all great artists, it was obvious that sooner or later Pixar would go through a bit of a rough patch when it came to their movies. From the giant first steps of ""Toy Story"" over a decade ago, each of the films kept getting better and better, each showing new improvements to the animation process and this, in turn, helped the films become much more than Disney's computer generated films. When Disney themselves try their hands on these type of animation it is obvious whose is the more superior: Pixar.<br/><br/>But sadly Pixar have had a fall - not a giant, catastrophic fall, as their ""masters"" Disney, mind, but a fall none the less. ""Cars"" was, in my opinion, surprisingly sub-par, a 6/10 effort. I hoped that ""Ratatouille"", directed by Brad Bird, who created my favourite and I think best of all the Pixar films, ""The Incredibles"", could pull Pixar back out of this rut.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film is only slightly better than its predecessor. Though there are obviously some very clever minds at work on this story, it still seems a lot like a kid's movie rather than a family movie. That's not to say it was particularly bad - I enjoyed it a lot. But I guess I was expecting something more original than the classic ""don't look at the book's cover"" morale.<br/><br/>The visuals are great, as always, and there are some amazing characters in the film, particularly Anton Ego the food critic, played brilliantly by Peter O'Toole. Yet I was still left yearning for the scope of ""Finding Nemo"" or the originality of ""The Incredibles"" or the humour of ""Toy Story 2"". Good, but not great; a step in the right direction, though.<br/><br/>7/10"

I didn't know the story before I watched it and it is never boring. The character of Ratatouille has been developed with lot of sensibility and depth. It is nice watching and delivers a great adventure with a very surprisingly end. The screenplay is well adapted to the atmosphere of Paris. The special effects from the PIXAR production house are as usual masterfully executed and should win at least an Oscar. <br/><br/>If you want to spent an unforgettable moment this is the one. 10/10.

","I think Ratatouille was an excellent movie. However, when I first watched it, I thought it was terrible. The reason? I'm a person who can be affected emotionally very easily. For example, when Linguini slams the back door of the kitchen after he says:""then let's do this thing!"", I felt the embaressment as if that had happened to me. But after I watched it a few times, I got used to these scenes and fell in love with the movie.<br/><br/>I also have another question. Why does everyone refer to Linguini with his last name, and Colette with her first name? Why not refer to Linguini as Alfredo?"
"Mightyzebra","8","2","3","19 January 2008"," A very sweet film with very cute rats!
","If you have ever said that rats are cute but no-one believes you, this animated CGI film may just be able to prove your point! With a weird, topsy-turvy plot with good Pixar quality, this film is sure to delight! Even though the adventure and dare may overdo itself, the characters and theme thankfully do not. The theme is cooking and it will not be a surprise that you will want to eat/cook just after you have viewed this motion picture! Also like all Pixar films, this has good quality CGI, the water and Paris sequences are definitely something to admire. So even if you are becoming bored of CGI, this film WILL NOT make you even more bored! <br/><br/>Remy is a rat in France with an unusual dream: to cook. He is originally starting out life testing food for rat poisoning, but of course he is becoming bored. When a crazy old woman chases him and his rat family (which is a huge number of rats) out of her home, Remy loses his way and ends up lost in the sewers. There, he resolves to follow his dream and finding the famous ""Gustseau's Restaurant"" and is determined to start cooking. Remy also meets the amateur chef Linguini...<br/><br/>The only downside to this film is that the plot is a little anxious and hectic. Luckily, like medicine, the cute rats and goodies make it better! :-) <br/><br/>Enjoy ""Ratatouille""! :-)"

","It has always been my sneaking regret not being able to catch this film in the theaters despite all its rave reviews. That was why when i had a chance to finally catch it on DVD, i wanted to make it a good experience (3am at night with peace and quiet).<br/><br/>The movie pans out introducing the animal protagonist(?), Remy the rat. His natural talent of mixing and tasting eventually leads to a coincidental meeting with the clueless douche of a cook, Linguine. Friendship blossoms and they face challenges which the movie will unfold.<br/><br/>Graphical quality as usual is needless to say, superb. Featuring a cast of relatively unknown voice actors, the feeling and impression I get from viewing the movie is refreshing as I am not unduly forced to picture the famous voice actors face or their past works(Eddie Murphy as Donkey or Mushu). But truly, the heart and soul of the movie still lies with its extremely heartfelt engaging storyline. Just armed with basic setting and characters, the movie without fail delivers a huge impact on the viewers due to its amazing character development and plot. The simplicity behind the film is not to be underestimated.<br/><br/>Definite thumbs up to Pixar for always delivering quality movies.

"kim_etzerodt","10","2","3","17 September 2007"," Pixars finest
","I've witnessed something incredible today.<br/><br/>Even after witnessing all the incredible advances made in the field of computer animation, and especially by Pixar, I've seen a movie today, which has made a big leap forward. I've never seen an animation movie like Ratatoullie. Brad Bird is in my mind the absolute best director when it comes to 3D movies. He crafts intelligent stories, believable characters and best of all: He does not have a need to make everything look realistic, something that a movie like Shrek is really bad about. I remember the commentary track for Shrek 2, where the directors where crazy-like proud of the eyes of Shrek and Fiona, blabbering on and on (and on!) about the detail put into them, and how it made the characters SO much more believable. And guess what: You never, ever notice their eye detail, since, even when zoomed in on them, you can't see it. At all.<br/><br/>Brad Bird characterizes his characters, which is a brilliant choice. If you want your CG-movie to look as realistic as possible, why not just make a normal movie instead? This brings out the essence of the character and emphasizes it, making them much stronger, than a realistic looking CG-character could ever be.<br/><br/>Now, this movie does not make any of the mistakes, that Cars did. I mean - a race car setting up neuron lights on the roof of every house in a city? <br/><br/>You believe in Ratatoullie, the characters, the story and the animation (which is the best ever - did I mention that already?).<br/><br/>I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to go see this movie. You won't be disappointed. This gives you a very strong taste of just what Pixar is capable of. From start to finish, this movie bites you in the butt, chews on your eyes and punches your laughing-muscles to oblivion... And you enjoy every second of it."

And when I came out of the cinema after Ratatouille, I said that it was just like any other Pixar animation movie. But guys, I must tell you that since watching this movie my affection for the French Cuisine has been growing continuously. The day before yesterday my wife and me even visited a French restaurant to enjoy in person what we saw on the screen. I think it changed my eating habits as well. I am still surprised by the effects this movie had me. Great work! Congratulations to everybody who participated in making this masterpiece!"

","To be frank, I watched the movie because there was a discount on tickets that day, and I wasn't expecting much of it, but it truly surprised me. The animation was absolutely fantastic, the sets were all gorgeous and the food looked good enough to eat.<br/><br/>Remy is the epitome of cuteness and one cannot help but love him. The other characters, too, are equally fleshed out and will keep you rooting for them - even the seemingly dour Anton Ego will gain your sympathy in what is surely one of the most heartwarming moments in Ratatouille.<br/><br/>All in all, Ratatouille is a little gem not to be missed, and could very well be the best animated feature this year, beating the likes of Shrek 3 and The Simpsons."
"vinsond21","9","2","3","16 August 2007"," A most delicious Ratatouille to be savored many times
","Let me declare this outright, Brad Bird is pure genius and on top of that, one with a lot of class. Here is an animated feature with EVERYTHING: comedy, suspense, satire, an engaging story, brilliant artwork and superb voice-overs, a fine music score (although no Randy Newman song *sniff*) and all that topped up with LOTS of Pizazz. As a critic, i always look out for flaws; as a movie-lover, i tend to be forgiving. In this case, there are hardly any flaws to speak of and so, nothing to forgive. Animated rats have always been cute, but the ones here are not only lovable but very realistically characterised as well. While this animated feature may have been made with the adult viewer in mind, there is more than enough of the fun factor thrown in so that the younger ones will find it appealing as well. At the same time, many life lessons were included as part of the story; thankfully, these were not imparted in a heavy-handed way. This is indeed a hearty feast for all the senses, and one to be savored over and over again."
"SteakSalad_101","8","2","3","28 July 2007"," One of the most original films I've seen in years
","I entered the theater for ""Ratatouille"" hungry. Yeah, my stomach sort of was craving that buttery, salty, hydrogenated fatty taste of popcorn. But aside that--I was hungry for a fantastic animated film that has been absolutely raved upon by distinguished critics and average moviegoers alike. Hungry just like a food critic is about fine French cuisine.<br/><br/>Mmm, and did I leave the theater full of what I wanted (not only the popcorn!) Quite bluntly, ""Ratatouille"" is one of the most original films I've seen in recent memory, and also one of the best movies so far of 2007.<br/><br/>The film deals with a rat named Remey living in the French suburbs. Remey isn't any ordinary rat...unlike the tastes of garbage which his family and friends crave, Remey wants REAL food...human food, as he initially calls it. When he and his family are kicked out of this quaint town, Remey finds himself in Paris, with a new friend called Linguini, a human, who is the pimply-faced teenaged janitor for a highly regarded classy 5-star French restaurant.<br/><br/>The problem is, Linguini wants to be a chef. And since Remey knows how to cook (and damn well) he teams with Linguini by hiding under his chef hat, controlling his actions (by pulling on his hair) to create the best food in Paris.<br/><br/>Hilarity ensues. Truly, I expected nothing less from master filmmaker Brad Bird, who brought us The Incredibles, and some of the early days of The Simpsons. The directing is very well-done, the screenplay is superior, and the voice talent is absolutely BRILLIANT. Peter O'Toole plays the hungry, evil, most cynical food critic around and executes the role seamlessly (and painfully funny too, if you're familiar with his other work as I am!) Sometimes absolutely hysterical, sometimes the ""awwwh"" moment of feeling sorry for someone, sometimes downright absurd--like fine food, it's got something for everyone. I saw it with my little brother, who happens to be six years old, and the movie was silly enough to keep him entertained and sophisticated enough to keep me and my dad laughing throughout.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is indeed worth all the hype it's collected in the month it's been released. See it on the big screen before it leaves theaters for good--and then you'll see this one at the Academy Awards!"
"marissas75","9","2","3","9 July 2007"," Boiling over with humor, visual beauty and food for thought
","Those wildly creative folks at Pixar have done it again with ""Ratatouille,"" a funny and sophisticated movie about Remy, a rat with an unusually well-developed palate. After getting separated from his provincial (or should that be Provençal?) colony, Remy ends up in Paris, where he takes it upon himself to save the renowned Gusteau's Restaurant from a villainous owner, a fearsome food critic, and an inept busboy named Linguini, who mistakenly believes that he can cook. Remy and Linguini enter into a ""Cyrano""-type partnership, Remy providing the recipes and Linguini the human face, while dodging all those people who don't think a rat in the kitchen is so appetizing.<br/><br/>Remy is cute and appealing, but also has a fully developed, human-like personality. You are never in doubt that Linguini is Remy's sidekick, and not the other way around. Also, thank goodness, the movie doesn't make Remy able to talk to humans, which would be far too twee. Remy can communicate only with his fellow ratsunfortunately, none of them understand his ambitions.<br/><br/>Still, the story of ""Ratatouille"" doesn't seem quite as tight as in other Pixar movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" Those movies had one central objective (get Nemo back home/get the toys back home) and culminated in a thrilling action sequence. ""Ratatouille"" has more, smaller conflicts, and plenty of action throughout, but it doesn't build in the same way. Also, ""Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" are told entirely from the perspective of the toys or fish; ""Ratatouille"" switches between the rats' perspective and the humans', and the seams show a little.<br/><br/>All of the action sequences look fantastic, though: my favorite is a chase scene alongside the Seine, which captures Paris in amazing detail. Indeed, the movie's backgrounds are jaw- droppingly photorealistic. Pixar is also getting better and better at animating humansthere is great physical comedy when Linguini gets drunk and when he has Remy running around inside his shirt. ""Ratatouille"" has a consistently great sense of humor, with puns, amusing character interactions, vocal performances, physical action, and throwaway visual gags all contributing. My favorite character voice comes from Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. Monsieur Ego also provides one of the best visual jokes, with his skull-shaped typewriter.<br/><br/>What really distinguishes ""Ratatouille,"" though, is its larger theme. Remy is kind of a loner, and that's rare for the hero of a kids' movie. Usually, a loner exists in these types of movies only so he can learn the lesson ""You can't succeed without friends."" Though this applies to Remy as well (actually, he knows from the start that as a rat, he'll need special help to realize his dreams), the real message of ""Ratatouille"" is about uncompromisingly pursuing excellence and teaching others to appreciate itabout leading a community rather than simply belonging to it. Let's hope that Pixar, too, can continue to take the lead in upping the standards of computer animation."

","Out of all my reviews I have done for IMDb, this is the one review i'm most happy to be typing right now. If you are reading this, I can't tell you enough to go see this movie. It's that good. Easily one of the best, if not the best Pixar film to date. Animation is awesome, script is awesome, scenery is awesome. Not only that, but it really benefits from being on a big screen too. Voice acting is great, not to mention the casting. Good on ya. They really chose the right actors for the job. Never are you distracted with that annoying feeling that you heard that voice before. (i.e Woody Allen as an ant.) Personally what I really appreciated most about this movie was that they truly made a family film, a film every age can enjoy. I always felt that with ""Cars"", even though a great film, wasn't made for adults. Just look at all the toys and products that had Lightning McQueen's face on them and you will see what I mean. This film has an off-beat, yet adult story of a young chef/rat trying to make it as a cook. It deals with bad bosses, relationships with co-workers, and job stress. In fact you replace the rats with kids from a rough neighborhood, and you have a drama/comedy about class struggle. The fact is, this was a film about real life (minus cooking rats). Not a cute story about a world run by talking cars. If I had to nitpick. And it really would be nitpicking. I would have to say that the film felt about 15 minutes too long. Also the basic story formula was familiar movie territory. Fish-out-of-water mixed with a pseudo-Cyrano de Bergerac story. It worked, but I was very aware of what I was watching. The evil chef sorta felt like Dean Wormer from Animal House. Thats all. Just little things here and there sometimes felt very familiar. I will say this. I am proud of Pixar for maturing in their storytelling. I was starting to notice that every film by them was a rescue story, again! Thank you for not making another. It is a welcome change. Also, to it's credit, Ratatouille was not nearly as gaggy as the earlier Pixar releases. Instead they relied more on clever facial expressions and situation comedy. Plus gags, when present, were more visual. Nothing like the stupid one-liners, i.e ""find a happy place"" in other Pixar films. (Hey it's a fish that needs therapy, yuk yuk!) I'll say this, Pixar used to really emphasize the novelty aspect of computer animation. It seemed like they use to make a game out of reproducing cheese puffs, or toy packaging, or making sea turtles into stoners. This was getting old for me. I really enjoyed the change of pace in Ratatouille. Lush scenery, realistically detailed rats and objects, and perfectly rendered lighting. Very impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if this won for best animated feature at next years Oscars. Well done!"
"Midgarmerc","10","2","3","6 July 2007"," Pixar's done it again
","You know Pixar has never disappointed me. I've loved everything they've made and I've always thought them to be the current gods of animation. Last year they brought us Cars which was great but did not really give me the same Pixar feel. By that I mean that out of all Pixar films Cars was my least favorite with The Incredibles being my top favorite. Pixar movies are always a treat and this year's slice of cake is Ratatouille (thats rat-a-too-ee). Ratatouille is the story of a rat who teams up with a garbage boy to become the greatest chef in Paris. But I don't want to dwell in the story so lets just say its got the Pixar seal of approval.<br/><br/>The voice acting was all done very well considering that Linguini's voice actor is actually an animator for Pixar. You have your standard John Ratzenberger and I especially liked Peter O'Toole's role as ultra food critic Anton Ego (who was actually designed to resemble a vulture) and Patton Oswalt's portrayal of the titular character Remy the rat. In this day and age of film making there are no longer many advances in sound effects other than stuff sounding closer, further, muffled or echoy so I'll just say they were well done as well. The music captured the mood and thankfully avoided the CGI animation cliché of resorting to pop culture references and music to get a cheap laugh from the crowd (I'm looking at you Shrek).<br/><br/>All that stuff is great but what really had me loving this movie was the same thing that had me loving every other Pixar film which is the looks. Simply put this movie is gorgeous... no its not gorgeous is beautiful... no its gorgeously beautiful. The lighting, the reflections, the water effects, the clothes effects the textures the character expressions and looks, every tiny little thing to make this world which just so happens to be our world come alive. Another noteworthy thing to point out is the way the film exemplifies Paris to bring out it's life. There were many a time during the film when the city was seen from a vantage point to show just how beautiful it is. Therefore beautiful Pixar animation added onto the most beautiful city in the world equals nothing short of true art.<br/><br/>So yeah I loved the movie, but was there anything wrong with the movie? Well I can only say the movie was TOO good considering that I viewed it one week after its release and the theater was filled with people during an afternoon showing and there were kids behind me who wouldn't stop talking until their dad moved them to the front of the theater thankfully allowing me to enjoy the rest of the film.<br/><br/>So there was nothing wrong with the movie itself and even the Pixar short ""Lifted"" had me glued to the screen. 10/10 Pixar's done it again"

The second movie on the bill was Evan Almighty and I didn't bother to stay for that one since the reviews here have been bad. Here are my thoughts on Ratatouille: Excellent animation, nice story without the focus-group-topical-jokes, and they got the food right. Not quite the genius of The Triplets of Belleville but still a great movie. It would be interesting to show both movies back to back as they both use animation and food in contrasting ways.

There are others (Dreamworks) who are providing quality family animation entertainment, but none on a level equal to Pixar. With all that said, let me simply say this: if you enjoy good story-telling, well-crafted characters, eye-popping animation, and a movie that the entire family (minus those who may have a rodent phobia) can enjoy, then by all means go and see this work of art.

Disney struck gold when Jobs sold it Pixar...the gift that just keeps on giving. Great entertainment to us, bags of money to Disney.<br/><br/>What great voices, especially notable was Peter O'Toole as villain-turned-good guy Anton Ego..... he was perfectly egotistical and snobby as a scary food critic. The story...who doesn't like food? The inner workings of a busy French kitchen was fun and interesting. The animation showed continued tech improvement as nuances and shadings and physical movements are getting so much better and more realistic with tech advances. God is in the details in animation, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Loved it throughout, if you could overlook all the kid chaos and noise in the theater on the first day. Any lesser film would have been disturbed by the incredible din. Everyone loved it, with much applause at the end.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and see it in a theater. See the vast improvements in animation and color, but not just for that...see it for the great and touching story of a rat that appreciated great food over the garbage his friends and family liked, and due to that love he made sure he became a part of the haute cuisine world forever. <br/><br/>We are all better off for it.<br/><br/>See Waitress and Once also, if you haven't.

Somehow they manged to create believable animation without making it look CG - and that goes for both human characters as well as the rats.<br/><br/>The overall look of the whole film has this a dreamy soft look to it that equals to the romantic Paris that one would associate. Pixar made everything look real and believable that often times I would forget I am watching an animated feature.<br/><br/>The food rendering are simply amazing. If there is a 3D version of the film, I am sure I would reach out to grab the food.<br/><br/>I have been disappointed with the three films that came out earlier in the year (Shrek, Pirates, Spiderman - interestingly they are all part 3 of a threequel.) <br/><br/>But now finally a great film for the summer.

","Food, family, creativity, criticism, racism, romance: If these themes satisfy your critical standards for a superior film, then Ratatouille should qualify as one of your favorite films of the year.<br/><br/>Pixar and director Brad Bird, who defined family entertainment with The Incredibles, have another human comedy animation hit on their hands, and the foodies have to love it. Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt), a rat in a French restaurant, helps a hapless lad named Linguini become the five-star restaurant's star chef.<br/><br/>The rat is a rodent realistically realized, homely by contrast with those more pleasant looking in Flushed Away. The human faces of the non-rats are by far the best renditions of reality I have seen in hyper-humanized computer graphics. The restaurant kitchen is so real I wanted to cut onions and crush garlic. But the piece de resistance is Anton Ego, the food critic, as trenchant a criticism of us self-centered, aloof critics as will ever appear on screen.<br/><br/>The voice of Peter O'Toole makes his demeanor even more insipid and scary, his words heavy with moralizing: ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new."" I was humbled and exalted at the same time. Art for art's sake, I say.<br/><br/>Bertolt Brecht said, ""Food first, then morality."" Well, throw out the moralizing platitudes and eat. Food is the music of Ratatouille, nourishment for all the adults of the family and a primer on kitchens for kids who think good food comes out of a window and through the car window."

"mollymormonbrat","9","2","3","2 July 2007"," Real charm popping out of a seemingly ho-hum situation.
","I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.<br/><br/>But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking ""This is so good!"" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.<br/><br/>Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.<br/><br/>Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, ""Ratatouille"" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.<br/><br/>The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.<br/><br/>I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title ""Ratatouille"" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.<br/><br/>I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished."

"amyhughes7380","10","2","3","30 June 2007"," PIXAR Goes 8 for 8!
","I am a viewer with a purpose. If the story fails to impress, I find myself yawning half way through. I don't care how much stuff you blow up. Story ain't there, don't bother.<br/><br/>But, with PIXAR, you feel like you are watching an original unfold before your eyes. Maybe it is contrived, but I usually compare PIXAR with the original Walt Disney Studios with their storytelling techniques and ability to create wonderful full characters you care about. Then it has dawned on me that sometime in there Disney referenced Brothers Grimm, JM Barrie and others. Whereas PIXAR comes up with new intriguing stories that have never been in a picture book to my knowledge.<br/><br/>The story is simple: Remy is a rat, Remy is a great chef with a nose for ingredients, Remy finds Alfredo, a chef who cannot cook, and Voila! a wonderful plot is born. Remy cooks under Alfredos hat by pulling strands of hair. Before too long our young and little chefs are the toast of Paris.<br/><br/>Where this all gets complicated is this: How often do you welcome a Rat in your kitchen? Much less MANY RATS? Fish out of water, rat in kitchen. But where most of us would vomit Remy warms you and by the end you are cheering for his recipes and technique. Voiced by a very funny Paton Oswalt (Comedians of Comedy) he is recognizable and solid. Oswalt has wonderful timing and a timbre in his voice that is just REMY. No getting around it folks, you are rooting for a RAT.<br/><br/>The supporting players are wonderful, and wonderfully created by those ingenious artists at Pixar. My favorite however was the delightful Peter O'Toole as Alton Ego, the snobiest yet endearing critic in all of Paris. His study that of a coffin, his typewriter looks like a skull, yet you get him in a way that calls to the food snob in us all.<br/><br/>The visuals are also stunning, superb and brilliant. The movie a feast for your eyes and I dare anyone to leave the theatre not craving a bite or two afterwards. The richness in detail of copper pots, wafting vapors, heck even all the splendid fruits and veggies in the food locker are enough to make your mouth water. Brad Bird at the helm, a wonderful story, it was a great night out with a 3 and 4 year old. I fully recommend to all families!"

HILARIOUS!!! XD <br/><br/>IT WAS THE BEST Disney/PIXAR COLLABORATION THAT I HAVE SEEN IN ALL OF MY LIFE!!!!! ^_^ I totally hope it is worthy of winning a few or a lot of Oscars. Who knows: maybe it might actually be the first animated movie to be nominated for an Academy Award in Best picture since Beauty and the Beast. I didn't originally say that, but the guy who DID say it, I agree 100 percent with him! XD All in all, I love this movie, and it's completely, amazingly, deliciously...... PERFECTO AND MAGNIFIQUE!!!! It gets a ten out of ten on my scale! I wish I could give it more stars, because if I could, I'd give it a trillion!!! ^_^ Don't be an idiot; see the movie! You'll love it! ;)"
"letsmakeadeel","8","2","3","29 June 2007"," It is, how the French say...MAGNIFIQUE!
","What a fantastic movie. I haven't enjoyed an animated film like this in years. Perhaps animation these days has become more of measure of how real we can make things look with technology. We have forgotten what makes classics like Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin & Beauty and the Beast forever remain in our hearts and our memories. I have seen Finding Nemo & Toy Story, and though I can appreciate the trailblazing methods in creating animation that is unbelievably life-like and impressive, I have always felt that something was lacking. It's that feel-good, lesson-learned, awe-inspiring, tear-jerking story that we all want to share with others close to us. This isn't a semi-musical, as many of the classics were, but an equally well constructed soundtrack does the trick too. How about creativity? Most animated films these days make a parody of real life through the eyes of an ant, car, fish, or chicken - while throwing in the voices of a few currently popular celebrities for good measure. But not this film, the voices are done by those who really fit the role/character, and the daily life of a rat is not paralleled with our daily lives. It does not monopolize the story. I felt an absolute joy watching Ratatouille (what a title too) - the plot, the creativity, the animation and the soundtrack; all were on point. Pure genius. If given a chance, this one may just become a classic. Bravo!"
"moutonbear25","10","2","3","28 June 2007"," A Rat's Story
","Rats are a hard sell. They're filthy little rodents with fierce, ugly teeth that scurry across your feet when you aren't expecting anything, dragging their long, scaly tails behind them and sending those they cross into squeals of fear. Rats in a kitchen comedy are arguably an impossible sell. If you don't like rats to begin with, you certainly don't want them anywhere near your food. Yet here we are smack in the middle of the premise for the near infallible Pixar's latest summer crowd pleaser, RATATOUILLE. Separated from his rat colony, Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), finds himself accidentally putting his culinary talents to good use in what was once one of Paris' most prestigious kitchens, earning him rave reviews. Of course a rat can't take credit for fine food preparation so he forms an unlikely friendship with a gangly, awkward fellow by the name of Linguini (Lou Romano), who serves as his front. Together they bring new life to an aging restaurant and inspire each other to be better than they believe themselves to be. The folks at Pixar might have been sniffing too many expensive cheeses when they concocted this mousecapade but they may also be the only people out there who could have pulled it off. Only, under the writing and direction of Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), they didn't just pull it off; RATATOUILLE is a masterwork in the field of animated film-making, deliciously reaching heights that no rat has ever reached before.<br/><br/>Remy is no ordinary rat. He has a gift, a gift that is being squandered at home. He understands the complicated calibration of cooking. He knows the spice for every occasion yet his overbearing father (Brian Dennehy) uses his heightened senses as a tool to sniff out rat poison amongst the garbage. Like so many of us born into situations that do not lead instantly to fame and fortune, Remy is destined for greatness but has yet to be discovered. Not only does he need to win over the hearts and stomachs of notoriously finicky food critics (like the one voiced so delectably by Peter O'Toole) but he must also win over the potentially lost appetites of modest movie goers who may not want rats with the their popcorn. Bird's animators studied the bahavior of rats extensively and felt it would be best to have the rats walk about like humans, on two feet, in an effort to appear more likable. Bird refused. He wanted the rats to act like rats. He wanted their ideals to win us over. When trapped in a jar early on in the film, it is Remy's charm that gets him set free. There is an earnestness, a yearning, a hope seen deep in his pleading eyes that reminds us just how often we find ourselves trapped in jars by people bent on keeping us down. Besides, aren't we all just rats in the race?<br/><br/>Like Remy, Bird and his Pixar cohorts know to add a sprinkling of depth to their dishes and that presentation is key. RATATOUILLE raises the Pixar standard of beauty to new levels while seasoning the whole with hints of meaning that are only completely realized once they hit your palette. Pixar's Paris is a foggy riverside with scattered street lamps at one moment and a string of window lights and fountains the next. While it is romantically distracting, it is nowhere near as chaotic as the view from two inches above the floor. Rats scamper and the camera follows as Remy swerves in and out of kitchen crevasses and sewers (always sure to wash his hands before touching the food). The fluidity of the movement through such luscious colour is hypnotic and mag ical, simply what one would expect from the city of love. Somewhere tucked away in this city is a tiny one-bedroom apartment the size of a storage space known as not much but still home to Linguini. The friendship formed between the man and his rat is unlikely, yes, but it anchors the film with its humbling mutual appreciation. They learn to rely on each other without forgetting how to contribute the most vital parts of themselves. Theirs is a friendship so powerful and so respectful that it changes the minds and hearts of the naysayers who play witness to it, including those sitting comfortably in front of the screen.<br/><br/>""Anyone can cook."" These are the words of Chef Gousteau, Remy's inspiration and hero, that run throughout RATATOUILLE. Cooking can be interpreted as anything and therefore anyone can do anything they want. Just look at Remy, a rat with an impossible dream that comes true despite every odd and thanks to hard work (and a dash of fate). Better yet, just look at Pixar. By not simply following the recipe but rather using inspired, unusual ingredients, they have managed to make a mesmerizing masterpiece that is astonishing, endearing and about a rat.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"laci-5","9","2","3","27 June 2007"," Truly excellent
","Nowadays I don't believe the first reviews that appear here on IMDb; most of the time they say the movie is excellent etc., yeah, as they are written by plants, studio people who want to generate excitement and make the movie successful. It was a relief to see Ratatouille is really, truly excellent. The reason I did not give it 10/10 is simple: maybe some of the dialogues should have been trimmed a bit; sometimes the talking parts seemed to be a bit slower and longer than they should have been. And that's all what I can say on the negative side. Ratatouille is great. It is heartfelt, it is moving, it has style, great French feeling, it has lovable characters (especially Remy, of course), great story and, again, except from some man-to-man dialogues, every second of the movie shows creativity, care and a really high skill that the team at Pixar has. I loved the talking scenes with Remy as his gestures are great, also seeing his little heart pumping all the time etc. makes him instantly lovable. And the non-talking scenes (call them 'action scenes', not as if it was an action movie) are always so skillfully directed and effective that I was totally amazed. I haven't enjoyed an animated movie like this for years; I think it is among the three best Pixar movies (the other two being Finding Nemo and The Incredibles). I just can't express how much I loved it. Pixar is really the heir to (Walt) Disney as Remy is for Gusto - as both really do know how to serve food that is perfect even for the most hateful critic..."
"Cliff729","8","2","3","21 June 2007"," Satisfying, but younger viewers may get fidgety
","The biggest burden to having a reputation for excellence is having to meet or exceed the high level of expectation that comes with it. Consider Gusteau's, the Parisian restaurant in which most of Ratatouille takes place. Its eponymous chef delighted gourmands with his bill of fare, and his books and TV shows appealed to the common man. But Gusteau is now deceased, possibly from heartbreak over a less-than-stellar review from notorious food critic Anton Ego. And the new chef, Skinner, seems less interested in quality cuisine than in slapping Gusteau's image on boxes of processed/frozen/prepackaged food.<br/><br/>The parallels to Pixar Studios, which made Ratatouille, are obvious. Having taken animated films to new technical and creative levels with the Toy Story movies, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the studio often takes an undue amount of lumps when its films aren't excellent, but ""merely"" great, such as A Bug's Life or last year's Cars.<br/><br/>SoÂ… can Ratatouille's hero, Remy, bring both Gusteau's and Pixar back into everyone's good graces? An aspiring chef with grand ambitions and a connoisseur's sense of taste and smell, Remy believes wholly in Gusteau's mantra: ""Anyone can cook!"" He's also funny, expressive, and well-voiced by Patton Oswalt. But--and it's a big ""but""Â—Remy's a rat. And rats may be almost as unwelcome on a movie screen as they are in a restaurant.<br/><br/>Remy's shot at culinary fame hinges on his relationship with Linguini (Lou Romano), the restaurant's new garbage boy. The film purports that rats can understand human speech, but not vice versa (when rats ""talk,"" humans only hear rodent chitters). By hiding under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair, Remy can manipulate Linguini like a marionette to prepare scrumptious new cuisine. Before long, the restaurant appears to be on the road to recovery, but obstacles remainÂ—Linguini must keep Remy hidden from the other cooks, the health inspector and his boss, Skinner (Ian Holm), who has his own plans for the restaurant. Moreover, the discriminating food critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) is preparing to write a new reviewÂ…<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise that the Pixar team, headed by ""Incredibles"" screenwriter/director Brad Bird (from a story by former Pixarian Jan Pinkava) executes the movie's antics with their usual technical aplomb. The Paris locales are gorgeous, and the film's food looks good enough to eat. And to the filmmakers' credit, Remy and his ""colony"" of fellow rats, although considerably cuter than their real-life counterparts, remain pretty darn rat-likeÂ—they have pink tails and scraggly fur, they usually crawl (though Remy likes to walk erect to keep his cooking paws clean), and in scenes in which they swarm en masse, it's as creepy and disgusting as it is hilarious. (I wouldn't want to be the parent who has to explain to their child why a pet rat would be a bad idea.)<br/><br/>However, some of Ratatouille's story elements may be too lofty for the juice-box set. When the film devotes large chunks of dialogue to wills and DNA testing, younger audience members are likely to get restless waiting for more slapstick. It's also a shame that most of the film's characters are, well, undercooked. Linguini is little more than a plot device, forced thru the motions by both Remy and the filmmakers with little personality of his own. Other than Oswalt, most of the film's voice talent (including Will Arnett, Janeane Garofalo, and Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger) isn't given very much to do. O'Toole shines, however, as critic Anton EgoÂ—you haven't lived until you've heard an eight-time Oscar nominee wring laughs from the word ""Boyardee.""<br/><br/>Ratatouille may not reach the creative heights of Pixar's best films, but unlike other studios' second-tier animated films (e.g. Shark Tale or Open Season), a second-tier Pixar film is still well above-average for the genre. If your kids aren't put off by the culinary plot, and if you're not put off by relatively realistically-rendered rodents (sorry, couldn't resist), Ratatouille is well worth sampling."

","I found it thoroughly engaging with a bit of everything for everyone. The story of a rat aspiring to be a chef may not sound appealing at first, but the movie took me to places that I did not expect. I could identify with the need for family and relationships with the desire to pursue your dreams. It is unique in this summer of sequels - of couse, the movie has the trademark Pixar brand of unbelievable visuals and attention to detail..in this case, I paid particular attention to the restaurant's kitchen and its coterie of characters. The food depicted here looks so real I could touch the onions cooking in the oven at one point.<br/><br/>If you have a kid who's looking for thrills and slapstick humor, check.

"Erico_77375","10","2","3","19 June 2007"," Ratatouille is a Dish Best Served Fun
","It amazes me just how ingenious the men and women of Pixar can be with the trickiest of material. Every film made is both a technical marvel and a festival of fun, the perfect marriage of art and entertainment. And just when you think they've bitten off more than they can chew, they introduce Ratatouille (pronounced Rat-a-too-ee), their most ambitions and most delicious film yet. Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), the film not only exceeds expectations, but also raises the ante for all animated films period.<br/><br/>The bottom line on this film is this; Ratatouille is a masterpiece. It perfectly maintains both the fairy tale and the reality of the situation all the way its satisfactory ending. Yes, Remy can walk upright, use his front paws to cook (and he does wash up before touching the food), but he also has to maneuver around the health inspector who wouldn't appreciate a rat chef, no matter how clean he his. The characters are multi-dimensional, exciting, and intriguing. The film is fearless to do thing that other animated films are afraid to do, such as putting such complex themes into what most people would consider to be a kid's movie.<br/><br/>On the technical side, this has to be one of the most beautiful animated features made, ranking beside Finding Nemo. The colors are warm and alive. The digital sets are scaled very well. This is important since size plays a major factor. We will have to see the same things in the kitchen from both a rat and human perspective. And for the first time, water effects look natural, especially with characters that are covered in fur.<br/><br/>Normally voice acting is usually noticed because of the huge celebrities involved. After the lazy voice acting in the latest Shrek movie, I was hesitant. But the voice talents here are not well-known people, but they were the perfect choices. Patton Oswalt is amazing as Remy, making him both funny and vulnerable. Peter O'Toole oozes with evil delight as Anton Ego, but is also shows the soft side of a hard critic. Ian Holm rarely gets attention for his range in voice acting, but with Skinner he does wonders. But when it comes to great voice acting, I have to talk about Janeane Garofalo, whom I didn't even recognize her voice at any time. And yet she gives Colette a razor-sharp wit and resiliency that is very much a part of her own personality.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of the best films of 2007, if not the best. I can't think of a better summer movie for the whole family. But go hungry, you might find yourself wanting something French afterwards, and I hardly think it will be fries."

","*********MINOR, MINOR SPOILERS*********** You can find out what this movie is about from the front page, so I'm just going to critique it here.<br/><br/>For starters, this movie got two stars from me instead of zero because the animation was quite unique and paid great attention to detail. Not anywhere near say, a Studio Ghibli level of technique of animation, but quite good, nonetheless.<br/><br/>On to the faults, of which there are MANY. Let me just list them, for easier reading: - The whole plot is RIDICULOUS. Leaving aside that this is animation (which does often take many more liberties than would be allowed with non-animated productions), rats running a kitchen (Gross!)? A chef being controlled by his hair? No one ever seeing said rat back lit under a white hat? A rat that just ""somehow"" knows how to make all these dishes, knows what the culinary equipment does, and knows exactly what spices to use, EVERY time? Really.<br/><br/><ul><li>I almost never say this (usually I campaign for the other end of the spectrum), but this movie is WAAAY too long! It really begins to drag and blend together by about a third of the way in, and it was a real struggle to keep watching. I can think of so many more deserving movies that should have been gifted with such a time allotment! - Can you find a sympathetic character in this? Good, I couldn't either. Characterization was definitely lacking, as well as motivation - pretty much every character in this movie is flat, uninspired, and frankly, annoying and grating.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Humor that is ""mostly adult-oriented""? PLEASE. I think I cracked a smile about five times during this one, and maybe a giggle. It's so overloaded with saccharine garbage you will be nauseated.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On a more personal note, if you don't like rats and find their little pestilence-ridden bodies distasteful, this is NOT the movie for you. Also, I'm not quite sure why so many animated flicks in the past few years have made the focus of their films detestable creatures (rats, bees, ants, other insects, mice, pigs, birds, and did I mention how many movies there are about bugs?) The last good movie I saw with anything that counted as a predator would be Lion King. What is it, some sort of vulnerability ploy? - I'm no expert on how European kitchens work, and there are many other flaws with this movie that many other excellent reviewers have pointed out. Don't let my review be the only one you read, and PLEASE don't take the number of stars given this one seriously! Every Pixar and Disney employee must have been told to give this a great review and number of stars, on ALL the major movie sites! Bottom line, looking for a better rat/mouse-type animated movie? How about The Rescuers, or one of the Fievel/American Tail movies, or best yet, The Rats of Nimh. Looking for a better movie by Pixar? Personally, I'd say Toy Story one or two, The Incredibles (fabulous, original work right there), Finding Nemo, or you know what, anything but this movie, and I think A Bug's Life isn't that great, either.</li></ul><br/><br/>To me, Pixar was one of the top American animation companies not just for their above-par animation techniques, but because their movies had one foot in the real world, while the other spun off into the realm of the fantastic. The Incredibles was the best example of this - I mean, superheroes being sued for saving a suicidal person? FABULOUS idea! But then they came out with Cars. I watched it and was nearly as annoyed as I was with this feature. Why were the cars there? Who made them? Questions like that. This movie tried to go back to their original formula, but flopped, and honestly, I blame new input from Disney for this. Hopefully, they'll do better in making future films, and I'll continue to wonder how this film got so many positive rating (and how many studio people helped make this so)."

","Ratatouille is such a great film for not having that appealing of a concept. A rat wants to learn how to cook. On the surface it sounds really boring, but how it is executed proves that Pixar can make just about anything interesting. I believe that this is the closest they will get to an ""artistic"" film, because of how faithful the entire thing felt to cooking while delivering a super rich message. This isn't to insult their other films, in fact I love just about all of Pixar's films.
The plot takes many unexpected twists and turns that make you want to keep watching. I love how self aware yet twisted the villain is, as it adds to the comedy and enriches his behavior. In fact all of the characters seem to leave a lasting impression on the audience, even the side characters.
This film is defiantly the most ""adult"" pixar has gotten. It doesn't feel like something made specifically for kids who would care less about plot development and character arcs, because this film is filled with them. The ending just about proves this by describing one of the main quotes of this film, ""anyone can cook"", through a critic's interpretation. Anton Ego's speech is one of my favorite scenes in all of film for having such truthful and inspiring dialogue overlayed with an artistic montage of the beautiful city of Paris.
For anyone who wasn't a fan of this film as a kid, give it a second chance. I'm sure it will come around to you."

"kikoydaba3","9","1","1","26 June 2019"," A Pixar gem about the Arts
","Few animated films can boast a script as matured as Ratatouille. More suited for adults than kids, Ratatouille at its heart is about a character coming-of-age who pursues his dreams in an unsympathetic world. Pixar's magic continues by taking high concepts such as culinary arts into a family-friendly outing that delivers goods and drama. Accompanied by terrific visuals and soundtrack Ratatouille is a blast and thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is an excellent film, but not without its faults. The story is engrossing when Remy, the rat cook, is the focus but drags when Linguini, the human partner of Remy, takes center stage. Due to its fast pace, the comedy often overtakes the emotional beats by failing to present introspection, especially in the first hour. The film hits its peak when the story shifts to Remy's family in the second half.<br/><br/>9/10"

The animation is beautiful and detailed, especially considering it was made 12 years ago.

","14 July 2007. Except for a jarring transitional scene later in the movie, this animated feature comes close to animation heaven in its detail as an animation film without crossing the boundary into live action realism. As the technology continues to move forth, this stylistic production decision will one day become a real problem. However, as of today, the real treat is in the script, the rich colors and detailed features of the movie, the consistent, compelling action in the movie.

"janjeltes","10","1","1","29 September 2018"," Superb film, holds up over time
","Ratatouille is yet another masterpiece of Brad Bird. Most of his earlier films (before he became politically correct) are works of art (iron giant, the incredibles).
Ratatouille is a very clever juxtaposition between artists and critics and about following your passions. It sticks true to its values and doesn't get itself sidetracked with sex politics (like he did in Tomorrow Land and Incredibles 2 - where his focus concentrated on the genitals of the characters rather than a deeply clever story).
Disney has had its issues in the past (see the mouse that roared). However, until a few years ago Disney had never taken to marginalising most of its audience.
As a conscientious family, we are now going back to the older (pre politically correct) classics like Ratatouille to avoid Disney's modern shenanigans targeting little children.
While Disney and Brad Bird have let us down in recent years, there are still superb movies such as Ratatouille that conscientious parents can watch instead. Ratatouille and the original incredibles are definitely worth revisiting.
As for Disney ... watch the new Wreck It Ralph 2 trailer and ask yourself : inclusive? Divisive? Rubbishing all of the Disney princesses as ""victims"" and to all of the children who lived the Disney princesses in one swoop? That's a master stoke of something. It's up to you to decide what that something is."

","""Ratatouille"" (2007) is a professionally produced animated adventure comedy about a rat named Remy, voiced by Patton Oswalt, who has an uncanny ability to cook and an aspiration to become Paris' top Chef. Remy, through coincidence and direction from the spirit of famous Chef Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett, meets Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano, and forms an alliance between rat and human. I have watched this film several times now and every time I get this warm feeling in my heart. This animation provides a very real sense that there is an ability to separate the differences between entities to share commonalities. The story is very strong and realistic. In the film, the scenario is applied to a despised animal and a human, but the same scenario can be applied to the race, gender and sexual orientation that plague the world today. The vocal acting compared to the visuals is spot on. I never felt like anything was out of place. I commend directors Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava for bringing this work to life and delivering such a powerful message through, what most people consider, a ""kids movie."" I love this film and recommend to everyone to watch at least twice."

","The story of a rat chef struggling to break into a French restaurant kitchen full of humans.<br/><br/>The visual and technical creative brilliance of the film is indisputable, and, from that point of view, is one of the best Pixar movie to the date. Unfortunately, the virtuosity of the animation is not matched by a brilliant script.<br/><br/>The script, despite being entertaining, can be complicate for kids and not engaging enough for adults. The pacific living between rats and humans is an utopia and nothing is going to change that, so the start is non-believable. Then, the fact that the rat controls the human is again impossible and therefore non-believable. That is so because for that to work the rats would be able to communicate with humans by word. However, that part is real, as rats do not speak human language. So there is a mix of real and unreal things that never mix well. Better do all fantasy or all veridical, not half half. In fact, the story lacks of the internal logic that Pixar uses to make believable their characters. The dialogs are OK, but there is not enough humor, there are archetypal characters and situations, and looks like a movie targeted to school- holidays children. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable entertaining movie, pure eye candy, but closer to Disney than to Pixar's spirit."

","Remy, an ambitious rat has always dreamed of making it as a top chef in France and after an accident, he winds up in the French Capital and helps nervous chef Linguini to create a name for himself.<br/><br/>Pixar have become the biggest animated company in the world, joining forces with Disney just after the millennium and though the companies have had their differences, there can be no question that they can still make fine cinematic viewing, which is evident with this 2007 Oscar winning animation.<br/><br/>The Incredibles director Brad Bird returns to Pixar and creates a wonderful sentimental story which takes a while to get into but leaves a smile on your face come the end.<br/><br/>The beginning is intriguing with the camera freezing right on a rat that has just dived out of the window away from a human and simply narrates ""I should rethink my life a little"" this little sentence along with a few other well scripted words helps paint the picture of what being a rat is like, and soon the audience is engulfed into a life of hardship, about looking like pests and living in a world of survival.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent but does take a while to get fully into as the characters are introduced slowly. Once the main ideology is set down about cooking and Linguini is introduced, does the plot pick up and we see a strong man and animal relationship develop which is highly likable and funny at times. Like other Pixar films the comedy is equally measured alongside a good plot and a heavy use of human emotions, for animals and humans.<br/><br/>A side issue of animal cruelty is evident towards the end and has a great twist to the evil side of the world, creating hope for the characters.<br/><br/>The comedy comes thick and fast during the middle of the film when Remy and Linguini meet and the sheer ideology of a rat cooking will provide plenty of giggles, if not as strong as Toy Story or Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>Pixar's animation is the at it's very best here with the graphics mouth watering and just keeps getting better throughout the 111 running time.<br/><br/>Ratatouille does rely on a few clichés but creates a wonderful atmosphere in doing so with good comedy and a feel good narrative which is healthy for the entire family."
"bob the moo","Null","1","1","5 May 2008"," Lacks the usual quick-fire one-liners of other Pixar films but is up to the usual quality in every other regard
","Evicted from his home and separated from his family, rat Remy is living the dream as an unwelcome guest in the kitchen of the famous Gusteau Restaurant in Paris. His passion and gift is cookery and a series of events sees him with soup that had been messed by garbage boy Linguini. Chef Skinner is ready to fire Linguini for his meddling until the customers love ""his"" improvised soup. Skinner keeps him on but Linguini knows the truth, striking a deal with Remy where the latter provides the cookery and the former provides the ""looking like a human"" bit.<br/><br/>Although it won the Oscar for best film, Ratatouille got mixed reviews from critics on release. Watching it for myself I must admit that it exposes the long-term value of the ""best animated feature"" aware because it is not a film that should show up as ""best"" unless it is in a very short list (which of course it was). This is not to say that the film is no good though and indeed it is a perfectly good story told in a very slick, amusing and engaging way with all the usual quality one would expect from Pixar in regards animation. The story has the usual moral about the importance of the heart over appearance and in this regard it works really well, with a touching character at the core. I refer of course to Remy, because Linguini is all a bit wet as a character.<br/><br/>This doesn't matter too much because Linguini is rarely the sole focus in the way that Remy is. The story develops well across the running time and I was never bored once but, and here's the thing, I didn't laugh that often. For me the story was strong enough so that the lack of really good consistent laughs didn't bother me but I can understand why it is an issue for others. In many ways it is because Pixar are victims of their own success and we now expect the strong heartfelt story to be underlain by constant quick fire gags and one-liners. The lack of the latter is not a weakness in the film but it does slightly disappoint until you get into the story.<br/><br/>It is not without laughs though but they are more general and less smart than you might expect. The big colourful action is amusing and entertaining and it all drives the good story forward effectively. The voice cast for once is not filled with famous A-list names but you don't feel their absence. Oswalt is the best main character and is better served than Romano with material. Holm is nearly unrecognisable but good, although I'm not so sure about Garofalo's mixed attempt at accent. Dennehy and Sohn are fun in support while O'Toole is a real good piece of casting.<br/><br/>Overall this is a really good film that delivers a consistently engaging story with heart and humour. It is not the usual quick-fire one-liner stuff one might expect but it is still an very enjoyable film that both parents and children will enjoy."

"RResende","Null","1","1","11 September 2007"," Welles cooking!
","This is very good work. Pixar is by now a solid bet, and they have brilliant minds who are working their ways in new cinematic adventures. Here is another.<br/><br/>The principle of the thing is a being (mouse) who is able to control another being (human) and thus create his art (gastronomy). This is announced before the beginning of the film with the short ""Lifted"", i commented on it and there placed my view on the subject.<br/><br/>The way the story develops is fully Disney anchored, some bad people, lots of great beings, some trouble in the middle and a happy ending. We're used to it.<br/><br/>The reason why this is adventurous is because of the movement and placement of the virtual camera. This is really well done. I suspect the reason why a mouse was chosen was because being such a small animal, which at the same time can move around easily, it was perfect for being climbing up shelves, going inside walls with rusty pipes, being on the floor looking up, being inside a cooker's hat (and there you get the transparency of that hat, another theme to work visually) and moving quickly between all those places. So they have that point of view, the one of the mouse, and layered on that, they shift constantly and go to the point of view of the humans around, other animals. This is very well paced, of course, and the editing is superb. The camera works as Welles might have done it, it understands virtual space, and explores it.<br/><br/>This is much much better in these concerns than ""finding Nemo"" (which was sort of a disappointment to me) and i suspect i know why. There we had an immense space (the ocean) which we were free to explore. But that wasn't well done there probably because there were lacking physical references, objects that could stay still while the characters were moving around (great work exploring the possibilities of deep space is the one Besson does, while filming directly the ocean in Atlantis but also in practically the rest of his work).<br/><br/>My evaluation: 4/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","The animation is simply impressive. As far as I can judge, no detail was left out. It was simply perfect. Even without comparing it to other animation movies I think one can agree that this one is for sure among the top ones. However, when it comes to the story, there is really nothing original about it. In its essence, there are so many similarities with ""The Perfume"", another superlative movie in my eyes. OK, Grenouille was really not a rat, maybe in the metaphoric sense he was, but still a nobody who created the most fine perfumes ever, just using his extraordinary well developed nose. Same as here. But at the end... who cares... Not everybody has seen ""The Perfume"" so this will leave him or her the freedom to enjoy without the feeling of deja vu. The movie is very entertaining and funny. It's a movie for the whole family and to some extent also educational, which is not always the case. For sure worth buying the DVD."

An unfortunate incident in the house they all live in causes Remy to become separated from his family. His travels through the sewers bring him to Paris.

The animation was superior, and so realistic. The scenes of Paris (that are in the previews) are fantastic, and there is a water scene near the beginning that will make you feel like you're actually experiencing what's happening on screen.

","We can all see the hard work put into the film and looks quite expensive although not as expensive as its budget which is $150 million. But the film has an absolute poor story-line that is probably written by a 10 year old child and lacks a single decent joke. It was about 2 hours with not even a paragraph of story about a rat who is helping a chef to cook; if the story is supposed to be poor then they should have cut down the running length about 1 hour 20 minutes. The film was about 2 hours but it seemed about 4 hours and when it ended I sighed with relief and I thought that it would never end.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is critically acclaimed and they said that it's smart which is absolutely wrong because you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to understand and come up with the plot. I just don't know why critics always have wrong opinions. I'm not a critic myself but I still told the fact.<br/><br/>I liked Pixar ever since I've seen Toy Story. Their animation is wonderful and stories are always interesting. For the first time I'm disappointed and about 60% of the film was quite boring that I had a look around the cinema hall and some children were asleep, adults were yawning and a couple of people just left and never came back. Basically everyone was dying by boredom. Pixar usually make their films suitable for all ages but Ratatouille isn't, it's too long for children and boring for adults.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie was a million times better because it had a much more intelligent plot; every single scene was extremely funny, shorter running length and was made half the budget of Ratatouille. The only reason why I can say that it's a blockbuster because it's a Pixar movie and they really did a good job fooling everyone with the really interesting trailer. The top 5 best Pixar films are: <br/><br/>1) Monsters Inc <br/><br/>2) Finding Nemo <br/><br/>3) Cars <br/><br/>4) Toy Story <br/><br/>5) The Incredibles"

","""Ratatouille"" is adorable. Remy, the lead character, a rat gourmet cook, is noble, sweet, and endearing.<br/><br/>The animation is top notch: beautiful, detailed, appearing to be three dimensional. Paris was never lovelier.<br/><br/>I laughed several times, and even cried once, when a character is served a meal that brings back memories of his childhood.<br/><br/>There is one chase scene after another. The rat is menaced by much larger human beings; he escapes. This is repeated several times.<br/><br/>Given all the chase scenes, there isn't much time left for character development. Linguini, a cook, announces he is in love; when did that happen? And Remy, though the main character, does not grow or change at all. He cooks; he escapes; he cooks; he escapes.<br/><br/>All these chase scenes leave little room for the kind of magic, time out of time moments found in cartoon classics: the dance in the ballroom from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the spaghetti dinner or ""midnight howl"" from ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the dance of the mushrooms from ""Fantasia."" <br/><br/>The villain, Skinner, a short, dark-skinned, cook, is uninteresting. His major crime seems to be promoting fast food. ""Supersize Me"" did a much better job of skewering fast food. There are a lot of truly terrifying cartoon villains out there: Cruella de Ville, the witch queen in ""Snow White."" Skinner is not in their class. <br/><br/>Skinner is a nice name for a villain, here. Skinner is, of course, the last name of B. F. Skinner, the behaviorist famous for experimenting on rats, and for his book title, ""Beyond Freedom and Dignity.""<br/><br/>Brad Bird, who also wrote ""The Incredibles,"" favors excellence and individuality, themes that run counter to Skinner's theories. So, his bad guy is named ""Skinner,"" a very un-French name in a Parisian setting. <br/><br/>""Ratatouille,"" like too many animated films, is a man's world. There is only one female character, and she is underdeveloped.<br/><br/>I loved the beauty of this film's animation, but it isn't a classic, to me. There just aren't those moments where the action stops, and I get in touch with the heart and soul of a living, growing, character. And the all-male Paris -- both its rats and its humans are viritually all male -- is too grim in its obvious message."

","I really don't understand the enthusiasm for this bland film. Sure the visuals may be stunning and clever, but without a plot that really grips who cares? The script seemed fractured and without focus. I kept trying to get pulled into the different characters' trials and tribulations, but I never felt that anything was really at stake emotionally. <br/><br/>The film tries too hard to to appeal to the ""ordinary American"" and ends up talking down to the audience instead. At times it tries so hard to be all inclusive that it seems to be apologizing for the subject matter wearing a face red with embarrassment. When Collette (voiced by the abrasive Garofolo) describes all the macho backgrounds of the restaurants cooks I felt I was watching a movie from the 70's or earlier. I think America has grown sophisticated enough to no longer think all people interested in the culinary arts are decadent sissy snobs. Think of the popularity of the Food Network, Iron Chef America, Emeril Lagasse, Thomas Keller, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, etc.! <br/><br/>Instead of trying to prepare our appetites for an art form America already embraces, Pixar might have spent more time getting the script to show us the power of good food. The best moments involved O'Toole's Anton Ego. He was a character with interesting lights and darks that was underused. Patton Oswald's Rat was so boring. His conflict seemed superficial and the scenes with his family could have been cut at no loss to the storyline. Maybe a better actor could have given more pathos to the rat's plight, but a better script would have helped tons."

","I am in disbelief of the comments left for this film. How anyone could consider this to be Pixars greatest achievement let alone the greatest animated film of all time shocks me. There is no denying the technical achievement that this film represents, however the reason for any film should be the storyline. Throughout the film I was checking my watch to see when it would finish, as the poor plot and unbelievable characters did nothing to draw me in. One of Pixars finest abilities is to create a film for children that appeals to adults humour as well. This was probably the least funniest Pixar film I have had the misfortune of seeing and can only see any humour in the pretentious reviews written by so called 'art types'. Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type."

I wasn't nearly as fun as some of the other movies like toy story or finding nemo. It wasn't close to funny. Sure there were good moments, but not as much as you would expect for such a long movie. I guess you have to think how funny can a rat who cooks be. This was a total disappointment after great movies like happy feet, Madagascar, cars, etc. I mean what the hell was this?? Who came up with this brilliant idea?? I just hope the directors have better things to do than waste time on crappy movies like this one. And who are all these ppl who love the movies??

","I suppose any Pixar film has the unenviable task of living up to the previous movies from the production company. The Toy Story movies are the gold standard and equally fantastic for both children and adults.<br/><br/>Ratatouille follows the adventures of a rat who befriends a cleaner at a restaurant which has seen happier times. The rat is a frustrated cook and it gets the chance to prove its skill via the cleaner. The film is a little long and drags a bit at times - That's the adult perspective and I suspect some children would also be restless at times. As ever with Pixar some of the visual are stunning especially the cityscapes of Paris. Not in the same league as Toy Story, but still fairly entertaining."
"Elswet","6","4","9","27 September 2007"," Fun Mediocrity
","This is not a home run in the Pixar/Disney Hall of Fame, but it IS enjoyable.<br/><br/>RATATOULLE lacks soul, heart, and frivolities, which normally draw children and adults alike by the droves. This film is a romantic sort, as are most Disney animated features, with the Comedy factor omitted from the formula this time, and the movie suffers for it.<br/><br/>It was only moderately interesting and somehow managed to be quaint without endearing itself to its target audience. Some adults will particularly like this due to the adult themes and elements, but the age group who are out there attempting to make it on their own like the lead character in this work, will not be attracted to this venue.<br/><br/>This sad fact is negated; however, by the fact that this film did only marginally less at the box office, than the widely loved (and vastly superior) Cars. It is further negated by the fact that RATATOULLE receives a user rating here at IMDb.com, which surpasses Cars by laps. Deservedly so, in my opinion. RATATOULLE is a wonderful film, but it lacked the magic of the rest of its line.<br/><br/>All in all? I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be the beginning of a trend into decline. It is fun at times, and interesting at times, but not ever both at the same time. You take your chances with this one.<br/><br/>It rates a 6.3/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"come2whereimfrom","5","4","9","27 September 2007"," Rats, what a let down.
","Pixar are the computer boffins behind such great films as 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredible's' so it is with excitement I look forward to watching their new film 'Ratatouille', but I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The idea is basically about a rat who longs to be one of the greatest chef's in the world, lucky then that he lives under Paris, unlucky that he is a rat. Basically that's it, there are no really cool characters like the turtles in 'Nemo' or the aliens in 'Toy Story', there is his unbelieving dad, fat brother, bumbling chef accomplice who are all quite unassuming the only one with anything to them is the evil head chef who runs the kitchen with an iron fist. There is none of the magic that made earlier films so appealing for young and old and the jokes are thin and far between or have been done before. I think the whole thing is let down by the idea, it just isn't as strong as previous outings. There's a loose theme of humans hating rats as they are pests but it never really gets of the ground and a kitchen doesn't really allow for many action sequences. The animation is as you'd expect flawless and the rats (despite being pests) are all fluffy cute so the kids will probably love them but all in all this is probably the worst film to come from the Pixar stable, which considering past achievements and their normal level of originality ends up being a bit more of a let down."

"Mrswing","6","4","9","10 August 2007"," Technically brilliant, but Pixar storytelling process stumbles - SPOILERS ABOUND!
","I went into Ratatouille with huge expectations due to the glowing reviews. I generally love Pixar features.<br/><br/>To my surprise, I wasn't immediately swept off my feet as the movie started. I waited, and waited... and though there were some brilliant sequences, there were just too many elements which did not ring true for me to get into the film.<br/><br/>Things I had problems with: 1) Remy isn't really a rat, he's a human in rat shape. He already knows how to cook, he can read, he's hygienic, he has moral qualms about 'stealing'... His only problem is that he's a rat, and thus unable to achieve his desires. That's a purely physical limitation, not a psychological one. So there's no real growth on his part, just the search for the opportunity to live his dream.<br/><br/>2) Linguini is so passive and incompetent, he's really an uninteresting character. The conflict between him and Remy is forced - even when he's taking credit for Remy's talent (very late in the story), he does so because of circumstance and Remy has never before given any indication he's not okay with this.<br/><br/>3) Colette is completely superfluous to the story. Moreover, she starts off extremely feminist and violently tough, but soon after becomes just another lovelorn female pining for idiotic Linguini. Her anger at the female-unfriendliness of the haute cuisine world is immediately forgotten. <br/><br/>4) Skinner is a badly realized character. He's only interested in his line of Gusteau frozen foods, yet he keeps the restaurant open and expects it to produce quality food. However, he doesn't try to improve the star rating (which could only help his business plans). On the other hand, he doesn't deliberately cut corners or lower standards to save money. (It's not clear to me whether his frozen foods have already been launched or whether this is a secret plan of his - if so, it's never discovered (as a revelation) by anyone during the film, so it doesn't really add to the storyline. Also, Skinner is so very concerned about Linguini being Gustave's son, feeling certain that he 'knows' something and his appearance just before the deadline is no accident. However, nothing is ever discovered about Skinner, he doesn't appear to have any dark secrets. So why the paranoid worrying? Finally, Skinner isn't really a successful villain to oppose Remy, as their goals never really clash. When Skinner finally captures Remy, it's not to kill him but to force him to cook more deep-frozen meals... Not exactly a fate worse than death. I was also irritated by his English name being coupled to a French(ish) accent.<br/><br/>4) Anton Ego is an even less suitable opponent for Remy. He's a very mean character (almost vampire-like in looks), and directly responsible for Gusteau's death. Yet there is no punishment (though he indirectly killed Linguini's dad!), only a sense of immediate and total redemption. Why did he become such a monster (compared to the sweet and innocent boy he used to be)? If you think about it, the character is all about exercising tyrannical power (destroying the reputation of chefs for the fun of it), not the love of food as he claims. How does this put him into direct conflict with Remy? He's the main threat of the film but only shows up in the third act (when the less imposing Skinner has been largely disposed of). (It would also have been nice if Remy's food had first provoked culinary hallucinations of an incredible potency before flashing him back to his childhood) <br/><br/>5) Remy learns to control Linguini perfectly, but when they have to cook the sweetbreads, Linguini is once again careening off the walls etc. like in the much earlier apartment scenes.<br/><br/>6) The kitchen personnel is very dull: nothing is done with them, and they have almost no personality (despite being introduced in a way which makes you expect them to have a far greater impact on the movie). Perhaps the whole rat family theme should have been dropped and more time should have been spent with the kitchen staff)<br/><br/>7) major coincidences propel the story forwards: Remy losing his family and (especially) finding them again is really arbitrary.<br/><br/>8) The final fate of Gusteau's restaurant is disappointing.<br/><br/>9) Remy's unwillingness to believe humans hate rats when his father shows him the shop is really strange, as he's experienced the homicidal old lady. It would have been better if he remained convinced that Linguini is his friend and would never harm him no matter what, unlike other humans.<br/><br/>10) The film lacks a climax as spectacular and inventive as Monsters Inc., Nemo and Incredibles.<br/><br/>11) The paternity angle is resolved extremely quickly, after having received quite a build-up. The resolution was very unsatisfactory (more could have been done with it story-wise, and during development it probably was at one time or another).<br/><br/>Finally, the film isn't that funny, compared to the other Pixar classics. Heck, Flushed Away (which had a less likable hero by far, and was less emotionally involving) is funnier by far than Ratatouille. <br/><br/>Ratatouille is more serious in tone than many other Pixar films, but for me, the story told didn't convince and the moral lessons were far too heavy-handed (follow your dream, prejudice is bad, family comes first, critics are generally bad :-)...) The set pieces are very impressive, technically the film obviously breaks new barriers, and there are some nice jokes and little touches scattered over the film - but to me, the magic was missing. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say the development process of the story must have been extremely complicated and I often had the feeling that bits were left in that probably worked better in previous versions of the story, or alternately were added later without fitting the overall story perfectly."

","Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2.<br/><br/>And now, Ratatouille. Considering that this movie came from Pixar, it was so earth shatteringly average that it made me want to cry.<br/><br/>Remy (Patton Oswalt, King of Queens) is a rat with a love for cooking. It's his passion in life. Often choosing cooking over family. His dad (Brian Dennehy) and the rest of the rat colony, all think Remy needs to stop chasing a dream that will never come true. It's time wasted.<br/><br/>After messing around in a local woman's kitchen, Remy gets busted and chased out of the house with a shotgun. Everyone else, in fear, heads for their little boats to float away in the sewer. Remy gets separated from his family, certain that he'll never see his family again. Hungry and alone, all Remy has is the book, Anyone Can Cook, of his all time favorite chef, Gusteau.<br/><br/>In his delusional state, Remy receives advice from a shoulder angel version of the recently deceased Chef Gusteau and ends out making all the way to Gusteau's old restaurant in Paris.<br/><br/>Remy befriends Linguini. A young garbage boy who is credited with making a delicious soup that was actually Remy's. Because Remy would never get a chance to cook, he and Linguini enter into a partnership, where Remy does the cooking through Linguini, and Linguini gets the credit.<br/><br/>As the movie wears on, the two run into several problems. They find it difficult to keep this secret from the overly mean head chef, Skinner, a growing tension between the two begins when Linguini falls in love with another chef, and they are faced with the challenge of cooking something for the most respected and hard to please critic in France...Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) <br/><br/>Critics have raved this movie as the best film Pixar has ever made. Uh...no. This is probably their worst film ever made. Pixar has always churned out great family movies, and I've always adored the characters they create. No...not this time.<br/><br/>None of the characters are terribly likable, and the laughs are very few, despite repeated attempts with gags about French people.<br/><br/>It was OK. Nothing more, nothing less. It's original, as most Pixar stuff is, and so that helps it along, but it just wasn't that good compared to their other work.

""Ratatouille"" is luckily faaar superior to last year's ""Cars"", it's got great visuals and truly incredible voice-overs, but it mysteriously failed to impress me. My best guess is that Mr Bird has so far managed to set the bar so high it simply wasn't possible to go anywhere but down. But not severely, I respect the man for trying different stuff every time, for finding mesmerizing and captivating stories and bringing them to the big screen, and for always having great sense for everything, be it random details, voice actors, character animation. <br/><br/>I hope this movie positively surprises at the box office, so far the buzz has been kind of mixed, which is to be expected since last year's Pixar's weakest and dullest entry ""Cars"" failed to make an impression. <br/><br/>In the long run I predict ""Ratatouille"" will be fondly remembered, adored by some, but mostly feeling just slightly sub-par compared to the Pixar ""greats"".

"piccologenkidama","2","8","23","10 January 2008"," An Insulting Movie
","Let's start with the good. Ratatouille is a well-animated, well-produced film. And the short at the beginning was hilarious, as those beginning shorts usually are. Throw in adult-sounding French dishes, and apparently that is enough for most of reviewers and critics. But I can't imagine it's enough for most kids. I took my little cousin to see the movie a while back at the drive-in, so it was impossible to see the reactions of other children. But for us, the movie just failed on every level besides appearance.<br/><br/>The jokes in the movie run from mind-numbingly stupid, to mind-numbingly pretentious. It's almost as if two movies were created. One to insult the intelligence of children, the other to please the refined palate of French cuisine experts. This left my cousin bored, and me angry. There's no middle ground here. It's clear the creators thought children would be amused by a talking animal enough to ignore the emptiness of the movie and the complete lack of thought put into the actual story. Which is extremely surprising, given the excellent job Brad Bird did on Iron Giant.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Patton Oswalt gives a decent performance, enough to make his character memorable. But he's not good enough by any means to salvage the film. The rest of the characters are forgettable stereotypes of women, geeks, the French, etc. There's nothing about the characters that makes them unique. Their stories are cookie-cutter clichés.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the adventures of Remy, a rat who dreams of meeting and emulating his brilliant chef idol. Of course, Remy's refined tastes don't fit in well with the eat-absolutely-anything crowd he has grown up around. Remy soon finds himself separated from his family, and into the life of a young chef, who is secretly the illegitimate son of the very same guy Remy idolized. Oh, and buy the way, that guy died, and Remy sees him from time to time, in what we can only assume are brief episodes of schizophrenia. Throw in a few scenes of diseased rats cooking meals, and I can see how kids must love this movie! I imagine the movie is a hit in the food critic/elitist film buff crowd. But don't let your children see this garbage. If you want to see a good talking rat movie, watch Flushed Away."
"Prutnumse","6","3","6","10 September 2008"," Visually top-notch, storyline weak
","I am a Pixar fan. No doubt. They are second to none, doing what they do. The imagery of Rataouille is simply stunning, the people at Pixar have done it again: They've surpassed themselves. All surfaces so beautifully textured adding a strong sense of realism to the surreal universe that's computer animated movies. And the movements of the characters are so very alive, and it all looks so easy. But anybody with even the smallest interest in animation will tell you, it is not.<br/><br/>The storyline, however, is IMHO definitely one of Pixar's weakest. It's not completely without merit, though. Where most of the characters left me somewhat indifferent, the food critic Anton Ego, for instance, was subject to a most compelling portrayal. Sadly, he was only a minor character. The biggest problem with the story of Ratatouille was, for me, however, not in the characters, but in the mere fact, that I didn't laugh. Now, compared with earlier Pixar movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and my all-time favorite The Incredibles, that all had me laughing loud & heartily from start to finish, this seemed to lack the trade-mark Pixar humor."
"sullibrandon","10","3","6","1 July 2007"," Greatest Animated Film since Finding Nemo
","Ratatouille is a film that, with Pixar now at the helm of Disney's animation department, firmly and squarely places Disney right back at the peak of the animation business. It's is a sumptuous feast of cinematic delight that comes close to and may even be better than Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Remy is a young rat with a nose for good food and a mind for big dreams. He lives in the house of a grumpy old lady with a shotgun and spends his days daydreaming about delicious feasts and reaching that perfect pinnacle of good dish. A world-renowned French chef, Gusteau, is Remy's inspiration, and his book, Anyone Can Cook, is practically Remy's Bible. Remy's dad, however, isn't so fond of Remy's aspirations - in his mind, rats should stay in the garbage heap where they belong and not get picky about what they eat, so he uses Remy's talented nose to sort out the poisoned food from the safe food.<br/><br/>Remy's passion is too great, though. His love for food knows no bounds, and he regularly sneaks off to try to cook. One day he screws up so badly that he and his family are forced to flee the old lady's house into the sewers, where Remy is separated from his family and discovers he's in one of the greatest cities for food in the world - Paris, and definitely the most beautiful CGI city that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>From its first frame to its last, Ratatouille sparkles with a warm glow that is hands-down Pixar's best computer animation work. Everything about it is beautiful. They take a filthy creature like a rat and make it into this lovable little animal that will win you over instantly. The fur on Remy is also of astounding quality - if it weren't for his very human-like expressions it would look like a very believable rat. And it's not as if Pixar skimped on the rest of the rats while perfectly animating Remy. Every single one of Remy's colony is just as realistic as he is. The animation of the humans doesn't suffer either. Every single one of them, from the villainous Anton Ego to the hopeful chef Linguini is a perfect caricature, a brilliantly animated and creatively drawn masterpiece of character, life, and action.<br/><br/>The story surrounding Remy and Linguini is simply inspirational. To see Remy dropping spices joyfully into soup, to see him happily sniffing his concoction to discover the perfect taste and smell is to watch Picasso paint a masterpiece, Beethoven compose a soothing piece of music, an Olympic gymnast land the perfect routine. Remy's refusal to settle for anything less than excellent is a testimony. ""Don't eat garbage!"" he yells at his brother. This isn't a movie about a rat cooking in a kitchen. This is a movie about one person following his dream and not settling for anything less than the best. And as much as it's not simply about a rat cooking, it is about food. The food in this movie and the way it was prepared and presented like the perfect dish - I was salivating throughout, even especially when Remy was cooking the foot. It all looked delicious and wonderful and perfectly good enough to eat.<br/><br/>Yet another great thing about Ratatouille is its perfect pacing. At an hour and fifty minutes, one would think a cartoon would drag, but each scene is great and the film moves along at a nicely clipped pace, never pausing too long in once place and never cutting one scene too short. There wasn't once in this movie where I thought it dragged - from the very beginning I was sucked in and I wasn't released until the beautiful credits finished rolling. The gorgeous soundtrack perfectly suits the beautiful city of Paris and it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an animated film in a long while.<br/><br/>The list of what makes this movie great just keeps going on and on. The voice acting in Cars was kind of unremarkable, and though the Incredibles was accomplished in every way and the voice acting was nothing bad, it wasn't particularly memorable. I questioned Patton Oswalt as the voice of Remy when I first heard about it. I don't particularly care of the comedian in real life, so I wondered how wise of a choice he was. But he perfectly conveys Remy's little passionate spunky self, wonderfully nuanced, great comedic timing, and absolutely believable. Brad Garrett did possibly the best voice work of his life - normally his voice is instantly recognizable, but he fit greatly into the role of Gusteau. Peter O'Toole was perfectly frightening, conniving, and evil in his role as the food critic.<br/><br/>Another very clear strength of this movie is that it refuses to cater and stoop to traditional close-minded views that cartoons are just for kids. Even films like Shrek that adults are allowed to consider cool clearly pander to younger children - especially the last installment in the series. Ratatouille is for adults. It is not a movie that is meant for kids. This is not to say that kids will not get plenty out of it - there are bright colors, hilarious characters, and a funny story - any seven-year old will love it. But there is also plenty for adults to enjoy too. A lot of the humor is too subtle for the young ones to catch.<br/><br/>I still don't know if Ratatouille beats Finding Nemo, I would need to see it again to decide, but it is most definitely close. It's undoubtedly the best movie so far this year, and the best animated film I've seen in a long while. A delicious and filling and wholesome feast of animated goodness and solid story combined with hilarious comedy and real characters, Ratatouille succeeds in every possible way and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the greatest movie of 2007."

It was charming (but of course... it is French.. no? oh, and it is made by Pixar so of course it is heartwarming, and charming, and just plain fun).<br/><br/>Okay, so in short: the animation was superlative. in fact, had it not been for the ""100% animation!"" seal at the tail end of the credits I would have thought a good number of their backgrounds were Photoshop'ed images. Most humans in cartoons these days are just really badly drawn. This film took great lengths to accentuate the facial qualities of each character in a way not seen since the old Disney classics. The story was solid, the jokes were funny, and there was very little smarm (ugh!) - just one scene, but you will have to see it for yourself to know which one - and a very satisfying ending.<br/><br/>I liked the subtle messages of the movie, and the fact that they were at once subtle but almost obvious to even the casual watcher. I may have laughed the loudest in the theater, so perhaps some of the jokes may go above the heads of the prime demographic (on the way out of the theater I was assaulted by hordes of urchins all gleefully clamoring ""Ra-ta-tooie!"" over and again at their beleaguered parents). All in all I say ""see it"" (as in ""now"" in the theater - it will make your weekend lot of fun).<br/><br/>Hope this helped."
"etsm92","10","3","6","1 July 2007"," 'Ratatouille' satisfied my appetite
","Ratatouille/2007/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Remy: Patton Oswalt Linguini: Lou Romano Skinner: Ian Holm Colette: Janeane Garofalo Gusteau: Brad Garrett<br/><br/>During and especially after this film I was hungry. The film had very convincing food; I'll give you that. You know why? Because the animation was truly brilliant! So much detail put in Pixar Animation Studios has started a reputation to now release a Pixar film every summer and they still convince, compel, enchant, etc. with their brilliant animation, clever scenes and compelling story. It's truly amazing to me how they can release a film every year and still be able to maintain an intrinsic beauty! As for Ratatouille, it filled my expectations more so than I thought. I had read a couple of critics' reviews and they were not mixed. The unanimous was good. One gave it three stars. Another gave it three and a half stars. And finally four stars. So I thought I don't know what to expect. Although the unanimous rating was good, that doesn't mean that that three could have been for animation purposes so it was only mildly recommended. So I told myself to remain sober throughout the entire film regardless of what other people say. And, as a result of NOT expecting it to be great like most Pixar films are, I was very impressed. Good job, Pixar. And mainly, good job, writer and director Brad Bird, whose The Incredibles was also extremely impressive. He showed his unrecognized talent once again! One other thing that spit at me to remain sober throughout the film was the preview for it. The preview didn't make it look very good and I'm actually glad. I think that previews shouldn't spoil films. Some films release the previews that have the funny parts already in them. So, when you see the movie, you don't like it as much as you should have because you have already seen a funny scene! Not for this film. But the previews were good enough to have me checkin' the film out and not to be completely turned away. The basic premise I found interesting and the movie proved that even more. But what is the basic premise? It's actually kind of odd. But there is nothing wrong with oddity, is there? It's what makes the world revolve on its very axis. And something like Ratatouille is something you don't see every day. Good. No clichés. It's about this rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). He is the more motivated of the rats in the rat colony he is in. His ingenuity in cooking is what motivates him and makes him want to do more. So soon he visits actual Paris, leaving his family and friends behind. He never knew he lived in Paris until he finally was inspired by a future friend and restaurant owner Gusteau (Brad Garrett) and had enough courage to leave the sewer, climb a tall building and be surprised to see the Eifel Tower. How much more revealing can you get that you're in Paris than seeing that? He then awkwardly meets with a young adult looking for a job named Linguini (Lou Romano). Remy then becomes the chef behind the hat. Although continually being spied on by the fastidious head chef Skinner (Ian Holm), he still continues to do well at what he does best and practices and practices with his chef acquaintance. Linguini's personal feelings start to bloom for a Miss Colette (Janeane Garofalo) later on. On worse news, he doesn't seem to have what it takes to be a chef and that gets a little hard on him after a while. Food critics come in and out and continue to rate the restaurant good or bad. Before Linguini was hired, the restaurant had lost a star and then another from the insanely picky, arrogant food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). Although a secondary character, Ego is also a vital character in the film that not only proves the moral of the film, but also proves one of the morals of life. And I, as a film critic, need to keep some of the lessons learned in this film myself and learn from my mistakes as well. Maybe I won't learn my mistakes by eating some food but maybe I'll learn by watching an impressive, enjoyable film like this one. Movie directed by Brad Bird."
"Thunderbuck","8","3","6","30 June 2007"," Very, very good... but...
","I love Pixar. As a studio they have created a new form of cinema that grows and evolves with every new film they make. In fact, I'd say that if I had the chance to work for any company in the world, Pixar would be it, even if it was just to empty the trash.<br/><br/>What I've admired most about Pixar movies is that story has always been of the utmost importance; technology has always been used to serve the story, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Being the Pixar fan that I am, I was looking forward to RATATOUILLE, particularly since director Brad Bird did such a wonderful job with THE INCREDIBLES, and I'm sort of a sucker for ""follow your dream"" stories to begin with. The idea of a rat who dreams of cooking in a Paris restaurant sounded just goofy enough to work.<br/><br/>On a lot of levels, RATATOUILLE does work. Bird was clearly ambitious here, with an obvious affection for food, Paris, and good restaurants. The kitchen he renders here is beautifully detailed and Bird even manages to sneak in a little tour that faithfully describes the various positions. Visually, there is a lovely warmth to this movie; who could have foreseen 10 years ago that CG animation could do justice to the City of Light? <br/><br/>The weakness here is in the story. And it's not that the story is bad--it's orders of magnitude better than, say, SHREK THE THIRD--just not strong enough to support director Bird's ambitions. There is little real sense of peril here, and the characters aren't terribly well-developed.<br/><br/>I enjoyed RATATOUILLE, even admired much of it, but Pixar needs to sharpen its story skills if it wants to stay at the top of the heap."

","when coming into the theatre in a special preview, my family and I were very excited as we come from a family of chefs and work in the restaurant business. overall, we think, this movie was not only entertaining and funny, but also catches every detail of kitchen life down to the smallest gleam of the knifes and color of the leeks. not only is the animation flawless, but just the authentic feel of the kitchen is lifelike and fast paced. Even the way the cooks work and the techniques they use are true to life and very realistic. This is not only an impressive landmark in computer animation, but a fun and warm-hearted movie sure to please all."
"wcga12","1","23","91","12 July 2007"," something's missing here
","Not Pixar's best by far. Last year's Cars blew this one away as well as Toy Story. The Toy Story saga's are wonderful and whimsical. The idea of a rat or better yet a kitchen full of rats cooking meals for human consumption kinda turned my stomach. I didn't like the villain either though it wouldn't be a Disney movie without one. It certainly doesn't belong in the top 250. That's pure crazy! I actually quit eating my popcorn after a while into the movie. Even Incredibles was much better than this film. This seemed so close to Flushed away which I didn't see, the kids did. I guess it's the year of the rat! I recommend Transformers for this year's block buster."

","""Ratatouille"" is really clever, entertaining and, of course, very ""well done"" (from a technical aspect, beside Squaresoft, no animation studio can reach Pixar's level). But, is it enough to make a good movie ? I'm not sure, and Pixar itself seems to have lowed down its standards here, in order to be more in a classical Disney's tradition.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, some ideas are brilliant : especially when the rat ""pupetmastered"" the human, or the touching ending with the critic's critic, or the Head Cheaf's characters, who is very funny, etc. But somehow, the story - and especially the human's parts, who seems paradoxically less human than the fishes, the monsters or the toys of other's movies - lack of the deep you normally supposed to find in a Pixar movie. The mousse tries to hides inside a rat's figure, but you still can see the disneyen's hears of the animal. The all moral aspect is for instance very shallow (and furthermore, it's almost Shrek one : no matter what you are, if you try hard enough, you can become what you truly are).<br/><br/>Of course, it's far better than the last other's American animation's studio's recent works, but its far more childish than, say, ""The Incredibles"", witch was directed by the same Brad Bird. I also was quite disappointed by ""Cars"", and I have the feeling that Pixar's singularity and originality is a little lost, replaced by the dominant classical Disney's moral. <br/><br/>Well, at least, this years, 2-D animation brings me ""The Simpsons : The movie"", and I'm gonna watch it one more time, waiting for the sequel more than the next Pixar's movie. <br/><br/>PS : For Animation's fans and movies'lovers, ""Persepolis"" is also a must-see of the year : there's more than American's 3D in the cartoon's life..."

","I enjoyed the animation and the characters, but really...this is, by vote, the 51st best movie of all time? Votes like this are how Madonna ends up on Histories Most Influential People. I felt like someone was given a title and five hours to come up with a plot so they could play off that title. The plot was not special. I doubt they used the entire five hours. The premise I cheerfully accept as fantasy, but I doubt anyone living in a slum area or anyone with a sense of hygiene would find it all that humorous. The only saving grace for this story is that the rats washed their hands. One of the kids in the theatre wanted to go home and put out some food for the rats. Nice job (NOT)."
"vitaleralphlouis","6","4","10","7 July 2007"," Rat Movie Halfway Decent; Not Better
","Rating this movie #44 in the all time best movie list is just plain silly; and adds to the suspicion that the integrity of the IMDb website is compromised by studio meddling (which IMDb can't prevent.) This picture was much better than CARS, but it's a high-mediocre film at best. Most of the characterizations, humor, etc offer nothing very original or new. We enjoyed this picture -- make no mistake -- but while Pixar offers the best of current day animation the overall quality of storytelling doesn't hold a candle to the work of Walt Disney.<br/><br/>Hollywood stacks the deck in bragging about recent hits. It makes no sense to compare the box office of an era when adult tickets are $11; children $7.50 to such classics as SNOW WHITE which sold millions of tickets at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. SNOW WHITE lasted 68 years so far, and isn't dead yet. Pixar's rat flick won't even be a memory by 2010."
"dbborroughs","7","4","10","30 June 2007"," Good but not that good comedy doesn't hit its stride until the last half hour
","The story of Remy a rat with a unique sense of taste and smell who wants nothing more than to cook. Ending up in Paris at the restaurant run by his idol Remy links up with a garbage boy named Linguini in the quest for culinary greatness.<br/><br/>Sue me I'm not in love with this film. Certainly the voice cast is great with a wonderful turn by Peter O'Toole and another by Ian Holm, and the animation pushes American animation farther than its gone before but the story was too unfocused and too much of been there done that.<br/><br/>I'm a heathen I know but while I was watching this all I could think of was where I had seen this before from Looney Tunes to Pinky and The Brain to Peter Greenaway to Fantasia 2000 to Iron Giant to I don't know how many other films that seem to have been cribbed from. I don't mind borrowing but please don't give me the time to notice all of the riffs as I'm watching the movie. Clearly I've seen way too many movies for my own good since so much of this film seems borrowed.<br/><br/>Its doesn't help that to me the film is unfocused for much of its running time. Once the film gets set in motion and Remy is introduced the film sort of staggers about trying to find its footing. There is no real conflict of consequence until the final half hour. Certainly there is the question of whether Remy and Linguini will make a team, but its not much of a threat since you know how it will have to play out, and the same can be said for Ian Holm's Skinner who is such a non threat that they have to add in a couple of out of left field plot twists just to keep things going (The letter from Linguini's mother and all that follows). Its not until Peter O'Toole's food critic resurfaces in the final reels that the film really begins to fire on all cylinders.<br/><br/>This isn't to say its a bad film, it not, its just not the spectacular one that everyone sees in its animated frames. There are some great set pieces, the escape from the farm is wonderful for example, that are wonderfully animated pieces of art. And with out a doubt the final sequences as Remmy and Linguini have to come up with a plan to over come the ""evil"" O'Toole are some of Brad Birds best work, but it comes at the end of a long meandering journey, which both lifts whats gone before and diminishes whats there.<br/><br/>I like the film, probably more than I realize (hence the 7 out of 10 rating) but I'm not in love with it."

Yes I hate rats too; right up there with mice, penguins, carpenter bees, and poodles. Rats are disgusting, they bite and have fleas. More irritating is the attempt to make this movie funny, the French are not funny, not in any way.

"mathknapp","5","3","7","5 August 2009"," Shockingly Ordinary
","Just watched this last night. I was shocked at how ... ordinary ... it was. Every other Pixar film I've seen (haven't yet caught Cars) has been special in some way. Toy Story was different. Monsters, Inc. incredibly original. The Incredibles was aimed at a slightly older crowd, but somehow made a surprisingly adult film for 8 or 10 year olds. WallE was brilliant.<br/><br/>This was not brilliant. The mouse able to read and communicate with humans seemed straight out the cliché book for animated movies. In an attempt to maintain some realism they do not allow the mouse to talk to humans, but forced to work around this the mouse can use the main character like a marionette, a far less plausible and more ridiculous invention. The morality of Remy's desire to ""make something"" instead of ""taking"" even falls short, as down to the end of the movie the rats continue to be on the taking end, with only Remy rising slightly above that. The main human character is dull-witted and undeveloped, and the movie fails to connect with the viewer on any emotional level -- exactly what makes the other Pixar films so wonderful.<br/><br/>Not to completely trash the film, it is amusing and worth a few laughs. Compared to many kids movies it is passable. Kids will be entertained and will laugh, but ultimately I felt the film was standard fare, far far FAR short of any other Pixar film I've seen."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","3","7","31 July 2009"," An unexpected surprise of a film, with a great message.
","I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message ""a great cook can come from anywhere"", summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O'Toole in a marvellous turn as the ""nasty"" food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox."

All rats cooking the meal for full restaurant is hard to swallow. Movie starts well and looks promising and looses its grip after an hour. Surely it has to be edited by at least 20 minutes.

","The city of Paris has never looked better - more richly-hued and elegant - than it does in ""Ratatouille,"" the latest product from Pixar Entertainment and the umpteenth animated film featuring an anthropomorphic animal as its lead character.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's confection brings two unlikely elements - food and rodents - together in its clever story of a rat with a passion for gourmet cooking who teams up with a newly hired ""garbage boy"" to surreptitiously whip up a whole host of savory dishes at an upscale restaurant located on the West Bank of Paris.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is somewhat more cerebral and considerably less frenetic than the typical Pixar production, which may prove problematic for some of the younger folk in the audience. And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself. Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here. The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness. The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized. The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.<br/><br/>The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.<br/><br/>But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make ""Ratatouille"" a thing of joy and beauty.

Were we watching a cut version where all the good bits were removed? This was terrible!<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of this movie was the superb quality of animation which was utterly wasted on a script that has been injected with corny Disney morals. The main characters were so horribly clichéd that I actually began to despise them. And why were all the main characters speaking with American accents in Paris? In one foul swoop this destroyed all the animators efforts to create a feeling of being in France.<br/><br/>But the worst part of this abysmal tragedy of film-making was the fact it just wasn't funny. I think I smirked once during the whole thing. The endless slapstick comedy was just infuriating and even the kids were getting bored and restless after the hundredth time someone fell over.<br/><br/>Pixar have always been very successful at making films that both adults and children can enjoy whereas this film bored the adults and failed to hold the children's interest.

"BMovieScreamQueen13","2","7","23","7 September 2007"," What was Brad Bird thinking?!?!
","After watching The Incredibles by acclaimed director Brad Bird, I was more than excited about watching his latest American film, (though with an annoying unpronounceable title), Ratatouille, which was brought to us by Pixar Animation Studios. After all the hype and all of the five starts and great reviews that it received, I was severely disappointed to discover that the movie was anything but great. The movie revolves around a country rat, Remy, who with his rare gift of a fine palate dreams of cooking as a chef in a fine restaurant to the dismay of his lesser civilized family. After a twisted turn of events, he finds himself able to get that chance: in the hat of a boy who cannot cook to save his life. From there, the film becomes ridiculously stretched out, as if Brad Bird intentionally took all of the most incredulous ideas about a rat in fine dining and threw them into a terrible stew called Ratatouille. I feel strongly that whoever came up with idea, took it and ran with it.straight into a wall. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and if anything, I was waiting for poor Remy to get the axe (literally). With its lack or violence (sorry, Remy never gets caught in a trap), foul language, or any sexual content, Ratatouille received a well deserved G grading for ""God, what was Brad Bird thinking taking up this project instead of The Incredibles 2?"" I give this film 2 out of 5 stars."
"jayjaypen2","2","6","19","5 December 2007"," Ratatouille was a disaster for every age group with few laughs.
","Simply the most boring children's animated movie, Ratatouille focuses on the contrasting visual perspectives of a rat and a teenage boy and attempts to draw most of it's humour from here. The comedy did not exist within the story itself... the joke of a rat assisting a teenage boy's cooking skills wears off after a few minutes. You can dissect the movie and delve into discussion around it's wonderful cinematography and attempts at being innovative with POV camera angles etc. but I think this is another film that reflects changing attitudes towards cinema that are quite dangerous for the industry. Production companies are putting far too much emphasis on captivating audiences with technical 'cleverness' rather than telling an interesting story. The reason for Toy Story's success is obvious. Not only was the animation absolutely enthralling, the story constantly held us in suspense with a variey of fascinating characters. Ratatouille not only holds on to themes and catch phrases for far too long, with the annoying 'anyone can cook' statement, it creates an extremely unrealistic relationship between animal and man through a very week scene of a boy discovering the capabilities of a rat. Anyone with even the most powerful imagination will be unable to accept their interaction, and a voice in their mind will scream out 'far fetched' throughout most of the film. <br/><br/>Ratatouille was a disaster for every age group with few laughs."

","Normally I do not venture out to see animated films because I am usually disappointed. Ratatouille was a pleasant surprise for the first sixty minutes. Director Brad Bird who also wrote the screenplay weaves an excellent adult fantasy up until that point. Sadly this 110 minute film could have been cut to 87 and Ratatouille would have been far more digestible. This is a movie about life, food, and new found relationships all working together to keep the human and animal spirit evolving. The animation is excellent. Pixar does magical film work, especially on a large screen when 2D becomes 3D. The colors, the depth, and the pure movie magic is completely captivating. Too much seasoning can foul the taste of the broth, too much time spent on needless scenes, drags out this film. Parents, this is not a film for children because it is made for an adult audience. There are only bits and pieces of cute scenes that your small fry will truly understand or comprehend. The actors who dub the voices of the main characters do an excellent job. How can you go wrong with such luminaries as Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, and Janeane Garofalo. Where Ratatouille sours is that it tries to choke itself on it's own recipe."

The use of textures, reflection, and transparency, along with sound (as in the sewer journey) were approaching the point where it was indistinguishable from reality. For me, this made the movie a joy to my senses from beginning to end.<br/><br/>That said, all four children (ages 6-13) and I found the story very slow, to the point of tedium. It nearly put my two older children to sleep and the younger ones were restless awaiting the end.<br/><br/>So I award my points based on the ground-breaking animation and the wonderful use of place (nearly the same locations as Bourne Identity!), but this movie will not be added to the set of animation classics."
"pere-25366","10","2","4","28 August 2016"," A chef-d'oeuvre served by the Pixar-Disney combo
","One thing that Pixar has always done exceptionally well, and that has distinguished them as the preeminent animated storytellers (with the exception of maybe Disney and Studio Ghibli), is put the story and characters at the forefront of each of their films. One of the most fascinating legends out there is the ""Pixar Theory"", which is the belief of a ""shared universe"" in which all the Pixar characters, and their stories, reside in. One certainty is, however, that all Pixar films are connected by their true-to-life themes, exploring subject matter that will never manage to be obsolete and always manage to tug at those heart strings.<br/><br/>When I first heard of ""Ratatouille"", I expected the usual, formulaic Pixar routine: A mismatched pair of partners embark on an adventurous journey. There will be a colourful ensemble of supporting players amidst the ""hidden world"" brought to life by everyday objects. But ""Ratatouille"" took the mismatch concept to refreshingly new heights. A rat is a virtual antithesis to humans and so we are enticed by the story to show us how similar these two characters are despite their inherent differences. <br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" is carried by great storytelling and characterization, fuelled by the instant conflict between our titular rodent, a bumbling kitchen boy and his impromptu ascension on the food chain (no pun intended). Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a Parisian rat whose dream is to be a grand chef in ""The City of Lights"". He has quite the sophisticated palate and appreciates the art of fine dining. One day he finds himself astray and arrives at one of Paris' finest restaurants. And this is where the real story begins. Could we genuinely buy into the idea that a boy can befriend and cook with a rat? Usually no but Pixar, and their exquisite weaving of such dreams, makes this feat imaginable. <br/><br/>There is so much heart in this film and the usage of Paris as its backdrop adds a charming, exquisite touch to its telling. Remy's occasional musing gazes at the view of Paris invite us to similarly admire the visual allure Pixar has presented us with. The animation is simply superb – the dark, polluted areas where the rats reside almost feel like a separate world when entering the dazzling, colourful city-scape of the Parisian neighbourhoods. The painstaking details of the rat are also impressive, from the movements of its fur against the wind to the functioning of the rest of its body parts like its ears, nose and eyes.<br/><br/>There is an undeniable realism felt throughout the film, largely achieved by the stellar voice acting present throughout. Patton Oswalt is someone I would not have pictured in the role as Remy but, after experiencing him, I could not have imagined anyone else capturing the pathos as well as he did. Same goes for Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm (and Peter O'Toole!). Overall, ""Ratatouille"" may serve up the conventional themes we have come to expect from Pixar, but it is able to deliver them with such depth and magic that I place it on a pedestal by itself as a cinematic masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" is a dish best served to everyone!"

In fact, the only two Pixar films I dislike, and I hate these, are Cars 1 and 2.<br/><br/>This movie is just superbly put together. The film starts off extremely well and instantly, it shows us what kind of person Remmy wants to be but how the rest of his clan's influence, in particular his father, stops him from becoming a person he wants to be. He finds humans more warm hearted than the rest depict them and spends time reading through books of his favorite chef and learning to cook.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film's unique and childish idea of Remmy being able to control all the actions of Linguini, the garbage boy of the restaurant who is accidentally promoted to a chef.<br/><br/>In this film, you really care for Remmy because of all the detail they give him. You also like Linguini and Colette and even find Skinner amusing. The voice acting for all these characters is just superb and the film takes unusual twists during the film. <br/><br/>The animation in this film is unbelievable and it pays excruciating detail to everything. There are lots of moments to laugh at, particularly at the end but the story is so fascinating, that even without any laughs, this film would be an easy 10 for me!<br/><br/>Must check film- Absolute Pixar masterpiece"

","The movie at the first glass seemed to be as one targeting children and early teens, the strangest part about this movie is that it surely gives you the message as well as a hope to follow your heart guided by your guts passionately. <br/><br/>The movie is a wholesome family entertainer offering a unique mix of emotions in comedy, drama, joy, sorrow and a mix bag of many other situational feelings. The lead character 'Remy' is the narrator of the tale and not only the movie portrays Remy's emotions but also every one involved in the scene.

","Disney like the word ""magic"". And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better. But without a good writer and director, they will only do pale copies."

","I'm going to start off with the fact that although I believe in freedom of speech and a difference of opinion, some people have either not seen this movie or are simply a film-wise equivalent of Anton Ego. I have seen dozens of people that just start to question all of the ""unrealistic"" parts of the movie. THIS IS AN ANIMATED FEATURE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE REALISTIC OR TO ENDORSE ANY KIND OF ACTIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE PERFORMED BY A NORMAL PERSON! IT'S MEANT TO ENTERTAIN AND IT DOES EXACTLY THAT!!! GET A LIFE AND THINK OF WHAT THE MOVIE AIMS TO BE BEFORE YOU QUESTION IT! Phew, now that that is off my chest, i'm going to start the actual review by saying that this is one of the greatest animated features if not the best movie i have seen. The CGI is absolutely amazing and even though i'm as critical as Ego when it comes to special effects, they left me in awe as i watched how beautifully Paris was portrayed before my eyes. The movie made me laugh more than ever and yes, you can't control somebody by pulling their hairs, yes a rat will never cook, yes you will never be able to start a business after you've gained a reputation of having a whole freaking colony of rats in your previous restaurant. But who cares? Even though everything is so far-fetched, the way it is all cooked together using a marvelous recipe is amazing, and delivers one very good movie. Going back to the fantastic side of the movie, i find it absolutely amazing that people have nothing against elves, dwarfs, gnomes or other such fantastic creatures seen in movies but they get hectic when it comes to a cooking rat :| Not many more words can be added without becoming either repetitive or really boring so i will only say this: Do not take into account what some people who are angry that an animated movie made it to it's well deserved position start saying about this movie and not even what i'm saying about it. Just go and see it for yourself just like i did, and please, beyond all else think of it as an experience and don't treat it like something from real life... it will only spoil any kind of feeling it may and probably will give you. And please be objective if you decide to rate it. I'm not saying to give it a 10, because it's not my place to impose such a thing. Just don't give it a review solely based on the fact that you want it down from the Top 100. If you come to hold a grudge against a movie i find that to be very sad to begin with...<br/><br/>From my side, the story of Gusteau's little rodent apprentice deserves it's 5 stars, 10 mark and every appreciation that people who actually have a shred of their inner child can give. :)"

I watched the movie and while i am watching it, it makes me feel relaxed and i don't think so much about what is going next? I just watched and i had a great time. Making this movie is not only giving people the idea that everyone just can cook, but also it gives people the idea that they can do everything that they want when they really want.

","Not much to add to so many comments already.<br/><br/>I would say this movie is entertaining. Fans of CGI should certainly go see it, the animation is superb. The story is a bit far-fetched but that's the beauty of animation movies isn't it? And the way it all unfolds is certainly a bit cheesy (beg your pardon). But all in all an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>When comparing with the other 'rats' animation flick I saw recently, 'Flushed Away', I would have to say that one did more for me. Way funnier than this one.<br/><br/>Also, I am not sure what the intended audience is here. It will certainly be hard for kids to understand what the French characters are saying. And the romance thing going on, there is no setup to it, it just happens. From an adult point of view I can understand how you might want to snog a saucy french cook, but I found it a bit sexually loaded. Don't think kids will get it, and from a storyline point of view, it didn't add much to the story.<br/><br/>One final question: do rats in France really have such a heavy American accent? I never noticed it and I've been to Paris several times..."
"joon1991","8","2","4","26 July 2007"," Definitely a good movie but not a masterpiece
","This movie, I must say has many humorous parts and is an enjoyable movie. I did not regret watching the movie, and in fact felt satisfied with the content. However, this movie is more appealing to younger audiences rather than to teenagers and above.<br/><br/>When I first went into the theater, the audience was mainly composed of little children and their parents. And I must say that I've had a hard time convincing my friends to watch the movie with me, because they knew that only it's meant for kids, not teenagers who hunger for violent movies or movies with hot chicks, or handsome guys in them.<br/><br/>At the beginning, the director wastes some time by showing footages intended to promote other Pixar films, and one short, mildly humorous clip, the purpose of which, I have yet to find out. I don't even think it was related to the movie. Anyways, there are the usual corny parts, which almost drove the kids to tears, and the plot was very predicable, and somewhat repetitive of the other pixar films, but it was worth a watch.<br/><br/>The voice actors did a good job and there wasn't much flaw there, but what was unusual was that all the people spoke English with a thick French accent, when they were in Paris. Besides the fact that rats could talk, cook, read, and outsmart humans, I found the people speaking English odd. Aside from the weird parts that I've mentioned, the movie was fantastic and the rat was so cute. I personally found them adorable and funny. Maybe that's why it appealed to so many child audiences.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for animated movie fans, and children, and is a fantastic movie to watch, but I do think that it is a little over rated on this site."

","My wife loves animated films. She thought the rat looked cute. The story's theme of the rat rising above his station of life is motivating. Reme, the rat, like foods and wants to create instead of stealing food. Linguini is controlled by Reme and the fun beginning with Linguini being comic relief. The French atmosphere is nice. One will notice many big name voices in the movie. Brian Dennehey and James Remar are heard. Peter O'toole is the voice of the food critic. The underdog theme of many children tales is well done.

Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it."

","When this movie first came out and I was relatively young I did the mistake of allowing the animated nature of this movie cloud my judgement. If I had known better, I may have been able to appreciate this movie far earlier.<br/><br/>I have not seen another children's movie that contains as much important and profound messages as Ratatouille. The way it tells the story prepares you very well for every point it has to make, and in the end these ideas start settling down, everything starts making sense, not just the movie, but life. Listening to Anton Ego's review in the end felt like drinking a warm glass of milk and honey on a cold day, it was not just comforting, it wasn't just uplifting, it felt essential, it felt as though the cold had finally gone.<br/><br/>At some point in life we all find ourselves in an existential crisis, we start questioning our identity and our purpose in life. I've never watched something that has given me a better sense of identity and meaning than this movie right here. Remy is an inspiration, he is aware of what he is and how nature has defined his life to be, but that does not stop him from finding a purpose. He had a gift, he never had a desire to make something of it until he was inspired by Chef Gusteau; for a rat to cook life had a long list of challenges awaiting Remy but god damn it he found a way that works. He could have spent his life sniffing food to prevent poisonings in his colony, a task which is very meaningful and perhaps to many rats, a drram"

","Ratatouille came out during the height of my teenage years. You know how it is, kids movies are for kids and I'm far too mature for that. Unfortunately I never went back when I actually matured enough to appreciate movies no matter who their target audience is. I'm really wishing I had sought out this movie sooner. I kept shrugging it off as just a movie about a cooking rat, as great as Pixar can be, it wasn't a concept interesting enough to get me excited about it. But of course, Pixar being Pixar, Ratatouille is about so much more than that.<br/><br/>We follow Remy, a rat with a supernatural sense of smell in the French countryside. While his family are content munching on the human waste that gets thrown out, Remy is much pickier. Much, much picker. He craves the purest essence of food, the magic of taste, of combining ingredients, preparing them in different ways, and savouring every delectable bite. He regularly sneaks into a nearby cottage to get his fix of the finest fruit and vegetables, and happens upon a famous chef who appears on television. He's inspired by this approach to food, and his foray into cooking and spices lands him and his colony in big trouble, seeking new pastures in the underbelly of Paris. This is where Remy separates from his family and finds a new home in the prestigious restaurant of the famous chef he idolised. Before long he's discovered by the garbage hand, and together they turn the local food industry on its head, with Remy as the food genius, and Linguini as the human puppet desperate not to lose his job.<br/><br/>So far so family friendly. It's a fun romp about two characters who forge a bond and dependency on one another, leading to some tense and thrilling moments, as well as some absolute slapstick gold. I'm not ashamed to say that watching Linguini flailing around as Remy pilots him is truly hilarious. I caught myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions. Pixar's animation department bring in their undeniable comedy timing and crack out their catalogue of amusing facial expressions that never get old. Remy and Linguini's practice run in Linguini's apartment is endless hearty laughs.<br/><br/>But as the movie goes on, something else starts to emerge. A tale much more mature in nature. Ratatouille evolves into a story about creating art, and critiquing said art. It becomes a story about the relationship between artist and critic. It becomes a story about how art can affect us all, to our deepest cores, and how art in all its forms can be appreciated. This is something that hit really hard for me. It's what I practically built this review blog on; the idea that even blockbuster popcorn flicks have their place, can be appreciated for their artistic value, that art is not about its technicalities, but about how it makes us feel. Or as Ratatouille's film critic says at the end; ""...the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so."" In a poignant monologue at the movie's close, Ratatouille transcends the simple designation of a family blockbuster, and becomes its own slice of art. ""Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."" It's an ending that hit me in so many places simultaneously, and trumps the familial emotional value Pixar often falls on. Instead it falls on the emotional impact and true love of art in all its forms. ""The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends."" Ratatouille tried something new, and deserves every ounce of praise it has earned. It avoids clichÃ© and predictability in the best ways, offering us an ending equal parts poignant and bittersweet, in probably the most un-fairy tale ending I've seen from a family movie.<br/><br/>Before I wrap this up, I do want to touch on Ratatouille's more technical aspects as well, because while Pixar are great at emotional gut-punches, they're also great at making groundbreaking animation. Remy and his rat colony are brought to life exquisitely, often looking like real rats, with every hair individually rendered, and the way they move. And yet it's balanced brilliantly with the more cartoony aspects of the character designs. Remy enjoys being somewhat anthropomorphised without losing his adorably animalistic nature. The human designs are also leagues ahead of where Pixar were when they first began only a decade previously. Again the designs are intrinsically cartoonish, with the lanky, somewhat goofy-looking Linguini, the short and hilariously disproportioned Skinner, the huge chin and forehead of Horst, and the on-the-nose deathliness of Anton Ego. Then again Colette enjoys the luxury of being entirely animated by female artists, never falling victim to male interpretations of cartoon women (see: Elastagirl). And yet Ratatouille remains oddly detail focussed, ensuring the right parts of a chef's uniform behave has they should when wet or dirtied, that food decays realistically, that the rats move, skitter, and sniff about like actual rats. You can rarely fault Pixar's approach to animation, but Ratatouille doubly so. There is just one slight moment that doesn't quite look right, and it's after Linguini jumps in the river. The water on his skin makes him look shiny and plastic rather than actually wet. One fault in a movie brimming with beauty isn't too bad going though.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? I can't believe I snoozed on Ratatouille for so long. It's a beautifully poignant film about creating, critiquing, and digesting art. It's about prestige cooking, but it's themes could apply to anything. It's hilarious. It's heartwarming. It's sad. It's thrilling and full of suspense. But that ending hit me harder than any typical tearjerker could. I give Ratatouille a resounding 9/10. It's definitely Pixar's most undersung achievement."

","Ratatouille is Pixar's magnum opus. Written and directed by the mighty talented Brad Bird (The Incredibles I and II, The Iron Giant) this 2007 animated film is both a satisfying comedy adventure and a deep piece on creating and the critique that comes with it.<br/><br/>Remy, an aspiring chef with big dreams, gets the chance of a lifetime when separated from his family during a thunderstorm. He soon finds himself on the streets of Paris, home of some of the finest chefs and food in the world.
The only thing standing in his way to becoming the finest chef in Paris? He's a rat. Rats don't belong in the kitchen.<br/><br/>Or do they? As Remy's cookbook idol Gusteau would say, anyone can cook. Remy sure can cook. But is he right? Food critic Anton Ego will be the judge of that.<br/><br/>With the help of a young nerdy chef named Linguini, Remy sets out to change Gusteau's into a five star restaurant. Proving to his dad and Anton Ego that anyone can cook, all while avoiding the aggressive, hilarious (and small) Chef Skinner.<br/><br/>Ratatouille fires on all cylinders. This is a top shelf animated production from Pixar. It's full of hilarious moments, from Remy's relaxed brother Emile to the various chefs that populate Gusteau's restaurant. The adventure is incredible, showing life in Paris from both a rat's and human's perspective. There is never a moment wasted in Ratatouille. The script is clean, tight, and focused. It's overall not just a great animated film but a good piece of film in general.<br/><br/>The film is elevated by the touching relationship between Remy and Linguini, and their journey to becoming chefs. The characterization is phenomenal and no one character feels unneeded or the same. Everybody is here to enhance Remy's journey, friend or foe.<br/><br/>But what makes this particular film so fantastic is the delicious, saucy filling that lies just underneath. Ratatouille raises deep questions of what it means to critique, and those who make the work to be critiqued. The ideological battle between Gusteau's and Anton Ego's thoughts on cooking give the film something to chew on.<br/><br/>This inner layer enhances Remy's journey, and gives the narrative a flow that brings everything together in a nice little bow. All of the film's characters are furthered through this deeper narrative, making the film feel seamless. Even old cranky Anton Ego has a change in heart. That scene with him eating the Ratatouille is perfection and one of Pixar's (and cinema's) greatest moments.<br/><br/>The pacing is slick, the characters rich, the themes above and beyond that of an animated family film. And don't even get me started on the beautiful animation and rendering, that food had me hungry as hell. Those rats move like real damn rats.<br/><br/>All of these things make Ratatouille one of the finest animated films to ever grace the big screen. Brad Bird and the Pixar story team are geniuses who understand what makes a strong script. A masterpiece of animation and Pixar's best.<br/><br/>10/10"

The animation is really nice to look at. The characters are all great. The story is amazing and we get to follow Remy the rat's journey from living in an attic in a country house and sneaking into the kitchen to pursue his cooking passion and longing for something more, to ending up in a 5-star restaurant in Paris and getting to live out his dream, while simultaneously befriending Linguini and helping him go from a garbage boy living in an apartment to gaining rightful ownership of his father's 5-star restaurant. You get to see the battle Remy faces in which he has to juggle between following his dream of being a cook and being there for his family, which in the beginning, do not support his decision. You get to see all of the things that go on in the kitchen and Linguini and one of the cooks, Colette, become closer throughout the movie. Eventually, Remy's family supports Remy in his cooking dream and they all come together as a family and help Remy. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is towards the end when the food critic, Anton Ego, eats the Ratatouille and he is immediantly brought back to his childhood when he ate that dish served by his mother. And because of this, you see Anton Ego go from being rather cold to becoming more lighthearted. I found this scene to be powerful. Ultimately, the movie has a really good ending and I would give this movie a 9/10."
"seige-hound","10","0","0","19 March 2020"," An amazing film about what it means to be an artist, and a critic
","I forgot how good this movie is, but rewatching it, I definitely consider it one of the best Pixar films to date. Mature in its storytelling, but kid friendly enough, Ratatouille tells the story of Remy, a rat with a keen, almost supernatural, sense of taste and smell, making him unique amongst rats in his ability to cook and create new flavours. However, his status as a rat prevents him from pursuing this dream, until he meets Linguini, a young man who is incompetent in the kitchen, but is somehow able to act as Remy's puppet, a human vessel allowing him to pursue his dream, but not without some resistance.<br/><br/>The main thing that makes this movie great is the ending. At the climax of the film, Anton Ego, the shadowy restaurant critic whose scathing review led to the death of Gusteau, the original owner of Gusteau's restaurant, enters the newly refurbished restaurant with Linguini in charge, expecting to tear it down in the same way. However, when he's presented a perfect dish, and meeting the true chef behind it, he writes perhaps one of the best monologues in film history, something that, in essence, is what critics in all forms do.<br/><br/>Ego in essence makes fun of himself and the role of being a critic, a person who risks nothing writing scathing reviews of those who truly work their hardest to present them something. This is undeniable. No critic can truly say that their reviews matter more than the piece of food, establishment or media that they are criticising. Anyone can say ""The Room"" is a bad film, but in objective fact, many people worked incredibly hard to make it over years. That in itself makes The Room more valuable than any single review, positive or negative. Me saying Ratatouille is a good movie doesn't matter much when compared to the impact the movie made on the world at large.<br/><br/>But he does give himself a little credit. Critics are great and valuable in one particular way: revealing things that are new and worthwile, before the masses discover it. Maybe you read a review for a niche arthouse film that you never heard of before, and that movie becomes your favourite film ever made. That is incredibly valuable, both to you, the critic, and the artist who you discovered. You can then act as a critic yourself, and spread the love further. Going back to the Room, a movie so bad that it has spawned a media empire of people loving to hate it. That required critics to discover, see it as the so-bad-it's-good masterpiece it is, and spread it amongst the masses. Critics are in essence on the front lines of culture, being the first to see and comment on the latest things. Maybe that makes them a bit pretentious at times, gives them an inflated ego, but I still maintain that critics are incredibly important to the functionality of arts, entertainment and food industries, in that they can help people find motivation to keep moving forward.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Ratatouille is a really fun kids movie with cute rats and incredible music. Watch it again if you haven't seen it in a while."

","Walking into a Pixar film I have always expected great animation going all the way back to their award winning short films but for some reason I am often surprised by the strength of the story.<br/><br/>This story in particular, a rat who wants to become a gourmet chef seemed like it might be a tough sell, but the characters are interesting as is the story and with the current trend towards elevating the art of the chef it is extremely timely.<br/><br/>As good as all of Pixar's films are though I found those directed by Brad Bird (though he took this film over partway through production) to be among the best. Both Monster's Inc and Iron Giant (not a Pixar film or computer animated) are among my favorite animated films.<br/><br/>There are a number of wonderful frantic scenes that capture ones attention, but the highlight scene for me would be a flashback scene later in the film with a technical flare.<br/><br/>While this is a family movie like all Pixar's films I wondered whether the deliberate pacing and more involved storytelling of the middle part of the film might not maintain the attention of younger children."

","The second Pixar film to be directed by Brad Bird and once again his strong areas shine through. The story is about a culinary mastermind, a chef of chefs, who just happens to be a common farm rat. Remy, the rat in question, gets separated from his family in the sewers and ends up meeting a cleaning boy, Linguini, who's working for a famous restaurant. Remy's talents pull through and he ends up preparing meals for the restaurant through Linguini.<br/><br/>An odd story, to say the least, but it has its own bizarre logic. And it isn't afraid of acknowledging its own strangeness. Every single time a person learns a rat prepared their meal, their reaction is priceless.<br/><br/>But what really elevates this movie above its peers is the technical talent of Brad Bird. Just like his debut film with Pixar, The Incredibles, this movie is an absolute joy to watch for the pure visual splendour it offers. Its Paris is the amalgamation of all those Parises we've grown to love. Its colours are the colours of dreams. Its way to portray food is something straight out of a Studio Ghibli film. If you're not hungry after watching this film, there's something wrong with your stomach.<br/><br/>Plus, the characters are a lot of fun. Anton Ego, a food critic with a bone to pick with Remy's restaurant, might just very well be my all-time favourite Pixar antagonist. Remy is also a fine character and all the different restaurant workers are a lot of fun. The only one that falls a bit short is unfortunately Linguini, who's the second most important character. But even he's just a bit bland rather than outright awful.<br/><br/>Ratatouille falls on the clunky side of storytelling. It could flow smoother. It juggles a plot point or two too many. But, that being said, it is such a nice experience that I'm more than willing to forgive its minor transgressions. If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favour."

"mirkobozic","10","0","0","10 January 2019"," The rat pack
","I grew up with Disney's 2D classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King etc. Either due to growing out of the age of their target audience, or the fact that the aesthetics of Shrek and the like were just too unappealing to me. And then came Ratatouille, a perfect little animated gem by Pixar, which combines two things that are very easy to grow fond of: good food and a good story.
It's a tale of the rat Remy with an overdeveloped sense of smell and taste, who refuses to settle for the usual trash bin menu, and goes on a mission to change his life. When he accidentally meets Linguini, a clumsy garbage boy of a Parisian restaurant, the two form a friendship and Remy helps him advance to the position of the cook, to the displease of the chef Skinner who is suspicious of Linguini's sudden success. The restaurant's original owner, Chef Gusteau, bequeaths the place to Linguini, and when Skinner finds out, a conflict unfolds, until it's discovered who is behind the boy's transformation into a stove genius. The characters have very well developed , distinctive personalities and the chemistry is palpable, especially between Remy and his rat pack (pun intended). The critic Anton Ego has a threatening charisma and it's a pleasure watching him unleash it on restaurant staff and writing about it. However, in the unexpected finale, he delivers a beautiful monologue about food critics, that pretty much sums up the relevance of them. Cooking is a joy, and one to be shared as a means to form friendships. Remy tells us a story of persistance, loyalty and dreams worth fighting for. A pleasure to watch, with excellent voiceovers and animation. Definitely one of those you gladly come back to."

","Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat with highly developed senses of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef like his idol, the recently deceased Auguste Gusteau. When his family are forced to flee their home he becomes separated from them and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant.<br/><br/>He sees garbage boy Alfredo Linguini spill a pot of soup and attempt to recreate it. Remy sees that he is ruining it and fixes his mistakes. Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and new owner, confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but while they argue the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Skinner retains Linguini who is assumed to be the soup's creator, and orders him to kill the rat. Instead, Linguini hides Remy under his toque where Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair. Skinner assigns the female chef Colette to train his new cook.<br/><br/>
Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling his hair.
Skinner and Remy learn that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Remy gives the evidence to Linguini who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant thrives, Remy's recipes are hits, a romance develops between Linguini and Colette, and Remy feels left out. He visits his clan in their new lair but he and his father Django fall out over his admiration for humans and Remy leaves.<br/><br/>The critic Anton Ego, whose negative review precipitated Gusteau's death, announces he will dine at the restaurant. Remy and Linguini argue, and Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries but Linguini drives them out. Remy is captured by Skinner to create a line of frozen foods but freed by Django and his brother Emile. Linguini apologizes to Remy, having been unable to cook without him, and reveals the truth to the staff who leave in disbelief. Colette returns, recalling Gusteau's motto, ""Anyone can cook.""<br/><br/>Impressed by Remy's determination, Django and the clan offer to help. The rats cook while Linguini waits tables. Remy creates a ratatouille variation, confit byaldi, which reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. The rats tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them revealing that rats are cooking, and when Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the other diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and writes a positive review for the newspaper, stating that Gusteau's chef is ""nothing less than the finest chef in France.""<br/><br/>Upon the release of the health inspector Gusteau's is forced to close due to the presence of rats violating health regulations and Ego loses his job as a critic. He then funds and frequents the popular new bistro, La Ratatouille, created and run by Remy, Linguini, and Colette. The rats settle into their new home in the bistro's roof."

Their sometimes exaggerated features make them all unique to look at. Most impressive is the giant colony of rats. <br/><br/>As I said the story is something we have seen many times before with a nobody becoming a somebody while still struggling with his heritage which is the case for Rémy who is a rat who likes to cook. Linguini is a clumsy young man with no talent for cooking at all, but he grows with the help of Rémy. The execution breathes fresh air into it by how they work together which is not just hilariously entertaing, but also very creative. <br/><br/>Every voice actor is doing a phenomenal job, the animation is lush and the message the movie conveys is inspiring.

","When people mention their favorite Pixar movie, the usual answer is either Toy Story, Finding Neo, The Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, or even Inside Out. And while I definitely admire those films for what they are and for the impact they've led on animation in general, my personal favorite of the company's filmography is none other than Ratatouille. I don't know what my deal is with this movie, it just gives me the most enjoyment and satisfaction out of all the Pixar films on the block. Watching it now 10 years since it came out, it still resonates with me on a personal level.<br/><br/>The main character Remi is unfortunate to be a rat who has the dream of cooking, and it's through his passion that we see just how lovable, intelligent and gifted he really is. Alongside knowing some really good recipes, the way he was able to befriend Alfredo Linguini but also control him with his hair just adds into how knowledgeable he is in terms of cooking. Speaking of cooking, that's where the movie truly shines in, as it shows many different techniques of how to prepare different types of delicacies, from soup, to a special order, to even the actual meal ratatouille itself. I myself love the very concept of cooking as a food lover, so it was fantastic to see Pixar really go outside the box to explore just how fun and intriguing cooking truly is. <br/><br/>Adding into how experimental the ideas of cooking in the movie are, the animation is just sublime. The usage of colors, types of food, atmospheric scape of Paris, and 1960s style setting really gives the movie a sense of French delight and makes the movie look appealing as much as the food it presents. Also, the character designs are very well done, as they look like 2D character first and computer-generated characters second. They cross between the line of realistic and simplistic while also moving at a brisk pace, especially the rats. And another added bonus is how well shot the movie is, not just how beautiful it looks, but also by how a scene plays out almost like it's own mini segment that still fits into the story.<br/><br/>As for the characters besides Remi, most of them are memorable, funny, and quite intriguing. Linguini is kind of uninteresting at first, but as he becomes more famous and starts running Gusteau's Restaurant, he becomes more relatable since he shows just how hard it is to run a restaurant while being a friend with a rat. Collette starts off more as a tough cookie, but as she teaches Linguini more about the staff and kitchen production, she does grow a soft spot for him and becomes a great mentor for cooking. Although, she and Linguini really didn't need to be a couple, they could have just been friends. Remi's dad is a bit crabby, but he's just a leader of a rat family looking out for what's best for him, his sons, and the rest. Oh, and Emile is so charming. Skinner is menacing at times but is also kind of a second rate chef, and the other cooks have their moments but aren't as explored as much as they could be.<br/><br/>And then there's the movie's antagonist, Anton Ego, played extraordinarily by Peter O'Toole. As a snobby critic who really takes cooking seriously, he had always loathed the idea from Jean Gusteau (Remi's idol and former owner of Gusteau's restaurant) that anyone can cook, but by the end of the film, not only does the meal he's given prove just how delicious the average piece of junk may be, but the review he writes is beyond words. I'm not kidding when I say that the review he gives is one of my favorite reviews, and it basically states that as much as it's fun to be cynical, we mustn't always let our bias get the best of us, because there's a good chance that something we may not care for is probably more meaningful than we think.<br/><br/>Overall, Ratatouille to this day remains my personal favorite Pixar movie. Sure not all of the characters are fully explored and it's not without it's clichés, but the phenomenal animation, expansive knowledge of cooking, lovable main leads and antagonist, humor, tribute to Paris, and review really make this movie a special treat for me. If you love Pixar, please give this movie another look. It may seem like a silly idea, but just like trying exotic French food, it's always fun to be adventurous, especially when wanting to be a great artist like a rat who loves to cook."
"classicsoncall","7","0","0","21 October 2017"," ""Food always comes to those who love to cook.""
","The first thing one has to do here is get beyond the idea of a rat becoming an accomplished French chef. Having spent my entire career in the food industry, and knowing that even one mouse dropping can fail a business's health and safety inspection, I had to cast a wary eye for this animated feature. But beyond the initial hesitation, the story turned out to be fairly creative, and I enjoyed all the clever animated sequences the artists came up with to make the story work. My best takeaway was how to tell if bread is fresh by it's 'symphony of crackle'. That didn't sound like a very technical term to me, but melodious enough to make me remember it the next time I'm in a bake shop. When Remy's creation brings food critic Anton Ego all the way back to his own Mom's home cooking, it served to make Remy the toast of Paris cuisine, proving that at least in the world of Pixar, anyone can cook."

","RATATOUILLE - 2007<br/><br/>Directed by Brad Bird AND Jan Pivanka<br/><br/>Starring Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano AND Janeane Garfalo<br/><br/>Plot Overview: Remy (Patton Oswalt), a resident of Paris, appreciates good food and has quite a sophisticated palate. He would love to become a chef so he can create and enjoy culinary masterpieces to his heart's delight. The only problem is, Remy is a rat. When he winds up in the sewer beneath one of Paris' finest restaurants, the rodent gourmet finds himself ideally placed to realise his dream.<br/><br/>I don't think this is the best Pixar movie, not at all. But I'll be damned if I don't say it isn't one of my favourites. I love everything about this film. The characters(with the exception of one), the animation, the cinematography, the heart - I love everything about this movie. Brad Bird is arguably the best animation director working today and he cemented that status with this film. I love this film and I highly recommend you see it.<br/><br/>The story for this film is excellent. Some could argue that it is overly complicated but I disagree. I love the sub plots in this film that all converge to an end game message. Speaking of which, I love the message for this movie. It is truly inspirational and the epitome of Pixar standard. Furthermore, the message I prefer is not even the only one. There are other, albeit lesser developer, messages that are intertwined within the plot. The ending for this film is amazing and, when I say this I am not over-exaggerating, the monologue narration at the end of this film is, in my honest opinion, one of the best ever written.<br/><br/>I do think that the opening for this movie was very rushed and I wish they let that play out a bit more and extend the run time. <br/><br/>Patton Oswalt was excellent as Remy. I absolutely love Remy as a character. He is simply a rat that can cook and that helps cement the overall message of the film. He is strangely likable and you just can't help but sympathise with him. I love that Gusteu is his 'imaginary friend'. It is such a fun, imaginative idea and makes his character more layered.<br/><br/>As stated before, I have issues with one character in this movie: Linguini. While Lou Romano does a good job in the role, I just don't find Linguini that interesting of a character. He is just your run of the mill doofus; he has no unique doofus traits and is just overall a pretty boring character. <br/><br/>Linguini's love interest, Collette(Janeane Garofalo), on the other hand was very interesting and the voice acting was great as well. I think that stance goes for all the other chefs in the kitchen. I can't recall any of their names but the little snippets of information we get about them make we want to learn more about them and that is why it is unfortunate we do not. The reason I don't know any of their names is because they focus so little on them and that is incredibly disappointing.<br/><br/>Ian Holm was good as Chef Skinner and I actually really liked him as a villain. He wasn't as eccentric as Syndrome or eerily creepy as Sid but he had a sense of determination and quirkiness that makes me really like him as a character. He won't be remembered as one of the greats but I still really like him regardless.<br/><br/>PETER O'TOOLE(You read that right) voices Anton Ego, a cruel critic who despises Gusteau's restaurant. I love this guy. His design, his voice, his dialogue, his conclusion, his monologue; I love everything about it. Possibly my favourite Pixar character and one of my favourite Disney characters PERIOD. You may claim I am too forgiving but I love this character. Oh, and of course O'Toole is spectacular in the role.<br/><br/>The animation for this movie is stunning. The colours are so warm and inviting. The character models are incredible and the location design is great. Anton Ego's design is incredible. The stark contrast of colours between him and the backgrounds is incredible. The lighting in this movie is awesome. I love the cinematography and editing. It is a visually stunning movie.<br/><br/>The humour in the movie was appropriate and none of it felt forced. I laughed numerous times, which I don't often do in animated films nowadays. <br/><br/>The music in this movie is also really good.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this film. It's not the best Pixar movie but it is one of my favourites. The colour pallet is incredible. The characters and awesome(for the most part). The message is important and genius. Please watch this movie if you haven't. You won't regret it. I'll rate this film 9 Shotgun Grandmas out of 10!"

","It is so nice to see there are still new ideas and concepts for animated movies that do not include princess, cuteness, singing and all those overly childish content. I was so refreshed with an awesome, new and almost entirely believable story.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a gem in a history of animated movies. It has a told story of a quality featured movie embraced in a warm hug of the animation. There are many things with which I was amazed but the most beautiful and surprising was a level of a humanization and similarity of a rat. I told myself i will never look at those lil' creatures the same way again. That much I was into it. The courage that small hero shows and all the things we humans strive to achieve are something on what we can be jealous at. It can also be a wonderful encouragement and example for all of us. 'Anyone can cook'. He cooked, he or she can count, you can draw, I can write and we all can do everything just if we want it. We just need to want. That is an idea I took from this movie.<br/><br/>As much as I laughed and enjoyed to Ratatouille I am sorry to say there were some overdone moments and unrealistic content that literally hurt me to see. That is why I couldn't give it a bigger note. I also expected a return to the beginning at the end as the whole movie was funny and playful. I expected a frame to take me in that granny's house or something like that. But overall, I am not allowed to be to critical. I loved it, enjoyed it and I would watch it again. And I am not a person who likes to watch things many times. That is how much this movie has to offer."

","A badly orchestrated kiss, rats improvising with the menu in a five star Parisian restaurant, and a young man deservedly slapped for not paying attention to the woman spilling her heart to him. Ten years after the release of Ratatouille and such moments are still laugh- out-loud funny. This clever and indelible animated film won a wide audience even among the notoriously fastidious French. It won a spot in their hearts, as well as my own, for its humor combined with amazing insight into the Paris restaurant underworld, the whimsical and witty portrayal of the human and rat relationship, and realistic and empathetic depiction of the struggle of artists in a world often unkind to such spirits.<br/><br/>Remy, a young rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell, is half pulled by his culinary talents and half pushed by bizarre circumstances, into the high culture of French cuisine. He is inspired by the great and popular Chef Gusteau who encourages creativity, daring, artistry and – of course - the savoring of delicious food and wine. Remy meets a hapless yet kind-hearted human, Linguini, who both compensates for what Remy lacks (human form and companionship) and triggers fears about the dangers of humanity. Remy and Linguini are pulled together into alternating currents of light and darkness that threaten to drown them and set them free. The cherished beliefs and legacy of Chef Gusteau hang in the balance as the unlikely rat and human duo battle vicious food critics, health inspectors, scheming profiteers, the fickle and capricious whims of consumers as well as love, and even family (Remy's Dad demands that his son stick close to the nest and avoid humans at all costs). The worst adversary for Remy and Linguini is the truths they hide within and from themselves. They both prefer to keep secrets which, they've come to believe, also keep the peace. <br/><br/>Ratatouille surprises and delights not merely in its compelling storyline, but also in uncovering the secret lives of chefs. The audience gets a schooling in the art of cutting vegetables, the importance of clean work stations and getting first pick of the produce, listening for the proper crunch of bread and understanding the kitchen hierarchy, among other things. Viewers are treated to an inside look at the restaurant industry where the words of respected critics rule the day for good or ill, artistry faces off against uniformity, workers combine in unwieldy and fragile teams, and there is immense pressure to sell-out in one form or another. From its success in portraying these bits of French culture, it is clear Pixar did not neglect its responsibility to conduct research and observe the industries. The complex, charming and intriguing characters of the film are paired well with complementary voice actors. This is especially the case with Peter O'Toole who provides the imposing and authoritative voice of food critic Anton Ego. Ratatouille is not predictable, rather it is full of delightful twists, turns and kernels of wisdom scattered everywhere.<br/><br/>The premise of Ratatouille is that anyone can cook. This should not be taken to mean that everyone should cook, but that a great cook can come from anywhere. This is also true with film. Great films come from anywhere. Look far and wide among different genres and nations of the world, for obscure or hidden gems. Dare to discover new talent and perspectives, as in this spectacular animated film that many relegate to the exclusive realm of kids. Looking back to childhood brings wisdom, as Anton Ego understands. I never tire of seeing this film. Along with the Incredibles, this is among the best of the Pixar studio."

","I recently watched the Disney Pixar film Ratatouille, while the movie did have its moments and I did enjoy it, I still thought there was much more room for improvement. Much like other Pixar films, the movie had stunning visuals and graphics including a diverse vibrant color scheme as well a distinguishable voice cast. The movie emphasized each characters love for food with breathtaking displays to illustrate different aspects of food such as texture and aroma. The visuals of the characters and the food were fairly realistic. The movie was lighthearted, sweet, but only mildly entertaining if you ask me. In a nutshell, the film is about a dirty sewer dwelling rat named Remy who loves to cook and a young timid man named Linguini who happens to be the biological son of one of the most prestigious and world renowned chefs, but he can't cook anything to save his life. Linguini inherits his fathers high class french restaurant after his passing and must team up with Remy in order keep the restaurant alive. The irony of the story is my favorite part about the whole film. A dirty street rat with a refined pallet and a passion for fine foods is the only one capable of keeping a high class restaurant from being shut down by a food inspector. There were a few things that really bothered me about this film though. For starters, the main character, Linguini, shows no growth as a chef from the beginning of the movie to the end. He was introduced as an awkward spineless, unintelligent young man who was thrown into an unfamiliar situation. After being guided, controlled and taught about cooking and the kitchen by Remy, Linguini still was just as incompetent a chef as he was in the beginning of the film in regards to cooking. It's because of his lack of growth as a chef that I feel his character was nothing more than a shield for Remy the whole time, protecting him from both prejudice and physical harm. I believe Linguini's character is an accurate representation of how some people in our society today hide behind masks in order to be socially accepted. I believe the message the film was trying to portray is in order to be at peace, we must accept reality for what it is and to stay true to yourself. Overall the film was touching but could be better."

","Ratatouille had a troubled history despite Brad Bird getting the screenwriter and director credit as well as taking the Best Oscar for Animation. The original director was (Czech born) British Oscar winning animator Jan Pinkava who only now gets a story co-credit for this this film. His vision apparently needed to be Pixar-fied.<br/><br/>Yet underlying this movie is Pinkava's vision, when the story gets boring and predictable I see Hollywood at play as the film gets derivative, you know joining the dots from A-Z.<br/><br/>Maybe the dirty smelly scavenging rats represent humans with Remy being the most well read and cultured example. Remy does not want to go through rubbish every night he wants to cook and is inspired after taking legendary chef, the late Auguste Gusteau's cookbook, 'Anyone Can Cook.'<br/><br/>Remy rises from the sewers of Paris to Gusteau's restaurant where he sees Gusteau's ghost or is it a figment of the rat's imagination? The restaurant is now run by head chef Skinner who believes in the commercialisation of Gusteau's name.<br/><br/>Remy hides under the hat of the incompetent, bumbling Linguini new to the kitchen and shows him how to cook by pulling his curly hair, fellow chef Collete teaches him the basic but it is Remy who provides the inspiration that wows the customers and arouses the interest of renowned and intimidating food critic Anton Ego who took one of the stars away from Gusteau. Skinner is also suspicious of Linguini's skills, in fact he smells a rat.<br/><br/>This is a breezy film, with rats in the kitchen cooking the food rather than taking it away although we do see that as well. The love angle is boring and predictable as are the few obligatory chase scenes in the streets and river of Paris. Yet I could not help wondering how Pinkava's film would had turned out."

","Ratatouille is not a bad film. Children have enjoyed watching it and today's 8-12 year old viewers will enjoy watching it. The animation is perfectly gorgeous. The skies are drawn with rich color and the special effects are not just professional but they are exciting. Ratatouille's animation is a 10 out of 10. The voice acting is pretty good and I give it 7 out of 10. Every thing except the plot was above average for me. I will give credit where it is due. The concept of the film is great. I think it is a very creative idea to have a rat that loves to cook and a struggling chef work together in a restaurant. This film is not new but I still like how creative it is. The actual story-line was a 5 out of 10. I think there should have been less comedy and more sentimentality in the film. Ratatouille needed to be a little more serious. There were too many gags in it for me to enjoy as an adult. But I still liked it."
"Semisonic","7","0","0","11 November 2015"," Not without a charm, but lacking depth
","I first saw this film back in 2007 when it just came out in the movie theaters. Back then i hadn't seen The Incredibles or Toy Story yet, so it's no wonder that Ratatouille seemed like a breath of fresh air, something new, vivid and inspiring. There was simply no much competition in the field those days, except for Shrek maybe, which had already passed its peak by that time. And now, eight years later, Ratatouille and i got a chance to meet again.<br/><br/>The times have certainly changed since then. Plus, now we have some new prominent examples of fine animation like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon. And while ignorance is indeed bliss, knowledge makes you re-evaluate certain things, and your cinematic experiences are not immune to that.<br/><br/>The most important thing that's literally screaming at you from the screen is how goofy and childish this film is. Of course, all the animation movies try to be appealing to the kids so some goofiness can't be helped. But Ratatouille wholeheartedly embraces the buffoonery, trying to turn it into the film's major source of charm and the main selling point. And while France had its history of brilliant and lovable clowns like Louis de Funès or Pierre Richard, Ratatouille fails to reproduce that fine balance of hysterical and touching that made those actors and films they starred in so different.<br/><br/>But all that clowning around could be easily forgiven if Pixar hadn't missed the spot with the dramatic angle. The most intense and emotionally saturated animation films these days inevitably revolve around the topic of coming of age. That genre is dearly beloved by me because there's nothing as mind-blowing and revealing and literally touching you to the very core as the process of transformation from an adolescent into an adult. It's something relevant to everyone, and a film that truly resonates with the kids' current feelings and is able to bring the memories of those feelings in the adults has a chance at being a true epiphany, a family-binding moment of sincerity and understanding that matters so much in the world of today when the fast pace of life drives generations further and further apart.<br/><br/>Here we had not one but two struggling heroes in existential crisis. Remy, a brilliant rat chef, is torn between his rat's nature, which his family never misses a chance to impose on him, and his humanly passion for cooking. And Linguini, a loser kid trying his best not to screw up for once and outgrow the shadows of the father figures he's been surrounded with.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in Ratatouille the whole sub-plot of that transformation of personality is wrapped up so abruptly that it seems as if no transformation has occurred at all. Both Remy and Linguini fight for their freedom to be themselves and to do what they love without being told what to do by someone else, however, they both end up dependent on each other and ultimately not free at all. And their act of liberation that was supposed to change everything ends up being nothing but a deus ex machina device when the world suddenly decides that it's not gonna interfere anymore. Compare it to the culmination of the same Kung Fu Panda and you'll understand why some movies give you that goosebumpy cathartic feeling while others slide past you with no aftertaste at all.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is by no means a bad film. It has enough kindness and charm to make the time you spend watching it enjoyable. However, the tone it speaks to you at the end is pretty much the same as what the film started with, and that lack of maturity makes it rather forgettable in a long run."

","There was a rumour doing the rounds a few years back that rats had been observed at some of the larger London cinemas. Apparently they would steal in during the show, prowl the aisles under cover of darkness and vacuum spilt popcorn from around the feet of the punters. Of course this is alarming and of course this is horrible ... and yet after sitting through the latest offering from Pixar (and at a large London cinema to boot), I feel oddly sanguine at the prospect. Among its many, myriad delights, Ratatouille is a film to make you love the rat.<br/><br/>And there is no escaping it: Ratatouille's rats are unmistakably ratty. They have snaking tails and skittering claws and rapid heartbeats that make their flanks quiver and their fur tremble. Sometimes they bite. While Brad Bird's film is being distributed by Disney as part of an ongoing deal with Pixar, it's safe to assume that these vermin would never have passed muster during the wholesome heyday of Uncle Walt. In one early scene, an entire horde of them is forcibly flushed out of their nest and the sight is so viscerally shocking that it takes a second to check yourself and realise that, hang on, we're not against these rats, we're on their side. Fortunately, it is only a second.<br/><br/>The film's hero is Remy, who would probably not be caught dead eating discarded popcorn in any case. This is because Remy (voiced by US comedian Patton Oswalt) is a culinary genius. He totters on his hind legs to keep his front paws clean and generally conceals the soul of a poet inside the body of an incontinent, disease- riddled rodent. Alighting at a top Paris restaurant, he promptly becomes the puppet-master of Linguini (Lou Romano), a lowly kitchen boy. Installed beneath a chef's hat, the rat communicates his gifts by pulling at Linguini's hair; a complex series of tugs, yanks and passes that has the kid jerking like a marionette from the oregano to the saffron and over to the pan. Naturally the diners love Remy's cuisine while lavishing Linguini with all the credit. None of them come down with botulism.<br/><br/>Sign up to our Film Today email<br/><br/>Read more Judged solely in terms of animation technique, Bird's film is a masterpiece. The over-bright, fauvist colours that typified those early CGI outings have now been tempered by a richer, more subtle palette. There is a tangy sense of authenticity to the kitchen scenes, where the medallions of monkfish are lovingly prepared by a band of ex-cons and cardsharps before being bussed through to a palatial dining room that thrums to an undertone of clinking glasses and murmured conversation.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is equally confident when it scurries outside. Pixar productions have always boasted a distinctive architectural nous, as witnessed in Monsters Inc's recreation of America's blue-collar neighbourhoods or The Incredibles' pristine sweep of retro 1950s suburbia. Here Bird's animators concoct a Paris of bustling little squares and misty riverside walkways. Certainly, Remy's first sight of the city, scuttling up a rooftop to check out the skyline, is as swooningly romantic as anything you'll find in Amélie or Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.<br/><br/>ADVERTISING<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Except that's just the half of it. The perennial cliché trotted out about Pixar movies is that they are smart and soulful enough to be enjoyed by adults as well as children, as though this is somehow a shock and not a quality shared by every great family film right back to The Wizard of Oz. True to form, Ratatouille contains plenty of exuberant set pieces (fraught chases along the Seine, some gaudy slapstick involving a visiting health inspector). But this riff on Cyrano de Bergerac also works as a heartfelt parable of illegitimacy and a passionate plea for the role of the outsider. The clue is in the DNA of the three main characters. Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo) is a talented cook struggling to find a niche in a male- dominated profession. Linguini is revealed to be the unacknowledged bastard son of a noted celebrity chef. And Remy, of course, is a rat and therefore reviled by polite society. The diners love his food but want him dead.<br/><br/>When Ratatouille stuttered at the US box office this summer, the subsequent fallout hinted at a growing rift between the Pixar animators and their paymasters at Disney; a marriage of convenience that is now pulling in opposite directions. Bizarrely, Bird's film gives the impression of anticipating this clash, this tussle between art and commerce, and bows out with a scene that places itself firmly on the avant garde, in a shabby bistro frequented by beret- wearing students and thrill-seeking hip-cats.<br/><br/>For good measure, it gives the last word to a snooty food critic (Peter O'Toole) who sees the light and argues that the best role a reviewer can play is to champion the new; hailing those unsung heroes who are trying something different, regardless of their background, colour, creed or species."

"OllieSuave-007","7","0","0","10 July 2015"," Pixar cooks up a few good items here.
","Pixar's Ratatouille is an overly imaginative animated film (anybody would think so when watching rats cook food in Paris), where a rat named Remy dreams of becoming a French chef despite him being a rodent pretty much despised by all humans. After a run-in with an eccentric old woman in his home, he wounds up retreating to the restaurant Gusteau's in Paris, where his passion for cooking food intertwines with a chef-wannabe named Linguini.<br/><br/>The animation is brilliant in a way that captures the wonders and beauty of Paris and the texture and aura of gourmet food. Unless you are really interested in cooking shows or culinary arts, the first part of the film might be a little dull to you as much of it is consumed with Remy's obsession about culinary arts, and the restaurant chefs blabbering about food and critics. However, the movie gets more interesting and plot picks up steam when Remy meets Linguini and tries to help cook food to impress the annoying Head Chef Skinner, all the while trying to fulfill his dreams at the same time.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the rats and their physical movements were actually quite cute at times. The chemistry between Linguini and Chef Colette was mismatched and lacked charm. The animation of the rats were good, but the humans were a little more sub-par I thought, especially that of Linguini and Colette (can never understand those over-sized eyes and noses).<br/><br/>Overall, it's a movie that will have you craving for gourmet food, visit Paris, and encourage you to fulfill your life goals. Not a bad Pixar movie.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

","As you read in the summary, (for those of you who haven't seen this film) that is pretty much the tagline for this film, and it works, for the most part, the film definitely has a few flaws.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film, is that its too long and there is way to much going on. You have all these characters being squeezed in (like all the chefs and the rat characters) and I will be the first to say, that without giving too much away, there are certain plot lines that are just not needed, particularly one about certain characters being related and it did not amount to anything in the end, which pretty much proves that it was pointless.<br/><br/>That is a fairly big flaw as I kept checking my phone to check how long the film had left. Also, surprisingly, I felt that, because there are so may different story lines, I felt like I never got to see that much of the characters, I liked Remy and I wanted to see more of him, it is his story. I would have liked to have seen more of Linguini and I feel that the romance he has with Colette was a bit rushed and could have been more developed.<br/><br/>However, the film's saving grace is the animation and the atmosphere. The animation is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. All the scenes that involve a view of the city at night all look like something out of a beautiful painting, I mean I could have stared at it forever. The characters (despite being underdeveloped) are still a lot of fun, the villain is freaking gold and Colette also gets some funny lines in. Remy is a great character and I loved the scenes where he is experimenting with food.<br/><br/>I will not dare give away the ending, one of the best endings in film if you ask me, I didn't expect it and it was heart warming. The inner thoughts of the critic (Peter O'Toole) at the end was one of the best movie monologues ever. It was touching, and thought provoking when it comes to judging art or even people.<br/><br/>Overall the film has a few problems but the stuff thats good is really good and outways the bad stuff my a long shot. I've seen this film many times in the past and will see it many times in the future."

"Stompgal_87","8","0","0","30 November 2013"," Not Pixar's best but has its funny moments, great voice acting and is preferable to 'Lifted'
","I've only seen this film a few times so far and while it's not Pixar's best ('Toy Story 3' is) due to being a little overlong and having some slow and forgettable moments, it is preferable to the short film shown before it in the cinema (I didn't see this in the cinema by the way, I rented the DVD once) and has some amusing parts, especially Remy's father telling him to shut up and eat his garbage and another rat spitting grapes at Linguini later in the film.<br/><br/>The CGI animation is as good as always for Pixar with some great 2D segments thrown in (the book illustration of Gusteau coming to life and part of the closing sequence) and Paris is realistically rendered. A lot of the characters are intriguingly modelled, the voice acting is exquisite (Skinner and Colette sound the most authentic) if the actors are somewhat lesser-known and the music has some variety to it - the French song by a female singer that plays twice is hard to understand yet lovely. The plot is clever with a lot of 'close shave' parts (especially Skinner thinking he had seen Remy but Linguini denying this) and I like how some of its elements link to the title and the title itself could be a pun on rats. Remy is especially cute and is a talented chef who eventually goes out of his way to assist Linguini. While Linguini is insane at times, he is also ambitious although Colette is sometimes threatening but eventually has a change of heart towards Linguini. Certain parts of the film made me sympathise with Remy, especially when he gets separated from his family, and I liked the earlier scene where Remy is shown flying out of a broken window with a recipe book, which leads to him telling us how it happened. I can see why the moment the food critic has a flashback of eating ratatouille as a child was the inspiration for the Richmond Sausages advert where a man has a flashback of eating them when he was younger but it was an effective scene nonetheless. I also liked the closing shot of the 'La Ratatouille' restaurant sign superimposed over a lovely view of Paris with the Eiffel Tower intact.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't my favourite Pixar film but it has a valuable message saying ""anyone can be a chef"" and moments that made me giggle. 8/10."

The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors, for example) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive.

"EUyeshima","8","0","0","22 May 2008"," Foodies Can Rejoice...Also Rodents...at a Charmer with Pixar's Trademark Craftsmanship
","The craftsmanship in a Pixar film is so startling that it's easy to take the genuine artistry behind it for granted given the studio's consistent run of hits since ""Toy Story"" over a dozen years ago. Like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Cars"", this 2007 confection runs nearly two hours, comparatively long for an animated film, with a story that demands more attention than most. Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind the ""The Incredibles"", returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance. Except for a few set pieces, especially toward the end, the movie is not quite as exhilarating as previous efforts, but there is no getting around its sheer entertainment value.<br/><br/>The dense plot focuses primarily on Remy, an intellectually curious rat with a heightened sense of smell. He lives in a rodent colony in the French countryside headed by his wizened father Django, who uses Remy to smell everyone's food for possible poison. However, Remy has bigger dreams of becoming a chef like Gusteau, the recently deceased guiding light behind Paris' finest restaurant. While escaping from an old crone whose kitchen he has been using, Remy fittingly ends up at Gusteau's where he meets a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini. By hiding under Linguini's chef hat and pulling on his scalp like a puppeteer, Remy is now able to fulfill his dream of becoming a world-class chef. Thanks to Remy's culinary wizardry, Linguini becomes the talk of the town. Naturally, Linguini has to take credit for Remy's dishes and attracts the attention of fellow sous-chef Colette who has dreams of becoming a chef herself. No fanciful story like this would be complete without a villain, and this time, it is Skinner, the small, self-centered sous-chef who took over the restaurant after Gusteau's death only to cheapen the master chef's name by developing a line of microwavable food products to mass market.<br/><br/>The rest of the story plays itself out in inevitable fashion but with plenty of clever twists and turns thanks to the perceptive screenplay by Bird, Jan Pinkava and Jim Capobianco, which focuses on the human qualities in the rodents. Needless to say, the CGI work is impressive, especially when the rats literally take over the kitchen. However, the visual realism of seeing the rats swarm in multiple battalions is a bit daunting to watch no matter how human Bird tries to make them. Despite the appearance of marquee names, the vocal casting is for the most part, merely serviceable. Comedian Patton Oswalt brings the right level of enthusiastic optimism to Remy's voice, while Brad Garrett (Gusteau's spirit), Ian Holm (Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (Colette) and Will Arnett (fellow sous-chef Horst) lose much of their individual personalities to their thick French accents. Lou Romano lends a fumbling callowness to Linguini, while Brian Dennehy is certainly recognizable as Django. The true standout, however, is Peter O'Toole who voices intimidating food critic Anton Ego with his usual theatrical flair.<br/><br/>I'm surprised the extras on the 2007 DVD are relatively sparse for a major Pixar release. There is no commentary track from Bird, but instead, a 14-minute featurette with him and master chef Thomas Keller, who opened his kitchen at the legendary French Laundry restaurant to the animation team. This isn't Keller's first foray into cinema since he helped prepare Adam Sandler for his role as a celebrity chef in the execrable ""Spanglish"". The two best extras are the animation shorts. The first is the five-minute ""Lifted"" that preceded the movie in many theaters. It's an amusing take on the abduction scene in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". The second is the clever, ten-minute ""Your Friend the Rat"" which features Remy and his chubby brother Emile carrying on about the joys of being a rat and why we should love them, too. There are also three deleted scenes with introductions and plenty of previews from both Pixar and Disney."

","Eww, rats in a restaurant. Well if it's an animated restaurant, where the story is just told for entertainment purposes, then this movie succeeded. I must admit, seeing that many rats (even if animated), can be disturbing. Once they started speaking English in Paris, and gave the little rodents characteristics comprehensible to humans, then the fear of animated rats in the animated kitchen subsided. I'll give the writers credit for disallowing the main character, Remy the rat, from speaking to Linguini, but only gestures to him on how to cook. The movie is sometimes implausible, and yet the story has an innate charm to hold your attention. This maybe an animated film, but it's also undoubtedly a ""food"" movie, with Remy being inspired by Chef Gusteau, the pleasures of fine dining. It is also somewhat of a morale lesson, in that, Chef Gusteau as a ""ghost"" supplies Remy with more than the fine art of cooking. I'd have to disagree that this is a classic Disney tale. No one dies and there's no rain. Even the chief villain (the food critic Ego) has a happy ending. It is however, a very well made animated feature with super cooking rodents."

","I have seen with my son almost all the Pixar movies and loved them for their wit, timing, non-conformistic attitude etcetera, Ratatouille is a bit different though. I got the strong impression that the makers have seen the equally excellent Les Triplettes de Belleville and Amélie and not only for the fact that the story takes places in France. Ratatouille has a 'je ne sais quoi' (;-)quality, a wisdom and a sensitivity that transcends it above the sheer fun movies I am an omnivorous movie watcher and for me I can safely say that i haven't seen a movie in recent years that combines so much of the best of movie history.

","Remy has a dream. He wants to become a renowned chef cook much like his big example in life, the cook Gusteau. Alas, Remy has a problem. He's a rat and therefore not wholly accepted in the high class kitchens he wants to cook in. When events drive him and his colony out of the house they have been living in for some years things start to change though and he might just get his one shot at fulfilling his dreams.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar have made a big name when it comes to animated films. And with each film they bring to the screens they seem to be raising their own ladder and expectations a bit. Ratatouille is no different when it comes to that. Animated sequences are brilliant. Nice choice of colors, no single still moment in the background and excellent details at the heart of every scene. In that, Ratatouille is a brilliant animation film.<br/><br/>Storywise it doesn't bring much new with the exception of a rat working in a kitchen. The backing story behind that is an often used one though, so in that it isn't very special.<br/><br/>Still I found it a very enjoyable watch that left me with the feeling usually caused by ""feel good"" movies, and it had me in stitches on more than one occasion.

","The rendering is absolutely awesome. When the rats move, especially the whole pack, you really get the feeling they are real. That being said, there are only a few instances where you're awed by the craftsmanship, because you forget about it during most of the movie - the story is compelling, the characters are great, and the feeling of the movie is distinctly French. This is not due to some fake accent, but because of the richly rendered surroundings, as well as the way the humans behave. Adults both young and young at heart will get a lot out of this movie, and I also think kids will like it as well.<br/><br/>Just try and resist your kid wanting to rush out and buy a pet rat: While they are very intelligent, clean, and sociable, real rats can't talk or cook. And this movie might let you forget about that :) <br/><br/>Very entertaining, lots of fun, good writing, and awesome technically, so go and enjoy!"

","What Ratatouille's got that nearly every other family film hasn't got is that everything about it is honest and real, with of course the exception of little nightclub societies of rats. It explores many things that I think it's wonderful that young kids will see at an early age in a film like this, a family film, the kind that they should trust. One major thing I'm speaking of is the atmosphere and portrayal of Paris and the nature of the restaurants. Not only do we learn about the foods and what goes on in the kitchen, but we also see customers that are insinuated as rich Americans who visited the restaurant last time they vacationed in Paris and always get the same thing, and other such details. The film is rich rich rich with details, by the way, which should fascinate all who see this, young and old alike.<br/><br/>But what I'm really getting at when I say Ratatouille is more honest and true to life is it's truly profound message, a deeper, more thoughtful one than most family films. I'm not saying that family films necessarily all have token messages and common sense morale. I'm saying that hardly any of them truly say anything thought-provoking the way this one does. It's about creation against simple survival. It uses its fun little concept of a rat who prefers fine cuisine to garbage to maturely symbolize that theft is simply surviving, and adds nothing and gives nothing, whereas creation is making your mark on existence, and exercising life and earning the finer things. The film glorifies sophistication as well as it parodies prudish French poise.<br/><br/>The only flaw in the film I see is the stale device of the fantasy guardian angel of the fat deceased master cook Chef Gusteau. What this particular role in the film delivers could be done in the clever way everything else is.<br/><br/>You may wonder why I feel that this is one family film where kids can trust its realism when the film is about a talking rat that controls and understands human beings. Well, I can support my point about the film's message by referring to a clever key scene near the beginning where we see that rats talking to each other from their point of view, then briefly see the rats having the same conversation from a human's point of view, and it's made clear at that point that, though we as the audience understand them when they speak in Patton Oswald's voice, they can only be vocally understood by each other and not by humans. I told you the film is rich with details most family movies wouldn't have. You'll be shocked at its maturity."

","Spanning the last decade of Disney films, one is rarely filled with any hint of Disney deja vu of yesteryears. Over produced failings and plots of mediocrity have caused many to conclude that the certain Disney experience that once caused laughter, smiling tears, and most importantly thought, is a thing of the past; after Cars, Chicken Little, and even Nemo, I was forced to agree. Then Ratatouille scurried in. This is Disney-Pixar's crowning achievement, finally blending the Toy Story animation with that classic humanistic feel of the hand drawn. The characters and animators are on the same page thought the show with excellent performances by everyone (especially by the wondrous Peter O'Toole) After watching Ratatouille, one is left with the old sensation that somehow those crucial themes of identity, discovery of self, family, truth, and comradery are secretly baked into a multiple layered extravaganza. Ratatouille presents a three course Disney feast, stirring both soup and soul,not seen since The Lion King . Bravo Chef!"

"kgprophet","6","3","8","8 July 2007"," A Rat who Cooks in Paris? If it's Pixar - Yes.
","Brad Bird really put himself on the line with this strange concoction of a film. The only way this concept could work for the length of a feature (at 1 hour and 50 minutes - that's an eternity in animation time), is to go all out. Indeed, that's what this epic does and succeeds. From a floating imaginary chef to hair pulling as puppetry, the film is stuffed full of little details and subplots. No, you can't let a film with a strange Tom and Jerry feel to it become the central part of the film, so the character of Linguini and his own strife counter-balance the rat's story. Indeed, Linguini, a clutz in the Jerry Lewis vein, carries the second half of the story, with the rat mostly disappearing in many scenes. What Brad Bird accomplishes, meanwhile, is that Pixar magic, where you get an unexpected emotional attachment to strange world they have created. <br/><br/>So, in the end, this is not a story about a rat who likes to cook, it becomes the moral that anyone can try something new. AND - there are no dumb Randy Newman songs. The pacing is quick, there are a few good action scenes, and humour exists, but mostly forced. This is still more of an adult orient animated film (there is a love story), but the rat is cute and the unorthodox premise never bores. As uncertain to the reaction when the film opened, there is a solid timeless quality to the execution that will make it a classic. Something that could not be said about last year's ""Cars""."

The best part about the movie I guess was the way the events were designed and the reasonings in the movie. You know, at parts, I was expecting some classic events that you expect from animation context. But they didn't, substituted by more realistic, human-like ones. Also, no exaggerated useless drama, just enough. The laughing parts were adequate and at the right times too, and on top of all, the animation itself. At some points, you could actually feel the afford they've put on this to look as real as possible, yet an animation.

","Ratatouille is a good film in that it is very well executed in terms of animation (Pixar remain peerless) and in terms of sound design...basically the film looks and sounds sumptuous. But. This is nowhere near as entertaining as I wanted it to be and nowhere near as good as The Incredibles. Pixar have choked twice now with this and with Cars. I wanted to love this...what's not to love? The trailer highlighted a story with heart, with a lovable character in the form of Remy who wants to break away from the rat race and become more than he is. He believes that barriers can be broken down and humans and rats can work and exist together. It's a metaphor of course and not an unworthy one but the story execution lets this film down alarmingly. My main criticisms are: The characters are unlovable; Skinner the head Chef is loud, brash and down right cruel, Linguini the put upon plongeur who Remy helps learn how to cook is stupid and has an incredibly grating voice and Remy's family are add-ons who fill no real purpose except to provide the ying to Remy's raging yang. Also, the idea that pulling Linguini's hair makes his arms and hands move involuntarily pushes the suspension of disbelief too far in a film where we are already happy to accept that a Rat is a culinary genius. You can ask too much of an audience. The tone is all over the place and any message the film is trying to get across is totally lost in the dense plotting and endless dialogue between some rather unpleasant or boring characters. The kids in the cinema I was in became bored very quickly indeed. Only Peter O'Toole's performance and the animation/character of Remy himself are the saving graces here. Perhaps Remy should have tried escaping from this movie instead of the sewer. My advice to Brad Bird would probably be to make The Incredibles 2 as soon as possible."

The positive message of this very kid-oriented feature? ""Anyone can cook!"" Which is what rodent Remy (Patton Oswalt) does best; after being separated from his colony, he winds up in France, helping a gawky clean-up boy at an upscale restaurant produce brilliant dishes, much to the head chef's chagrin. Strangely enough, ""Ratatouille"" has a monopoly on frenetic action, brilliant cinematography and editing, and a fine balance between authentic and cartoonish animation styles--yet none of this really makes the film 'funny.' I often found myself laughing at the sheer zaniness of what was happening on-screen rather than any of the scripted punchlines; even in a theater populated largely by children and their parents, the occasions of unison laughter were few and far between. Bird hit the mark much better with ""The Incredibles,"" which combined genuine thrills with satire and a sense of humor that pleased kids AND their parents.

","Ratatouille is a film starring a inexperienced cook and a rat who knows how to cook.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it is TOO far fetched. We are introduced early on to Remy (the rat) and learn that he has a far stronger sense of smell than other rats, so much that he can smell rat poison and save his Dad. Effective rat poison is odorless, so this is sort of a plothole but whatever. Remy and the nest get washed away into Paris and the main story begins.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is centered around a restaurant, where a young inexperienced chef gets a job. He screws up a sauce somehow, and Remy saves the day by adding a bunch of ingredients. Here's a major problem I have... how did the rat just... LEARN to cook a complicated soup? I mean, he can smell ingredients, but where does he learn to cook them and what flavors work well together? The next part is where the film just launched a rocket filled with believability right off the planet. Since the rat can't work in a kitchen (obvious reasons) he sits on top of the chefs head and pulls hair to command him like a puppet because of some involuntary reflex. Are you serious? Just.... no.... Since the rat can understand English (huh? - would like to know how he developed it), why didn't they just rig some microphone thing so the rat could just sit on top of his head and talk to him? Frankly it would've been a more believable and interesting movie if they had gone into the background of how the rat learned to talk English (using subtitles and squeaks for the rest of the rats), and developed a tool to be able to speak to the human, and developed the relationship in that direction.<br/><br/>Regardless, eventually the human comes clean, the rat essentially works as a head chef in the new restaurant they open. Queue a little love fling with another chef and some drama with a couple competing chefs and that's the film.<br/><br/>I can only suspend my belief for so long before even my imagination is like, ""Whoa.... hold on guys."""

And, I'm not the world's biggest fan of it, but above The Lion King? <br/><br/>The only area that Ratatouille is superior to any of the afore-mentioned films is the excellent, realistic animation and the innovative 'action' sequences.

Brad Bird's Incredibles saga was a hugely engaging, entertaining and funny film, and this is not. I know a lot of people may disagree with me (129th??), but I felt this fell way short of the bar.

The two ideas are incompatible. The fraud storyline is not engaging. The movie is about twice as long as I'd prefer, due to dual protags whose stories need to receive development & resolution, but the usual psychodrama of earning a parents respect (Remy / rat) and believing in oneself (Linguini / human) must be a tiresome saw for kids, and adults have seen it a thousand times. The climax in which a swarm of rats gets the run of the kitchen of a French restaurant is over the top (and frankly kinda gross). All of this goes down while revisiting two of Disneys most exhausted, irritating mainstays; A) protagonists regardless of race/nationality will appear to be Caucasian Americans, and B) villains will always be foreign & physically extreme. Adding insult to injury is that there is a token black character in the kitchen who doesn't have a single line of dialog.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Pixar's run of successful movies.

Its a well written , consistently entertaining and visually stunning film that effortlessly ranks as one of the best of 2007.<br/><br/>The films story, in which a sewer rat dreams of becoming a chef, sounds pretty dubious on paper but thanks to a sharp witted script, excellent voice acting (particularly from o'toole) and that indescribable sprinkle of pixar magic , ratatouille transcends its odd synopsis and emerges as a wondrous film that you will want to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>As to be expected, the film looks gorgeous. From the ultra realistic food and wet rat hair to the beautiful shots of Paris, every frame of the film is a stunning sight to behold. The film is also very funny- the humour consists of well timed , witty ,character driven and sight gags that will have you laughing out loud.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a classic. Do yourself a favour and go see it."

","Rats, face it, are not the most popular creature on Earth, even if they are one the most numerous. Look at the vile creature that sneaks into the baby's room in Lady and the Tramp and you'll get a good idea of Man's perception on these little creatures.<br/><br/>But Pixar transforms these 'vile little beasties' into something completely adorable and lovable. And so, we get Remy. Remy's dream is to become a chef and eat real food instead of the rubbish that rats usually feast upon. After being separated from his family in an 'American Tail'-esquire way, he goes on a crazy ride through the sewers (in the style of 'Fievel goes West') and ends up under Paris. Meanwhile, a young man named Linguinie, on the wishes of his dead mother, is given a job at the three (formely five) star restaurant Gusteau's. When the two finally meet after a near-miss with some soup, the talent-less Linguinie realises his cooking potential in the little animal...<br/><br/>Sure, it might seem a bit far fetched with the whole 'rat knows how to cook' theme, but Ratatouille is just such a funny, sweet and charming film that you'll forget all about it. It's touching without getting too overly sentimental and it's funny without becoming too juvenile and forced (that one too often sees in todays numerous CGI flicks). The food in the film looks very delicious. It doesn't look like plastic at all. I know this is going to sound weird, but even the cake in the rubbish heap looked tasty. Ratatouille will not only evoke emotions, it''ll evoke your stomach too! The rendering and imagery is just fantastic.<br/><br/>The plot is fun and more importantly, unpredictable - which was a real problem in Pixar's previous films. The characters are memorable too. If I had to sum up Ratatouille in one word, it would be 'sweet.' Linguinie's somewhat odd friendship with Remy is sweet, all of the rats look sweet, just the entire film is sweet and funny. Go see Ratatouille - it's a delightful offering in today's animated wasteland."

Talking of Remy,its a animation masterpiece: the fur,the eyes, the tail...everything is just perfect. All in all this is a perfect combination of high quality animation and meaningful,well put up story.

Remy the main character is so comical really cute I wish he was real! The graphics are truly superb, it's a really clever story it's one of the best films I've seen in a long time cartoon wise I mean! It's a real feel good film, it will entertain Adults and Children alike.

"iago0618","6","2","5","10 July 2007"," Weakest of the Pixar films
","Title of this review aside, I found Ratatouille to be highly entertaining and generally solid.<br/><br/>That said, there is a major structural flaw that ruined the film for me: Remy's marionette control of Linguini crossed the line. First, it's just a little creepy but okay, whatever.<br/><br/>In every Pixar film where our heroes have interacted with humans (toys, fish, bugs) the heroes appear to act normal, at least from a human perspective. Not here. In Ratatouille, our non-human hero actually controls a human.<br/><br/>I can live with the communication between Remy and Linguini -- it's necessary. But the puppeteering was a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I have about the film is that it's a bit expository for my taste. But food, though we all enjoy it, can be a complicated topic and some explanation necessary.<br/><br/>Voice acting, animation, story -- all superb. Especially what I consider to be one of the hardest things to show: how food tastes. The moment when the grim eater tastes Remy's creation -- brilliant.<br/><br/>Hope to see better work next time, Mr. Bird. But thanks again for a great evening's entertainment."

","Wow. Number 51 on IMDb's top 250, huh? I thought ""Ratatouille"" was cute, but I didn't like it THAT much.<br/><br/>Pixar's latest boasts beautiful animation, perhaps the most accomplished yet, but the film as a whole never reached the inspired and dizzy heights attained by ""The Incredibles,"" to my mind a small masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" straddles an awkward and ambiguous line: a little too cartoony to be a completely adult film, but a little too sophisticated to be dismissed as a film for kids. It tells a warm and touching story about accepting differences and overcoming our preconceived prejudices, but I kept waiting for that unique brand of Pixar humour that never (or at least rarely) surfaced.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is Peter O'Toole, who plays Anton Ego, a fearsome food critic who delivers a beautiful soliloquy at the film's climax that encourages people to embrace things that are new while still retaining the ability to discriminate between things that are quality and things that are not. The soliloquy also happens to sound beautiful as delivered in O'Toole's mellifluous voice.<br/><br/>In a food culture dominated by total crap like McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell (among others) I appreciated ""Ratatouille""'s reminder that good, well-prepared food is a way to treat your body while so many people are poisoning theirs'. But I just didn't see the masterpiece here that so many others seem to.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","I have seen this movie today afternoon. I had so much of expectations before watching this flick. I thought it would be the best film ever made by Disney - Pixar. But it is not. I am not saying that it is a bad film. It is a good movie. I gave 8/10 for this movie. Though there is nothing much to complain about this film, I felt little bit bored couple of times. For me, recent films like Monster's House, Over the Hedge, Cars are better than this in the story & screenplay aspects. But this movie proves that we are living in a golden age of animation movies. Anyways .. this is my opinion. Sorry if I had hurt any of your feelings."

","If you love snobby French cooking, you'll love this.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fun movie like ""The Incredibles"", you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>It's not really a funny movie -- more of an ""Eek!"" (will the rat be killed?) and ""Awww"" (isn't that heartwarming?) kind of movie.<br/><br/>The animation is superb -- but the story is weak.<br/><br/>How Remy the Rat controls his human is just dumb. They lost me there. That and when hundreds of rats swarm a house, a kitchen -- I was on the side of the exterminator then.<br/><br/>One rat in a kitchen MIGHT be cute. Hundreds are horrible.<br/><br/>I loved Patton Oswalt as Remy and Peter O'Toole as the mean food critic. But Janeane Garofalo can barely be understood under her fakey French accent. (Which raises a good point: how come some of these French people have French accents -- but some have English or American? Shouldn't they be consistent?) <br/><br/>They were meticulous in creating a French restaurant kitchen, the scenery of Paris and the animation. I only wish they'd put as much effort into the script."
"james-3248","1","7","36","16 December 2011"," Seriously how can this film get more than 1 star
","The fact this film is about a rat cooking for humans is absolutely repulsive, putting me off of French food. The French stereotype in the film is also incredibly offensive. I don't understand Disney's love affair with rodents, there follow up film 'Tales of Desperuex' was just as awful. Personally rats and mice are horrible and most people would probably agree with me. Disney/Pixar's quality of films in the past 10 years has really dropped, since 'The Incredibles' all their other films have been dreadful, excluding Up and Toy Story 3. I would rather watch a marathon of Vin Diesel movies than have to watch this film again. Please stop making films about rodents they're not cute, they're vermin and need to be kept as far away from my food as possible."
"jfgibson73","4","2","6","9 January 2015"," Bit of a Disappointment
","Seeing this movie years after its release, I had pretty high expectations. Not only is it a Pixar movie (by Brad Bird!), it seems to have a reputation as one of their very best. I was disappointed for several reasons. I thought it was weird to cast Patton and not give him a single humorous line, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable. Neither does the fact that it's not really for young children, although that is also strange since Pixar usually makes movies that all ages can enjoy. What bothered me is that I didn't care at all about the story or the characters. I really don't get why it is so revered. I also wish they had used the opportunity to animate more of Paris. Take a look at the opening scenes of Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris and you'll see what I was hoping for. You can't deny that it is a work of impeccable quality--the effort pours out of every frame--but I don't see myself changing my opinion with future viewings."
"roedyg","5","2","6","18 October 2012"," No up to the best of Disney standard
","The animation is excellent especially the detailed and rapidly moving backgrounds. There is plenty of slapstick. They spend rather more time that I would like chasing the poor rat Remy all over the place with knives. The dialogue is a bit limp, similar to Ice Age, with only one in-joke for the adults that I noticed. Both the lead characters are supposed to be French, but have not a trace of a French accent. They both have aggressively American accents. I found this jarring. There is only occasional non-descript background music. Disney's best work in contrast puts singable music centre stage. The plot is somewhat predictable. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way they manipulate the audience alternately to identify with the rats and feel disgust for them."
"jburtroald95","5","2","6","15 March 2009"," If Pixar sinks any lower than this, they're doomed.
","Pixar are still producing interesting and enjoyable films, but lately the famous creators of the first ever fully computer generated film 'Toy Story' 1995 have been losing their touch. The possibly last real masterpiece 'The Incredibles' 2004 really shone as a spectacular ,unique and altogether wonderful film. Cars 2005 was interesting but used up most of its originality at the beginning.<br/><br/>Now 'Ratatouille' doesn't have the vast quantity of brilliance that the earlier films had but who could criticise a film with such heart. It's told us that cooking is not a chore but an art. If you take pleasure out of cooking then you will like watching this and people who aren't so keen will most likely have their opinions altered.<br/><br/>This movie's central character is Remy, a rat with great dreams, passion, intellect and smell. But he lives with hundreds of other rats who eat mindlessly out of garbage bins and have very different points of view. One day after a disastrous and near fatal encounter with a mad, elderly lady all the rats are forced to flee their home. But during the escape Remy goes astray and ends up at a Parisian restaurant that was once famous but now neglected. There he is saved by the soft heartedness of a simple garbage boy named Linguini who is trying to live up to his father. When the two friends combine each other's assets they become a very fine chef that begins to restore the sensation of the restaurant.<br/><br/>But when Anton Ego Â– a superficially harsh and sinister food critic, hears of the new success of the restaurant and of Linguini he decides to review the restaurant once more. His visit diminishes the friendship of the now former companions and the happiness of the story. Then when the pressure of the situation dives away all of the other chefs Linguini, Remy and the newly located other rats must reunite and stop the restaurant's reputation from being ruined beyond repair.<br/><br/>It's a comedy that shows us how any two living things can befriend each other. But it does drone on and lose its audience in some parts."

","I passed on seeing this movie in the theater because I didn't want to see a story about a rat that cooks. After hearing how ""great"" this film was, I went ahead and rented it. Yes, the animation looks great. But, I couldn't get over a rat touching, handling, cooking, and serving food for humans. The final scenes in the kitchen make me throw up a little in my mouth. It was disgusting. I realize its a cartoon, but the animators made it look almost too real. The scene where the rats fall from the ceiling in the old ladies house skeeved me out too. Mickey Mouse = good rat that looks like a cartoon. Remy = disgusting rat that made my stomach churn every time he touched food.<br/><br/>The story is bad. I'm all for suspending disbelief for a movie, but come on...a rat that controls a human, by pulling his hair, that cooks gourmet food....they are asking a lot. I can only imagine what Linguini's comb smells like."

He wants to be a cook and his rat family frowns upon him. That's when he teams up a human cook at a fancy restaurant.<br/><br/>It may be a little weird but the plot accompanies the movie perfectly. All the actors succeeded in giving a believable and honest performance. And for the first time in a kid's movie since The Incredibles I felt that the script was smart. There wasn't any cheesy moments when you have to roll your eyes due to the fact it has been done so many times before. Overall the plot, script, and acting blended very nicely.<br/><br/>The animation was very beautiful and modern. I also enjoyed how it gave one of the most unlikable animals,the mouse, a cute and likable design.

Remi is just a little rat named Remi, but he has big aspirations! All that Remi wants to do is be a cook, but hes a rat XD. Remi does become a cook with a little help from the wise words of chef the spirit of Chef Gusteau, as well as using Chef Linguini.

","Ratatouille (2007): Dir: Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava / Voices: Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy: Delightful and detailed computer animation about expression and devotion. Remy yearns to be a chef. Problem is that he is a rat with a taste for great food. He unites with Linguini where he performs through him in exchange for food. Of course, he is watched by a cynical chef, threatened by food critic Anton Ego, and perhaps even a visit from a health inspector. Directors Brad Bird Jan Pinkava collaborate and are given gorgeous Pixar presentation of France. Bird directed another Pixar film called The Incredibles as well as The Iron Giant. He is backed by the voice of Patton Oswalt as Remy whose passion for food makes it worth the risk. Whether it is ethical to deceive the public with regards of what is preparing their food, is up to the viewer. Lou Romano voices Linguini, a dish washer turned cook who is assisted by Remy. Janeane Garofalo as the female assigned to help Linguini is a complete cardboard romantic prop. Ian Holm voices the antagonist chef who conspires against Linguini. Brian Dennehy voices Remy's father whose old fashion traditions call for eating out of a trash can. Stunning animation that is often amusing and certainly recommended to kids. Simple plot with detailed structure that glorifies God's gift of food. Score: 6 / 10"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","7 October 2013"," My Personal Favourite Pixar Film
","Envisioned, cooked, garnished & served by the finest talents working at Pixar Animation Studios, Ratatouille is a magical blend of imagination, creativity & craftsmanship that puts together its fresh ingredients with remarkable care & attention to detail, is flavoured with fine dose of wit & huge shot of inspiration which is then baked to near-perfection under its impeccable direction, deftly written screenplay & incredible set of rich characters, followed by its garnishing with state-of-the-art animation, expert use of colour palettes & enchanting score, and is finally presented to us customers in a perfectly refined fashion.<br/><br/>Set in the locales of Paris, the story of Ratatouille concerns Remy; an ambitious rat who is gifted with a highly developed sense of taste n smell, is skilled in the art of cooking & wants to become a great chef one day. While his rodent appearance & human's aversion to rats already pose a fatal threat to his passion for cooking, new doors of possibilities are opened when a fateful event separates Remy from his family & takes him to the famous restaurant of his culinary hero where he tries to achieve his goal by forming an odd alliance with the restaurant's garbage boy which turns the culinary world upside down.<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by Brad Bird, Ratatouille marks yet another achievement for Pixar as this revolutionary studio continues to scale new heights with its flawless fusion of quality storytelling with breathtaking animation and of all the films they've dished out so far, this is my personal favourite. The precision with which each frame is rendered here speaks volumes about the extensive research that went into its production and whether it is the depiction of Parisian streets or French cuisines or culinary art or rodent lifestyle or passion n love for food, Ratatouille captures these tiniest of details with sublime delicacy.<br/><br/>The 3D animation from Pixar has always been at the forefront of its genre & with this film, it further pushes that art form into new realms to raise the bar once again. The biggest proof that Pixar absolutely nailed it when it comes to capturing the essence of food & culinary art is present in the moments when we find ourselves salivating for what actually are animated cuisines. Add to that, the characters inhabiting this picture are very life-like & well-rounded with defined arcs plus its storyline risks failure by taking the road-less-travelled but once again manages to come out a winner in the end, just like every single Pixar film before it.<br/><br/>While characters in almost all their films are brilliantly designed, wonderfully detailed & smoothly rendered on the screen, there is one more thing that plays a vital role behind its success but never really gets enough credit & that's the contribution of its voice-cast. Time n again, Pixar has come up with a fitting cast to voice its characters & with Ratatouille, the tradition continues for the French accent here is pretty much spot-on. And last but not the least, there's Michael Giacchino's beautiful, heartwarming & delightful score that turns this tale into an emotional roller-coaster ride with its wild, dynamic & adventurous tracks.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ratatouille is a mouth-watering blend of action, adventure, ambition, art & awesomeness that continues Pixar's unbroken winning streak by hitting an eighth consecutive home-run for the studio and, with the help of its terrific direction, inventive screenplay, dazzling visuals, gorgeous animation, awe-inspiring camera-work, tight editing, exquisite use of humour & mesmerising score, effortlessly succeeds as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & fulfilling films ever made. Inspiring, motivating & satiating on both visceral & emotional scale plus radiating its heartfelt warmth effectively from start to finish, this culinary classic is a finger-lickin' delicious cuisine that comes delightfully recommended."

"babybootz77","8","1","2","11 December 2010"," Ratatouille grabs us with its artistic attention to detail and heartwarming story of believing in yourself and following your dreams.
","Pixar, and more specifically director/writer Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles), have again captured the child in all of us through the stunning visuals and sounds of Ratatouille. Unlike other Pixar films, (such as Monsters, Inc. or Finding Nemo), Ratatouille is not full of laugh out loud jokes and vibrant, bright colors. Instead it grabs us with its artistic attention to detail and heartwarming story of believing in yourself and following your dreams. <br/><br/>Remy, voiced by comedian/actor Patton Oswald, is an atypical rodent living beneath the streets of Paris, France. His highly developed sense of smell and taste earn him the boring job of poison checker for the rest of his clan. Remy, however, dreams of using his talent to cook. By sneaking into a human's kitchen, he discovers the cookbooks of the famous French culinary genius, Chef Auguste Gasteau (Brad Garrett). Gasteau believes that ""anyone can cook"", and Remy, through misfortune, luck, and with the help of the bumbling, lovable, kitchen garbage man Linguine (Lou Romano), sets out and proves just that. <br/><br/>Despite being an animation, the artistry and detail of the scenes and characters have a realism to them that pulls the viewer in to Remy's world. Children will identify with the rodent whose father (Brian Dennehy) thinks he knows what's best for everyone, and adults will appreciate Remy's drive to follow his dreams. Along the way, Remy stays true to himself, as well as breaking the species barrier and overcoming the prejudices between rats and humans. He wins over the heart of Chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) and causes food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) to question his own beliefs.<br/><br/>The sound effects are so phenomenal that just listening to it without watching it will enable a viewer to picture the whole film in their head. While the actors voicing the characters are well-known, they do such a great job that it's not obvious who's who without knowing ahead of time. Gasteau as Remy's sub-conscience reinforces the theme of the film without seeming to overdo it. His posthumous presence is a reminder that he's the driving force behind Remy and his dream of cooking. Chef Colette also idolized Gasteau and she, too, believes that anyone can cook. With her as their teacher, Linguini/Remy find their place in the culinary world despite the efforts of Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Finally, the animal/human relationships are reminiscent of the animated film A Bee Movie, which also involves an animal leaving the nest to follow his dreams, along the way cultivating a mutual friendship of respect and love with a human."

","I haven't been a big fan of Pixar films, mainly because I think they receive too much praise and put other CGI films to shame. I still find them entertaining and fun to watch, but when I watched Ratatouille, I was amazed with how well this movie was cooked to perfection. It's a rare treat to come across a movie like this.<br/><br/>With Pixar films containing a fresh, original story, Ratatouille is yet another one of those. Remy is a young rat who dreams of becoming a chef. However, he gets separated from his pack during an evacuation and ends up being in the streets of Paris, France. After realizing that his favorite chef had died recently and the restaurant he owned is loosing it's reputation, Remy decides to follow his idol's steps and shows off his cooking skills by working with clumsy cook Linguini and staying out of trouble too. It's a very nice plot to write for a children's book, but as a movie, it's fantastic!<br/><br/>Ratatouille creates a bright atmosphere thanks to it's flawless animation and generally light-hearted comedy. The story was really engaging and was presented in a skilled way. The music fits the setting quite well, with a good mix of fine French tunes and a score that does a good job recreating the feel of a cat-and-mouse-like scene.<br/><br/>Probably what I found most impressive about the movie is the main character Remy, because he portrays differently from other cartoon rodents. Unlike those other rodents that like to trick cats and create major havoc, Remy shows true characteristic and expression as he wants to discover and create like a human rather than just surviving like other rats. His cuteness, bold voice (done by Patton Oswalt) and fun personality show him to be a very likable protagonist.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a outstanding movie that really does bring fun into cooking. With a golden plot, enjoyable mayhem and a lovable main character, it's a movie well worth sticking your teeth into. ""A-"""

","Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) is a rat that loves cooking in the movie ""Ratatouille"" (2007).

During a flood, Remy became separated from the rest of his family and found himself under Gusteau's famous restaurant. <br/><br/>Linguini (voice of Lou Romano) is a garbage boy at the Gusteau's restaurant. One night Linguini spilled some ingredients in the soup and messed up with the recipe, Remy was horrified and ran to save the soup. Skinner (voice of Ian Halm), the manager, asked Linguini to re-do the soup since everyone at the restaurant liked it. Remy was trapped by Linguini, while Linguini was on his way to dispose of the rat, he recognized the rat's cooking talent. Instead of killing the rat, Linguini decided to take Remy home to teach him how to cook. Ever since, Remy became the ""little chef."" Remy and Linguini found a means to overcome their language barrier, with Remy pulling Linguini's hair under his toque Blanche to control his limbs like a marionette. However, customers loved the ""little chef"" cooking and eventually Linguini turned to be a success manager of the restaurant.<br/><br/>Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. In the film ""Ratatouille"", the director Brad Bird and co-director Jan Pinkava show a great deal of examples that illustrates how cynical humans can be. They are underestimating God's creatures and overestimating their complete selfishness and foolishness. Little chef's talents combined with the garbage boy human appearance and created one of the most famous Parisian dishes ""Ratatouille.""<br/><br/>A lot of movies are produced every year, but not a lot with ideals and wonderful animation. It is not the techniques neither the dressing, it is the spirit of the director who tried, and actually did, present his message through cartoon by comparing the life of two distinct unbalance creatures: one who refuses the garbage's life and one who collects the garbage. However, they both unite with the harmony of art and creation."

"dminkster","6","1","2","4 June 2009"," not up to the usual
","I was really disappointed in the film, it didn't have much of a story line, and the characters weren't as filled out as usual. I can't tell if it was the writing, or the voice performances, but I really didn't much care for it. <br/><br/>There wasn't the strong motivation of Nemo, for instance, where they HAD to find Nemo. Remy simply wanted to be a great cook, but there was no real driving force behind this want. The relationship between him and what's his name, the young chef (see I can't even remember his name) was so ho hum, not vital enough to drive the picture. And there were way too many animated humans, unlike Nemo and Pixar's previous efforts. I am probably in the minority, but animated human characters just don't get it for me. Animated animals, cars, chairs, fine, humans, no. <br/><br/>Actor wise, I think Peter O'Toole was the most successful in his characterization, and the film could have used some more voice talent of his level. The voice of Remy didn't capture any excitement, energy, nothing vital or arresting. Like wise Brad Garret as the Ghost Chef. I loved him on Raymond, but he didn't really find a character here, however he wasn't alone. <br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were too high, but Pixar has never let me down and I expected this to be right up there with their others."

The plot is very original and very creative. Following a rat's dream to be a cook in France was a great idea. It's like two opposite world's colliding. The CGI is fantastic and there are moments where you actually forget your watching an animated movie. Unfortunately there aren't many funny scenes in the movie but It doesn't need them, the film works in different sort of way. This is a Pixar movie that keeps interested in the story and not the comedy. I thought Remmy constantly talking to an imaginary apparition of his idol was weird but other than that I can't really find anything else to wrong with it.

"lizziebeth-1","10","1","2","17 April 2009"," Anton Ego voices the best critique of a critic on record in this most adult-friendly Pixar Trek.(10/10)
","Ratatouille was forced to give a ""Quality Assurance guarantee"" that this is ""100% genuine animation-–No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used"" when its rat-scurrying, soup-sloshing, and nose-twitching detail was found to be so terrific that some preview audiences thought it was done with motion capture.<br/><br/>2008 saw Ratatouille(2007) rightfully win the Best Animated Feature Oscar (with noms for another 4) not only for its realistic motion/cartoonish character 3D animation, but because its modern fairytale storytelling prowess is of the caliber of Hans Christian Andersen. It's an instant classic.<br/><br/>Unlike other Pixar instant classics, this one isn't really for littlies. Almost completely devoid of hyperbole or of overused conventions, Ratatouille's realism is a welcome gift for its patient adults. The double-hitter plot is about a talented rat discovering that his multiple roles make him robust, not a victim, and how mankind could accommodate other forms of life on a different scale/lifespan of existence--if we chose to.<br/><br/>Ratatouille(2007) betters its direct competition--DreamWorks' heavily marketed Bee Movie(2007)--by combining a straight story about the human/animal contract with deeper pathos and allegory for human relationships. In Ratatouille we find human analogues to our most vexing relationships with our egos and authority figures.<br/><br/>The ""better father"" theme was previously explored in Finding Nemo(2003) and the (storytelling-wise) slightly clumsier Happy Feet(2006)--sorry George Miller--but those were aimed mostly at children. Ratatouille(2007) is squarely aimed at their parents, who may have been guilty of voicing opinions like the father rat's: ""We look after our own kind (because) the world belongs to our enemy"", as they willingly created the insular communities that their unfortunate children would have to grow up in. This is the main reason for depicting the upward-looking, ready-to-move-out-of-home Remy as blue and cuter than his brutish, much uglier brown rat father. But let's not deconstruct too far.<br/><br/>The question at the core of their cross-generational argument(s) has now been answered. In countries where women and minorities got the vote and access to good jobs, it's getting very difficult to sound mentally competent insisting that ""you can't change nature"". When endemic political advantage is cemented as ""nature"" by both the culture and religion of the society in question, it is the job of the young to question that, because they have to inherit it. Ratatouille is brilliant at reminding such insular fathers that when they uphold this ""nature"", they do it against their own children, keeping the parents' failure to get a better deal unchallenged.<br/><br/>There is another powerful thread in Ratatouille, that of our social reconsideration for animal companions we'd normally revile for their surprising competitive success. In this, Ratatouille resembles Babe(1995), its most worthy filmic companion.<br/><br/>The story ennobles all those who join the level of debate (compete) in their chosen profession by signifying that even if our world isn't set up to treat the truths of the politically unequal as real, eventually they will be heard. Eventually everyone has to accept change, because, as Ratatouille's wisdom is voiced by little Remy, ""change IS nature, dad, the part we can influence--and it starts as soon as we decide"". Humanity went to the moon only because we set ourselves the goal; 3D features happened only because Pixar ""reinvented the universe"" (requisite technologies).<br/><br/>The delicately withheld character of Anton Ego is a welcome instant archetype, perfectly named for being the quintessential self-satisfied pompous loner who needs his ego pricked. And so, in the most balanced comeuppance that any film can/has shown, Peter O'Toole's perfectly inflected critic is eventually reformed: ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism which is fun...."" (generally a male-specific cruelty Germans call schadenfreude; not all of us are like this) ""....to both write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so."" (The Brady Bunch wasn't TV's finest hour, yet millions grew up pining for their parents to be that cheesy.)<br/><br/>It cannot go unobserved that ""Skinner"" is a very UN-FRENCH name for Ratatouille's rampant but diminutive Frenchie. This is due to the film's dimorphous central caricature: while Ego is a goth-like emaciated tall guy more resembling the actual--very American--BF.Skinner (cf ""operant conditioning chamber""--Wikipaedia), the caricature's other half is a sight-gag on the so-called Skinner Box itself.<br/><br/>Burrhus.F Skinner was probably behaviourism's most-reviled psychologist. His heyday accounts for the slightly 1950s look of Ratatouille's Paris. Prof Skinner's arguably overzealous positivism for empirical evidence was borne of his own ""Skinner Box"" RAT EXPERIMENTS which made for his purely robot-like explanations of people. The film therefore pokes subtle fun at the scientist by having an ultra-short namesake stand ON the proverbial Skinner Box--downgraded to a step-ladder--to see. Interestingly, Skinner is further caricatured as a sellout chef.<br/><br/>Ratatouille's cartoony humans are balanced out by their realistic motion, and by the breathtakingly detailed backdrops of Paris at its most beautiful.<br/><br/>However the true beauty of Ratatouille is its ability to weave together so many threads into ostensibly just one story. This is the meat of storytelling, and in this instance, the high art of original writing. Both Remy's prologue with the violent little-old-lady (establishing his rat respect as a poison-checker), and Anton Ego's comeuppance in the epilogue add to the overall message of due respect for little Remy as The Best Chef in France.<br/><br/>Ratatouille(2007) therefore deserves the highest popular and industry respect aside the original Babe(1995). The rug-puller truth for its critic was the same as for all of us: we're all human, even if some of us are less human than others.(10/10)"

How anyone can make a rat appealing is beyond me, but they have done it.

"jpschapira","9","1","2","13 March 2009"," Unusually unforgettable...I feel like cooking
","Maybe it's possible for anyone to cook, but we can't deny that there would have to be a clear agreement on what the expression 'cooking' means. If we're talking about the kind of cooking Remy -the main character of ""Ratatouille""- does, it certainly becomes unimaginable that, excuse my repetition, ""Anyone can cook"" (the title of Chef Gusteau's book and Remy's inspiration). But as food critic Anton Ego says, ""great cooking can come from unexpected places"". And I still haven't mentioned Remy is a rat.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's ""Ratatouille"" is the most unusual of Pixar's productions and one of the strangest animated full-length pictures ever made. Unlike Pixar's previous achievements, it doesn't a hero in a crusade, with a final objective in mind. Remy wants to be a cook and expresses his desire to the amazement of others (his sense of smell is so good that he becomes the 'poison detector' of his family's food, and that's as far as his father recognizes his talent), but it's not the film's overall goal, where everything is usually directed. Remy doesn't even make friends during his journey (to call it a name), so we don't get a wide gallery of characters; only Chef Gusteau (deceased and an imaginary friend that can't really help the rat) and Linguini, a young guy who's Gusteau's unrecognized son and ends up cooking the dishes Remy's always dreamed of in the most unexpected of situations, thus providing a sort of conflict for the movie and the figure of a villain in Chef Skinner.<br/><br/>All of this takes place in 'Gusteau's', the restaurant of the deceased chef, which is almost the only scenario of the film, that Bird exploits without rest (watch one scene in which plenty of rats are hiding in the kitchen and try their best not to be noticed: it's classic animation, classic Disney). Because it's not much what the Bird and the movie need to create an instant classic; everything is reduced to basics and works. One relationship (between Remy and Linguini) and the struggles it involves for each one to get what he wants.<br/><br/>It's also in this aspect that ""Ratatouille"" stands out as one of the most original animation pieces ever made. We've seen animals talking to each other a thousand times, and in a lot of occasions we've seen them trying to talk to humans, but humans never understand. However, even when they might miraculously get human help to achieve their goals, their success occurs entirely in the animal world, wherever that is, among animals. We never forget everything is fiction, but in ""Ratatouille"" Remy's dream comes true (with human help) in the real world; in France, in Paris.<br/><br/>I liked ""Happy Feet"" because Mumble danced along and helped his race because of his own merit. But those penguins saw humans as 'aliens', and didn't understand the weapons they used to harm them (in fact, they even saw some of them as gifts). Remy and his family know what men do to rats, but deep inside this 'little chef' believes that there's some good in the world. And he makes it throughAmong humans."

","Brad Bird, a member of the Simpsons team in its early days and the writer and director of the Iron Giant and the Incredibles. Pixar studios have made some of the best animated films ever, film Toy Story to the Wall-E, only missing the mark once. Pixar is the only Hollywood studio that can get away with such uncinematic material.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat from rural France who has a highly developed sense of taste and smell. He is obsessed with cooking and after getting separated from his colony ends up in the centre of Paris. He goes to the result of his ideal Auguste Gusteau who had recently died. He watches the kitchen staff work and sees the new garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) nearly ruining the soap of the day. Remy goes in to the kitchen an starts to make a tasty, but gets caught by Linguini. However, Linguini comes up with the idea that the two can work in a team and the young man becomes a cooking celebrity in France. However, the team have to take on the villainous the head-chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who used Auguste Gusteau's image to sell cheap frozen dinners. During the film Remy and Linguini suffer the highs and lows of celebrity and cookery and friendship, strain loyalties and romance, as well as tacking the evil Skinner and having to please the Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the toughest food critic in Paris.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful, which is what you expect from a Pixar film, but there is more then that. In Ratatouille there are characters you care about, good voice acting, a strong plot, great designs and a lot of research was conducted. This was a film made from love. The humour is mostly slapstick, but it's a kid film, so you expect it and it's good slapstick. There were also good visual and verbal jokes. The best humour involves the mass of rats. I also thought that the hard-as-nails female chef Collette (Janeane Garofalo) was an excellent comic creation. There is also some dark humour and jokes for adults. However there is one scene which may upset very young or sensitive children, but most will like it.<br/><br/>I admit I prefer the Incredibles, but Ratatouille is an excellent follow up by Brad Bird and I would like him to either do a sequel for the Incredibles or work as the Simpsons show runner just to sort out the once great show.<br/><br/>Fantastic film."

","Surprising exploring rodents in the kitchen is every restaurateur's (or housewife's) nightmare but the makers of this amiable animated movie turn that situation nicely on its head by making their protagonist a first-class gourmet that conveniently guides his artless master to fame and fortune in the culinary arts. Despite being the secret son of a famous (but subsequently) disgraced chef, he is engaged as a caretaker in his late father's bistro and mistreated by just everybody, especially the ambitious Head Chef who has his own designs on the place. However, his biggest nemesis is the fearsome food critic (splendidly voiced by Peter O'Toole) whose scathing review had sent his own father to an early grave and is intent on finding out just what the fuss of the revamped restaurant is all about. Aiding him in ditching his persecutors (including the belated appearance of a sanitary official) are a tough but conventional female cook, the friendly and constantly inventive mouse and, at the climax  just when everything seems lost after his employees quit him en masse upon discovering who the true gastronomical genius really is  the rat's entire family who find themselves engaged as impromptu cooks!

"Mario64","10","1","2","21 December 2008"," An Animated Masterpiece
","Just recently I sat down in my bedroom and watched the Ratatouille DVD on my surround sound system. It was my third time watching the film, and for some reason it may have been the most enjoyable. Well the first time viewing it was at a drive in movie theater, which is not really the best way to enjoy a film, but still I don't think that has anything to do with my appreciating it more in later viewing. Something clicked in my in my third viewing and I said to myself, ""Man, this isn't just a great film, it's a Disney Classic like Beauty and the Beast and Snow White"".<br/><br/>Ratatouille does one thing only the brilliant duo of Disney and Pixar could accomplish: not only does it make rats cute, but it makes them enduring characters in an animated film, every bit as much so as the fish in Finding Nemo and the Toys in Toy Story. Remy is a rodent with charming qualities, a great sense of smell and taste and a love of food which leads him to become a chef master. On the line of my belief that this is a classic Disney film, Remy is really the classic Disney animated character.<br/><br/>A similar classicalness could be said of Linguini, a somewhat geeky awkward human who befriends Remy after he takes credit, accidentally, for one of the rat's delicious dishes. Linguini needs Remy so he can repeat the recipe or he'll lose his job. The way the human and rat communicate is fascinating, and the way that they arrange how to work together in the kitchen is hilarious and dazzling. The food looks so great here that it makes one hungry while looking at it.<br/><br/>And along the way there great supporting characters including Rats like Remy's dopey brother Emile, and humans like Linguini's feisty mentor and love interest Collette, and his insensitive selfish boss Skinner. And there's Gusteau, Remy's imaginary friend, a deceased Chef that guides his journey, and Anton Ego a great representative of a real critic with harsh critiques. But really it's Remy and Linguini that dominate the film, and appropriately so. They have a chemistry that's strong, funny, awkward, angry and joyful; sometimes many of those things all at once.<br/><br/>What was true for other Pixar masterpieces is there for Ratatouille. It's a great story, full of well developed characters that are fantastic creations of art, has hilarious and wildly entertaining sequences, and great conflicts between the good and the not so good. But the main goal for the protagonists in this film is not to beat the bad guy; it's for them to produce great food. It's a simple pure idea taken to extraordinary height.<br/><br/>I'm doing something I have not done for many films here on IMDb. I'm changing my original rating for a movie. What once was a 9 now is a 10. I believe 20 years from now Ratatouille will be looked at as one of the finest animated achievements of this computer animated era of films. I'm not quite ready to call it a Snow White or Beauty and the Beast (my personal favorite animated movie of all time) but it comes quite close. A Disney Pixar Masterpiece."

","Just when you thought it was too hot to enjoy the company of a Parisian crew in a French kitchen, comes this delightful story of Remy (Patton Oswalt) a country rat with a knack for bourgeois cooking. The animation is top notch and visually incredible. I found very little in the way of any portions which might detract the story from it's intended audience, namely those who enjoy a good story. The great talent of Peter O'Toole is the voice of Anton Ego. a empirical food critic and the icing on this movie cake. Others like (Ian Holm) who is Skinner's voice, add impetus to the star, Lou Romano who plays Linguini. He's excellent by the way as are Brian Dennehy as Django and Peter Sohn who is Emile's voice. Two surprises to this film are James Remar (Ajax, from the Warriors) plays Larousse and Janeane Garofalo who is the voice of Colett, the heart-throb of our hero. The fast paced action and sympathetic storyline is enhanced by the musical score. In all the many talents who contributed to this magnificent tale are to be praised as the story becomes as favorably superb as the recipes themselves. A story for the top pantry shelf and a true classic for the visual library of any connoisseur of fine films. ****"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","13 May 2008"," Charming but not great (spoilers)
","As well made and as well written as Ratatouille is, there's also something rather uninspiring about it. It doesn't have the emotional heft of Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo, it isn't as funny as Toy Story and it isn't as exciting as The Incredibles. Instead it's a tasteful film that evaporates from one's memory as quickly as a mediocre meal. There isn't much in this film to sink your teeth into.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Ratatouille is its lack of laughs. After all, this is a comedy first and foremost. Therefore it's not a great sign when you only laugh out loud once.<br/><br/>The scene that got this response involved the scummy Chef Skinner. He begins to see rats and he's growing increasingly paranoid about his ability to control the restaurant. So he speaks to a confidant about his fears and starts clicking his fingers, going, 'Ooh, it's here', pretending to see the rodent everywhere. It's marvellously silly, something that's actually a rare commodity in a highly controlled film.<br/><br/>The problem that this high level of control has is that you can see almost everything coming. At the beginning you know that Remy the rat is going to be separated from his family and that he'll have to discover himself. You also know that he'll face challenges and strike up an alliance with a fellow outcast. And you know that near the end something bad will happen so that he has a challenge to overcome in the final act. You also know, because the guys at Pixar are smart, that Remy will succeed in the end but that his victory will be on a personal rather than grandiose scale. Consequently you see all the beats coming  there's nothing here that's going to take you by surprise.<br/><br/>That isn't necessarily a problem. Predictability needn't diminish a film's power to entertain. But the stuff that connects the beats is hardly top-drawer material. It's very run of the mill.<br/><br/>Which is a shame when a film is as technically accomplished as Ratatouille is. The animation is beautiful and the Paris that is presented here is gorgeous  there are some absolutely stunning panoramic shots and the scene between Remy and Linguini by the Seine drips with atmosphere. I also adored Remy's expressions  the rat can't actually talk with humans, instead he has to nod or shrug his shoulders, and it was always clear what he was trying to say.<br/><br/>Another superb piece of animation is when a sleeping Linguini is cooking. You see, this kid can't cook to save his life, and Remy the rat who can cook very well isn't allowed in the restaurant because, well, he's a rat, so they develop a technique where Remy sits on Linguini's head (under his hat) and by pulling on his hair he's somehow able to coordinate the boy. Well, there's a scene where Remy is doing this while Linguini is asleep. But the kid has sunglasses on, so one of his work colleagues doesn't realise that she's talking to someone who's asleep  the gormless expressions and twitchy body movements are a joy to watch.<br/><br/>But this puppeteering does make you wonder once or twice. There's a romantic sup-plot between Linguini and the film's only female cook. But the kid only kisses the girl because Remy is pulling his hair and controlling his body. Would Linguini know how to kiss otherwise? And there's a scene where Linguini and his girlfriend ride off on her motorbike. Somehow, in the heat of it all, Remy loses his grip on his pal and the couple ride off alone. Is the kid able to perform without his master rat puppeteer? Well, that's probably a yes, as the couple remain together until the end of the film.<br/><br/>One thing that's immediately clear when watching Ratatouille is how good Pixar are at action. All the action scenes are flawless. My favourite is the scene where an old lady spots Remy in her house and begins trying to shoot him. She shoots her house up so much that the ceiling comes crashing down. But then we see that hundreds of rats have fallen down and they're staring at her. It's beautifully timed. And the action that follows where the old lady shoots at the rats from a bridge as they try and make a river escape is impeccable as well.<br/><br/>And then there's the scooter chase, where the evil chef Skinner chases our hero. It's fabulous. But at the same time you kind of get the feeling that it's a little tacked on. The film knows it hasn't had an action scene in a while, so it throws one in just in case anyone has nodded off.<br/><br/>But it's the attempts to keep everyone entertained with action and conflict and all the plot points tied up that make Ratatouille more ordinary than it should be. The need to have a story with twists and turns detracts from the sweetness of the film. Because the film is all about doing your best  it's about pursuing your dream and not giving up. But although the end of the film is lovely, I kind of felt that I didn't deserve to feel as warm and fuzzy as I did  I didn't think the film had earned this response; the end is great, but the rest is so-so.<br/><br/>But speaking of the ending, I do like the way that Remy succeeds on his own terms. It would be too silly for him to become a famous Parisian chef, admired and respected by all. But the fact that he eventually has his own place and does his own thing is a good lesson for all  celebrity or fame should never be anyone's goal; instead you should pursue pleasure and contentment. That's the road to self-fulfilment and happiness."

Everyone believes Linguini is a fantastic cook, but not everyone is happy. Top chef Skinner (Holm) has other ideas.<br/><br/>From Disney and Pixar comes another wonderful animated film. To be honest, I have mixed opinions on each Pixar film, but 'Ratatouille' is one of the more enjoyable ones for me. The animation has been beautifully made and a well crafted story has been written. Like all animated films now, it comes with a league of top talent, including Ian Holm and Peter O'Toole. Every star is able to create such a realistic sounding French accent, that you will have a hard time trying to work out which character belongs to which star. Although I was rooting for a different film, I can see why 'Ratatouille' won the Oscar for best animated feature.<br/><br/>A real gourmet kitchen, and I get to watch.  Remy (Patton Oswalt)"
"SPcamert","9","1","2","24 April 2008"," Pixar does it again
","I have yet to see a movie done by the folks at Pixar that didn't make me laugh, smile, or even want to cry. This movie touches on all points and winds up with their typically surprising yet always satisfying ending. In a world where a rat can cook and understand English anything is possible, even impressing the stuffiest of critics. It's a silly concept really, and done by anyone else would be dismissible as just another kid's movie, but Ratatouille captures the heart and makes you care about every one of the characters. I am glad to see that the interaction between the rats and the humans didn't go beyond simply nodding but even that level of communication conveys exactly what each party is attempting to get across. An excellent movie that I'm sure I'll watch with my kids."
"mobileestates","10","1","2","23 April 2008"," A Beautiful Tale That Couldn't Be Better
","This film mesmerized me in so many ways, and I feel fairly certain you will feel the same if you have any appreciation for animation (though I have faith that those apathetic to the animated genre will still find much to enjoy). I have been a student of animation, both traditional and 3D, for many years now, and Ratatouille really blew my mind.<br/><br/>My ability to suspend disbelief was completely involuntary; for instance, I was saddened to see the list of voice actors who took part in the film. Though I knew nearly every one of the top fifteen actors, I recognized none of their voices on my first or second viewings (not that I couldn't pinpoint Patton Oswalt's voice from a crowded room, just that the tale's seamless creation of its virtual world didn't leave me thinking about such things). Each character so perfectly matches their voice- a feat that can be accredited to the modelers, the animators, and the voice actors alike- that you won't feel like famous voice actors were ever involved. The story is heartwarming, original, and hilarious: altogether encompassing everything I could possibly ask for in a comedy.<br/><br/>Ratatouille has the kind of story that is so often cut short by a ridiculous ending that either breaks the illusion of reality or leaves you with an unsatisfactory resolution that makes you replace your love of the rest of the film with your dislike of the end. Ratatouille's ending succeeds in creating neither of these endings; in fact, I daresay the ending is my favorite part.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, while limited, fits the film so perfectly, and the one lyrical track of note, being Le Festin by Camille, is as fantastic and memorable as the film itself.<br/><br/>The environments manage to be both perfectly believable and cartoon enough to not supersede the characters' styles.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is my favorite Disney film to date, above so many other beloved treasures. If you haven't seen it, do so- you won't be disappointed."

","Ratatouile is one of those films than can entertain children as well as adults. It's smart, beautifully crafted in animation. The story of a Rat who aspires to be a great French chef like Gusteau, a fictional male Julia Child. He gets caught up watching Gusteau as he learns of his death from television where the resident of the house, an old French lady with a gun, goes literally ballistic when she sees two mice. She blows the ceiling only to discover a scene like in Williard or Ben about a thousand rats living above her. Horrified, she begins shooting like Dick Cheney on vacation. She doesn't stop once they leave her house which almost destroyed. She goes right on separating the main character rat and his family and friends.

I was relieved to find that the humor and language used was fresh and witty, and didn't stoop to mediocre attempts at ""being cool"" - by being smart, it had it's own charm and style. The animation was spectacular, one the the best yet on Pixar's part. I loved the music- it was very fitting for the film, and I loved that it was in FRENCH. The plot development was done very well, as was the character development, particularly Anton Ego. Ratatouille contained so many subtleties that really add to it and make it a truly great animated film. I think it's suitable and enjoyable for anyone of any age without losing any charm or fun. There were just a couple snags here and there, but that's to be had with almost any movie. This is definitely one of my favorites :)"

","First, I want to say that I was at first greatly disappointed to see the upcoming JOHN CARTER OF MARS pass through several possible directors into the hands of Pixar. But after seeing RATATOUILLE I find myself thinking that they may indeed do justice to the Edgar Rice Burroughs story.<br/><br/>RATATOUILLE naturally is going to entertain young kids, but more than any previous Pixar movie, this has a decidedly adult appeal, culminating in the Peter O'Toole (voicing food critic Anton Ego) speech at the end. The script, the music, the voice acting along with the wonderfully detailed animation make this a movie which entertains adults possibly even more than it does kids. I certainly feel no shame in enjoying this film even without any youngsters to give me an excuse for seeing it.<br/><br/>In a year of downbeat movies, this is a breath of fresh air and is most enthusiastically recommended by yours truly."

The characters are distinctive, delightful and well defined in terms of both animation and voice acting. The animation is as good as anything I've ever seen.<br/><br/>If there's a problem, it's that some aspects of the story are a little formulaic in that our heroes 'let each other down a bit and then redeem themselves', which seems to be a standard plot device in animated kids movies these days, and in this case not entirely believable.

Not only did I like it, there was nothing to dislike! As I mentioned earlier, animation is great (good job Pixar!). The same accounts for the editing, directing, voices, ideas and everything. The whole ""crew"" responsible for this movie gets a pat on the back! It's nice to see such a great list of actors. Very well done to all of you! First class!<br/><br/>The morals outlined in the plot should be embraced by us all. Therefore, this is a definite see for kids, teens, adults, everyone alike. Everybody can learn from this, where, in our society, we see rats and many other animals as vermin - while others such as dogs, hamsters and cats, are (generally) more fortunate in their life and fates. In regard to children in particular, it must be noted that this film has great psychological effect. Many phobias toward certain animals develop in childhood, often rooted in the parenting (or actions of the parents) and society itself.<br/><br/>Giving this film a 10/10 is, let's say, a ""huge understatement"".

","(Karthik Narayan) I am not sure whether the movie title and the lead character being a rat was purely coincidental, but Ratatouille brings with it a whiff of freshness.<br/><br/>Adventure through the eyes of a rat presents something never seen before on film. The novel simply melting your heart, as Remy goes upon realizing his greatest dream in life  becoming one of France's best chefs. Goes to show that you can do anything when you believe in yourself. To quote Chef Gusteau: ""If you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead""  says it all.<br/><br/>Adrenaline rushing first few moments lead up to a fascinating watch over the next one hour as the creativity and fun begins. Witty lines add to the comedy, the storyline is fast paced and charming, to say the least.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say as a critic; the voice-over blends with the nature of the character and the mix of characters provides for most of the human emotions of anger, love, jealousy and most importantly, the value of thought and intellect.<br/><br/>""Not everyone can be a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."" Quality of the animation is top quality  especially the scene where Remy and the cookbook get wet  one can see and feel the wetness, the droplets of water. And the scenes with the food  looks and feels like real food your tongue drops with the eagerness to taste it. Keeps your taste buds alive.<br/><br/>The creativity is what makes this movie one of the finest  needless to say, I would rate this in my top 50 movies of all time.<br/><br/>Virtual seamlessly integrates with the real that you simply can not believe your eyes that all that you see is just computer generated. Pixar has done it again (after the grand success of ""The Incredibles""), to prove that they are the best  the closing credits are innovative as well. No stone unturned in the innovation category  Ratatouille sweeps it all! It's a food lover's delight, a message that cooking is fun and anyone can be good at it.<br/><br/>Killer lines, great animation, brilliant storyline and music, scenes etching human thoughts (and animal thoughts) and lovely, steaming mouth watering food! What else can you ask for in a movie? What are you waiting for  hurry up, the stew's getting cold! This was a movie which I never wanted to end. And if you felt the same way, it was more like staying hungry after a full, delicious meal for plenty more. Bring it on! Rating: 9/10"
"shhimundercoverdamnit","8","1","2","11 February 2008"," Ratatouille
","Just one heck of an energetic and amusing film. Easily one of the best Pixar creations. No surprise, that it should entertain both the young and old as well.<br/><br/>Just like all great films, Ratatouille is alive, and full of passion. At it's core are messages about friendship, family, compassion and determination.<br/><br/>The film's unlikely heroes are a rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) and a young man named Linguini (Lou Romano). They quickly form an unlikely partnership.<br/><br/>Also, interesting to note is the lack of big name celebrity voices in the cast. How great is it to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen as the critic Anton Ego? Favorite scene is probably the one where Colette is telling Linguini the backstorys of all the chefs, and all of the different stories Horst has. "" I robbed the second largest bank in France using only a ball-point pen."" ""I killed a man... with this thumb."" Anyone moved by the end with Ego being reminded of his childhood? How cool was Skinner? That scene where he's all dressed in a trench coat-all trying to act all mysterious & incognito at the restaurant. "" I'll have what he's having."" Awesome.<br/><br/>Easily one of the better films to have come out this past year."
"khemass","Null","1","2","7 February 2008"," It makes me want to cook!
","I give this film an 8.5 It's a delightful and enjoyable animation film. It's fun to watch. It's harmless and good for children. It's heart-warming. It has imagination and creativity. The idea of a rat who wants to be a cook is quite unique and the scenes where there are thousands of rat cooking in the kitchen is quite something to watch.<br/><br/>However, there's nothing else to it. The story somehow goes on the cliché theme of ""Believe in yourself. You can be different."". Something Hollywood films say again and again and again,sometimes successfully, but most not. (Like in ""Happy Feet"", an animation that didn't impress me).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film manages to inspire me a little. The first half of the story makes me want to cook! That quote ""Anyone can cook"" sounds so good for someone who doesn't really know how to cook, but admire the art of cooking so much, like me. I like the way little Remy enjoys cooking. It makes me feel that eating good food is truly a pleasure on earth and cooking is something fun.<br/><br/>Overall, a good animation that you can enjoy watching and have a good time."

","This wonderful Disney and Pixar animated production written and directed by Brad Bird whose other works include ""The Incredibles"" explores the French restaurant gastronomy. A beautiful and very cute story about the extraordinary French rat, Remy, who is a great fan of the famous French Chef Auguste Gusteau. Remy is truly gifted with cooking. Remy discovers that his adored and TV celebrity chef has passed away but lives on in his imagination guiding him on with his create motto ""Any one can cook!!"". Remy deserts his rat family clan to pursue the culinary arts at Gusteau's restaurant which is now managed by a little evil conniving chef Skinner who thinks he can take over ownership of the famed restaurant and convert the operation into a Frozen food company using Gusteau's recipes.. A clumsy and awkward young man Linguini is seconded by special written reference to commence apprenticeship in the restaurant and Skinner soon discovers that he is the son and heir to Gusteaus restaurant. Remy also discovers that Linguini has a strong but misguided desire to cook and forms a strange partner ship with him not unlike the famous Cyrano De Bergerac story. This partnership is wildly successful and the only female chef Collette in the Kitchen develops an attraction to Linguini whilst trying to teach him the basics of cooking. Remy soon discovers Skinners plans and reveals them to Linguini and Collette and in the process reveals himself to all as the master chef behind the newly and highly successful reemergence of Gustaeus restaurant. Finally the famed and extremely strict gastronome and food critic Anton Ego endorses the miracle recipes and cooking despite the fact that little Remy is the behind it all. In his critique Anton states "" Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere"" alluding to Remy's genius. Proving you don't require "" Larousse's Gastromonique"" recipes to for great home cooking. Brilliant film."

","I was a bit skeptical about this movie. Somehow, I could't figure what was so special about a rat wanting to be a cook.

I was amazed with the quality of the animation.<br/><br/>Many times during the movie I wondered whether it was really animation I was watching. The scenery is so beautifully depicted, that you almost have to believe you're watching real actors interacting with a real city.<br/><br/>But we're all used to the enormous technical quality of Pixar's movies. What's impressive about this one is the quality of the script (It's no surprise it's nominated for an Oscar) and the density of the characters, which combined with the best animation ever, makes this one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>It's funny, intense, emotional and beautiful."

"tenthousandtattoos","7","1","2","31 January 2008"," Anyone can watch this movie!
","Ratatouille begins in rural France, an idyllic little cottage nestled away in peaceful Nowhere. Here, Remy the rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) and his clan lead a relatively trouble-free life, rummaging through an old lady's trash for their dinner and scuttling about in her roof at night. But Remy dreams of more. He has a penchant for food, as opposed to garbage, and idolises a chef he's seen on the TV in Granny's living room, Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and his 5-star restaurant. But Gusteau has died, leaving his business in the hands of uncertainty and a snide little chef named Skinner (brilliant voice work by Ian Holm). Skinner is in the process of selling out Gusteau's to hock microwave food items (Haggis Bites are just one of the ""multicultural"" delights on offer, along with Chopsocky Pocketsoh dear).<br/><br/>Remy's trouble free life is about to be shattered when he is caught rummaging in the old lady's spice rack late one night. Miffed, Grandma decides to approach the problem not with a rat trap, but with a good ol' fashioned shotgun. As she blasts away the roof caves in, revealing Remy's pals, who have to skitter away into the night lest they be blown to bits. Grabbing his favourite recipe book, wannabe-chef Remy busts out too, but gets separated from his clan during Granny's lunatic, shotgun-blasting pursuit.<br/><br/>Lost in the sewers, he decides to poke his head up, and discovers to his delight he's been lost under Paris, across the road from Gusteau's restaurant! Gusteau's has a new garbage boy, Linguini. Unbeknownst to Skinner and the boy is that Linguini is Gusteau's son. Linguini attempts to fix a soup he accidentally ruined by chucking in random stuff, stirring and hoping for the best. Enter Remy, who has watched in horror the whole time while Linguini ""cooked"". Remy quickly fixes the soup. Linguini sees him, but is too late to stop the soup going out..to a food critic! To everyone's surprise, it's great. Skinner gives an ultimatum, if Linguini can recreate the soup, he won't be fired for cooking without permission. But Remy is discovered, and Linguini is tasked with getting rid of the rodent, away from the restaurant. Near the canal, Linguini discovers Remy can understand him, and communicate back, so spares his life with the caveat that he help Linguini recreate the soup so he wont be fired. Soon enough they discover Remy can control Linguini like a puppet by pulling his hair (""whoahthat's strangely involuntary!"") and the fun keeps rolling from there, but I won't spoil any more.<br/><br/>Ratatouille succeeds in never being preachy, it's message is simple and is never rammed home, like the message of Disney/Pixar predecessor Meet the Robinsons (I walked out of that one quietly muttering to myself like a mental patient'keep moooooooving forwardkeep mooooooving forward.'), and it's a good one: ""Anyone can cook."" Meaning of course, anyone can do anything they dream of doing, you just gotta get in there and give it a go! The atmosphere is magicParis is shown as a glittering jewel against a still night, and the film is imbued with very soft browns and greens, a touch of red, very ambient and beautiful. The hectic kitchen scenes are brilliant, and capture perfectly the organised chaos of a busy restaurant kitchen. The story cracks along at a pace that will keep the kids enthralled while remaining interesting enough to an adult audience to watch over and over.<br/><br/>The animation is sublime, in some places it looks real. Animators in this field keep outdoing each other. Let's hope that good stories like Ratatouille continue to be the motivation, not just the need to impress and dazzle. Impress and dazzle Ratatouille does, with a great little story as well."

","I have watched all Disney/Pixar films since Toy Story and I own most of them. They each have their own unique style, color and flavor. this is just the latest in a truly outstanding line of great and destined to be instant Classic films for generations to come.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give it a full 10 stars is because some of the dialog fell short at times and was a little cheesy (no pun intended), though I'm sure that was intentional by the creators of the film. I rented this title from Netflix and enjoyed every minute of it.<br/><br/>I especially like the part were Remy and Linguini don't interact directly as through human speech, (as in most animated movies). They develop the hair pulling technique as if linguine was remy's puppet, and when Remy or the other rats are communicating with other humans, they are using hand signals or body language not conventional human speech. The movie producers don't humanize the rats too much, they keep the two species as separate as possible, but still develop a separate world for each.<br/><br/>In all I think this was a magnificent film that could be enjoyed by most ages. It has some mild adult humor, language and situations in it but nothing you don't see in the news these days. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to enjoy an excellent Disney movie."

It opens the eyes and senses that we lost somewhere while eating and enjoying only the full stomach part of dining. Dining is not only about filling that tank, but the smell, the taste and the style. This was delivered by Pixar's ""Rat"": Remy.

The slight jealousy between Linguini and his girl-friend when Linguini exceeds in cooking between the two even though she was her mentor, jealousy between Remy and Linguini when Linguini conceals the secret to his success, Remy torn up between Linguini and his family and many other emotions are shown so beautifully that people would forget that we are watching animated characters and rats.<br/><br/>Everyone is great is the voice casting. I did not even care that much about the French accent that should've been shown as it was a great film. There is some adult humor in the film too and I was happy that they had it, breaking the Disney line of not including anything bad in the movie, which too is good but a few adult jokes can be included so that even adults get their share of laughter.<br/><br/>All the characters are lovable. This is because of the magnificent animation and the detail in the character sketching. Some of the scenes were memorable, like the gun scene, the grand finale and when Remy tries to modify the soup after dodging a number of obstacles.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a must watch for all. 9 out of 10. A great Pixar movie with a great message- 'Anyone can cook'."

It was constantly funny, exciting and visually fascinating that for me is unusual from a Walt Disney movie. Don't get me wrong, I love Walt films, but at times they get boring. This one will make you comfortable in your seat, you will not get a minute wasted. It also conveys a message that everyone has some kind of secret but eventually honesty means the solution.I am 99% sure, it will get the Best Animation Feature of the Year Oscar!If not so, there will be a huge mistake made."

The Be-An-Artisan-Not-A-Corporation message is a bit of a head scratcher in corporate context, but maybe makes sense in a Wizard of Oz, leave-us-alone way. That Creole boss guy needs some better mayhem, Anton Ego seems to be Disney's attempt to neuter Tim Burton in absentia, and I'm sorry but Linguini is a drip. Complain, complain, complain.

","Even though I have seen all of the Pixar movies since I was first a small child when ""Toy Story"" first came out, at the age 16, almost 17 pretty soon, I still have the love for their incredible animation and especially for the movie ""Ratatouille."" It's an adventure and comedy about a rat who finds out that his favorite cooking idol is dead, and eventually lands in Paris to find ""Gusteau's"" restaurant being ran by a rather ""short-supplied"" man named Skinner. His dream is to become the greatest chef in all of Paris, and does so with a young man he befriends named Linguini. Linguini of course doesn't know how to cook, but yet Remy does, but the truth is that anyone can cook; you just have to believe it. Linguini gets support from a woman named Colette who works in the restaurant, and eventually they gain a relationship between each other. However, since Remy and his dad think differently, he decides to be himself and move on. The animation in the movie has some points in it where it seems so much alive in it, and the movie is so good, it makes you wanna even watch it again for the pleasure. And if you say you can't cook, well watch this movie; it has the wisdom of a chef right before you on the screen."

","I've watched this film now 2-3 times and each time I like to watch the every day struggle of a rat and its' family.<br/><br/>Like all cartoon movies, this is no different. A hero, a family struggling in the every day world of humans vs Animals, a greedy boss who wants to have everything for himself.<br/><br/>But to have a rat controlling the main character is a little bit OTT despite it being a cartoon. The film makers could have put a bit more thought in to this part of the movie. The film over all is great to watch, great for younger children and a great movie for people of all ages.<br/><br/>As in most modern day movies, the guy turns out to be a bit of a geek making his way through the world of greed and every day changes, he realises there's a girl he wants and in the end gets.

Although the human, Linguini, is pitiful because he doesn't have a job, girlfriend or even a decent apartment.<br/><br/>Disney pulled it off and created the most appealing partners since Woody and Buzz.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't only have a very nice story.

","Pixar & Disney animation studios bring us absolutely shimmering movie magic to melt both hearts, minds and souls: Remy the Rat, who just happens to be a genius cook, stumbles into hapless kitchen-hand youngster Linguinis' life in Paris and turns him into a master chef himself, with more surprises in store...<br/><br/>SO clearly made with love for the world of cooking & cuisine, and if one is into that (like myself), it provides that extra dimension to elevate this into that masterpiece-status as this one is! Besides a good and as complex story as this kind of fares can handle, providing to its brilliance are all the carefully picked details such as setting (Ah, Parri'! Aristocats surely knew how to set an atmosphere for success!) and great side characters that don't necessarily steal the show. <br/><br/>As an adult, I would be more curious about the relationship of Linguini & Colette, but this IS a family fare, so my grunts are as good as none. Timelessly funny and endearing, the classic scenes add up- but the climactic serving to Anton Ego, the food critic, is THE one to never forget!

"aharmas","10","1","2","12 November 2007"," True Inspiration: A Magical Treat
","Who would have believed a rat could be so charming? When the studios try so hard to put together a hero, they seem to ignore that it's the actions and the heart of the character that they have to work on, not the exterior. I shudder when I think of those animated creations that animators have developed and passed as ""cute and interesting"". The hero in ""Ratatouille"" has been altered to make it likable, but he still looks like what it really is, and there is a moment, to the credit of the filmmakers when they acknowledge that the ""hero"" is still a rat, and that having too many of its relatives in a food establishment will have serious consequences.<br/><br/>Still what lives at the heart of this movie, is the story of the underachiever who finds his way into a world that might not be very welcoming. The star of the movie is the food that must be prepared and used for different situations to move the plot forward; the rest is some very effective support by a clever screenplay that treats us and its character with respect and that shows much love for the fine things in life. It is a joy to see how someone appreciates the ecstatic enjoyment of gourmet food, the pleasures of preparing it, and the satisfaction of doing a good job. Is the clear presentation of opposite sides of nature: the mediocre and the sublime, and the unexpected approaches that provide us with much delight.<br/><br/>The film is gorgeous to look, and it sings loud and clear, from beginning to end, as it shows the quest of its two main characters to prove themselves in a very hostile environment. It has its heart in the right place, and it shows how wonderful life can be no matter who you are and where you happen to be."
"Benjamin_Cox","7","1","2","4 November 2007"," Still tastes good but Pixar forgot to add the final ingredients - 75%
","As much as I love Pixar films (and believe me, I do), there is a nagging sense that nothing will top Brad Bird's superhero masterpiece ""The Incredibles"". ""Cars"" gave it a good run for its money but I felt that it just wasn't as colourful, entertaining or fun as the adventures of Clan Incredible. Having said that, ""Cars"" was a lot better than I was expecting despite having what I thought might have been a dodgy premise. Sadly, their latest effort reverses that trend - maybe I was expecting too much or maybe the premise was too bizarre to pull off but I just felt that there was something missing from this recipe.<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" (pronounced 'rat-a-too-ee') introduces us to Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat with highly developed senses of smell and taste as well as a fascination for humans and the art of cooking. After a disaster which separates him from his family, Remy finds himself in Paris and at the doorstep to the famous French chef he idolises, Gusteau (Brad Garrett). But things aren't going well at Gusteau's restaurant - after a viciously cruel review by critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the great chef has passed away and the restaurant staff are now bullied by fiery midget head chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Striking up an unusual partnership with the restaurant's garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano), Remy takes it upon himself to turn the fortunes of Gusteau around.<br/><br/>It's not worth me talking about how beautiful this film looks - each Pixar picture gets better and better in terms of visual splendour and ""Ratatouille"" is probably the best yet. In fact, the sheer processing power required for the chaotic final reel alone is enough to give me a migraine thinking about it! Paris at night shimmers with a wonderful glow and everything looks and feels as it should, as you'd expect. You'd also expect a top-notch vocal performance and indeed, ""Ratatouille"" doesn't disappoint either. Holm is superb, almost unrecognisable as the main obstacle to Remy and Linguini's success. Even John Ratzenburger's obligatory appearance is well disguised - I had to look it up on IMDb to see who he played! It's also funny although not as funny as ""Cars"" or as much fun as you-know-what. And this is where I feel things start to unravel. ""Ratatouille"" has a highly unusual premise which I felt worked against it - it's just too weird for it to be credible enough to enjoy. The pace is a little slow in the middle and it is too long so younger children may find their attention drifting before the frenetic buzz of action before the end.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this film, nor that it is a bad movie. It's fantastic - a country mile better than almost any other non-Pixar animation you could think of, if you haven't already forgotten about the likes of ""Open Season"" or ""Barnyard"". It's just that I didn't enjoy ""Ratatouille"" as much as I thought I was going to. Maybe my expectations were impossibly high but for me, this film isn't as good as ""The Incredibles"". It is better than ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Finding Nemo"" but overall, I thought that they might have taken the foot off the gas a bit. I do hope Pixar aren't running out of ideas because they keep me entertained for endless hours. But dare I say it, are Pixar starting to rest of their laurels? A brilliant family film but not the strongest effort from the masters of modern animation."

","Another great animation from Pixar Studios, Ratatouille is a movie that is best served warm(pardon the pun). It essentially follows the journey of Remy the rat(Patton Oswalt) who leaves the colony by accidental means and ends up in Paris.He is caught snooping around in the recently deceased Gusteau's restaurant by a garbage boy by the name of Alfredo Linguini(Lou Romano) who is later revealed to be the son of Auguste Gusteau(Brad Garrett). But in my view one of the more interesting characters is the mean food critic Anton Ego(played brilliantly by screen legend Peter O'Toole) as he is the main villain in a way and as his performance was sort of a dramatic one, I think he should get an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. This film should also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as the aforementioned Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Peter O'Toole. A great movie with a great taste.Bravo!"
"EijnarAmadeus","10","1","2","11 October 2007"," Top Three Pixar
","Pixar is one of the most successful film-creators in recent history, and rightfully so, the re-defined the family-genre with TOY STORY, not just adding enormous depth to story and characters but also showcasing stunning animations. And TOY STORY wasn't a one-hit-wonder, it was followed by several successful outings; tell me one family who hasn't seen MONSTERS INC., CARS or FINDING NEMO and I will send them a DVD right away. And Pixar took their universe a step further with THE INCREDIBLES, an amazing character-study of superheroes left behind, trying to behave like regular people. Now, in 2007 Pixar does it again; RATATOUILLE is arguably their finest movie so far. Right from the outset and throughout it's entire runtime it was a warm and powerful feeling that kept me wanting more and more of this tale about a rat-going-cook in Paris. As in any Pixar movie, there are many supporting characters which helps making it fresh and always fascinating. And as in any child-friendly movie, there are moral and life lessons, and although they have behaved a bit cheesy from time to time, they serve well. RATATOUILLE portrays Paris in the most romantic and dearly beloved way imaginable in a animation-movie, and were better to put a story than in a classy restaurant? And one should not forget the impressive main characters here; the Rat Remy and the garbage-boy-turning-cook Linguini, both being Pixar at their peak capturing character-studies. Remy delivers serious speeches about his urge of getting out of the rat-life, like a human being he wants to create something new, and not eat the left-overs from something left behind. As he arrives Paris to discover his dreams, he realizes that his big idol, cook Gusteau, is dead. But Gusteau has already entered his mind, and Remy slowly evolves from being just a rat to becoming something quite extraordinary. Linguini is quite possibly the most likable character Pixar has created yet, a troubled but behaved, ambitious but not talented boy who lives in a small apartment, bicycles his way to work and blushes more than he blossoms, he isn't just the perfect sidekick to Remy with his funny behavior, but his romance with companion cook Colette is so sweet! RATATOUVILLE couldn't have been any better, this is truly as good as family-entertainment gets."

The sheer joy and excitement and attention to details and humor and seriousness and deep philosophical insight and revelations mixed together in a wonderful soup or ratatouille or whatever dish you may think of made this movie I dare say Pixar's finest masterpiece to date. <br/><br/>And here I thought The Incredibles would be on top for many many years to come. Well, if it's not beaten, then it surely has been beaten aside on the top of the prize-pedestal. Like Steve Jobs is doing with the iPod's and the computer, music and movie industries, so is Lasseter, Bird and Catmull doing with animated movies in a tour-de-force that will surely be remembered in the history books as a Renaissance in movie-making. <br/><br/>Isn't it wonderful sometimes to be reminded how great it is to live in times like these?"

"powerfull_jedi","8","1","2","18 September 2007"," It's a great movie however...
","Make no mistake, it's a great movie, the CGI is top notch, the humor is great, the storyline is a tad cliché, but it has some surprising plot twists, yet something feels wrong. It's an unconventional story about a rat(Remy) who wants to be a great chef, however, he's just a rat and that raises some problems. After causing his colony to flee from an old cottage, he finds himself alone and stumbles upon his favorite chef's restaurant as he decides to mingle with a soup that was being bluntly prepared by a new hire named Linguini, Remy gets spotted by the kid, who gets the horrible task of disposing of the vermin, only to find out a critic tasted the soup and liked it. So Remy and Linguini team up to help each other out. It's a rather curious choice, in a world where women carry pepper spray if guys get a little too close, yet a food critique enjoys a meal prepared by a critter that feeds off of garbage without worrying he might get sick from food poisoning. Normally when you see rats going around, it's not a good sign, but yeah, it's movie, so I'll let that slide. The humor is great, physical humor works wonders in this picture and Linguni's own awkward and goofy temper provides some of the best laughs in the entire movie. Most of the other character are somewhat forgettable, apart from Collete who's sorta makes her the de facto girlfriend and the one who Remy and Linguini can count on when everything goes to heck(even though the two have different views on the matter). Sorry if I sound a little cranky while writing this, I left with the impression kids under 10 year olds should be banned from theaters, which kinda clouds my better judgment. Anyway, Pixar will enjoy it nevertheless and for the rest, remember, sometimes it's better not to see how food is made."
"madonnawb","7","1","2","18 September 2007"," Rats are cool... just keep them out of my kitchen
","I saw this movie over the weekend and well, apart from the weird notion that rats anywhere (let alone in the kitchen) are OK, the Ratatouille was a fun and well produced movie. Made by Pixar, the expectations in lines of animation were given - and it was delivered, but I was also interested in the storyline and weather it would have that whole family satisfaction experience, and like I said kids enjoyed it and so had I.<br/><br/>It is a story of a rat called Remy, who with a very peculiar sense of smell and takes up interest in cuisine. However, his family (a traveling pack of garbage scavengers) doesn't agree with his new liking of humans and cooking. As luck would have it, after one accident the family is separated and poor Remy is left alone with his only and favorite possession- a cookbook of a celebrated (and also deceased) chef Gusteau, who as a figment of Remy's imagination gives him all kinds of guidance and direction. At any rate, one day he finds himself at chef's Guesto's old restaurant which is now run by a seeming su-chef and an interesting kitchen staff and decides to live there and observe how food is made. This is how he befriends Linguini, a new kid that doesn't get any respect, but whose past will soon be revealed as very important in relation to Chef Guesteau. Together, Linguini and Remy take on the cuisine critics to prove that it doesn't matter who you are and where you come from, but if you love what you do and you have a talent- you should go for it! Apart from the inspirational message, I guess it can also make kids more interested in helping moms cook- or have rats as pets.<br/><br/>That said, I wonder whether they could have had a field mouse or any other more pleasant rodent be the main character, since let's face it, no matter how cute they look animated, I doubt this movie will suddenly make me or general folk enjoy rats presence in the kitchen or a back alley. Other than that, great family movie."

"happiscotsman","9","1","2","28 August 2007"," If I don't like it, then I won't watch it again
","I identify with the passion of one of this film's characters who declares to be ""hungry for more"" after having seen this work by Brad Bird. I absolutely loved ""The Incredibles"", and yet figured that Brad Bird would stick to his schedule of only making a movie every few years or so. I certainly wasn't sure that he'd team up again with Pixar. And then I saw that he had chosen this project. I was a little trepidant approaching this movie's opening. Could lightning strike twice or was Bird doomed to wander into a wasteland of storytelling like M. Night Shyamalan? I am now confident that Brad Bird will not dwindle away his talent. This movie was as richly fulfilling as the feasts it displays and I'll try to stop with the food metaphors from here on. I had thought the story was going to be about urban rat adventures in the same way as ""Flushed Away"", ""The Great Mouse Detective"", or ""The Secret of NIMH"". But then I saw the teaser which informed that instead it would focus on the delight of making and eating fine cuisine. With rats? Yes, with rats. It encouraged me that are others out there who know that real reason haute cuisine is so snobbish is because it has the wealth of flavors that you won't get from The Olive Garden or McDonald's. I watched with shear joy as food was woven into the plot and displayed with such magnificence. My mother who was an art major in college said that this was the finest animation she had ever seen, and this from a woman who has watched ""Toy Story"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", and ""Wallace and Gromit"". All you have to see is the breathtaking vistas of Paris and you also will want to shout Bravo! Finally, what I've started noticing and liking about Pixar versus the sequel maniacs at Dreamworks is their ability to cast characters. ""The Incredibles"" could've had bigger names than Craig T. Nelson or Elizabeth Pena, but they would not have matched character as flawlessly. That continues here as you will not immediately recognize most of the cast (Lou Romano?), but you will agree that no else could've matched so perfectly. Another skill I attribute to Brad Bird. I now eagerly await ""1906"", confident that it will be one more feather in the cap of someone who is making a claim as the greatest animated filmmaker ever."

","Almost each new product Pixar released made me think ""It can't get any better!"" But than comes Ratatouille... What was presented by Brad Bird is truly phenomenal!

Without any doubt Ratatouille has forged a new path and has established the new standard in animation. This movie will be definitely enjoyed by both kids and adults and even those who normally don't like animation. Never before have animated characters been so adorable, Remy and his fellow rats are just the definition of cuteness.

","If anyone knows who Jim Hill is, suffice to say that he is a crummy reviewer who would like nothing more than to see Pixar and Brad Bird go down with the slowly sinking Disney ship. He thought, if Ratatoulle (the first Pixar film since the Disney-Pixar merger) did horribly in the box office (or at least as poorly as A Bug's Life), Disney would stop ""overpaying"" the Pixar department and ""taking so much stock in ""their"" opinions."" Because of Pixar, Disney canceled the majority of their direct to DVD projects (thank God), in case you didn't know.<br/><br/>But Mr. Hill was dead wrong. Ratatoulle has become a big hit, one of the highest grossing films this summer. It stayed #1 in the box office 4 weeks in a row, and has been getting rave reviews from almost every professional in the business. And I will tell you why.<br/><br/>Pixar uses likable characters (including villains you love to hate), great story development (I most certainly didn't see the health inspector being tied up and thrown in the closet coming), and incredible animation techniques (did you see the light reflect off those pots and pans?) to make Ratatoulle an enjoyable movie for all ages (my father, for the first time I can remember, admitted to liking an animated movie and even called it ""funny"" instead of ""cute."") It avoids clichés brilliantly (I was expecting Gusteau's to stay open) and creates a good moral (presistance will help you achieve your goals/never give up) without shoving it down your throat.<br/><br/>This movie is an instant classic.

","The film comes with a theme that endeavour goes a long way. It calls for the core ability and latent values for both people and arts, instead of peoples' outlook or their past. Quality output can arise from simple and inexpensive materials in the presence of innovation and diligence. The story brings two apparently incompatible subjects together: rat and fine dining. It is rhetorically weak subject wise but propitiating both story wise and theme wise, coming with a classical narrative flow of Hollywood flicks. The epilogue brings an enlightening remark for commentators of any kind. The Cantonese version of voice-acting (Hong Kong) is excellent. Some graphics and dialogues are locally adapted with vividness enhanced. The flick is no less a film for adults as well and a good one with depth indeed."

Even though my expectations were high, I was totally blown away by what was served up on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Although it's an animated movie, this is NOT a movie made for or directed at kids, although there's enough slapstick and action that kids will enjoy this. It is an extremely well-made movie, with amazing sets, characters, and story, that can stack up against any live-action movie out there.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is amazing. From the peeling paint on the shutters of a French cottage, to the cityscape of Paris, to the innards of a French kitchen, the world feels real. And, many of the scenes, which are shot from a rat's-eye point of view, are both frenetic and fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>This movie was perfectly cast. Peter O'Toole as a pompous food critic is especially delightful to watch, although it took me until the end of the movie to figure out who was voicing that character. And Linguini, one of the main protagonists, is as tall and thin as his noodle's namesake, a picture of teenage awkwardness.<br/><br/>The story is a classic coming-of-age story. Well, sort of. Here, a young adult must find his place in the world, and leave the nest--literally. The main twist, of course, is he's a rat, but there are other surprises in this story which keep the story as fresh as a just-picked sprig of Rosemary.<br/><br/>Brad Bird, I salute you for continuing to elevate the genre of animation to an art form that's on par with any movie out there.

Even so, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see Bird's writing and directing easily transcend this potentially contrived plot and make a funny and heartfelt movie in almost every aspect. The message it carries is positive and poetic and the film is forgiven its occasional slapstick comedy moments or predictability to (hopefully) make it slightly more appealing to the younger audience and thus more marketable.<br/><br/>The initial introduction and characterization had me entertained, but slightly worried, but once the film got rolling, I was pretty much enthralled throughout: out-loud laughing, smiling or fighting a tear. A feel good movie and a good story. Don't expect Shrek's flatulence or average talking-animal humour. Expect more of the witty humour from The Incredibles, minus the action, plus a bit more depth in dialogue and human soul-searching. Disney's magic? Well, this film has the intangible that makes it all work together."

","Patton Oswalt--whose appearance on the Jay Leno Show makes me think of him as a straight Nathan Lane--is perfectly cast as the voice of Remy. A rat who feels he is born to cook food, rather than steal it from human garbage cans. Of course, the only thing standing in his way is that old human stigma about rats being diseased vermin.<br/><br/>Enter young Linguini, who later turns out to be the son of Remy's idol; the late, great master chef Auguste Gusteau (voiced brilliantly by Brad Garrett). Linguini wants to cook in the worst way...and that's initially how he does it! That is; until Remy learns how to control Linguini's actions by pulling on the latter's hair.<br/><br/>Between the two of them, they manage to put Gusteau's Restaurant back on the five-star map. Despite the worst actions of the jealous Monsieur Skinner, who's been using Gusteau's name and likeness to sell the most horrible kinds of frozen food!<br/><br/>Along the way, Remy reconciles with his traditionalist dad (voiced by the great veteran character actor Brian Dennehy). And, Linguini not only wins the heart of the lovely assistant chef Collette. He also impresses the aptly-named food critic, Anton Ego (voiced by the legendary--and lovably eccentric--Peter O'Toole).<br/><br/>In short, this is more than an old-fashioned love story. It's also a charming fable about not letting others dissuade you from what you really want to do with the rest of your life. Not if you're truly serious about it, to begin with. And, I will be slightly disappointed if this doesn't become the sleeper family hit of the summer.<br/><br/>P.S.---I can't help wondering if those New York City McDonald's rats got started this way?"

","Ratatouille is, in a word, brilliant. Just about everything in this movie is flawless. You would think that with so many great Pixar films, it can't get much better, but this movie proves it can. The animation is borderline unbelievable, literally. It was dazzling. The attention to detail is astounding. The voice acting shows nothing but great talent. The concept is clever and humorous. The entertainment level is high. The script is witty.<br/><br/>This may very well be the best animated film ever. Brad Bird is some sort of genius. If this doesn't win best animated feature at the Academy Awards, which at this point seems insane, it will make me very angry.<br/><br/>I feel this film can be enjoyed by just about anyone.

","Pixar, once again, does a fantastic job of transporting us into its world... this world? Culinary Paris... from a Rat's perspective.<br/><br/>The animation is terrific, but more than that, the music, setting, scenery, characters and humor all fit together so well into this storyline.<br/><br/>The story would most likely be enjoyed most by adults, simply because haute cuisine, Paris culture, and upperclass culinary arts, are not typical areas of interest for grilled cheese eating toddlers and tykes.<br/><br/>Negative - a lot of slapping, irresponsibility with guns, and wine (although that is accurate for the setting). This didn't offend me, but may bother some with kids.<br/><br/>Positive - it was purely entertaining and well crafted. Also, they did not get into the world of crude/rude jokes (Shrek style), but told a wonderful story about friendship, loyalty, trust, hard work, perseverance, not taking credit for someone else's work, and honesty.<br/><br/>The characters - Collette is a dynamic woman, someone you might now. The friendship between Linguini and Remy is beautiful and touching. Skinner is diabolical. The culinary critic seems to be straight out of the Adam's Family. Nearly all characters are eccentric... but all weave into the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall - well done!"
"CombatWombatt","10","1","2","7 July 2007"," A progression for cgi animated movies
","Ratatouille - Alright, this movie really surprised me, but I also wasn't too surprised that it did with legendary Brad Bird behind the movie. First of all I'd like to congratulate this movie and Brad Bird for trying to break the mold of animation and the preconceived notion that it's only for kids. This movie has an adult vibe to it; little kids probably won't know whats going on half the time and won't understand half of the words. And I love it because of that. If you liked The Incredibles you will probably like the way this movie was done.<br/><br/>Second of all, the story and character development are outstanding. I haven't really seen characters (such as Remy and Linguini) progress and develop so much within a movie. Their character changes after all of the events and its great -- very realistic.<br/><br/>You know the endless flood of terrible GCI movies coming out lately that never seem to get any better? Ratatouille isn't one of them. Almost no pop-culture references are to be found, which is very refreshing with all of the Dreamworks crap coming out lately (Shark Tale anyone?). I hate it how movies these days try to cash in on the latest Hollywood gossip and pop-culture and every CGI movie coming out never trays far from the Shrek-ified mold. Like Richard Roeper said, Ratatouille is actually going to be timeless because of this.<br/><br/>This movie had comedy and great storyboard work galore. It wasn't over-the-top funny like Transformers, but it was more of a controlled and fitting type of humor -- it didn't distract from the story too much and it made sense. The scenes were well presented and the camera following the rat through all those little pathways was amazing. It may not have had very much noise and action, but it was definitely a finely crafted delicacy (pardon the pun) of a movie."
"Bosco-HK","10","1","2","5 July 2007"," On the contrary...
","On the contrary to most parents' adage, ""Don't be picky, always try new things."" This adage has been given it's initial part a twist of fate. And I, too, have always believed that being picky is not a bad thing. I have to admit that I am one myself, just like Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole voice), ""If I don't like it, I don't..."", unfortunately, I'm way beyond his last two words, I don't even try it. This is a wrong thing to do, I will never know what is good or not.<br/><br/>Anyways, in regards to this film. I think it builds foundation for those who are picky and especially to those that are forced at home to eat something they don't like. But of course, you cannot say you do not want to eat your vegetables. However, there are some bitter tasting ones, and those are the ones you may have a chance to push yourself out of the seat.<br/><br/>At the scene where Remy decided to cook a peasant dish to a renown critic, it really reminded me a couple of Chinese cooking movies too, one of which that I clearly remember is Sik San (1996) starring Stephen Chow. There are choices that one can make to deter the simplest dish and turn it into a masterpiece that can ""drive you into an apple's core"", just like the tasting of new food when Remy first tasted the better lifestyle of Paris, or when Remy tries to teach his brother (i forgot his name) about not eating anymore garbage when you are in a country of high quality life and the flashback technique in the movie, and also in the movie I mentioned.<br/><br/>Beside the fact about taste and cooking, Remy was the cause of a romantic trigger between Linguini (Lou Romano) and Colette (Janeane Garofalo), and Remy's father's change of beliefs of rats and understanding humans differently.<br/><br/>One last note, the introduction of the movie was strange but it is an attention grabber and to introduce how easy can a human be manipulated by aliens or other life forms. I thought that the kid on the 1000 controls panel was really cute! He points: ""This one? No, this one. Hm.. That one? This one...?"" And so on.. with his eyes he's like asking the teacher in the classroom like a student who is trying to ask for help on a test given to him. Obviously, a test is where you do not ask any questions at all.<br/><br/>I recommend this wonderful film about cooking to all families around the world. It is a good thing to know that one day, one of your family members, who is very picky, may end up as a talented official or unofficial cook, just like Remy (Patton Oswalt voice). Everyone has their own favorites, likes and dislikes. And one day, being picky will probably save the day, just like Remy, who knew that some food in the garbage have been rat-poisoned."

","Ratatouille is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It isn't the best. But it is without a doubt, one of the best. It involves Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who strives to become a cook, like his role model Gusteau (Brad Garrett), the magnificent chef. His immortal words were, 'anyone can cook.' I say were, because after a scathing review by the feared and infamous food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the great Gusteau died of what seemed to be a broken heart, and his magnificent restaurant lost two stars, giving him three out of five. Although his family tries to knock it out of him, he continues to try to become a cook. Then he is separated from them and finds himself alone in Paris, at the restaurant that Gusteau owned before he died. So he embarks on a journey to become a cook, using a meek orphan by the name of Linguini (Lou Romano)to do the deed, meeting many characters and learning many things along the way.<br/><br/>Who could've thought up an idea like that? A rat who wants to be a cook. The capacity to imagine ideas like this is incredible.<br/><br/>The story moves along well, its plot is very well done.<br/><br/>The animation is top-notch, the best I've seen yet. The lights of Paris, the darkness of Paris, stunning visuals. The animation is also perfectly in tune with the actor's voices as well. These animated mannikins seem like real breathing human beings (and rats.) The voicing is perfect, absolutely on the mark, with special kudos to Peter O'Toole and Ian Holm, the latter of whom voiced the vertically challenged Skinner, who claimed control of the Gusteau restaurant after Gusteau's death. Absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is the man for the job. After doing The Iron Giant, and the Incredibles, I knew that he was a master when it came to bringing animation to life. A magnificent job.<br/><br/>A definite winner. I don't know about it being in the top 250, but hey, this movie is good, so I'm not complaining."

","Though I have thoroughly enjoyed every Disney/Pixar film released in past years, some titles stand out more than others in my mind. ""The Incredibles,"" for instance is my personal favorite. Still, last summer, when I saw ""Cars"" I was not enormously ""wowed"" by it. I felt that Disney/Pixar might have been going downhill, and the preview for this film was no thrill. However, I am pleased to say that ""Ratatouille"" has brought it back.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessors, ""Ratatouille"" does not boast big actors for its voices. Still, I found that this took away nothing from the experience. Instead of puzzling over whose voice each character had, I could sit and simply enjoy the film, which is absolutely terrific. The plot centers around Remy, an adorable rat with extreme culinary talent, who is separated from his family and winds up in Paris, at his idol's restaurant, ""Le Restaurant de Chef Gusteau."" He joins up with Linguini, a garbage boy with no talent in cooking. The two form a secret partnership in which Linguini provides a home and food for Remy, while Remy controls Linguini in the kitchen of the restaurant, cooking up a storm. The result of this madness? It's hilarious and I won't even attempt to describe it.<br/><br/>The characters in the story are surprisingly multi-dimensional. Some of my favorites were Colette- a feisty and talented feminist cook, the scheming and treacherous new chef of the restaurant, and others.<br/><br/>It's fantastic, and though not the best of the films in its category, it is priceless for all ages. See it!"

","I don't care if it looks good, this film patronising rubbish. Rat likes food, rat controls boy by twiddling with his hair to cook food, critic likes food and embraces the concept of rats in the kitchen! I'm sorry but is this the best story we can come with? Kudos to Pixar, they are masters of animation but when the story is as banal as this they may as well go back to crayons.<br/><br/>Spiritless, without heart, virtually no progression of narrative. Humour is severely lacking. Peril is minimal. As a result this story (and lets face it, story is quintessential) plods along going nowhere fast. Trading on marketing seems to be where animation films have been for a long time now. It seems to me that we're being presented with inane tale after inane tale. If only the children of today knew what they were missing. I don't care how nice the back drop looks, when the plot is as offensive as this it's obsolete."
"LemonyShepard","7","2","7","11 July 2007"," Fun, but for who?
","Can Pixar fail? I think even if those geniuses tried, they would still end up making an Oscar winning film. Which brings me to Ratatouille. It's everything you would expect from a Pixar movie: a loving cast of characters, a cute little story that teaches an important lesson, and the infamous CGI that has made Pixar the most popular computer-animated company in the world.<br/><br/>The story tells of a rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who longs to become a chef. However, there are two problems with that dream. First, he lives with a family of rats who enjoy nothing more than eating garbage, while Remy prefers more lavish cuisine. Second, a rat in any kitchen means trouble to the humans.<br/><br/>Remy's dream seems impossible until he gets washed away in a sewer (a very Flushed Away moment) and resurfaces in his favorite restaurant, Gusteau's, in Paris, France! There, the storyline splits into two as we follow the tale of a clumsy misfit named Linguini (Lou Romano), a kitchen boy who works at the restaurant. A twist of fate brings the rat and the boy together, and they create a system: Remy cooks while Linguini acts as his cover.<br/><br/>The story is where Ratatouille cuts somewhat short. It's more realistic than Cars (a world of talking cars? I never got it either) but it's still way too far fetched for adults. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor is above little kids' heads. So who was Brad Bird's target audience for this movie? I don't think even he knew.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the story may not fit for many audience members, I enjoyed every second of this movie. What it lacks in humor it makes up in heart, warmth, and amazing animation. Definitely not one to miss."

","Ratitouille, while enjoyable, diverted a bit from the formulas used in the other more-enjoyable Pixar movies. All of the other Pixar films took the audience to a different world other than the human world (i.e. world of toys, bugs, monsters, sea creatures, etc.). However, in ""Ratatouille"" the rats interact directly with the humans, something not previously seen in the other Pixars. This lacking element of separate worlds between the humans and the focus characters makes it less enjoyable and less connected to the other Pixar movies.<br/><br/>With that said, ""Ratatouille"" is a fun, clean show that families should go see together. The funny dialog blends in well with the story, and is well-made by ""Iron Giant"" and ""Incredibles"" director Brad Bird. <br/><br/>In the film, the main rat longs for a life better than the life of a standard rat. He's able to achieve this goal by interacting with a guy desperate for a job- and not truly a good cook- but acts that way with the help of the rat.

Other than that, the movie is a fun romp through a kitchen and a story of how, no matter how little you are, great things can be accomplished when you work together. Also reminds us not to judge others by what we think they can accomplish, but rather to give them time to really amaze us. The movie is fun because of getting to watch all these little creatures get to work together. I also liked the Critic who tries so very hard to be mean about everything and be snobby to everyone about any food created. This unhappy little man get his...shall we say...comeuppance.

Besides the awesome setpiece of Remy, the gourmand rat, entering Gusteau's kitchen for the first time and the wonderful climax, there is little that is memorable. The characters are also pretty generic, except for food critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole, and Colette, voiced by an unrecognizable Jeneane Gorofolo. Remy is dull, as are a lot of cartoon heroes (they're hardly ever the most memorable characters), and the other rats don't have enough screen time to make an impression. The villainous chef is a dull bad guy, and Luigi, the human who is helped by Remy, is never redeemed by the script. Even in the end, that character has taken advantage of Remy. He admits that to the other characters, but doesn't do much to make up for it. I would actually have ranked Disney's CGI film, Meet the Robinsons, above this, but the climax is so wonderful, and the aftermath so beautiful, that I ultimately felt very pleased, despite only being moderately so for the other 90 minutes."

Audiences get bored if all you show us is the same ol' same ol'. And this is where RATATOUILLE runs into trouble.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Brad Bird (who also did The Incredibles and THE IRON GIANT), Mr. Bird has fallen into a small rut; one that I hope he doesn't remain in. Yes, the animation was great. Yes, the voices were wonderful. Yes, the story was cute and funny. But there was nothing new. We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.<br/><br/>Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods  and not garbage  gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt, RENO 911!: Miami) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett, MUSIC AND LYRICS), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano, CARS). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster (ROAD WARRIOR reference) of Gusteau's restaurant.<br/><br/>Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole, CASANOVA).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.<br/><br/>But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 6 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.<br/><br/>Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory. And let's hope that the two can talk about the necessity for rats to NOT be in restaurants."

Sure, the movie had it's darker moments, but nothing to compare to say, Sid's house in Toy Story or Boo's capture in Monsters Inc. It actually felt more like a Dreamworks film (animals doing human activities while making a funny face), which isn't a bad thing, just not something I would expect from Pixar. There was also an almost independent film quality that was a tad different for a children's movie. It's also the first family film in a long time that I have seen anyone drink alcohol. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie is spectacular. Since Remy practically lives on Linguini's head, there's a lot of animation devoted to Linguini's hair. Of course, Pixar's been ahead of the pack with animation of individual hairs ever since Monster's Inc. Really, it's the food that shines in this film. Every dish looks delicious, and it's interesting to see how much detail is put into everything, down to the spices. And not only does it look good, it sounds good, like the scene where Colette crackles bread to show its freshness. <br/><br/>The other interesting thing about the movie is the city of Paris through the eyes of a rodent. Some of the shots of the city are told through Linguini's or Skinner's point of view, but for the most part you are introduced to Paris through Remy's perspective. Which means a lot of detail on things a human would normally overlook, like the sole of a shoe or the various things found in the garbage can outside a restaurant.<br/><br/>I would say see this movie if you like good food, business intrigue, family issues, and old women with shotguns.

","Ratatouille is a computer-animated comedy produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was directed by Brad Bird. The title refers to a French dish which is served in the film, and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a rôtisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's brother; Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef; and Will Arnett as Horst, the sous-chef at Gusteau's restaurant. <br/><br/>The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.A said scrawny rat named Remy finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau. As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini. Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat. <br/><br/>One key point: if you can get over the natural gag reflex of seeing hundreds of rodents swarming over a restaurant kitchen, you will be free to enjoy the glory of Ratatouille. Our hero is Remy, a rat who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant. How this happens is the stuff of Pixar magic, that ineffable blend of headlong comedy, seamless technology, and wonder.As classically as ""Babe"",it turns animal-kingdom expectations on their ear for a unique, generous and gleeful gastronomic masterpiece that knows it's not much fun to look out, or cook, only for yourself.Director Brad Bird doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive.Added to that,it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure.It is surely a must-see."

In a Warner Bros. cartoon, like Road Runner or Bugs Bunny, logic and laws of the physical world are thrown out the window, and anything can happen if it's convenient for the plot. They, like Ratatouille, are well-suited to the ADHD crowd, at least for five minutes or so. But 111 minutes? <br/><br/>The biggest problem is I didn't really care about the characters. I don't think the producers did, either. Look at the credits: It's all about the them and the animators; the characters and their human voices don't show up for two and a half minutes. I have never, ever seen such an insult to actors in any movie credits!<br/><br/>We're supposed to like this because it's got really slick CGI animation. Well, frankly, CGI doesn't work for me, at least to the extent I am thinking about it. All it does is make me feel that I am being manipulated artificially. Now, Charlotte's Web did work, and I really cared about Templeton the rat, but I stopped thinking about the CGI because I was drawn into the story. And Bambi still breaks my heart.<br/><br/>I guess we're supposed to be really impressed by what CGI hath wrought, and maybe the current generation is. Most reviewers' frame of reference seems to be either Pixar or recent Disney animations. But there was very good animation before CGI, even back in the 1930s and 40s, especially Disney's Bambi, Snow White, and Pinocchio. There were some very well animated cartoons in the old days, before they started cutting corners and you got jerky, artificial looking motion on scrolling backgrounds; even The Simpson's isn't as well animated as many older cartoons. CGI doesn't make it better; it makes it cheaper. <br/><br/>The reason this story didn't work is because it was founded on too much sleight of hand. The rat wants to be a cook, but has never made much of anything besides combining cheese and strawberries, or mushroom and cheese. Yet, poof! suddenly he's a genius master chef, the greatest in Paris.<br/><br/>The kid shows up in one of the greatest restaurants in Paris and wants to cook, yet he has no experience and no talent. Even someone with qualifications is going to start washing pots and pans, as part of an apprenticeship. And we are supposed to be shocked that he starts as the ""trashboy""? Tant pis.<br/><br/>So the rat, with no experience takes over for the kid with no talent, and suddenly 1 + 1 = 1 in a million.<br/><br/>Now, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a story about a rat who wants to be a chef, but the filmmaker is going to have to meet me halfway. Obviously, it's a fantasy, and apparently it's good enough to work for kids. But to work for adults you can't throw all plausibility of plot out the window, or it's just a bunch of cartoon characters running around on the screen. Or perhaps I should say caricatures. There is absolutely no depth to any of the characters, at least beyond the rat.<br/><br/>Ratatouille was mildly entertaining, but the ending left me entirely unmoved; indeed, now that I think about it, none of it was emotionally moving. As I watched it, I kept asking myself how I would respond to it if these were human characters? And the answer was, without the slick CGI animation, there wasn't any beef. If I were to sum up the movie in two words it would be ""mostly boring."" <br/><br/>CGI? Who cares?"

","This very good movie is an adventure and comedy about a rat who finds out that his favorite cooking idol is dead, and eventually lands in Paris to find ""Gusteau's"" restaurant being ran by a rather ""short-supplied"" man named Skinner. His dream is to become the greatest chef in all of Paris, and does so with a young man he befriends named Linguini. Linguini of course doesn't know how to cook, but yet Remy does, but the truth is that anyone can cook; you just have to believe it. Linguini gets support from a woman named Colette who works in the restaurant, and eventually they gain a relationship between each other. However, since Remy and his dad think differently, he decides to be himself and move on. The animation in the movie has some points in it where it seems so much alive in it, and the movie is so good, it makes you wanna even watch it again for the pleasure. And if you say you can't cook, well watch this movie; it has the wisdom of a chef right before you on the screen."

","I am not a big fan of animated movies but Ratatouille is so well made that I actually got caught up in the adventures of Remy the rat and lead character of the story.<br/><br/>Remy has a highly developed sense of smell and taste leading him to believe that his destiny is to be one of the great chefs in the world. The problem is, of course, that no one will hire a rat to work in the kitchen of a restaurant. The obstacle is overcome one day by Remy hiding and passing on instructions to a human cook. The reviews for the food are tremendous and eventually the rodent becomes a big shot in the world of the animal kingdom. Pixar uses the technology as well as any studio today, and with an entertaining plot, it is easy to get caught up in Ratatouille's cartoon world."

","The first half was funny and entertaining, I thought. It was the second half that fell short. Let me explain.<br/><br/>The first half introduced all the characters and set up the basic plot. And it's a pretty interesting plot, a rat helps an inept garbage boy learn to cook. It was pretty clever, the dialog was witty, and all in all, I enjoyed it for what it was.<br/><br/>In the second half, that's when we uncover some new information. Unfortunately, there's little time to react to this information or go into detail about how different everything becomes. They resort to a lot of montages. Now montages can be great when they explain things that aren't vital enough to be full scenes but enough that they need to be explained. They just didn't work in this movie. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the second half is really confusing unless you're paying close attention. That's where the movie suffers.<br/><br/>So all in all, it was okay. Not spectacular or anything but it was decent enough. I don't I'll be watching it again anytime soon."

","Okay, let's make the brave decision not to make Incredibles 2. Instead, let's go with a movie about a rat, and just to make sure even fewer people can get around that, let's make the rat and everyone else French. Nobody really likes the French. Even the French don't really like the French. The only reason to have French people in a movie is to make fun of being French. But that doesn't work unless there are enough non-French people to point out how much cooler it is not to be French. There was a great computer animation film featuring rats, but it was ""Flushed Away"" and the rats were Brits. There were some French frogs and they were hilarious. The only reason I give this one four stars was that everyone making this really worked hard. Don't waste your money on the Collector's Edition; you'll only feel bad for the Pixar people as they explain how they really, really thought they were doing great things making this disappointment."

But, because it's an ""animated"" film, it wasn't voted in for Best Picture of the Year at the Oscars, which it deserved. My only tiny problem is that maybe it was just 15 minutes too long?

As always with Pixar's films, it isn't the plot details which matter, nor is it the sumptuous visuals (a gloriously realised Paris, mostly seen from a rat's-eye point of view), it's the emotional journeys taken by the characters: Remy the rat flying in the face of expectations, Linguini the callow kitchen boy, acquiring maturity and self-confidence, Colette the woman in a man's world, softening as she warms to Linguinini's gentleness, Ego the critic, learning that there are more important things than that which he thought was so important.<br/><br/>Every major character learns, develops, grows, and moves forwards, and they do so in a wonderfully visual way - and not only that, it's funny!

","Ratatouille is a thought-provokingly superb Pixar effort, effortlessly besting its nearest rivals in the Animated Category. Brad Bird's animated tale of a rat (Remy) who pursues his dreams of becoming a world class chef in Paris is very entertaining, although more geared towards adults. The story will be of lesser interest to kids (apart from the excellent physical comedy routines). The story doesn't take the easy way out, but instead takes it time setting up the characters. The animation is brilliant. Peter O'Toole is perfect as a cynical critic, and the scene where he first tastes Remy's cuisine has to be seen to be believed. His climactic speech where he bemoans the cynicism and futility of critics is quite deep for a cartoon! Truly one of the finest Pixar films yet, only slightly below Wall.E and The Incredibles. <br/><br/>Overall 9/10"

"baz-howard2","4","1","3","18 May 2008"," Great CGI doesn't pull this film's chesnuts off the flambe.
","I must concede, when you think about old Disney films - the requirement to suspend disbelief was always paramount. Take 'Lady & The Tramp', say - two dogs, having a romantic, candlelit dinner and being serenaded by a couple of Italian Chefs. No bottoms are sniffed at anytime, and nobody looks in danger of being neutered against their will... Yet, I loved it, I would say 'at the time' but the truth is that I still kinda love this old time Disney schmaltz. You know why?...Because, despite the ridiculous situations and prepositions, they STILL pull it off. If only for a second, they have carried you away somewhere on their whimsy, and lost you in the elaborate fantasy. There shouldn't, therefore, be any problem in taking this concept a little further down the food chain. After all, if you can love stray dogs once you realise they have feelings too, its surely only another leap of faith to love the rat that wants to cook your dinner. Really?! Try watching this film WHILST eating your dinner, and then come back and tell me it was a great idea. And, therein, is where I believe the problem lies - plausibility.<br/><br/>This film is, at times, either VERY plausible or not quite enough. Sometimes its even both at the same time. Whilst being an achievement in itself, this creates a nightmare dichotomy between some of the very best CGI to be seen anywhere before, and some of the very WORST character development and storytelling in Disney history. The realism of a rats perspective- including sense of scale, angles, the movement of us humans looming overhead etc is a small wonder to behold. Oddly enough, the development for the subsidiary characters actually seemed more rounded than the main ones. Of those I enjoyed most were the shady Sous Chefs and Chef De Parties, and also the Old Lady in the beginning. To true Disney tradition, their stylised figures and expressions, uttered delightful snippets of comical dialogue. All of which, were beautifully rendered and animated. This was alongside only, the movement of the rats themselves, which is almost unnervingly lifelike. To be honest, disturbingly so- in light of the saccharin sweet morality tale being told here. This, for me, is where it all becomes beyond the joke. If you could imagine a liberally- sensitive sitcom funded by the Bible Channel about a cute family of botulism microbes that escape the factory in a carton of Petit Filous, then you're more than halfway towards understanding how literally hard to swallow Ratatouille is. Its more interesting how acute the story's desire is to not offend anyone's beliefs, to the point where even the concept of ghosts is meticulously avoided, in favour of Gusteau being only a 'figment of Remy's imagination'. This kind of compromise only serves to dilute the concept further. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, if you're gonna animate rats then they SHOULD look and move like rats...but please don't imbue one with the on screen personality and moral virtue of Tom Hanks and expect me to swallow that garbage. If I must- then please sprinkle some Warfarin on the piece of crap telling me that the rat discovers two magic clumps of Remy's hair that directly control his arms like joysticks.... Its a pity Brad Bird hadn't made an equally magical couple of discoveries when selecting his writing team. Even one with an idea of keeping a story tight and accessible to all ages would have been a Godsend - sorry Divine Intervention of a Figment Of My Imagination Instructing Me To Do The Right Thing By My Fellow Creatures-Send. And to bring all this Old Testament style righteousness kicking and screaming to the last century, there's always the addition of the lone female character that's had to fight her way up in a man's world, a well-worn - but by no means tired device, and hopefully guaranteed to please a good proportion of one's target audience...the gender friendly scatter-gun. <br/><br/>Surprising though it may sound, Its not been my complete aim to spoil this movie, or indeed, include any spoilers. There are many visual merits to this movie most of which seem to take place in the first half...these are well worth viewing and for this reason I have given it a 4. If you make it to the end without leaving the room/hitting the 'fast forward' button then you have my eternal admiration."

","Rataouille is about a rat who longs to be a great cook, despite the whole situation of, you know, his entire species meant to eat and live in garbage. That's the basic premise of Ratatouille, and it could have been so much better, if focused in the right direction.<br/><br/>I'd say Ratatouille is Pixar's worst movie to date, but it isn't saying much, considering all of their previous films have been excellent, and this one isn't really that bad either. It just doesn't hit the high-mark other Pixar efforts have. The biggest problem is there's very little time to really build emotion for the characters. Whether it's between Remy and his father, or Linguini and Colette, one just can't seem to connect with these characters on an emotional level. A lot of the film's ideas, turning points, and even jokes also follow suit, and end up feeling awkward and rushed. ***SPOILER*** For instance, the idea of Remy ""steering"" Linguini around by pulling his hair was funny, but also very awkward and out-of-place in the film universe.***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning as always, but they couldn't save the movie from leaving me feel unfulfilled.<br/><br/>I've seen the previews for Wall-E, Pixar's next film, and it looks visually stunning, but I just hope it doesn't fall short where I feel it most counts."

No one else notices Remy though, so Linguini gets all the credit. Only problem is Linguini really can't cook. The owner, Skinner, discovers that Linguini is really Gusteau's long lost son. That means Linguini could still inherit the restaurant. Customers begin asking for Linguini's special dishes, which are created by Remy. They strike up a partnership. Remy controls Linguini's arms with his hair. I know, that sounds really weird. Any way, its up to them to impress the harshest food critic of all and to find out about Linguini's father.

And yes, the Paris in this film is an unrealistic Paris that never existed, or perhaps only in the over romanticized imagination of Americans. But: One, I think a sweet, idealistic ""Paree"" is allowed since 'Amelie' by Jeunot and Carot. Maybe that's the reason why Collete is named after Audrey Tatou?

"filmbuff20","8","1","3","6 December 2007"," A Rat's Life
","First there were toys. Then there were bugs. Then there were one eyed green things with Billy Crystal's voice. Then there were automobiles. Pixar has asked us many favours over the years and we have all happily, gladly and willingly obliged. Empathise with the things in this world least likely to be empathised with. Inanimate objects. Insects. Now - rodents. Pixar have succeeded in everything so far, but rats must always have been tricky. Specifically, we're talking semi-real world rats, in a semi-real world setting. In this case, a kitchen.<br/><br/>It is a testament to Pixar's genius that I even mention having a problem with this. Most of the little animated cuties in films like Basil the Great Mouse Detective or The Rescuers etc are set apart from all other vermin by being distinctly cuddly and humanoid. Basil, for one, was Sherlock Holmes, wearing human clothes and adapting the rodent underworld into a human-like environment. But in this case, we're dealing with Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles, who gives us little gems of nuance to give his animated reality an identifiable sheen. The Incredibles, for example, is as preposterous as Sky High, yet includes such themes as bored in the office, family troubles and the like. His storytelling is unique and the animated world is so very layered that it is lifted high above some of the child fodder put out by Fox animation and, ahem, IDT Entertainment. It is this that gives Ratatouille some of it's magic.<br/><br/>Yes, these rats talk, but only to each other. All human ears can hear is squeaking. But really, this movie does not delude itself or it's audience. These are cute and cuddly rats, but nevertheless, rats in the kitchen are disgusting. So, once you get past that aspect, you can begin to invest. The plot involves a rat named Remy who loves good food and likes to experiment with cooking. A chance meeting with a young man named Linguini in a restaurant kitchen causes them to team up and begin cooking together, garnering acclaim. I won't tell anymore than that because it's much more fun to find out for yourself.<br/><br/>The film's voice talents are spot on. The trick here is that no-one is particularly recognisable (aside from Peter O'Toole who is absolutely marvellous as usual). In animated films such as Shark Tale, the focus is taken off the story in favour of showcasing Jack Black! Will Smith! Angelina Jolie! much to the detriment of the final product (the excessive pop culture referencing is enough already as well). In this movie, the story is it's own boss, even going so far as to continue to be real-world even in light of certain ridiculous developments (which are a lot of fun, just ridiculous!). There is slightly less laughter than one might expect, but it's not really noticeable as everything else is so absorbing. The existing one liners however never miss (""we don't mean to be rude, but we're French!""). The animation, shown up wonderfully on the crisp, clear DVD (that's normal DVD, HD can kiss my butt) is perfect, showing Shrek the Third up easily. So, my only comment would be the slow start. Normally these movies get better when I watch them again, so maybe opinion will change. Until then, any further analysing would be overkill. It's a cartoon after all, and a damn entertaining one at that. Now, who's hungry?"
"rake-7","6","1","3","6 December 2007"," Pleasing but WAY overrated
","With all the raves around this picture it's next to impossible not to have high expectations. Lower them. Unless you are entirely bowled over by visuals alone (which are truly stunning), you will be left wondering what all the fuss is about. This may be a movie about fine cuisine, but the story seems to have been concocted in a Cuisinart--it's a mash-up. Instead of a clear character objective or a distinct plot through-line, the filmmakers have tossed in every possible character type, sub-plot, and chase sequence, with the cumulative effect of holding your attention (for the most part), but leaving you ultimately unfulfilled. It's not that these sequences aren't artfully done (the technique is flawless), but they amount to an obfuscation of the fact that there's not much here but numerous pastry-thin layers of small vignettes (even at that, the filmmakers seem to have missed a lot of opportunities here, especially comic ones). There are also serious problems with suspension of disbelief. This may sound odd considering that this is an animated world, but such worlds hinge on their ability to establish their own parameters of reality. For reasons I cannot quite fathom, Ratatouille goes out of its way to set very specific and highly-realistic parameters, and then proceeds break them. You find yourself literally rationalizing certain plot developments with a conscious determination such as, ""well, it is, after all, a cartoon."" Great films may indeed be like great meals, but flavor alone doesn't satisfy."

Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.<br/><br/>Last year's Pixar movie, ""Cars"", was really underwhelming, although still generic. This put Pixar back on its tracks. Not just with the seamless, not to mention wonderful, animation, imagination, but with the unique storyline.<br/><br/>Every speck of scene is done with great detail (of course with a budget of $150 million!). The vivid colors and all turns this into a visual masterpiece! Yet, the movie (for a whole) wasn't perfect. It fell just beneath my expectations.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected more than the unusual. Although with a weird plot, it didn't go anywhere in the movie until the last twenty minutes in the film, not to mention some choppy pacing. Also, this movie is more for adults and teens than for kids, probably why it didn't make as much money than most Pixar films.<br/><br/>Still, in the end, Ratatouille is a fantastic animated feature, worthy in the Pixar franchise. It's funny and it's a visual delight. Although it doesn't make a perfect meal, it's still fantastic to eat."

Well prepare yourself for this, it has everything you need to make an absolute classic it's witty comedy captivated my kids and myself and the storyline was faultless. If you haven't seen this please do I wouldn't want you to miss this. I have never written a review for a film before but I felt I should for this as I want as many people as possible to see this lovely film.

","Up until the ending, I found it rather clichÃ©d. It followed the typical animated film plot, and even the end, which kinda circumvented that, wasn't totally immune. I know it's a kid's film, and a dark, twisted finish wasn't in the cards, but I felt that both of Bird's previous films had a much more interesting story. For all this talk of Pixar 'growing up', I felt this was more of a step back from The Incredibles, which I still view as their most adult film. Still, though, it was a lot of fun, with fantastic animation, great voice work, and a lot of little comic moments that added up. It wasn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it was rather enjoyable. Not the greatest animated film ever, but certainly a welcome respite from the crap that is populating this genre today."

","don't let my comment title confuse you. Ratatouille is amazing. when it was released some time ago, my older sister (yes you read correctly OLDER SISTER) dragged me to the theater to see it with her and her (coed) friends. i was shocked. this was probably the best Pixar movie ever, and Pixar is doing great in the movie business. The film's plot is interesting, and the title is hilarious (in relation to the pun). the animation is really good, the locations actually look like Paris, and there's a witty sense of humor in some scenes that don't really require it. not to mention, in the film's two hour runtime, with ever passing second you see the chefs cooking the food, and the sizzling of the food in the kitchen it just makes you SO HUNGRY. What's really great about Ratatouille is it's theme. It's sort of (this might sound corny) about how one can be misunderstood or disliked, but still can become a success. bottom line, this film is a true Pixar hit. 10/10"

","My wife and I experienced this film a couple of months ago and rented the DVD yesterday. The eye-popping art and colorization of the film are not lost in viewing the film at home. When we saw it in the theater, we so much liked the story and the characterizations that we simply lost track of all the ""heavyweight"" voice-over talent that was there! <br/><br/>Another great aspect of the film is its upbeat, ""never-give-up"" attitude towards modernity with all of its ups and downs. There is much of sadness and even despair in almost any life, but to approach the negative concerns with positiveness and confidence is simply refreshing and enlivening.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for families--it is replete with love and tenderness without being mawkish, and yet it is pragmatic enough to be thought-provoking and worthy of repeated viewings.<br/><br/>From this point on, anything that has Brad Bird attached to it will be seen by our house ""no questions asked!"""

Even thought it is the 50s-style Paris, our feelings were here: if New-York is the city that never sleeps, Paris is the city that never changes! <br/><br/>Except for the slow beginning with the crazy grandma, the story is imaginative, mixing fun and tenderness, and the characters are cutely drawn!"

","Pixar find themselves back on track after the slight misfire that was Cars, only stumbling a bit when introducing characters in the first twenty minutes. Afterwards, a joyous reverence for American computer animation's most prestigious unit became more and more apparent as viewers are led down this unique, heartfelt journey of one rodent's love for making tasty food the talk of all Paris. As downright preposterous some of the plot elements revolve around seem nearly everything works splendidly, from the inspired physics of Pixar's patently breathtaking chase scenes, comedic brilliance in a snobbish maturity of the antagonists, to the splendidly and poignantly captured climax. Ratatouille, if not the company's best work to date, represents a newfound creative realization for what is still hopefully only the beginning of these titan's computerized expressionism."
"MOscarbradley","8","1","3","24 October 2007"," Pop-Art of a high order ... but perhaps not one for the kids.
","I must confess that a movie about a rat who can cook, ('anybody can cook' is the film's motto), and becomes 'the greatest chef in all of France' didn't real seem my cup of red-eye but egged on by a five star review in Empire magazine together with my friend Nuno's assertion that this was the best film he'd seen this year kind of swayed me so I did something I rarely do if ever and dragged myself off to an early screening where I was the sole adult without kids. Oh, and on top of recommendations from Nuno and Empire there was always the fact that the writer and director was Brad (""The Incredibles"") Bird. 'If it's a Brad Bird film,' I said to myself, 'it must have something'.<br/><br/>So a five star movie? Best film of the year? Well, not quite. I hate to sound churlish but the script's a bit on the thin side and it isn't that funny and from the silence of the little lambs in the audience is it not a mite too sophisticated for the younger tots? I know pirates may be dastardly and wizards can be scary but this is the 21st century and children have grown hardy, blood-thirsty even, in their quest for adventure so a movie about a Parisian rat with a penchant for haute-cuisine? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Well, that's me being picky. As I pride myself on being a 'sophisticated' adult let's just say I loved it and am convinced that perhaps it wasn't the tots Mr Bird was aiming at. This is a clever, invigorating, 'grown-up' movie which might explain why I am prepared to criticize the script for being 'too thin' and for the paucity of humour; (I laughed but less than I had hoped to). It's good enough, (and the last quarter is very good indeed), for me to wish it had been better, (and at almost two hours it is a bit on the long side).<br/><br/>Technically and visually it's a marvel. Bird is canny enough to adhere to the old-fashioned values of animation, (I like the way he constructs backgrounds that could be taken straight from the best Disney cartoons), while using all the techniques available to him to give the film a 'realistic' look. This is pop-art of a very high order but only adults will appreciate that.<br/><br/>It starts well and it ends terrifically. There is a bit too much padding in the middle, perhaps, so I'm knocking a mark or two off for that but you still come out on a relative high and if you're a real movie buff you can't help but get a buzz out of Peter O'Toole's voicing of the food critic Anton Ego. This is Parma Ham cut thick, a master actor savouring the opportunity to have a bit of fun. I could have been doing with more of him. So Nuno, it's not the best film of the year but it's still a treat, nevertheless."
"rmlattimore","10","1","3","23 October 2007"," Best picture
","Not just best animation, best picture, period. Great voice acting, smart, funny script. Any objections to the movie are just quibbles. Remy is the most memorable character to come along in years. The best movie scripts develop the unique personalities of the individual characters, and Ratatouille does this, maybe better than any movie I have seen since Diner. Peter O'Toole doing Anton Ego's review -- it does not get any better. I doubt the AMPAS membership has the guts to put an animated feature up for Best Picture, but they found a reason to ignore Citizen Kane and Russell Crowe in LA Confidential, so that means zilch. Ratatouille is the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year."

","This Pixar production is a lot of fun. I enjoyed myself at least as much as The Incredibles. The story is very good, and the gags are littered throughout. My favorite recurring one being anything with the rat-like resident 4ft chef who get's the boot. His paranoia and antics remind one of loony-toons in good touch. Once again Pixar outdo themselves with fabulous fur and texturing, and vivid colors of Paris and the inner city, and dynamic motion. Voice acting may not be quite as good as in productions past, but it's good nonetheless. Peter-O-Toole is unmistakable in his pronounced English accent. Looking forward to the next movie called Wall-E. Check it out on DVD, well worth it."
"therubixtheory","7","1","3","14 October 2007"," Incomprehensible CGI with about 2 seconds of something funny.
","I went to see this yesterday, there are a lot of positives about this film but there is also just as many negatives.<br/><br/>I don't know if i can clearly sum up my impression of Ratatouille because what can you really say that's not already been said.<br/><br/>Alright, first the positives.<br/><br/>1. Pixar really go all out into making you believe that these are actual rats, this includes giving you a glimpse of how rats are treated, how they live etc. After the film is over i left thinking that the only reason we fear rats is because of what we've turned them into. We treat them with less respect than pigeons.<br/><br/>2. You will not see CGI this incomprehensible anywhere else and at least not for a while, try not to blink too much because you might miss something you wont ever see again.<br/><br/>3. Most of the emotion appeared heartfelt and it was backed up by amazing dialogue which was also another good point, the dialogue is wonderful.<br/><br/>4. In films such as this you'd expect there to be at least one stereotype in the movie and surprisingly there wasn't, or at least there weren't any that were made obvious.<br/><br/>5. The critique stole the movie, delightfully wicked, and his monologue is something i haven't seen in ages.<br/><br/>alright and now for the bad points.<br/><br/>1. I didn't expect this film to be that funny, and it wasn't, you'd have to be a paid critique to find it funny (And i deeply stress the word PAID!), there is no comedy in this movie and i don't think there was really supposed to be, i don't think Brad Bird wrote it to be a comedy there were just an occasional gag in it and the newspapers did the rest.<br/><br/>2. I groaned a couple of times, towards the end the film severely starts to drag, the film is a little boring throughout since it lacks comedy and got a bit typical with the plot but towards the last half hour, it really got boring.<br/><br/>3. This film was very realistic but some things were just put in there to make the writers jobs easier, like the rats didn't speak human but they did understand English, and Remy knew what all the different types of cheeses and spices were although he was just a rat, one thing that killed it for me is when his dad says ""And thank GOD!"" i'm sorry but why do all the animals in CGI's have a concept of religion.<br/><br/>And how did they manage to tie up the health inspector and the former chef.<br/><br/>i know it's for kids but it doesn't hurt to be a little more true to life.<br/><br/>4. There seems to be a pattern weaving where it doesn't matter where the movie is set or what accent you give the main characters and you can judge what accent a character will be given depending on which company made the movie.<br/><br/>therubixtheory@hotmail.co.uk if anyone has anything they wish to yell at me for."

How can you not like this movie? From the moment we get introduced to Remy the rat you will believe that he is a wonderful cook. The fact that he is a rat makes it even funnier. We want Remy to succeed. Even when the people and rats think that it isn't possible. There are some lessons to be learned by adults and children.

"dinesh_cena1989","10","1","3","6 September 2007"," A delightful and awe-amazing rendezvous with the world of rodents.
","I shall be a little honest with myself. PIXAR has been an utter bore since 1995's TOY STORY which debuted with enough success for it to be called a masterpiece. Pixar Animation Studios had dished out enough offerings that impressed the audience and the critics alike. I noticed this a long time ago. But the problem was FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES, they were sweet but just not on an all-time high level. I'll be straight, Pixar Animations Studios had never dished an offering that impressed me. That is, until the year 2007 came along with it another Pixar offering, 2007's RATATOUILLE.<br/><br/>It tells the simple story of a rat, yes, an animal and the kind everyone cringes at the sight of. Only, Remy the rat prefers dishing out Jamie Oliver style rather than munching on the litter-trash thrown away by us responsible human beings. Remy the rat is taking the advice of an idol, the French chef Gasteau who dies and leaves his ex-critically acclaimed restaurant in the heart of Paris. It eventually lands him into a little espionage mission before all 'heaven' and 'hell' broke loose.<br/><br/>I never have had the guts to say this but RATATOUILLE should be called the greatest motion picture in the form of computer graphics. Yes, TOY STORY was a revolutionary offering, giving us a crunch of visual delight but seriously, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command was not a joy to watch. The movie also pokes a little ""huhu-haha"" at the very ,respectably taunted critic aka. food critic Antoine Ego. The movie brings more energy with the liveliness of the characters on screen.<br/><br/>The thing is that TOY STORY was well-known was because of a leap in the realm of animation motion pictures. This one was the only Pixar movie that actually gave a well-fashioned combination of great ""recipes"" into it's yearly of two an three years offering.<br/><br/>A simple category of Pixar Animation movies in the past are these TOY STORY= By now, everyone has to admit, it got boring.<br/><br/>MONSTER INC= Original but again, boring.<br/><br/>FINDING NEMO= Better but a little draggy THE INCREDIBLES= Really, really boring.<br/><br/>RATATOUILLE: Excellent, well-made.<br/><br/>The conclusion is that if RATATOUILLE were released in 1995, people wouldn't only have paid attention to the visual dynamics and the CITIZEN KANE like dimension to the movie (coughs TOY STORY) but they would also be mesmerized by the heart and soul of such creatures.<br/><br/>For the first time in 12 years, well done.<br/><br/>A"
"valadas","7","1","3","6 September 2007"," Rats and Men
","In formal and technical terms this movie is undoubtedly very good but not better than the average recent other computer animated movies. Its main original feature is the story itself which tells us about the rat that wants to be a chef and attains its aim after a lot of exciting vicissitudes. This movie has the successful peculiarity of making the viewer to take to the rats which are animals we are used to face as repugnant, distasteful and disease-carrier mainly in what relates with food. But here we sympathize with them indeed. Getting back to technical aspects, the design is stupendous, the puppets extremely original and expressive, the action runs at a sometimes hallucinating rhythm and the visual effects are of an amazing movement and perspective. This is one more excellent achievement in the field of animation movies."

","Fog settles along the bank of the Seine River in Paris. The street lights have an eerie, romantic aura about them. A young man scurries down the steps towards the river's edge from his bicycle, looking over his shoulder every which way to see if anyone is around. With him is Remy who will soon be at the bottom of the river. He approaches the edge, ready to dispose of the innocent victim. By the way, Remy is a rat.<br/><br/>The latest Disney/Pixar collaboration Ratatouille brings us through the streets of Paris and into the kitchen of what was once a five star restaurant. This witty and wonderfully put together animated feature is just another astounding accomplishment by the creators and animators who brought us Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles.<br/><br/>We find ourselves following Remy, a Parisian rat whose taste buds are not satisfied with the everyday apple core and pizza crusts. His unique ability to create delectable treats that even a human can't resist ends up having him separated from his friends and family, but brings him to the kitchen of one of the most respectable restaurants in all of Paris. <br/><br/>After sneaking into the kitchen, Remy rescues a sauce that has been ruined by Linguini accidentally and has the customers in an uproar about how delicious it is. Remy, after being spotted, is taken out by Linguini who must dispose of him but can't after figuring out that Remy can understand him. Linguini realizes that this rat has made the soup and must come up with a way of recreating the soup and keeping Remy a secret.<br/><br/>The two must join forces in winning over the chefs, the customers, and the critics in order to keep the restaurant in business and to keep Remy alive. Remy figures out a way of manipulating Linguini's movements to prepare the food and keeping himself out of sight.<br/><br/>Since Toy Story's release in 1995, every film since then has been a step up in the advancements that have taken place in the production of these films. The quality of the animation and the attention to detail is unbelievable. Every shot and every movement is a carefully drawn out plan with many levels. There is the lighting, the action on screen, the movement of the camera, sounds, and a wide spectrum of minute things that we don't even notice but are essential in creating a scene.<br/><br/>Take for instance the city itself. The film mainly takes place in the kitchen, where Remy's family lives, and where Linguini lives. All of the in between scenes that are only on screen for a few seconds give the film this grand scope. The Eifel Tower is a a prominent piece of the Paris skyline. But the lights and cars and trees that surround it give it much more depth.<br/><br/>One thing that has made all of these films successful are the ingenious stories and their characters. The writing for all of these films has always been solid and in tune with the message that is trying to be sent with each story. The glue that holds the story together is certainly the characters. The cast of voices include Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehey, Peter O'Toole, and a host of amazing voice actors who bring to life these lovable and at times characters. Pixels become actors.<br/><br/>Anyone can cook. That is the motto of the great chef Gusteau. But what this really means is anyone can do anything. Even if all of the odds are against you like a rat trying to be a five star chef, you can do it. The film is easy to understand but it works for all ages. There is something here that everyone can enjoy. That is why these films have worked for so long. They make an impact on all age groups.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a food connoisseur to appreciate Ratatouille. Even if you have never had ratatouille in your life, this movie will go down smooth and easy, filling you up with satisfaction and delight."

","Ratatouilli is a wonderful Disney Pixar film. Remy was really cute, and when he was guiding Lenguini to do the stuff in the kitchen, it was really funny when he kept bumping into everything. But, there were some parts that were really gross, like when the rats were cooking. Another part that was gross was when the lady shot the top of the chandelier, and it fell down, and then all the rats were found there. Ratatouilli was really funny, though. The credits were cute, because they were cartoons, as well. I hope that no one thinks that Ratatouilli is just a lame Disney movie, because it isn't; it is definitely worth seeing. Although paying to see it in the theater was a lot of money, it was definitely worth seeing. I really liked the romance between Lenguini and Collette, because it was a really sweet part of a really funny movie.

"emasterslake","Null","1","3","9 July 2007"," Pixar hasn't let us down yet.
","As long time fan of Pixar's works. I still consider it the best American CGI company ever. After seven big hits, the company is very worthy in the animation industry. With Ratatouille marking as their eighth film. I had a hunch it'll be something different.<br/><br/>Set in a retro era of France. Remy the rat lives with his family of pack rats in the country side. Him and everyone else survive by eating garbage and waste. Remy had it with rats living in this kind of style. So he eats fresh food instead, which is nothing compared to the taste of everyday garbage. His father always told him to stay away from humans. Because rats are seen as thieves and unsanitary. Remy however wants to change that method. As he was inspired by a chef on TV named Gustav, who states that anyone can cook. So Remy begins to mix ingredients together to create dishes for his pack. Hoping that it'll change the way rat eat by cooking simple ingredients rather than steal food.<br/><br/>One day however, after an unexpected accident. Remy finds himself in Paris, France. Where he stumbles upon Gustav's restaurant. Where he he'll cross paths with Linguini, a non-experienced employee, who ended up as a poor garbage boy. Remy however will change his life by helping him become an experienced chef. But can he change the image of rats for good? I have to say that this movie is more than great. The word great can't match the excellence of the film. Ratatouille stands out differently than the other Pixar films do. Directed by Brad Bird who's given us ""Iron Giant"" & ""The Incredibles"". Has created a unique CG animated movie. Unlike his previous titles, which were science fiction related. This one is more of a culinary/fictional story. But the style and look resembles both a Pixar and a Brad Bird film.<br/><br/>Ignore all the negative reviews from those who don't know true art. Ratatouille is highly a highly recommended movie for all ages & all Pixar fans. The humor will make you laugh. The plot will be interesting to witness. And the characters will sheerly entertain you.<br/><br/>I guaranteed it'll be the best CGI film of this year."

The only issue I had with this film is that some parts were a little over the top...such as the old woman shooting at the rats, and the chasing scene near the end...a tad too cartoonish.

The story is a fairly hackneyed ""you can achieve your dreams"" type affair with a bit of the ""not everyone is special"" message of The Incredibles thrown in for a bit of (slightly grating) good measure. The animation is good but I cannot help feeling that a stylised two dimensional approach (similar to that used in the end credits) would have been better. In fact, watching it again, I cannot help feeling that I'd like to have seen The Incredibles filmed in the style used in the end credits. Please can someone who isn't Japanese out there go and make a good 2d film.<br/><br/>There seems to be some confusion over the potential audience as there is little or nothing of the slap-stick humour which might entertain a child and there are few enough laughs even for the adults. With food as a central theme of the film strangely little emphasis is placed on it.<br/><br/>The film is set in Paris, but to no purpose as we never see a proper representation of the city, but for the Eiffel tower hovering in a few wide shots and an old Citroen parked in a back street this might have been anywhere. Similarly I would like to have heard some clichéd french accents as some fun could have been had with that - Remy's middle American accent was particularly grating.<br/><br/>Admittedly the film never explain how Remy can read, understand humans or manipulate someone using their hair but if that worries you then you really need to think hard before seeing an animated film as almost all cannot stand up to any sort of scrutiny. <br/><br/>For all the negatives I did enjoy it and there are a few great moment, the segment where the food critic tastes the titular Ratatouille is pure genius.<br/><br/>While Ratatouille it is not up to the standard of The Incredibles I think you'd be hard-pressed to feel cheated if you went to see it, it's certainly a million times better than the execrable pile of total pump that was Cars.<br/><br/>WARNING If you come from the the Christian right (neither correct nor Christian in this Christian's opinion) or the Aryan Brotherhood of Justice or whatever the loony right in the US are calling themselves these days then you may be forced to shoot a few abortion doctors over the fact that -oh my dear sweet God!- one of the main characters may have been BORN OUR OF WEDLOCK and NO ONE BURNS HIM AT THE STAKE BECAUSE OF IT!"

","I hate to be a killjoy here but there should be a warning before very young people see this film. I say the following with real regret. For some reason unknown to me, the word 'bloody' was used by Peter O'Toole as the voice of Anton Ego in the context of swearing! What a great shame, and to the dismay of many parents in the audience too! Children were commenting whilst I watched the film saying 'that man used a bad word'. We were all embarrassed and left wondering whether any more swearing was going to materialise and consequently interrupted the flow and enjoyment of an otherwise spectacular film. Why did such a great animation have to be spoilt by such ridiculous use of language. Sure, Anton was angry, but swearing when 4 and 5 year olds are in the audience. It was absolutely not necessary, especially for the use of just one word. My fear is that it is an attempt by the film company to educate the very young and very innocent in the use of bad language at an early stage. What a sad reflection on the film company! Having said all that, ... I was transfixed by the film from start. My son and I thought that it was extremely funny, well written, excellent animation and had a good storyline. I will highly recommend the film, but with reservations. This film would have got a 10 rating."

","Bambi was beautifully drawn but failed somewhat on the story side. This one didn't, and it moved me just as much. The word plot makes no sense - this one had a story.

It doesn't take away the cartoon heart of the movie. It is still an animated movie; also in style. But there are moments where you almost say ""aha!""... ""they are mixing..."" and you realize they are not. Remy holds a piece of bread at one point... it was so beautifully done it was beyond description. Not only did it look real - it look downright delicious. The attention to detail is simply out of this world. Animation is smooth and lifelike mixed with a dash of rosemary... I mean with a dash of Tex Avery and there were times when the audience were flat with laughter over scenes that had nothing but wacky moves to carry the moment.<br/><br/>The movie of the year! It had it all! The only reason I still give Bambi one more star is because I have seen it so many more times than this.

"bsoft-3","6","1","4","24 July 2007"," Merely Average
","Ratatouille is a decent movie. It does not, however, live up to the excellence we have come to expect from Pixar. This was a movie on rails - the sugar-coated Pixar story that we have come to love, but without the originality that makes it so great.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like a geek, I should say that Pixar movies have to deliver technologically. We live in a world of computer-animated films. It is not sufficient for Pixar's technology to be ""good"", it must push the boundaries of what is possible. In Monsters Inc., it was fur. In Nemo, it was water. In The Incredibles, it was cloth. Ratatouille didn't push the boundaries. Yes, it looked great. But so did Cars, Over the Hedge, Happy Feet, and Shrek 3. Perhaps we are reaching a plateau where everything that can be improved already has been. But the spark is gone. Pixar no longer stands out as the leader in computer animation.<br/><br/>So, what else makes Pixar movies so great? Voice acting. Who didn't love Hanks in Toy Story, Spacey in A Bug's Life, Goodman/Crystal in Monsters, DeGeneres in Nemo, Hunter/Jackson in The Incredibles, or Wilson in Cars? Great voice actors bring personality to the movie. They, more than anything else, define the presence of the characters. Excluding Peter O'Toole's excellent performance as Ego, the acting was merely average in Ratatouille. Both Over the Hedge and Shrek 3 had better voice acting, as has every previous Pixar movie. Lou Romano's Linguini character was the stereotypical shell-shocked teenager, a voice that I've unfortunately endured in countless other films. Patton Oswalt's Remy had more personality, but it still lacked the impact that defined previous Pixar characters. The voice acting in Ratatouille wasn't bad, but, excluding Peter O'Toole, it wasn't outstanding either.<br/><br/>So, what do we have left? The story. Pixar is, and has always been, about great storytelling. Ratatouille, unfortunately, is a letdown in this regard. It plays out more like a Disney picture than a Pixar picture. Linguini begins the story unable to cook, and, at the end, he still can't cook. I guess that ""anyone can cook"" doesn't apply to shell-shocked teenagers. Where's the lesson that we're supposed to take away? Where's the danger? Every other Pixar film connects us to the characters by putting them in peril. Remember the door scene in The Incredibles? Or the rocket scene in Toy Story? Or the angler fish in Nemo? There is no risk in Ratatouille. Remy is put in danger, but it is too brief for the emotion to sink in.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say that Ratatouille was a bad film. It wasn't. But it doesn't have the magic of a Pixar film. When a Dreamworks film, Over the Hedge, looks just as good and has better voice acting, what does it mean for Pixar? It means that they are losing their edge. Pixar is becoming more like the rest of Disney - merely average."

","I don't know French but I know I like this movie. Despite a somewhat predictable story, this film is compelling from beginning to end and full of excitement and hilarious humor. The pacing is brilliant, including a rare freeze frame animated sequence and some seriously interesting perspective on the world of food. The slapstick scenes are sometimes as original as a vintage silent film and when they are overly silly, they are still funny and playing to its target audience. It may not make as much money as Cars, but that film was boring and once joke strung out for the same laughs. Remy is a balanced main character, with solid voice work by comedian Patton Oswalt. The portrayal of France was romantic and genuinely appealing and I felt some scenes could have had a cheerful song or two, but as it is the film is nearly perfect and paced exceptionally well. Garofalo and Garrett both use accents well and create memorable characters and the theme of having help from sources outside of yourself is one often covered and re- covered in popular film, but never as comically and effective as is done here. The rat can cook, and cook well he does."
"editor-299","7","1","4","22 June 2007"," Newest Pixar film a real charmer
","The charm - and ultimately the success - of John Lassiter and Pixar Studios has been its ability to create motion pictures that are pretty much ageless in their appeal. <br/><br/>Such films as ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Monster's Inc.,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Cars,"" have thrilled youngsters with their brilliant, colorful animation and fun, goofy characters; while adults could savor the multi-layered story lines and familiar pop cultural references.<br/><br/>The organization has also made a staple out of the two-hour ""cartoon"" movie, something unheard of before the advent of Pixar.<br/><br/>The newest offering, ""Ratatouille"" (pronouced ""rat-a-tooie""), does not divert from that formula, telling the tale of an amazing Parisian rat, Remy (voiced by Patton Oswald, the short, nerdy actor who's made a name for himself on such TV series as ""Crank Yankers,"" ""Mr. Show with Bob & David"" and ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force,"" among others), who cannot abide eating the same garbage day after day.<br/><br/>Blessed with an acute sense of smell (he sniffs out rat poison for his colony) and an ultra-sensitive palette, he soon finds his way to Gusteau's Bistro, a world famous restaurant that has fallen upon hard times since a negative newspaper review by Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) caused Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett, ""Everybody Love Raymond"") to fall into a funk and die.<br/><br/>Here, Remy runs into a poor sap of a cleaning boy, Linguini (Pat Romano), a cross between Jerry Lewis and Napoleon Dynamite. While trying to add to a soup dish one night, Linguini only succeeds in making the food unpalatable; fortunately, Remy saves the day, creates an amazing concoction and earns everyone's praise - for Linguini.<br/><br/>The rodent is soon captured, and Linguini is ordered to kill it by the Chef (Ian Holm, ""Alien,"" ""Lord of War""). He can't do it, however, and the two make an agreement - Remy will aid Linguini in the preparation of food, and the latter will take credit for it.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of the rat's innate ability to create amazing dishes, Gustaeu's become a popular Paris hot-spot once again. This incites the jealousy of Chef, the anger of Ego and the resentment of Remy's stern pop, who tells his boy never to trust humans. <br/><br/>To complicate things even more, while trying to keep this secret from being discovered, Linguini falls for fellow chef, Collette (Janeane Garofalo).<br/><br/>Soon, though, complications arise, and on the very night Ego intends to visit (and write what he thinks will be another scathing review), Remy's role in the deception is uncovered, causing everyone - including Collette - to walk out of the restaurant.<br/><br/>Will the day be saved? Will Linguini and Collette end up together? And what of Remy and his dreams? Well, you'll have to see the film. To me, this picture elevates the craft, at least as mature storytelling is concerned. This isn't the best Pixar film, but it is certainly one of the most complicated and nuanced.<br/><br/>From the subtle and appropriate musical arrangements to the perfect vocal characterizations to the aforementioned animation (just the lush, sweeping views of Paris at night are worth the price of admission) to the complex tale. No bells and whistles here - it isn't necessary - just a sweet love story (love between friends, family and, of course, a boy and a girl). In addition, the message is no matter what someone looks like on the outside, it's the inner character that counts.<br/><br/>It's a moral that's been told countless times, but ""Ratatouille"" delivers it in a fresh, new and charming way."

","Everyone knew that Paris hotels had the biggest, friendliest and juiciest fleas in the world with whom all tourists fell in love at the first bite. A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference.

","There's no need for praise considering the fact that it's all been said before. What has me puzzled are all of the ""burn scars"". I saw this movie on the fourteenth, my birthday, at the free preview in Manayunk. I'm reading a lot of reviews that talk about burn scars on all of the chef's wrists. As far as I remember, there was no consistency of burns among the chefs. I see figures in random textures, I know that I would have seen them on the other chef's throughout all the times that they expose their hands; such as when the one holds up his killer thumb.<br/><br/>What I did notice was the blatant marks on the woman's wrists when she talks about how to play things safe so as to avoid harming one's self. To an intelligent individual this seems to be an instance of very direct reference to some troubled times in her past that most likely led her to become tough. It is so obvious how this is appropriate for her character and that suicide scars don't mean someone is a cutter as cutters have small slashes in many locations, not just huge scars on the wrists. I've read reviews and saw where some said they were ""worried that her character was a cutter"", as if a little reality would shatter their bubble; and most likely did. As a result we have a great bit of detail meant strictly to be read into by ""mature"" audiences that gets watered down because a bunch of dumb-ass parents,( who probably didn't pick up on the citizen cane references and all of the cultured stuff in general) whined about the possibility of something disturbing to them that they would have to point out to their kids for them to even be phased. I hate censoring, and the dramatic emphasis on her wrists in that scene along with the suggestive dialogue and formulaic persona of the character make it so simply obvious that you would have to be blind or drunk to not pick up on. Then again, some folks think that 100 is high for an IQ. sad world. I hate whiners and I hope your children take to all of those things that you obsess with sheltering them from by putting the burden on other's backs and killing culture instead of actually raising your kids and using your easy bake minds a little better so as to understand and explain to your kids why people do these things and why they are often things that lead up to a person becoming tougher and not just dead as long as they have someone to reach out or something or other. To all of the idiots out there-STOP SCREWING UP OUR CULTURE AND ART BY DILUTING FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COMFORT YOU POLITICALLY CORRECT BASTARDS!!!<br/><br/>PS-try looking into what politically correct really means; fascist and hypocrite are non-PC and it's OK to make fun of the middle east. get your heads out of your asses and stop acting like this lame ass etiquette of Americana makes you righteous and not dumb sheep.

","Uneven, imperfect, illogical (so are all the other Pixar film subjects), and formulaic, but you forget all that as you are quite literally swept into a satisfying conclusion to a fable on the art and business of cooking. Ratatouille resonates in true Pixar style. Don't be surprised if it earns a bushel of nominations and quite possibly a Best Director award (or two).<br/><br/>If Peter O'Toole deserves accolades for his voice characterization, Ian Holm must have been a joy to watch in the recording booth, and at a distance. And twice in the film Brad Garrett had tears coming out of my eyes within a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>I don't know whether to be impressed with, or seriously creeped out by, the staggering photo-reality of Pixar's animation. Way down among the end credits was a ""100% Animation"" logo, ""No Motion Capture Was Used In The Making Of This Film"" or some such. That may have been an inside joke, but starting with The Incredibles I'm convinced Pixar's aiming to make its movies look like—movies!<br/><br/>In this light, I've seen rats up close and personal (don't ask). A rat swarm evokes the most primal of responses, and a wet rat is not in need of compassion. You favor your kids by instructing them after the matinée that these particular rodents are not overgrown field mice, truly don't look or behave like Remy or Emile or talk like Brian Dennehy, and should absolutely not be fed from the hand or even at the end of a very long stick.<br/><br/>I'm past the point of feeling compelled to categorize each Pixar flick as better or worse than its kith, for each manages to be unique regardless, and all pretty much transcend the medium. Suffice it to say some make me laugh louder than a screen full of humans manages to.<br/><br/>But it isn't about the rodents. And that's the trick, folks: It's all fun in the telling."
"Cel_Stacker","6","2","18","29 June 2007"," ""It is about ze food, and zat is really enough to zell it to ze Americans...""
","Remy (Patton Oswalt) was born with the unique gift of deciphering smells and tastes, and marrying the two effectively--a gift any chef would give their apron for. Unfortunately, Remy was also born a rat. When it becomes apparent that his family cannot really appreciate his gift outside of its use in avoiding rat poison, Remy attempts to refine his talents in human kitchens. He even has the guidance of the late, great master chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett) to influence his endeavors. A series of unfortunate events unfolds, and the little rat finds himself in the big city, namely Paris, attempting to prove his talent with the help of hapless kitchen boy Tony Linguini (Lou Romano, Bernie Kropp in ""The Incredibles"") to the most discriminating of palates, including that of tough-as-nails critic Anton Ego (Peter ""The Great"" O'Toole). This is actually a nice piece of storytelling and an even better piece of animation. The environments of Paris and the French countryside are represented in grand scale--Bird's capable team and Pixar's diligent artists even manage to make a sewer look amazing! Meanwhile, you truly get the desperation and inspiration driving some well-designed characters, who are sure to remain memorable. Bird's fans might be a pinch disappointed in this one, though--it doesn't have that breakthrough stance employed so boldly with ""The Iron Giant"" or ""The Incredibles"", although it is nice to see him take on something a little lighter. A few lulls in the pacing make it feel a bit long, and technically, it's probably a little TOO good. It's evident that the Pixar crew did their usual in-depth study on the subjects, and while the rats are designed cute, the sight of millions of them gushing out of kitchens and houses made my skin crawl and took me right back to cult head-turners like ""Ben"" and ""Willard"" (brush up on your film history if you're unfamiliar with those). While far from Bird's or Pixar's finest, it's still a good time, and really a must for those of you (You know who you are!) who truly appreciate food.

","Sorry, guys, but after all the hype this film received as a ""meaty"" animated film, I just can't agree that this will be a ""classic"" or some kind of turning point in animated film. I was bored from beginning to end, except for the scene with Anton Ego and his great speech about the critic's role in life. I mean, who is this film geared toward? Are kids the least bit interested in inside jokes about gourmet food prepared by a rat who wants to be a chef? (Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential,"" with his assertion that most people working in restaurants are ex-criminals, was all over this, of course.) It wasn't amusing or persuasive, and the storyline was entirely predictable and not much of a story anyway. I used to tell myself stories to make myself go to sleep at night about rabbits that wanted to swim like frogs and such--and this feels about as far-fetched and thin. It IS beautiful in its animated effects, of which it is rightfully proud--but maybe this is the problem. The process has taken over the content.

Let's see, we had the batty old lady with the shotgun and the tough but hot chef, and a brief glimpse of a female food critic. Why couldn't there have been some female rats, at least?

","Summary: The other nominess for 2007's best animated feature film must not have been that great then. Despite a promising premise that had the makings of a classic story, the story itself isn't consistent with it's internal logic. This leads to some frustrating and inexplicable moments and contrivances and makes you wonder what exactly the movie's message is. Wonder if the character of Ego made critics afraid of being someone like that. The movie is still enjoyable with some good humour, and a love for food. 
_____________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Although I wasn't too interested in the first few minutes, that changed once the 'imaginary' Gusteau showed up. Coupled with the atmosphere and the premise of a 'ghost' helping a rat and his grandson help each other, I thought it had the promise of becoming quite a classic. However, the inconsistency of the plot with the internal logic of that world led to some really annoying scenes and contrivances. I did however really like the humour and the kitchen dynamics etc until Linguini becomes the owner. My four main issues are - everyone calmly accepting everything Linguini says about rats, Linguini & Colette suddenly being in love, Linguini freaking out over Remy 'stealing' food from a restaurant Linguini owns thanks only to Remy's work and finally, and ambiguous (at best) message. <br/><br/>Despite this being a world where humans have no reason to believe rats can understand them or have any form of intelligence, it does make sense for Linguini to accept it, and it is clear that wasn't an easy feat. However people later on just calmly accept this, instead of questioning Linguini's sanity. Why would Skinner even think the rat was of any importance? A more logical conclusion for them would have been that Linguini is this eccentric chef genius who believes he needs a rat on his head to do his best. That scene where all of Linguini's staff walk out on him, I thought it was because they decided he was off his mind. But . . . they just didn't want to work under a rat? Colette only returns because she remembers 'Anyone can cook', after all. And later Ego also simply accepts this instead of throwing up, on realising his food was somehow made by rats.<br/><br/>Where on earth did the romance come from? They didn't even spend much time together until then?<br/><br/>I simply didn't get the scene where Linguini flips out when Remy 'steals' food from his restaurant. Linguini owed everything he had to Remy. The restaurant might as well be Remy's. I guess they were going for a Linguini getting over-confident and later regretting it arc. Not only is that overly clichÃ©, it is very lazily executed. <br/><br/>Finally, what exactly is the movie's message? 'Anyone can cook'? Linguini sure can't. That humans are being speciesist to rats, and we should instead live in harmony? <br/><br/>I really liked the good parts of the movie, which makes these annoying flaws all the more frustrating, as it prevents me from fully enjoying the movie."

","I think Ratatouille is going to be most enjoyed by the kids and adults who are into cooking. I'm into cooking myself, but I mean SERIOUSLY into cooking, like people who are more interested in the kitchen of a fancy restaurant than in the food. The premise is pretty silly, a rat living in the sewers under the streets of Paris unwittingly discovers a talent for cooking that some of the most highly trained human chefs can't seem to attain, so he befriends a young boy, the garbage boy at the restaurant (who might remind you of young Wart from Sword in the Stone) and basically uses him as a puppet so he can get access to the kitchen. You see, other people working in the kitchen at fancy restaurants don't want a disease-infested rodent as a colleague, so there have to be some secrets. <br/><br/>Needless to say, a lot of bizarre situations follow, as is to be expected when you have a rat controlling the head chef at a famous restaurant by hiding under his hat and pulling his hair.

The combination of the duo's talents allows them to take on the world.<br/><br/>The film is exciting and fast-paced, never leaving its audience bored. Remy's journey from the attic the countryside to the kitchen in one of the most famous restaurants in Paris will keep you entertained the whole way through. Its use of a combination of color, sound, and visuals to represent taste was unique. Whenever a flavor appears on screen, the viewer can almost taste it as they watch. Bright colors bring out the beauty of the environment around the characters, especially in the kitchen. The different foods pop off of the screen while the people preparing them seem to be creating art. <br/><br/>As is the case with every Pixar movie, Ratatouille was once again a completely different film from the Studio's other projects. Ratatouille is a fantastic film that will leave the whole family entertained."

","This film tells the story of Remy, a rat who want to cook. In order to do so, he decides to ally with a young but incompetent cook. Directed by Jan Pinkava and Brad Bird, which also provides the script, it has voice actors like Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole and Patton Oswalt.<br/><br/>This film is good, but it would have never been able to stand out without its adorable protagonist. The script works well, but is more complex than usual in children's films, which makes it more appealing to older audiences (from nine or ten years). The voice actors are good and have done a work without errors, as well as the animators, who filled with realism each scene. Designed for fun, it doesn't seek to convey great moral maxims and has scenes able to get the audience to tears of laughter. The soundtrack fulfills her role without stand out.<br/><br/>Fun in the ideal measure, a little more adult than usual, original and captivating, this film will probably stay in the memory for having one of the most visually lovable characters of modern animated films."
"greg-e-porter","9","0","1","29 July 2016"," Ratatouille is a wonderful Pixar movie that I would recommend to anyone especially if one enjoys food.
","Ratatouille opens with an exposition describing the late, fictional celebrity chef Gusteau (Garrett) whose motto was ""Anyone can cook."" We cut to our protagonist; a rat named Remy (Oswalt). Remy is gifted with an advanced sense of smell which teaches him to appreciate the food that he eats. He'd rather not eat garbage when there is a whole culinary world around him. In his attempts to get some basic spices, he stumbles upon a cooking show featuring the aforementioned chef. Before he knows it, Remy finds himself in Paris. Exploring a little further, he makes his way to Gusteau's restaurant. He watches, with hungry eyes, the creations of the master chefs. Remy crosses paths with the recently hired garbage boy, Linguini (Romano). The pair team up; Linguini will be the human representative of the two, while Remy provides the culinary direction.<br/><br/>Ratatouille isn't too dissimilar from the dish of the same name. Ratatouille (the dish) is a bunch of vegetables, cooked together and baked. It's simple but it can be delicious. In Ratatouille we follow the smallest of characters, a rat, in his quest to do what he dreams; to cook. There are so many wonderful decisions even with the basic premise. Consider the idea of simply cooking. It's something we can all relate to because even if the audience doesn't like to cook per se, who doesn't like food? We can follow Remy's quest and imagine tasting his creations. And even the desire to cook is attainable for anyone in the audience. It just takes practice to get a sense of the mechanics, aromas, and flavors. Indeed, ""anyone can cook"" and Ratatouille makes the ordinary that much more magical.<br/><br/>The music of Ratatouille is phenomenal (I'm listening to the theme song ""Le Festin"" by Camille as I write). Some of the characters, particularly Linguini, teeter on goofy which I'm not the biggest fan of but they are so darn endearing it's OK. The graphics are, of course, incredible. Early in the film, Remy goes down a raging river and the water effects are amazing, even by today's standards and this came out in 2008.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend Ratatouille. I've seen it several times and it's always been a lot of fun. It's accessible to everyone too so it's a great family movie. I hope you see Ratatouille and enjoy it as much as I have. This is, of course, assuming you haven't seen it a number of times already."

Not having seen this film since it was out in cinemas NINE YEARS AGO, I could only remember bits and pieces, so it was nice to come back and watch the whole thing almost as if it was the first time. There were a few humorous elements that would've gone over my head as a young kid and now knowing who the voice cast actually are is a treat. The best part of this movie was the finale, starting from when the rats took over the kitchen - man, not only was it comedy gold but that's the kind of ending all films need to have. It was funny, it was tense and, surprisingly, emotional."
"rzajac","10","0","1","18 June 2016"," It's perfect!
","Ratatouille is an exceptional product, from production to mythic payload. The voice acting is fantastic, and the animation work is painstaking and engaging to view.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the myth. Ratatouille is a fun depiction of genius. Sure, it's more than a little cartoonish, but that's more than forgivable: True genius doesn't take itself too seriously either.<br/><br/>It's simply a well-wrought story with great character studies. The characters alone are an embarrassment of riches.<br/><br/>One of the astounding things about the story of Ratatouille is that it cleverly avoids one of the all-too-common, cop-out, standard-issue karmic machinations: (Here comes the modest spoiler) Most narrative products of this sort feel they have to find a way to dump on the ""heavy"" (""bad"" guy), and this can even sometimes feel gratuitous.<br/><br/>Ratatouille not only refrains from this easy out, it goes one further and fully redeems the heavy. It shows, in a believable way, that ""he wasn't bad, just misunderstood""; and had been so, for a long, long time. His exposure to true genius fulfills a deep and genuine need-- and this sets him right again. This was unexpected and enormously refreshing to see in a ""pop"" narrative product. This highlights a light-on-his-feet/turn-on-a-dime openness on the part of Brad Bird as narrator/director.<br/><br/>Check it out!"
"antoniokowatsch","10","0","1","17 June 2016"," A True Masterpiece
","Ratatouille is easily one of the best Disney/Pixar movies. The only other animated movie which comes close in terms of overall quality is Frozen. One of the ironic things is that one of the main themes of the movie is the critique of criticism itself (I'm alluding to the ending monologue of Mr. Ego). It has so many facets which ultimately make the movie truly interesting/remarkable: a rat with an identity crisis, a vengeful ex-employer a.k.a. the arch-enemy, a ghastly looking food critic named Anton Ego, a supportive rat family, Linguini's conflict of heart and the fact that he's leading a double-life are just some of the reasons why I decided to give this movie a 10/10. I didn't expect the movie to be this good but it suffices to say that I'm glad that I gave it a watch."

","The late Auguste Gusteau was the best chef in Paris. He wrote a cooking book for everyone which is dismissed by snooty food critic Anton Ego. Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat with impeccable tastes. He is also dismissed by his patriarchal father until he is discovered to be able to taste for poison. He becomes the clan's poison detector. He is still unhappy with eating garbage. After stealing the Gusteau cookbook, he gets separated from the family and arrives at late Gusteau's failing restaurant in Paris. Linguini is the new garbage boy. Linguini ruins the soup and Remy fixes it to new heights for a critic. Linguini is given the credit. With Remy's help, the garbage boy becomes one of the best chef in the kitchen. Skinner was Gusteau's sous chef and is the beneficiary in his will except Linguini may be Gusteau's love child.<br/><br/>Brad Bird and company have cooked up a nice stew of traditional animated fare. Remy is an appealing protagonist. The message is good. The animation is impeccable. Pixar delivers something very traditional from a less than traditional source. The only change I would do is have Remy wash his hands more. There is an aversion to rats when dealing with food. The movie needs to alleviate some of that hesitation. After all, Remy goes everywhere including the sewer."

","Ratatouille is simply another Pixar movie that I have had for a while but have re-watched only recently, and it's still as exciting an experience as trying new French foods. The animation depicts the setting very well, and the characters move quite fluidly and realistically. The story has plenty of original twists on the dreaming chef (or two) and features some cleverly executed jokes. The characters act with purpose and will keep your eyes glued to the screen, and the voice acting is some of the... I won't say best, but the casting was nothing short of precise. And to think that some people consider this among the worse Pixar movies, right down there with the Cars films and A Bug's Life. This was a film meant to please critics, and being the highest rated animated movie on Metacritic, I don't see why audiences don't enjoy it as well. Sure, there are a small handful of moments that drag, but I was affected pretty hard by this film. Specifically, I was encouraged, as my 6-year-old self, to be a risk-taker with cuisine and become more tolerant about it, helping me to discover several more killer dishes from around the world. Your children will appreciate this movie, and you will, too."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","13 April 2016"," The Cook is a Rat, his Cooking is an Art...
","While in the past, an imposing belly was the sign of good wealth, today: the poorer, the fatter.<br/><br/>Indeed, good and healthy taste, in our junk/frozen/industrialized-food consuming society, became a luxury. This might explain the success of cooking-related TV programs, the sight of an appetizing meal is as rewarding to our senses as if it was eaten. Some surrender to bad food, out of laziness, those who don't learn to cook and are rewarded by the certitude that they'll always eat well, in total respect to their tastes and their stomachs.<br/><br/>But can anyone cook? <br/><br/>The question is raised in Disney Pixar's animated movie ""Ratatouille"", released in 2007, and it's as serious and defining as a problem in a high school essay. Everything in the film subtly relates to that simple question. Is the required discipline and dedicated available to the common mortal? The film doesn't provide answers, it's too adult for that, it just gratifies us with two great characters and let us figure out for ourselves. Of course, the most important and fascinating one is that blue rat, Remy, whose dream is to become a chef. The title ""Ratatouille"" is very well chosen as it plays on the word 'rat' and an iconic French meal, it also contributes to one of the most original climactic moments for any film.<br/><br/>Remy is a fascinating character, even by Pixar standards, contrarily to many usual leads, his goal isn't conditioned by a specific mission, limited to the film's time-frame. This is a rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell that was first used in order to detect poison. But later, RÃ©my felt he had a gift, he could recognize good food and from that, could learn about cooking. His idol is Chef Gusteau, a French cook whose motto was ""anyone can cook"". Remy used to watch him on a TV belonging to the old lady (whose house served as a refuge to the rats' colony) until discovering the chef died a long ago because of a scathing critic from Anton Ego who was probably to food what Pauline Kael was to the movies. This is a rather dark moment in the film where it's impossible not to believe the chef committed suicide, this is no joke in France as previous chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after losing one star is the fear Michelin Guide, the book whose effects can either be beneficial or disastrous.<br/><br/>But it's still a Disney film and not to discomfort young viewers, Gusteau is resurrected in Remy's imagination. After escaping from the old lady's gunshots, his family vanishes in the sewer while he floats on the cooking book and maybe hallucinating out of hunger, discusses with the illustrated Gusteau (who's like 'Ghosto' all through the film). Remy wonders if anyone can cook as the chef pretends. But he actually gives another meaning to the question, it's not ""can anyone cook, even an amateur?"" but ""can anyone cook, even a rat?"" Remy will prove that, even as a rat, he can cook to perfection because he belongs to the category of gifted people who take cooking seriously. And he's immediately gotten the opportunity to prove his talent by fixing a soup almost spoiled by a new sous-chef hired in Gusteau's restaurant.<br/><br/>Linguini is a lanky and awkward boy in his early twenties, he's hired by Gusteau's former sous-chef, a diminutive and sneaky-looking cook named Skinner. When he accidentally spills the soup and blindly drops ingredients in it, Remy manages to fix it, and the soup catches the attention of a prestigious critic. It's a matter of time before Linguini and Remy discover that they can communicate, and Remy becomes to Linguini what Cyrano was to Christian, a Ghost cook, so to speak, managing to guide his body in order to cook the perfect food. This is also a nice pretext to some of the film's best visual gags, the most explicit manifestations of slapstick and visual humor in a rather serious film. The smallness and fastness of Remy, the nonchalant and thin silhouette of Linguini creates great interaction, but it's the complicity between the two that drive the story.<br/><br/>The second act allows us to discover that Linguini is Gusteau's unknown son and is likely to inherit the restaurant, which gives Skinner a status of clear antagonist. Meanwhile, a conventional romance develops between Linguini and Colette, the only female chef of the team (made of very interesting characters) and I think there was enough relationships in the film, Remy and his brother and father and even Linguini to really make us care for the romance. The crew was made of intriguing and interesting guys but their under-use didn't come as a surprise given how RÃ©my and Linguini formed a solid pair. Colette was a colorful and interesting character on her own but she didn't need to be in love with Linguini to help him. So, the film loses its track until a fantastic climax whose merit is not to rely on the traditional confrontation of good vs. evil.<br/><br/>Anton Ego, tastes a piece of 'ratatouille' and lives a wonderful Madeleine Proust episode. In a way, this Madeleine moment makes the film's point about cook, it's an emotional connection, we love food that reminds us of something. I'll never forget the first tiramisu I ate, the best and I couldn't find the same taste. Food is something that revives emotions, mostly positive, it can indeed draw a smile in your face, and this is the power of ""Ratatouille"", it's inspirational on countless levels.<br/><br/>I can imagine a kid dreaming of being a cook thanks to ""Ratatouille"", which is a serious vocation-inspiring film, but supposing Gusteau was wrong and not anyone can cook, then I hope the film's beautiful story will inspired kids to dream of being capable to bring the same joy and happiness to people by doing something with as dedication, love and passion as Remy."

","Ratatouille follows the story of a rat named Remy, with big dreams, ambition and courage. A rat who is bored of eating scraps out of the garbage and dreams of mixing flavours of fresh food to create better tastes! In Paris he discovers a world famous restaurant where he can't help but improve an awful pot of soup by adding his own flavours! The garbage/cleaner boy is accused of interfering with the soup which everybody now loves and is forced to repeat his recipe. This is where Remy the rat comes into play, sitting within the boys hat and instructing him on how to be a good chef!<br/><br/>Personally I wouldn't say that Ratatouille is one of Pixar's t most impressive films, this is due to the constant high standard of content they produce, but it is significantly better than your average animated movie. It contains all the ingredients that a Pixar movie should; it's funny, cute, heart-warming, creative and contains all the appropriate values and messages you would expect. It contains all the clichÃ©s that we have come to expect from animated movies but this isn't something that I can mark this movie down on, it certainly didn't discourage my opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>The settings created are beautiful, the landscapes, alleyways and canals of France, plus the accents of the characters are realistic and believable. The choreography is also very impressive, especially the kitchen scenes; they are very well created and flow perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend Ratatouille if you haven't already seen it, like the vast majority of Pixar movies, it is a film for all ages!<br/><br/>8/10"

","ï»¿Animated movies targeted towards children can be a lot of things. Artful. Immersive. Deep. Breath-taking. And in some, or even many of these areas, they can be better than the majority or even all of the movies directed towards adults. Yes, there are some things that they cannot do that 'adult'-oriented movies can. But there are just as many things that the latter category can't do and only the former can.<br/><br/>It is because of this that I laugh at people who don't want to see these movies that they consider 'too childish.' If you don't want to see these films, fine. But don't' act like it makes you cooler or more mature. Because it doesn't. It only leaves more empty seats at the theatre for people like me to stretch out in. We all have a phase where we vehemently hate everything from our childhood. But the better of us grow out of that phase. I did so before I learned how to drive a car. If those fools want to see the immature ones, they would only need a mirror.<br/><br/>Okay. Rant over. But do check out C.S. Lewis' quote on this. I've linked to it right here if you're interested. I'm not a big fan of his but that quote is perfect.<br/><br/>Because I believe in what I've said above, I have watched many good child-friendly animated movies. And I am a more creative person for it. But as much as they have offered, this one right here, Ratatouille, a movie about a rat that learns to cook, is the first one that I consider profound.<br/><br/>Bird has always had a penchant for things of this sort. The Incredibles had a lot to say about the state of the world today and the standards of boring mediocrity society forces upon us. But in profoundness, this film goes above it, particularly in the last ten minutes. Oh, those last ten minutes. They are like drops of milk falling from a luscious tree made out of honey. While The Incredibles is probably a better-written film on the whole, those last minutes of Ratatouille are some of my favorites in all of film.<br/><br/>I am talking primarily, of course, about the speech given by the man who for most of the movie could be considered the film's primary antagonist. As you know if you've read all of my other reviews, I am a bigger fan of speeches in film than I probably have a right to be considering that film is and should be primarily a visual medium. And this is one of the best speeches I have ever heard in a movie. It hits especially strong if you are a critic like I.<br/><br/>And don't just take my word for it. Almost every critic that I've seen, from the greats like Ebert to more recent reviewers, like the NC, has said that this speech hit them in a powerful place in their heart. Bird (who also wrote the screenplay to the extent that such matters) manages to 'get' critics more than some critics 'get' themselves. Kudos to him for that. I tip my hat to you, Mr. Bird. It is a 'drop the mic and walk out' moment.<br/><br/>If nothing else, see the movie just for that speech. Yes, you could read the transcript or catch a clip- and you should do such if you don't have time to watch the movie- but it has more impact if you've seen the whole movie and are emotionally primed.<br/><br/>I would be tempted to put this film in my top 100 for that speech alone. Yes, that would not be such a great critical decision, but I operate above all else on my emotions. Thankfully for my (minimal) critical reputation, there is more than enough else in this movie to justify it being there.<br/><br/>This movie is stirring to the two of the five senses most involved with movie watching: sight and hearing. The colors are soft and as flowing as the heart of artistry itself and is backed up by lighting that is romantic in every sense of the word. When Remy (the rat) first gets out of his sewer and is amazed by Paris, we are too. If they used the picture of the Eiffel Tower in this movie for its description in the travel guides, even more people would come to Paris.<br/><br/>This is visual storytelling at its best, as well as the diametric opposite of those movies where you are supposed to insert yourself into the slot of a personality-less 'hero.' Unlike in those movies (examples of which include the Twilight movies and any serious movie with Keanu Reeves in the lead role), the character is not a skin that you put on. They are a close friend that you are sharing a deep moment with.<br/><br/>The score is something out of a xenophilic seventeen year-old girl's deepest fantasies about France. I mean that in the best way possible. The atmospheric, intimate, ambient sounds that we in our moments of greatest wanderlust associate with The City of Love and Lights and with Paris in general are on full display here. This film is a love letter to Paris through and through. Though it may not take the place of an actual trip to the city, it certainly is a fitting compliment.<br/><br/>It can be argued that Pixar from 1999-2010 was on the greatest run in cinematic history. They certainly were on the most creative run ever. This film is arguably the best movie of that run and unarguably the one most representative of it. They understood, and here I paraphrase that speech at the end of the film, that not every film can be great, but a great film can come from anywhere."

"sharky_55","9","0","1","14 June 2015"," Anyone can cook
","And a great artist can come from anywhere. It's the sort of motto only Pixar would take to mean an anthropomorphic genius cooking rat. But animation needs these types of crazy premises because there is so much potential in the medium. It's Paris, France however where Ratatouille takes place. The lover's city, one of the most beautiful in the world, and yet that famed shot of the Eiffel Tower is used sparingly to great effect. Most of this film takes place in one kitchen, that of the recently deceased Auguste Gusteau. The vibrant and lively animation from Pixar studios is on in full force here. More than a million hairs animated for the lead character of Remy the rat, but that's not even the best part of it. His character design is full of human mannerisms which add so much to the rodent voiced by Patton Oswald: shrugs, finger guns, running skids, rubbing his hands together and waving to waft in the aromas of French cuisine. Which brings me to another of the film's many strengths; the animation brings the kitchen of a world class restaurant to life. Bunches of spice, fat cloves of garlic, thick ringlets of white onion, a bubbling brimming pot of soup, crunchy clusters of grapes, huge wheels of cheese, even a simple aromatic omelette. Readers of Brian Jacques and George RR Martin know exactly the feeling. Rataouille is a mouthwatering delight equally for those microwave masters and fine dining connoisseurs. <br/><br/>Michael Giacchino delivers an charming and delightful score that never oversteps throughout. It accelerates when it needs to; most notably in the first ascension of Remy to the surface where he creeps throughout the various floorboards and roofs of Paris, racing past fighting lovers and dinner parties and dogs to a frantic yet whimsical flute tune. He climbs higher and higher and the music swells and gently floats as he reaches the top for the first time, the bright lights of Paris and the Eiffel glittering in front of our eyes. A very beautiful scene. This sort of contrast is again seen when Remy is attempting to escape the kitchen. It's the same theme as before, only this time even faster paced, heavier and more menacing as he dodges fiery ovens and knives and gigantic boots. The orchestra builds to a climax and then abruptly switches to a pleasant strings version of ""Le Festin"" as the cart breaches the boundary between dining and cooking. The sound design is particularly exceptional in this scene in creating and contrasting the frying, banging and chopping of the kitchen to the wonderful ambiance of the dining area. You could almost close your eyes and follow the themes just as easily. And of course Camille's performance of ""Le Festin"" during a montage in the middle is absolutely wonderful. It's in the alluring language of French but it's not hard to decipher the meanings it conjures: of love and romance, of good food and celebration, of life as a feast to admire and devour. <br/><br/>The voice-acting is another top notch dimension of the film. Patton Oswald is perfect as the ever inquisitive and spirited Remy. His narration is so natural and well-fitting that only a few lines seem overdone; in some revelations it's unnecessary, such is the amount of subtext and information contained in the animation of Remy's gestures and expressions. Brad Garrett's experience shines in his portrayal as the jovial and larger-than-life Gusteau, stealing every scene and figment of imagination he appears in. Ratatouille is filled with so many similarly rich characters which combine with the voice acting and animation to create a living breathing world. Lou Romano's over-exaggerated screams and stutters fit perfectly with his character design of a bumbling human marionette, flustered, clueless and over-enthusiastic yet possessing heart. And who gives a more menacing performance than veteran Peter O'Toole, as the scathing British food critic Anton Ego (probably could have come up with a better name). He lives a life of disappointment despite his love of food, bouncing from restaurant to restaurant in search of some well-seasoned perspective. He gets more than that in a blast from the past with his first mouthful of the so-called peasant dish of Ratatouille; a loud rush of nostalgia as we flash back to his childhood, a modest hut bathed in the warm afternoon soon, filled with an ethereal glow, a boy tucking in to a homely afternoon meal. Even without the slow motion drop of the pen we know exactly what Ego is experiencing. His face creases up in delight. There's not even a word to describe it: just an audible mmmmhm from a mouth used to spitting out harsh criticism. Even Skinner at the other table can't hold it back when he tastes the dish. It's an extremely evocative and poignant scene that sits up there with Pixar's best.<br/><br/>There's no need for O'Toole's voice-over in that moment; in fact it might have diminished it's significance. It's later heard in a voice-over of his review of that meal. It's the perfect bookend to a film about new expectations and ambitions. Remy's humble origins don't hold him back from attaining greatness in the face of a city that mostly disdains pests like him. It's not the most complicated plot but it's one that is lifted from the simple framework of a young character aspiring to be more into a lavish and memorable story about an unlikely genius. The screenplay is simple yet almost never bloated (the romantic angle being one slightly forced arc). The animation, voice-acting and score all play their part in this heart-warming film which, like Ego, leaves you hungry for more."

","I could go on for hours about the delights of Ratatouille. The animation is superb, the vocals flawless, the script witty, the central dilemma between family ties and the pursuit of excellence subtly handled. Its jokes (all of them brilliant), its conflict (all of it rousing), its every move springs from this simple fact: Ratatouille has heart. <br/><br/>Wisely returning to form after the lackluster Cars, the story is delightfully ludicrous. Born with an acute sense of smell and taste, young Remy, a Parisian rat (Patton Oswalt) squirms at the idea of eating moldy crusts and soggy table scraps. He's acquired a taste for the finer things largely thanks to his favorite gastronome Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), who's crafted a career and a five-star establishment from his copy written tagline: ""Anyone can cook!"" His sole pleasure is food and he dreams of culinary glory working as a fine French chef, but needs a front man who won't cause screams in the kitchen. He soon hooks up with the timid scullery hand Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy with no noticeable gustatory talent who's willing to play puppet to Remy's puppeteer in order to keep his job and, secretly, to pursue a pretty sous-chef. Out to nail the new mystery chef is a pallid, joyless food critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) who is irate that an establishment he has relegated to the lower echelons is making a comeback.<br/><br/>Verging on the surreal - if not downright psychedelic - Ratatouille takes place in a highly believable universe that looks and behaves a lot like our own. In the world of Ratatouille, as in ours, rats are gross, humans are boss and cross-species tolerance is a dream. But Brad Bird gives us the most distasteful setup imaginable – Rats in the kitchen! Not only touching the food, but preparing it - and turns it around into something absolutely delectable. You expect kitchen slapstick; you get something that's closer to kitchen ballet, with food so seductively animated you can tell stale bread from fresh. More than that, you get a story with real strum and a lot of heart. Patton Oswalt lends a certain degree of vulnerability and sympathy to the main character, and the supporting cast of Brad Garrett and John Ratzenberger fill out the film well. Peter O'Toole is sublimely sneering as the ominous food critic Anton Ego. <br/><br/>Ratatouille is an intricate dish, infused with energetic and amusing story lines that are all fully cooked and complementary to the film's rich visual look. Bring your hardiest appetite. Ratatouille is immensely satisfying!"

","Remy is a member of a large family of rats (a horde, I think, is the word) who ply the trash cans and sewers of a Parisian suburb, just like good rats should. ""Eat your garbage!"" commands Remy's father, who obviously doesn't come off as a loving parent. The rats are evicted from their cozy home in a cottage-kitchen ceiling in a scene that will have rat-haters in the audience cringing ), and they are swept through the sewers in a torrential flood. Remy washes up near the river, in view of the most famous restaurant in tout le France. This is the establishment of Auguste Gusteau, author of the best-seller Anyone Can Cook. <br/><br/>Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) has always been blessed, or cursed, with a refined palate and a sensitive nose, and now he starts skulking around the kitchen of Gusteau, his culinary hero (voice of Brad Garrett). Alas, when the monstrous food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) issues a scathing indictment of Gusteau's recent cooking, the chef dies in a paroxysm of grief or perhaps it is not a paroxysm, but I like the word, and the kitchen is taken over by the sniveling little snipe Skinner (Ian Holm). Lowest of the low is Gusteau's ""nephew"" Linguini (Lou Romano), who must be hired, but is assigned to the wretched job of plongeur -- literally, one who washes the dishes by plunging them into soapy water.<br/><br/>Linguini and Remy meet, somehow establish trust and communication, and when Linguini gets credit for a soup that the rat has saved with strategic seasonings, they team up. Remy burrows into Linguini's hair, is concealed by his toque, can see through its transparent sides and controls Linguini by pulling on his hair as if each tuft were a joystick. Together, they astonish Paris with their genius.<br/><br/>All of this begins as a dubious premise and ends as a triumph of animation, comedy, imagination and, yes, humanity. What is most lovable about Remy is his modesty and shyness, even for a rat. He has body language so expressive than many humans would trade for it. His eye for detail is remarkable. Every prop and utensil and spice and ingredient in the kitchen is almost tangible, and I for one would never turn off the Food Channel if Remy hosted a program named ""Any Rat Can Cook.""<br/><br/>I will not dare give away the ending of this movie; in my opinion, this is the perfect ending to a fantastic movie. It's heart-warming, funny, clever, and the ending monologue is very thought provoking. This is clearly one of the best animated films ever. Every time an animated film is successful, you have to read all over again about how animation isn't ""just for children"" but ""for the whole family,"" and ""even for adults going on their own."" No kidding!"

","At first, many might simply take this as a crazy film where a rat cooks food with cliché french characters. But it is so much more for those who feel trapped outside the kitchen where they believe they belong. <br/><br/>Pixar's team have something extra ordinary in making these films. It's nothing to do with the clarity of visuals, the fast pace of the character development, the crystal clear audio or the jokes at sophisticated level that makes cartoons more introspective & emotionally valuable than other films. It's the stories they tell that makes them so powerful. And this particular title is NO exception. <br/><br/>This film throws SO many punches at your soul. And maybe I'm just on my own here, but by the end of it, I am a quivery mess of tears & memories. <br/><br/>I can relate to the outcast dilemma of being hopeful when surrounded by mundane people who take pride in making you feel like some sort of traitor for setting dreams as a paramount pursuit. The burning relentless torture of that desire to create, as though art runs through your veins. And the inherent loneliness you submerge yourself into by perpetuating these thoughts. It doesn't matter that he's a rat. I feel his pain as though it were my own. <br/><br/>I can relate straight away to the young boy, desperate to find a job, a home, a family & reach for a purpose that might offer an argument to an otherwise pointless life. It's helped with slapstick to easy the load off of my mind! But not for long, because then we see a modern day brotherhood between unsuspecting friends whose opposing circumstances in life doesn't stop them from relying on each other. <br/><br/>However, these are mere flee bitings compared with the next real life comparisons. Living up to your farther's reputation & expectations can be an impossible struggle. We have the girl who walks out on the boy, but who actually comes back - a rare breed these days! But nothing wrenched my heart out as much as the final scene where something made with love reminds the critic of the love & the memory of his mother & her cooking. Our senses are so much more than tools for perception. Inside every human is a wealth of happy memories we all look back on with a certain amount of sadness & nostalgia, & every so often we are reminded of these people that mean so much to us that they are a part of us. Something as infinitesimal as tasting a piece of food can relate to a thousand memories we strive to keep locked up. <br/><br/>This film & others by the Pixar Disney team open the flood gates to these fundamental emotions & let us revel in them so we can remember the most important experiences in our lives. <br/><br/>Others can talk about the visuals, & the voice acting & all that. But for me, this story cracked me open like an egg, scrambled my emotions, & dish me up a side helping of laughter too! <br/><br/>My only complaint would be that it had to end at one point."

The music too complements the screenplay and thats why I believe academy has awarded them with Oscars.<br/><br/>Many things can be learnt from this, how defiance helps even when the chips are down, how selfishness to have the best quality to one self in turn may help others but ultimately it satisfies because it's done for self and not for others.

","Ratatouille (/rætəˈtuːiː/; French pronunciation: ​[ʁatatuj]) is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was co-written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title refers to a French dish, ""ratatouille"", which is served at the end of the film, and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a rôtisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.<br/><br/>Development of Ratatouille began in 2001 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, Bird was approached to direct the film and revised the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animations used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at Thomas Keller's French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film. Ratatouille premiered on June 22, 2007 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California, and had its general release on June 29, 2007 in the United States. The film grossed $623.7 million at the box office and received critical acclaim. The film later won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, among other honors."

","It is usual to expect PIXAR Animation Studios to churn out meaningful animation entertainers. Once again they have cemented this belief, by presenting RATATOUILLE (pronounced RAT-A-TOO-EE).<br/><br/>RATATOUILLE trailers were first showcased during PIXAR's previous CARS shows in cinemas. This did generate the interest in this venture among the film goers. The first word remark about the movie -> FUNTASTIC!<br/><br/>PIXAR Animation Studio seems to be getting better at animation technology, with the 'world' in its films' canvas closer to the actual world. Adding to this technical brilliance, the characterization and handling of the emotions, which has been a forte of both PIXAR and Walt Disney Pictures makes this movie, as I see it, a better one than its predecessor CARS. CARS, though a brilliant work of imagination, did not connect with me as much as RATATOUILLE due to its lack of the 'HUMAN' factor. But with RATATOUILLE, it is the perfect combination of IMAGINATION, EMOTIONS, MESSAGE, and CHARACTERIZATION that makes it for me a better fare than the splendid CARS.<br/><br/>I am not going to talk about the plot or its characters. It is a thing to be experienced. I am blogging this to express my astonishment and excitement over the animation film. Some people have dubbed it, without watching the film, as an 'Animation film for the children'. Trust me, its not. It's for everyone. This is one more feather in PIXAR's hat, having made a genre that was thought to be for the children reach out to all age groups.<br/><br/>This week, if you have decided to watch a movie, watch RATATOUILLE, at a cinema near you. If it's not running at a cinema near your place, wait till November 2007 to buy the original DVD and watch it. But make sure, YOU WATCH THIS ONE.."

Also, I really licked how the rat's guide was like an illusion for him since he was already dead and wasn't real become it made it see like he was thinking to himself and arguing with himself of what to do but they showed him talking to a chef that was dead like he was talking to the rat and giving him advice, which I thought was really cool."

","It seems the Disney/Pixar alliance can do no wrong. Ratatouille brings typically slick animation and marries it to a sweet little story- with injections of subtle and not-so-subtle humour along the way.<br/><br/>Remy is instantly likable as the rat who dreams of being a chef- Linguini is equally likable, as the well-meaning but bumbling young man who doesn't realise that he is in fact the rightful owner of the restaurant he works for. Anton Ego is cold and fierce as the 'villain', although Skinner (the head chef following the death of Gusteau, the original owner and Linguini's father) is the main, yet incompetent, bad guy.<br/><br/>Add in a love interest for Linguini in the form of Colette (which frustrates Remy no end), and you have a neat little film.

"Tweekums","8","0","2","4 June 2012"," Remy the Rat wants to be a chef
","Having enjoyed several other Pixar films; The Toy Story Trilogy, Wall-E and The Incredibles, I was keen to see this when it was on television recently, and while I don't think it was quite as good as those it was entertaining and as one would expect from Pixar it was beautifully animated.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of Remy the rat; he isn't any old rat though; he has a nose for the finest foods and has even learnt how to cook from watching the great chef Auguste Gusteau on television. One day he is forced to flee from his rural home and is separated from his family in the sewers; when he climbs out he finds himself in the heart of Paris within sight of his hero's restaurant. When he looks through the window he sees garbage boy Linguini making some additions to the soup; realising the soup is being ruined he sneaks in and adds a few touches of his own... the soup is served to a critic and is a triumph... which doesn't please Skinner, the chef who took over after Gusteau died. Linguini is told he must make it again... something he can't do until he meets Remy. Being a rat Remy can't talk but they find a way to communicate and his cooking gets more and more popular; of course he can't tell anybody who is really doing the cooking! While this is going on we have a romantic subplot involving Linguini and Chef Colette, Skinner worrying that Linguini may be the rightful heir to Gusteau's restaurant and a visit from a famous critic who caused the establishment to loose one of its stars on his last visit.<br/><br/>At almost two hours in length this did feel a little bit too long but not hugely so; the story was enjoyably and provided a decent number of laughs; largely from the deliberately unlikeable Skinner; although I suspect the biggest laughs for younger viewers will come from Remy's method of controlling Linguini. As well as laughs there were plenty of thrills, although none too scary; it is rated 'U' after all. The animation is absolutely stunning with the virtual camera moving in ways that gives shots that would be almost impossible in a live action film. As mentioned before this film is rated 'U' but that doesn't mean only children will enjoy it; there is plenty here to entertain viewers of all ages."
"Lejink","8","0","2","7 April 2012"," Rat in mi kitchen
","This has to be one of Pixar's finest and funniest features to date. While even now,I struggle to get my head fully around enjoying a film where a kitchen is invaded by rats to the extent that they at one point prepare and serve all the food in a top restaurant, even my natural hygienic revulsion was overcome in the end. What next, a playful killer shark with ideas on how to boost tourism at a holiday resort or a friendly viper who helps weed the garden...?<br/><br/>Anyway, the setting of Paris gives the studio the chance to, in more ways than one, broaden its horizons, with new, funny characterisations, French locations and also interiors, from a five-star restaurant and its working kitchen to Linguini's shabby (later luxurious) Eiffel Tower-facing apartment. The storytelling skill and joke-count are as high as ever, but for me it's the detail in the art-work which impresses most.<br/><br/>Of course, being an animated feature, means that the director can take a shot from any vantage point, but even so I was frequently surprised by the sheer audacity of some of the set-ups and edits which certainly kept me interested and helped the movie negotiate its sometimes tricky dual-plot line format. The film at first seems to reach a natural ending prematurely with the initial success of Linguini (and Remy) so that the coda of their having to convert the sternest critic in Paris could have seemed contrived and padded but the single scene where he's won over is probably the best in the movie and justifies the extra half-hour for the more muted but still happy ending.<br/><br/>I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voice-overs in cartoon films (give the work to jobbing actors!) but even I enjoyed Peter O'Toole's star turn as the glacial critic who turns, but in truth he's no better than the rest of the cast in giving life to their pixilated creations. <br/><br/>Being a Disney film, of course there has to be an element of playing to the young and so we get the usual sub-plot pitting a sort of bad-guy head-chef against our hero and the usual pick-and-mix of uplifting morals for all, but it's none too blatant and never a distraction.<br/><br/>In short, this was a highly entertaining family feature, although I personally pity the parents of young children who on seeing this film will be pestered to buy them a pet rat for their birthday or Christmas!"

When he makes an unusual alliance with a restaurant's new garbage boy, the culinary and personal adventures begin despite Remy's family's skepticism and the rat-hating world of humans.<br/><br/>Pixar has spoiled our minds with the most creative movies to date. Talking toys, a movie about monsters, talking cars, a family of superheros, a robot, and an old man. Yes, all of these expand childhood and create new experiences for us. But a rat who loves to cook? Outdone. This movie is one of Pixar's best and of course you don't need to be a kid to love it. The voice acting is great and real as in every other one of their projects. The animation is fantastic and you need to see it in Blu-Ray to get the full effect. And the soundtrack is nice; with a French touch. Everything about this film is great and Pixar has NEVER failed at movie making (not including Cars 2, that of which I have not seen.) I cannot wait to see what they will come up with next and I'm sure it'll be just as amazing as this. 8/10."

","Remy looks like an average rat but he is armed with an amazing sense of smell and a passionate desire for cooking perfection. His talents and a stroke of bad luck send him on an adventure across France where, with help from clumsy garbage cleaner Skinner his cooking talents and morals are put to the test.<br/><br/>'Ratatouille' is a Disney film and was animated by Pixar. Compared to previous productions such as 'Toy Story' and 'The Incredibles' it is no disappointment and with stunning animation, excellent directing and a heart warming story it's a film that really showcases the talent of everyone involved.<br/><br/>What I found really enjoyable about the film was the message it gave that 'Anybody can cook' which is complimented by the bubbly and traditional image of chef Gusto who says it, the film portrays a story of an underdog who against all odds succeeds and that for me is pretty inspiring.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for people who want a feel good movie experience of any age, the film has a storyline that good enough to keep adults amused but is also understandable to children and has grin worthy visual comedy. I would even say that it is a good couple film, make sure you have a movie snack handy as it will leave you wanting to devour the most appealing stuff in your cupboards.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie 8.8 typically overweight, happy chefs out of 10.<br/><br/>http://kinseymoviereviews.tumblr.com/"

","Talking toys, bugs, monsters, fish, cars, and now there are talking rats...in the damn kitchen. Pixar's newest flick, ""Ratatouille"", follows the story of a talking rat with a dream to become a four-star cook at a French cuisine restaurant. Well, this movie happens to be another personal favorite Pixar movie, and it felt like an inspirational portrait of dreams from a rat's point of view. The script was spectacular, the casting was terrific, there are laughs to be had, and let's just say all the cooking made me hungry, and I had to eat a bowl of nice ravioli while watching. I also felt that the movie was kind of transporting us in the middle of Paris, taking us behind the scenes of the cooking process. This movie made me laugh, made me cry, and sometimes the movie made me completely hungry. So I really enjoyed the film, and it made me come back with the ravioli. ""Ratatouille"", in my review, ""a fun passport of inspiration and dreams, with rats that have good appetite""."

","So I watched 2008's Oscar winner for best animated feature film Ratatouille. So is this movie good, I say once oui, bon tre bon. I think this movie is an instant classic, and is one that does not just appeal to kids and most adults, but in particular to gourmets, which I am. This movie captures perfectly what it is like to be in love with food. It defines the dividing line between what is eating to survive and surviving to eat. About the only character I had a problem with is Linguine, which I didn't dig. The character didn't seem up to the standards of the others, and he does share the lead with Patton Oswalt's wonderful Remy the rat. Besides from that I literally loved every single second of this movie. From the beautiful animation, to the clever story line, to the interesting characters, it is one of the best animated films I have seen period. Some of the people who do voices may surprise you, not in the sense they are doing this film, but in the sense that I honestly (outside of Patton Oswalt) didn't know who did the voices until I looked it up, and was very surprised. This is particularly true of Janeane Garafalo who apparently doesn't have to sound like some whinny gen x'er who smokes too much all the time. Too sum things up, I have to say, any movie that can make rats cooking in a kitchen adorable, has to be good. Why? Because if you saw that in real life all the rats in this movie would be dead not cooking. So enjoy this flick maybe even make some ratatouille yourself, because as Gusteau says anyone can cook!"

","Although my grandkids love this movie and I found the message (like all Pixar/Disney movies) to be uplifting, especially to kids, I still find the idea of a rat in a restaurant to be disturbing. I keep wondering how clean the kitchens of famous French restaurants are!<br/><br/>How does this compare to other Disney movies? It's a little more ambitious since very few children know much about haute cuisine. Movies like Toy Story and Cars have an automatic interest factor for children. <br/><br/>But most American children think that vegetables come from the supermarket and meals come ready made from MacDonalds. For that reason alone, the movie isworthwhile. Of course there is the love interest and the villains. AndI haven't seen humans as the enemy since Bambi.<br/><br/>Liked the food though -- could almost smell it. It's on my list for best movies for food lovers over at Associated Content.

","Well I must admit, its been a long time since anything from Disney has been worth watching. I absolutely loved this film, original, fun, entertaining and joy to watch. The detail and research that have gone into this production are to be recognised, a job well done. Believable characters with emotion and heart. The music and backgrounds were fantastic, I really thought I was in France. Truly brings out the style that is uniquely France. Culture, passion, cooking and well mannered.

","A simple rat has aspirations of becoming a gourmet chef, and moves to Paris to follow his dream, hooking up with a lowly (human) kitchen hand along the way...<br/><br/>There aren't too many animated comedies that you can credit with helping you discover a favourite stand-up comedian, Ratatouille did exactly that for me.<br/><br/>(A related digression: Find some of Patton Oswalt's stand-up stuff, it's worth it.) I knew in advance that this would be good despite the seemingly odd combination of having a rat-chef as the central theme. After all, Pixar don't make bad movies and Brad Bird especially elevates his pics to another level still.<br/><br/>This is one film where the story is paramount above all else, after all the lead character is hardly cuddly and the lead human is hardly witty and charming. The comedy comes from the situations and the final sequence with the cooking ""team"" wowing the pessimistic critic is one of the most well paced and charming endings to any film in recent years.<br/><br/>Kids might not be scurrying back to watch it again and again, but Ratatouille deserves to be seen repeatedly by kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>What you hope kids will learn: Appearances shouldn't count. Anyone can do anything they set their mind to.<br/><br/>What they'll take away: (Probably the least kid-friendly film on this list.)

","There are moments when I see a film when I am taken out of myself for a moment and caught up in the enjoyment of the moment. Ratatouille is one of those films. While its themes are relatively straightforward, the multitude of them and the unique way of which they are told is enthralling. It is not the funniest movie Pixar has come up with, but it plays out like a rich elegant 5 course meal. The animation is so vivid that you can taste the food that is being cooked. The movie does not cut corners by giving easy pay-offs to scenes, but allows the plot to develop organically. The only thing that keeps this from standing as the crowning achievement of Pixar repertoire is that it feels patchwork. It bites off more than it can chew. There are so many characters that you don't get to really know several ones that would have been good to have dwelt upon. There are so many themes interwoven together that they don't always coexist well. And some of the humor feels forced as a result. That being said, it is a wonderful and enchanting film that is a must see for all lovers of cinema."

"honorhorror","10","0","1","9 June 2010"," Life-changing Ratatouille.
","The truth about reviewing your favorite movie is it's never easy. After all these years, Ratatouille happened to be my favorite USA-made cartoon. Or, should I say it's destined to be? OK, let's be fair first. Ratatouille is not a movie you'd like to go into with your rat-hating grandma, especially when you still want to save some goodwill for her.<br/><br/>But again, this is a movie I need to recommend to everyone except those who never had any struggles in lives. What precedes the technical terms, atheistic values is its natural reflection on many aspects of my real-life experiences. OK, I am in my mid-20s, having finished university but not in the line of work I love, just like Remy. However, I was also extraordinary like Gusteau, and just like him I wasn't approved by everyone and had a difficult time struggling with it(luckily for me it wasn't a heart attack). Still, I like to review movies which also sums Anton Ego's profession, though unlike me he likes to make harsh comments every time. I don't know how many of you IMDb guys are just like me out there on earth, but it's surely unlikely that you can relate to all the main characters in a movie. Oh, I still forgot to tell you, that the movie is about making delicious cuisines, which is a hobby I have developed after watching Ratatouille.<br/><br/>Yeah, and that's how Ratatouille made to my No.1 animated movie of all time. It's so personally inspiring, yet it balanced individualism and collectivism in its brilliant plot. According to Brad Bird the writer/director, this movie is what he wanted to make for a long time but had to drop it because it may be considered too offensive. My experience showed that there could be some kind of sexual preference/bias to this film, that all the male audiences I know loved it instantly including my 55-year-old father but half the female audiences felt reluctant to finish watching it. My mum had to do some serious thinking to appreciate its value after the first viewing which she bite her fingernails through. That being said, Ratatouille does have some crude humors and implications if not interpreted right would offend certain group of people. But, isn't that exactly like the modern globalizing world we're living in? Values, ideologies, customs all struggle to find their places in a newly shuffled world. Young people are often caught up in the middle; some of them carry a talent so dangerous yet so fascinating, like Remy. Some of them only want to stay out of trouble, like Linguni. The way they have to survive together combining a mouse's wizardry and a human's appearance is instantly pervasive, bizarre and unrealistic, yet in my opinion it's a very realistic metaphor to the unfair, hypocritical and above all imperfect human realities.<br/><br/>The movie is very dark at times, especially when Remy was led by his father to visit the mousetrap vendor machine. Meanwhile, it's very poignant and tear-jerking especially in the end. Backed up by his entire family of rats, Remy made a dish most unexpected by the egotistic food critic Anton Ego. With the very first bite, Ego's pen dropped on the floor, his eyes widened and entire person freeze in awe. The camera moved into Ego's eye as he brought up the early memory in which mom cooked him the same dish--Ratatouille for him after he injured himself riding a child's bicycle. As he jumped back to reality, he didn't bother to pick up the pen, and finished the dish all the way up like a child. The long lost joy revived on his wrinkled face. Ego asked for the cook to express his deep appreciation, but Linguni refused his praises. Colette and Liguini then told Ego he had to wait for all the guests to leave for seeing the real cook. Ego waited until Liguini presented him Remy in a cook's hat. After Remy showed him all the hard evidences of cooking his favorite dish, Ego left Gusteau's restaurant to write his dish review. Overvoiced by Ego reading his review, Remy stood in the back-alley of the restaurant, gazing at the happy Liguini couple who called him to join them on the way home. He waved them off, and turned to find his father calling him to join the rats family's way home. Loving Linguni and family at the same time, Remy waved his father off, and stood in the middle of the street savoring the triumph as well as enjoying the independence. ""This is a long night to remember"", thought him to himself in a special bitter-sweetness. Little did he know, this bitter-sweetness is also shared by his father, who finally learned to accept his son's difference, as he sleeps in the moonlight. In his review, Ego reflected on his harshness and tendency to entertain the world rather than giving them true talent and truly delicious food. He told the public that the chief cook of Gusteau restaurant is unbelievably low-born but is the best cook in Paris. In his self-reflecting review, Ego redeemed himself. In the next day, Gusteau Restaurant was closed down for hygiene problems, and Ego lost his job as the high-profile food critic because he gave Gusteau positive comments. He then invested in a small restaurant which in no time attracted thousands of guests. Then the movie ended with Remy, Linguni and Gusteau being partners and closed friends.<br/><br/>have I ever had, or will I ever have another touching moment like what I just described to you in a movie? I hope I will. The notion of adventuring with your own unique taste in Ratatouille directly resulted in me becoming a amateur cook, who enjoyed friends' expressions as they bite my works like tigers. ""You should open your own restaurant."" They sometimes tell me so. ""No"", I replied, ""I don't want the bureaus finding a rat in my hat, besides, I'd rather cook for family."""

","This is not different than any other Pixar (Except for ""Toy Story"" that really deserves 100%) it's a great and magical movie, but has one or two issues.<br/><br/>The voice casting, as we all expected is wonderful, specially Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego (The best character of the movie), that gives his character an authenticity that differs from all the other characters. The camera angles were what impressed me the most, it's as if a great director (Maybe what Brad Bird is) choose them.<br/><br/>The story is also very motivation and funny, but only if you forget this movie's biggest problem, The fact that they, at no time, explain how the rat pulling Linguini's hair, can make him move, it's very unbelievable in a movie that, to sound believable, never makes a rat talk to a human, it's distractive, every time I thought, ""Come on! at least try to explain it"", like the scene where dogs fly planes in ""UP"", don't you think it's exaggerated? The final Ego review still gives me goosebumps, and it's probably the best scene of the whole movie, it inspires you, and it's even better with Peter O'Toole's voice.<br/><br/>Verdict: It's Pixar!"
"wizzballs","9","0","1","20 February 2010"," Pixar roll on.
","Marvellous. The best thing is that Pixar are taking risks. Although the sentiment of the story is pure Americanism, the aesthetic of the film goes far beyond Disney-lite. If it lacks some of the darkness of The Incredibles, it reaffirms their artistic credentials in other, delightful ways. They are in danger of building a post-modern aesthetic that surpasses anything in the mainstream in it's attention to detail. Amelie is an obvious touchstone. It reminds me of an effort like 101 Dalmations, where Disney fused their own style with another brilliantly realised aesthetic, but this is a far tighter, sharper effort.<br/><br/>Just like a great chef, they are broadening the pallets of the customer, whilst totally satisfying their appetites. If the story was a little light, the moments were presented in a highly winning fashion. The effect is infectious and surprising.<br/><br/>You may indeed feel like a cynical critic who has been transported back to the purest sensations of his/her childhood.<br/><br/>Bravo!"
"captkirk_4","7","0","1","30 December 2009"," Good movie but could have been better
","Ratatouille is a good entertaining movie in the Pixar tradition. The rich imagery of the copper pots and pans, the Paris skyline, and the food which looks so good you could taste it are all superbly animated. Along with an amusing ensemble of rats and an ""evil"" food critic who turns out surprisingly sympathetic at the end.<br/><br/>However my main complaint is a horrible, unlikable, moron of a main character who undergoes absolutely no character growth through the course of the film. The ""slapstick"" scenes of the mouse pulling his hair like a marionette are creepy rather than funny. SPOILER: When we find out the lead human is really the illegitimate son of the deceased master chef I had expected that the plot was going to lead to the mouse awakening some latent ability in him and having him mature into a great chef himself. But alas in the end he remains just the same bungling, inept moron that he begins with. This lack of character maturation and creepy, gross slapstick was a major flaw in the plot, I really wish the writers had taken a different direction. I also wish there was some other less disgusting way to have had the rat influence the cooking other than the ""hair pulling"" i.e. perhaps just talking to him, this is a cartoon after all. Then this could have been a 9 out of 10 film rather than the 7 of 10 I am giving it."

","I really loved this film. Like all the Pixar films, it has that rather slick Disney feel where ten to fifteen minutes in you get so used to the computer generation that you forget its computer-generated and start trying to identify the celebrity voices; John Ratzenberger is always a given. The movie is about a rat who goes to Paris to experience fine dining after getting tired of scraps and then trying to extend his culinary knowledge to an inept and skill-less innocent. The humor, especially where it involves the rat world to the human world is hilarious, particularly where they take the health inspector hostage. Overall, it's a great children's movie with all the niceties to attract it to adults as well."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","1","7 November 2009"," Has some to offer
","I base this upon the 2-Disc Special Edition. This definitely does a thing or two differently than other 3D flicks... as an example, instead of doing tricks for the audience with camera and animation, it feels more like a movie that happens to be all CG. The movements are very realistic, and in a lot of ways, this actually doesn't strain credulity. That's, of course, not counting the main concept. Why must Hollywood always oversimplify psychology and the complexity of the human brain? Also, am I the only one whose had enough of critics being regarded as bitter and crusty old jerks who just like to pick apart the work of others? People, if their judgments bother you that much, *stop listening to them*, it's not a difficult thing to do. The plot is OK, though it doesn't all make sense. Voice acting is marvelous, everyone sounds exactly right. The characters are well-written, they come off as people that could exist outside of fiction, and few are annoying. This is visually well-done, immense level of detail, and grand, vivid color and lighting. The romance feels tacked on, and in fact Linguini is dangerously close to being completely useless in this. I don't really find this funny, however, someone put forth that it's really a drama for kids to a greater extent than a comedy, which I largely agree with. It often tries too hard for laughs when it does go for such. There is intensity and potentially disturbing content in this, as well as one use of a moderately strong word. The DVD comes with Lifted and Your Friend the Rat, the shorts(that I will review on their individual pages) several well-done featurettes, a handful of deleted scenes(in early stages) and some trailers. I recommend this to fans of these films. 7/10"

Fine art can come from a very humble origin (which is here an animation film, that is mainly intended to be a children movie), as like as a great cook can be a rat! In my place there is a common misconception that animation films are made basically for children. I see it in my father's eye when he 'caught' me watching a 3D animation film! I think this film is a very good reply for that. Animation films are always under-rated everywhere, so it was a good surprise for me to know that Pixar's new film (Up!) is now in Canne's film festival (2009)!

Remy controlling Linguini's action by his hair, it is an excellent idea. I like the restaurant named ""Gusteau's"" because the dining hall and the kitchen are very beautiful. Linguini's expressions and his movements make it totally funny. Skinner looks like a pucca villain. I like the rat's fast moving when they run. In the last scene, when the whole family of rats comes to the kitchen and cook and remy is directing how to cook, that scene is totally cool. When the customer tells the waiter that you have something new and tells we need the food from Linguini, that time Linguini cooks very fast but it is very funny, that scene was also superb. When skinner is chasing remy to get his documents, that scene is totally cool. When, remy falls in the kitchen and he tries to escape from the kitchen, that time he runs very fast from the humans, that scene is totally thrilling.

"dwpollar","6","0","1","2 December 2008"," Unique & funny computer animated film...
","1st watched 11/28/2008, - (Dir-Brad Bird): Unique & funny computer animated film from Brad Bird & Pixar again takes us to worlds rarely seen. This time it's the world of rats and more precisely a rat who wants to be a cook and create instead of steal like most of the rats do. This breaking out of the nest philosophy isn't unique in films, especially animated movies, but a rat that wants to be a cook is. Humans usually shriek when rats are near food or call the health inspectors but Bird brings us one who not only touches food but makes it wonderfully tasty with it's touch. Bird uses wonderful camera positions to make us feel like we're looking from the rats point of view. This incredible animation along with a very unique story made for an enjoyable movie-going experience. I've basically already outlined the main story but also involved as the patsy or puppet human is a young man who wants to cook but doesn't have the knack for it. He's hired on as a janitor for a world famous restaurant and after botching up the soup recipe he notices a rat putting various ingredients in and the customers love it after his special touch. He's amazed by this and the human gets the credit but he can't duplicate it without the rats help. They scheme together a plan where the rat controls the human through his hat by pulling on his hair to direct him.(OK, so this is a little weird but in animation anything goes) There is a subplot involving the restaurant owner who thinks the boy named Linguini is the original owner's son and is afraid he will inherit the restaurant. This eventually is the case and there are some funny scenes where the owner notices the rats' involvement in the process and others think he is crazy, of course. This is an unusually convoluted plot for an animated movie but this is what makes it enjoyable for adults. Kids will like it too despite this as the movie is an enjoyable experience throughout. Bird & Pixar keep kicking out new material that continues to surprise and they probably will both be at it for a very long time, god willing."

","May contain minor spoilers!! <br/><br/>I believe as perhaps David Lynch would, that movies should be felt. I believe that movies are like mirrors, we watch them and we reflect our life, our thoughts from it. We pour our soul open and have an invisible discussion with the events on the screen.<br/><br/>When I was a child, I thought that the ""bad older boys in the neighbourhood"" who used to pick me were always on the side of the bad-guys in TV (makes sense when you are 5 years old). I still remember the day I figured out myself that perhaps the bad bullies are on McGyver's side too, just like me. That changed my thinking, my perception of life. That is who I am now as an adult, I believe that there is good in every one of us.<br/><br/>Why is it that so many of us think that all 3D animations nowadays have to have non-stop humour, entertainment value on maximum - fun-run for 2 hours..? Why so many of us are keeningly commenting on all the ""morals"" and realism that these films are suppose to present? Why couple of times saying ""Don't steal"" has to be taken so seriously? I personally don't think it is the main theme or ""lesson"" of this film at all. That sentence is needed for the story to evolve and to be happening in the first place! Remy wouldn't make a go for his chef-dream if he would be satisfied in thieving just like the rest of the rats! There are reviews here commenting on things like ""how come a rat can understand speech and walk with 2 feet"" etc... Of course everyone realises that animation has and is able to make reality more magical, but no one seems to notice the possibilities in story-telling this brings us.. For instance did anyone notice how Remy walks proudly on two feet when his co-operation with humans works well - and when he has his crash with Linguini he admits that he is just a rat and starts to go by fours again..? How the typewriter (shaped like a skull) of Mr Ego seems so much more natural after he has had his revelation? Brilliant little details like these are scattered all over this film! For me the best gag and most remarkable event in this movie is when the so-obvious-baddie turns out to have that good side in him after all. That the bad food-bullie who rips down restaurants for fun is deep inside an understanding and kind human being.<br/><br/>Tears came into my eyes again during that scene - Because I reflected, I mirrored what I saw on the screen through my own life. That in every one of us there lives a good soul - a happy child, instead of that angry selfish adult.<br/><br/>And this is not probably what the makers of this movie wanted to preach, nor probably was it their aim, but for me it was a great ending."

","Absolutely wonderful animation. I know in my head that it is similar to that for Toy Story, but there's something more here. I couldn't tell in the outdoors scenes whether the water, etc. were real or animated. And the you feel as if you can touch the characters and know what they would feel like, more real than claymation. Just bizarre, but wonderful.<br/><br/>The story and even the music, as well as the characters themselves are everything you would want in an animated film. But I deducted one star only because I don't think it would hold the interest of very young children for the whole movie. For example, in the beginning of the movie there are long (and boring) shots of moving within cellars and between floors. And there is quite a bit of yelling and knives aimed at the rats.<br/><br/>But other than that it is an intriguing movie that goes by at a rapid pace and will leave you amazed at the quality of the animation, the sweetness of the story and characters and the overall effect of a ""feel good"" movie excellently made (but hold the rat hair)."

","Brad Bird proves with the charming effort, that he is one of the best directors currently working in the field of animation and Pixar once again shows why they are the ""leaders of the pack"".....<br/><br/>""Ratatouille"" tells the tale of a young rat named Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who longs to be more than what he is. Inspired by the great chef August Gusteau (Brad Garrett), Remy discovers his passion for food and cooking. In quick succession a series of events sees him separated from his family and all alone in the great city of Paris.<br/><br/>Remy finds himself drawn to the restaurant of his idol Gusteau who has since passed away (in fact Gusteau stays on in the film as a ""spirital guide"" for Remy). In the process, another tale begins to emerge as a young man called Linguini (Lou Romano) also finds himself at Gusteau's seeking a job and in turn, the two end up being tied to each other's fates.<br/><br/>This movie successfully infuses a delightful blend of physical comedy and savvy wit humour. Combined with great animation, a lovely score from Michael Giacchino and great voice over work from Janeane Garofalo as the feisty young female chef Colette, Ian Holm as the devilish villain of the piece, Chef Skinner and Peter O'Toole (who was a master stroke of casting!) as the king of all critics Anton Ego.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is able to provide this animated feature with a level of depth and intelligence which adult audiences can appreciate and enjoy. ""Ratatouille"" proves that animated films can move beyond the cute and cuddly realm for which many find themselves stuck in. Granted, children can enjoy this movie and this is certainly plenty of moments for them to soak up, but what impressed me most about this film was the fact that it had layers of thought behind it which appealed to my sensibility.<br/><br/>Highly recommended..... :)"

","Ratatouille is path breaking stuff. Animation movies are no longer for kids and people who are kids at heart, this is serious stuff. The movie so eloquently and beautifully depicts the story of a rat and his misadventures and triumphs, that you are forced to wonder, does The Lion King really has that insurmountable tag with it? The animation is superb, to say the least.

"david-5145","10","0","2","12 September 2008"," The most cutest rats I've ever seen
","After their last film, which didn't come up to scratch, Pixar still had to give out dessert, which this time is given top marks. 'Ratatouille' shows us that even other creatures than us on earth, can cook. It also shows that not all vermin look ugly; 'Ratatouille' gives us the best in cute rats!<br/><br/>The story is great; the fact that a rat named Remy can have a knack for cooking even though the whole world is out to get him is a nice twist to a story about a creature who you wouldn't expect to have such a talent in cooking. It's also very hilarious, especially at times when you least expect it. The ending also makes an extraordinary twist to the story, where the evil character turns into a good character, the rats are treated like humans (but in secret) and everyone has a happy ending despite any mishaps.<br/><br/>Pixar must be the best company to create the cutest cartoon animals, especially at creating vermin like rats. The animators wonderfully express the animal's feelings by their facial expressions and body movement. Compared to his father and the other rats, Remy looks like the runty one of the offspring, except perhaps his older brother Emile, a funny, fat rat. Also, Pixar has once again done wonders with creating the humans as realistically as possible.<br/><br/>As for the voices of the people in Paris, Pixar has chosen actors who can speak English with a French accent. This has worked well, though the downside is that sometimes you have to listen very hard or you'll never understand a word they're saying. Fortunately, not all the actors' use the accent, such as those who play the rats, which does seem sensible, since rats couldn't have learnt how to speak French.<br/><br/>The picture quality is top class. The cartoon Paris looks exactly like the real Paris on a Saturday afternoon. They have drawn the food exactly as it's supposed to look like in a posh restaurant. Also, the background music adds to the atmosphere of Paris like a dream.<br/><br/>I would recommend the film for the whole family. I might also suggest that anyone who works in a restaurant should watch this, and understand that not all rats are vermin!"
"legendaryrebeljoe19","Null","0","2","4 September 2008"," An Outstanding Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
","The movie Ratatouille is about a little rat (Remy) who is a great chef and a master of the senses. he can smell rat poison a mile away(exaggerating)!! As he IS a rat, he's supposed to eat garbage and things. He travels to Paris via an interesting route. There he meets a man named Linguini and helps him become a great chef, as good as his father Chef Gusteau. From there the story takes an emotional turn as Linguini and Remy's friendship is put to the test and when family bonds come back to save you. And then there's the mysterious Anton Ego, an infamous critic who is known for his shaming of famous restaurants and chefs. After our hero cooks for him, he is shocked. He had never had a meal so delicious since his mum had cooked for him during his childhood. The writing of the story is fantastic from this point. They don't choose to give Anton a very complicated or overwhelming dish but a simple yet extraordinarily effective dish, the Ratatouille. Ego's review is a masterpiece as it really touches the hearts and minds of the viewer and contains a powerful emotional side to it which adds to the beautiful drama. A fantastic animation all round and a round of applause for Pixar for making this story into a movie it deserved. Wonderful, captivating and good round family fun. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","I really liked this movie and I have to say that a rat helping and controlling a boy is kind of weird but at least it's something different and it kind of makes the movie even more special. The visuals are outstanding especially when Remy goes to the roof of a building and he looks out and you get a spectacular view of Paris which really impressed me. The characters are all great and to name one that I really liked was Linguini because the journey he goes through and the challenges he faces to become the best cook in the kitchen are pretty thrilling. I really enjoyed this movie and anybody out there who likes family movies will like this one."
"michaelrbenjamin","10","0","1","29 July 2008"," Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great!
","From my point of view, Ratatouille is very easily the best movie. Its plot is very simple, yet it's brilliant when it's mixed up with the idea of a rat who got what it takes to be the best chef! I also fall in love with the animation. It's fantastic. The objects texture, the drawings, the furs! Not to mention, the best angles and composition yet in an animation movie. OMG.. so colorful, detailed and so alive. Like watching moving paintings, which is so full of art sense. Even you can be overwhelmed by just seeing the rat's heart beats.<br/><br/>The story is one of the most original scripts. It's very solid with humor that's not pushed over the limit. It's classic in many other ways. The character development is also one of the best in Pixar's. The director once again succeeds to build characters that are gray, not the typical black&white characters as seen on many other children movies. And I'm personally in love with Remy! Remy is talk-active, smart, enthusiastic, passionate, perfectionist, but also a bit cocky, pushy, crafty, etc. In short, he's so rich and natural in his character! For me, he's also one of the best Disney's character because of his heroic thing. There aren't many Pixar's movies who have the identical ideation as other previous Disney's character, but Remy has it. From time to time, Disney's characters always tend to be different and be something or someone that stands out in the crowd, and against all odds. And that idea of being different is brilliantly drawn in Remy, that I don't see also being drawn that brilliantly in any other Pixar's character (except maybe WALL-E).<br/><br/>I also love Emile. He's with his tummy is so cuuuute!! :D And speaking about cuteness, the rest of the rats are also very cute, with their tiny bright sparkling eyes. Yes, as I said, if you speak about the animation; the camera angle, the composition, the artworks of the movie are the best ones amongst all Pixar's movies. It's just so artistic and delightful.<br/><br/>The quality of the animation is well accompanied with the warming music from The Incredible's Michael Giacchino. Even besides, the sound editing is very good. All the characters seem to fit the voices. I love how Patton Oswalt voices Remy. Just perfect. Or how Ian Holm voices Skinner. Fantastic.<br/><br/>But above all the praises, what I like most from the movie is the second half part of the movie which I think, excels in many ways. You are first offered the feel of happiness when Linguini officially owned the restaurant and fired Skinner. Then all of a sudden, there are lots of conflicts like when Remy couldn't accept the fact that Linguini started to deny his capability, over Colette. It continued when Remy brought the whole colony to steal foods, that made Linguini really disappointed and said harsh words to him and kicked him away.<br/><br/>All of the desperation continues when all the gourmet employees quitted their job when they think that Linguini was out of his mind for trusting a rat, and even Colette walked away from him. It's all in the night when it was the most important night for them. Gladly, Colette is an important character so she's brought back to the whole ending scenes, along with the movie essensial slogan ""anyone can cook"" which she had believed from the very beginning.<br/><br/>And after all the desperations, out of nowhere, Django gently spoke to Remy in a very fatherly way (i love it!). And boom! This is the part I'm talking about. It's when the rats colony got into the kitchen and help to cook. Wow! The feeling I get when watching this part is just overwhelming. Now I can see why they call themselves ""a family"" and am just so excited to see Remy walked around the kitchen and tasted all the sauces, the cookings and said words such as, ""good, too many salt, good"". It's just so entertaining and at the same time, inspiring. That part is also so hilariously funny, if not the funniest part of the movie. Like when the health inspector got tied up by the rats. LoL! Speaking about this part, it's concluded with the best ending yet, when Remy cooks Ego ratatouille and afterwards Ego makes a review about it. The review is really breath-taking.. It speaks about the morality of a critic itself which I think is really genius. How can you criticize a movie that's concluded with something speaking about the work of a critic itself? ""The work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and theirselves to our judgment."" Those lines are amazing. Have you ever thought of its meaning? It's very deep and has a lot of love message, of how you appreciate others, no matter where they come from, or what they are. As spoken wise, a great artist can come from anywhere. That's why I always cry every time I come to this part. Even after watching it 17 times, I still cry.<br/><br/>And the fact that the ending has something really related to its own title (Ratatouille) is just superb because not so many movie can save its very own title from the beginning of the story till the end, yet make it the bomb for the ending. Like wise saying, save the best for last.<br/><br/>In the end, it leaves us with warm feelings, along with a spirit that ""anyone can cook"" (but only the fearless can be great!). A spirit of how ""a great artist can come from anywhere"". Also some cute memorable moments and an originality that easily mark it the best movie ever made."
"giren-ismaya","10","0","1","27 July 2008"," A delicious yet beautiful movie
","Ratatouille raise the animation bar by giving us the wonderful experience with the movie itself. In my opinion, the most important thing in this movie is not how Remy - the main rat - trying to achieve his goal by making the most delicious food on Paris, but how we as a human being appreciate an art and its process to make it an art. At this movie, Brad Bird brilliantly choose food as the art itself.<br/><br/>Why food? Simply because food is enjoyable on every aspect. The food in this movie was a fine dining. A kind of food who not only have to be delicious, but also beautiful. And how on earth a sewer rat will make a food beautiful and also delicious?<br/><br/>Well, since its a Pixar movie, nothing seems impossible.<br/><br/>Ratatouille succeed for making the viewer understand the process of the art itself. It was so moving to watch Remy and his desire to cook. The screenplay and the script was flawless, actually when you realize that this is 'only' an animated movie. The line when Skinner the Chef was so angry with Linguini when he messed up with the soup was so simple, yet it tells the audience about how crucial it is too playing with ingredients, especially when it was a signature soup.<br/><br/>The character had a very rich personality, and the story was so bold. I'm sure that Ratatouille still will be a great movie even if it conceived in a simple 2-D animation like it's rival at Academy Awards, Persepolis. <br/><br/>Anton Ego character was stunning. With the simplest choice of words and gesture, he conceived us that he is a very dangerous and critical critics. It was like seeing your old killer- looking professor at college when you want to hand him your term-paper. <br/><br/>The technical aspects were also flawless. But what do you expect? Of course it was flawless! Its Pixar movie for God sake! No wonder that Ratatouille was the best reviewed film of 2007. I realized that some people found that Ratatouille was boring, weird, etc. Well, I guess you have to use some of your so-called-brain in your head when you watch this movie. This is not a stupid animation movie that we see a lot these past years. This is not Barnyard, Madagascar, Shark Tale or Shrek The Third. This is kind of movie that will make you think. If that to much for you to do, than just skip it.<br/><br/>I enjoy Ratatouille as much as I enjoy the good food. And I will watch it over and over again, while I wait for another masterpiece from Pixar, hungry for moreÂ…<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","This summer I felt like looking into a few good movies and discovering a couple novels. While I have seen a few witty and groundbreaking animated movies, namely Shrek and The Incredibles, I have been detoured by the recent plugging of well known actors to draw an older crowd to ultimately ""kiddy"" films. It came as an enormous surprise when I took a daring leap and picked up Ratatouille. This movie is not only animated to a degree of showing emotion better than some A-rated actors/actresses, but also hits dead on by illustrating many scenes of grief, stress, and happiness with its vibrant and dynamic colors. But this movie is not dependent on sheer animation, as my fears came to a rest. This movie explores the human spirit and its desire to overcome, endure, and bare creativity. That there is a potential for excellence and uniqueness that is not found in just anyone, but can be found anywhere. A rare Disney message that is a fresh approach to its overused ""everyone wins"" motto."

","An animated film about a rat wanting to be a chef? I have to admit, I wasn't sure whether I would like this one from Pixar. Although the company hasn't made a single mistake yet, I just couldn't see this one being a hit. But wow, after viewing Pixar's Ratatouille, I think I can happily say that this is the best animated film ever.<br/><br/>The story is about a rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) whose dream is to become a chef in a French restaurant. Remy's Brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and his father Django (Brian Dennehy) find his dream to be absolutely crazy and explain to him that rats and humans aren't meant to be. When Remy and the rest of his family get split up due to some unexpected events, Remy ends up in Paris and finds a restaurant once owned by Auseste Gusteau. Gusteau happens to be Remy's idol because of his motto ""Anyone can cook"". After sneaking inside to take a look, Remy makes a soup that turns out to be great. The chefs think that the garbage boy named Linguini (Lou Romano) is responsible for it so they hire him as a cook, but when Remy is caught in the kitchen, the garbage boy is told to dispose of him. Unable to kill him because of the wonderful soup he made, Linguini and Remy form an unusual friendship and they find a way to work together in the kitchen to make great recipes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Ratatouille is more than just an animated film, It is a masterpiece. Somehow the story just seems to work perfectly. It truly is an amazing film that is as much an adults film as it is a child's.<br/><br/>10/10"

Remy(Patton Oswalt) is not your ordinary rat. He doesn't enjoy stealing and eating garbage. He believes you are what you eat and he doesn't want that to be garbage. He only liked eating the good food. His father,Django (Brian Dennehy) and brother, Emile (Peter Sohn) say that he's just picky with his food. Then one day after combining to different types of food Remy realized that combining food makes it taste better.<br/><br/>Remy learns a lot about cooking from watching Gusteau (Brad Garret) on TV and reading his book. After an incident involving an old lady with a shotgun, Remy finds himself at Gusteau's restaurant. Gusteau, now dead, is no longer in charge of the restaurant. The chef in charge is now Skinner (Ian Holm). Skinner hires a young awkward man to be a garbage boy, named Linguini (Lou Romano). Linguini is Gusteau's son, but no one knows this except for Skinner, who doesn't want anyone to find out.<br/><br/>Linguini doesn't know how to cook, but tries to fix some soup. Remy sees this and fixes Linguini's abomination. Everyone then likes the soup, and wants Linguini to make it again, so he and Remy have to work together as a team. Gusteau's then becomes renowned once again, and Linguini discovers he's Gusteau's son, thanks to Remy, but Skinner tries stopping them. Eventually all is well and both Remy and Linguini get to work together.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is a fun movie for the whole family. It's one of the better animated movies I've seen in a while. All the characters were great, and voices suited them well. The story seemed very original, and even though it sounds ridiculous when you hear about it, when you watch it you have fun.<br/><br/>While watching this movie you really do root for Remy and Linguini. The directors did a great job of making you feel what the main characters feel. You're happy when their happy and you're sad when their faced with a dilemma, or problem.<br/><br/>Usually animated movies are made for little kids that like to laugh at a cartoon when someone makes a funny face, but Ratatouille had more of a mature type of humor, not so much that a little kid couldn't enjoy it, but that everyone would like.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars"

","Pixar have done it again. This is the Second Best Pixar film so far, as nothing beats Finding Nemo. It was directed by the Oscar-winning Brad Bird director and writer of ""The Incredibles"", who has created a film with humour, heart and meaning. If you see the film at the cinema it will begin with a hilarious so called ""Pixar Short"" called Lifted, that will actually make you cry with laughter. Anyway back to the story, it follows Remy a young and lovable rat with a special gift of hyper smell I suppose and he just loves to cook. He actually loves to cook so much that he ends up putting his huge rat family in danger and ends up in (with some help from his ghostly hero Gusteau, a top chef) Paris the food capital of the world and right in front of Gusteau's restaurant that's being run by Skinner who's just in it for the money not the love of food. Remy then makes a friend called Linguini who can't cook to save his life. So with some amazing discoveries and clever antics, Remy and Linguini run this top restaurant, with help from their staff of course. Then all goes wrong when Linguini falls for one of the chefs called Collette, Remy is fed up with Linguini getting all the credit for his work and worse of all, the food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole Troy, Venus and many films that I am too young to know) that could determine a restaurants future by a few words. Well that's the clever and original story, but what really makes this film shine is the beautiful and absolutely mind blowing animation, the attention to detail is unbeatable and this definitely shows when you see the water in the sewers. This backed up with brilliant sound and brilliant voices from people that I have never heard of, except Peter O'Toole of course who gives quite interesting speech at the end. The message of this film is anyone can do anything if they put their mind to it and it doesn't matter where you come from, which I suppose is true. So overall a clever and warming film for the whole family, with humour that both children and adults will find funny."

","From Pixar, the geniuses behind Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., and director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles) this is another pleasant experience. Basically young rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) lives with his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and father, leader of the pack of rats, Django (Brian Dennehy), and because of his great sense of taste and smell, he is a rat poison checker. But he dreams of becoming a great chef, like his hero Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), who he often imagines talking to. The rats escape the house when the old woman living there discovers them, but Remy is separated from his family, however he does find good luck when he sees that he has been living under Paris for all long, and he heads to Gusteau's restaurant. There he encounters Linguini (Lou Romano), who spots the rat putting ingredients into a soup that he almost spoilt, and when it is taken away to a customer, who they didn't realise was a food critic, everyone believes it was Linguini, and chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo) convinces nasty owner Skinner (Sir Ian Holm) not to fire him, as long as he can recreate the same soup. Linguini realises Remy knows how to cook and can understand him, so they soon form a ""partnership"", and to make Linguini do what he wants Remy controls him by pulling his hair. After a long while, Linguini is made to look like a great chef, and unfortunately for Skinner, he may be the heir of Gusteau, and obviously later it turns out to be true. Oh, and there is a small bit of love story with Linguini and Colette. Of course there are negative turns, when Skinner discovers it's Remy that is the genius, Remy sees the bad side to human when he is reunited with his family, but there is a happy ending, and the man they are desperate to please, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) gives his praise, and the kitchen is revealed to run by all the rats. Also starring Will Arnett as Horst, Julius Callahan as Lalo/Francois, James Remar as Larousse, John Ratzenberger as Mustafa, Teddy Newton as Lawyer (Talon Labarthe), and if you have the British version, it would be Jamie Oliver as The Health Inspector. The animation is (as always) impeccable, the characters are all well thought out, and the story is good fun and gives a great perspective into the restaurant and recipe creating world, all the family will enjoy this charming animated comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Music for Michael Giacchino, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film.

","Remy is your usual neighborhood rat that has a gift, of discerning smell. He is a born chef, but who ever heard of a rat as a chef? Rats in the kitchen means the health department will close you down!!<br/><br/>One fateful day Remy and his family and friends are chased into a sewer system and when Remy emerges and checks out where he is above ground, it is in Paris. And, right next to the restaurant that his idol owns, Chef Auguste Gusteau, who wrote a book, ""Anyone can cook."" Unfortunately for Remy, the chef had just died.<br/><br/>At that same time a new boy, Linguini, shows up look for work, so he is put to cleaning up in the kitchen. He not only can't cook, he also makes a big mess wherever he goes. But Remy's cooking instinct is so strong, when he sees Linguini trying to ""repair"" a pot of soup, badly, Remy ends up adding ingredients he thinks will work, and the soup is a big hit with all the customers. Everyone thinks Linguini can cook, when it is really Remy.<br/><br/>So, most of the movie is to see how Remy will be able to interact with Linguini to create great dishes. Including one for the local feared food critic that can make or break the restaurant.<br/><br/>All the voice acting is good, but the animation is superb. You ""almost"" forget that it is animation. And the story is a fine one too. Great entertainment."
"blackburnj-1","9","0","1","5 February 2008"," Wonderful film
","Pixar's films hit the big time thirteen years ago with the magnificent ""Toy Story"" and since then they have a near flawless record in the quality of their releases. Perhaps the high point of this decade was Brad Bird's first Pixar effort, ""The Incredibles"", which was by no means perfect, but was witty, imaginative, gorgeous to look at and intelligent. There were, therefore, high expectations of ""Ratatouille"".<br/><br/>However, there were also worries. The project was originally assigned to Jan Pinkava, who retains several credits, but, under somewhat mysterious circumstances, Bird took over. Rumours of disaster spread like wildfire, but the film defied these concerns and was pretty spectacular in many ways.<br/><br/>Many see the film as a clear metaphor for Pixar itself, fighting against convention and the ""rules"" in order to realise artistic potential. There maybe something in that but, ultimately, it doesn't matter because this is a wonderful and joyous film, brilliantly made and thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is the sublime animation. It really is a major step forward. Environments are completely photo-real, characters are designed brilliantly and the look of the film is highly detailed, luscious and vibrant. But all of that hard work would be nothing without an entertaining and amusing narrative and Bird provides this. The film isn't perfectly structured. The plot loops on itself occasionally and the pace slacks during the third act. But, the characters are brilliantly detailed and there are more than enough amusing moments to get you by. His direction is also terrific. He gives the film such energy and movement that every shot is arresting.<br/><br/>The vocal cast are also superb, with the standouts being Ian Holm's villainous chef Skinner and Peter O'Toole whose breathtakingly brilliant voice is absolutely ideal for the food critic Anton Ego. The sound of the film is also supported by Michael Giacchino's electric and eclectic jazzy score, an example of the further elements that all come together to make this film what it is.<br/><br/>It is by no means perfect. It's slightly overlong, it's poorly structured but that doesn't matter. It is a lovely, wonderful film and if you leave this film without a smile on your face then there is something wrong with you."

","Ratatouille is one of those movies that make you dream about the impossible. When we're little, we think about what it would be like to be an astronaut; movie or rock star. In Ratatouille, a fat rat named Remy dreams the impossible, to be a chef in the top restaurant in Paris.<br/><br/>The setup for the film alone was genius. The rat's dream is pure taboo and I mean pure taboo. He faces stiff opposition from his family and the world he dreams of working in despises his species. It's about as taboo as a Palestinian dreaming of marrying an Israeli and bearing Jewish children for the betterment of Israel (or vice versa). Humans can't stand rats and the idea of a rat in a restaurant can't be tolerated let alone, the idea of a rat being the head chef.<br/><br/>The screenplay was rock solid but it's the characters that really sell the film. And when I say character I'm talking about a combination of the animation and voice acting. Remy (Patton Oswalt) is modest, honest, and really believes in himself and finding peace in the world amongst humans. Oswalt's voice acting is wonderful and his voice really brings life to Remy. Remy is so full of potential, he's got a natural knack for cooking, and when he gets separated from his family in a sewer, there's nothing to stop him from pursuing his dream. When he meets the new garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) at his dream restaurant, the two of them forge an alliance. With both of them desperate to succeed, this odd couple sets out to take the Parisian restaurant scene by storm. This rat and his human sidekick were more entertaining than most of the characters I saw in movies this summer. Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Tobey Maguire, and Optimus Prime (well, maybe not Optimus) aren't nearly as fun to watch as Remy. And you know he's the honest, daring underdog, so you want him to win.<br/><br/>This is where I would have to say the animation is nothing short of perfect. This film had better action than most action films that come out these days, not to mention more laugh out loud laughs than any recent comedies. I'm sure now that a freeway chase is just as exciting as a chase through a kitchen might be. Actually, the kitchen scene might have the upper hand since it's more of an obstacle course. Hot pots and pans, boiling water, stoves, knives, not to mention all the food in the way as Remy runs for his life.<br/><br/>Most movies get a sequel automatically; this is a movie where I hope there is one. Maybe Remy could get a cooking show or write a book. At the end of the day, Ratatouille is one of the year's best films. It's one of those films that make you feel like a kid again."

","Ratatouille is a very funny and enjoyable film, because it is a unique and original story and a theme that I can readily identify with. The food that a person eats speaks volumes about the mannerisms of that particular person. Some people are partial to almost any kind of food, others are very selective. I am among the latter group. There is a wide variety of food for the various people around the world to choose from, yet nobody can eat just anything, unlike a rat. Remy the rat would certainly believe in the saying ""Variety Is the Spice of Life."" It can be difficult to choose between food that tastes good and food that is good for your health. I give my compliments to Brad Bird for his culinary cinema masterpiece."

","One has to love any Pixar film. This one is a lot of fun. I would say loved the music the best about this movie. It was just some extremely well paced music that really gave me the feel of the movie. Another thing that stood out and popped was the lighting and the whole color schemes of the movie. Just wonderful looking in every sense of the word. All of these movies have some really cliché message that they are trying to get across and it does a pretty good job of it. The love interest was not totally necessary and it annoys me how they always try to put them into movies. The voice acting was very nice and a lot of the voices where not even recognizable. They get a good number of big names to voice some of the characters, but it seems like they only pick them because they would do the characters justice. It was a lot of fun, but in the end it just another pixar film which are always a good time."

There were just enough adult themes, rich performances and flashes of comedic brilliance to satisfy people of all ages. It a crossover blessing...

The story about a rat who wishes to follow his dream is universal enough to overcome the snobbishness of the arena in which he wishes to make his mark.

""oh no, you're kidding me.."" in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Only downside for some is that some might not find the subject of culinary art as interesting as superheroes, explosions, robots, and fuzzy aliens. Nevertheless, it is full of action, great visual gags, and a strong story. Pixar obviously took a huge risk with the subject and I must say, it is executed near flawlessly! Having visited France before, it was nice to see some recognizable landscapes as well.

The characters are likable though none of them are particularly memorable except Anton Ego, who is voiced by the brilliant Peter O'Toole. And Ratouille is even better because there is something missing that has been in Pixar movies for years: The annoying supporting character with the voice of nails on a chalkboard. I'm talking about characters along the lines of Ellen Degeneres in Finding Nemo and Billy Crystal in Monsters Inc. Thankfully there is no such character in this film. Ratatouille's story is simplistic but the movie is aimed at a younger audience after all.

Undeniably, albeit similar messages which share the same theme  everyone can succeed  have been conveyed through an array of movies, none had the flair and originality Ratatouille has. With comical lines inserted into a poignant plot, Ratatouille has successfully disseminated a cheesy message, which society is tired of listening, in a casual, simplistic and elegant way.<br/><br/>At last, I would love to say that Disney has finally produced a film that would not only appeal to youngsters for its cute animation but at the same time instill a message that most of us have neglected and overlooked  if a rat can cook, why can't a woman rule, why can't a boy be effeminate, why should we punish idiosyncrasies, why do we ostracize?"

The movie does a great job at establishing the way things work in the 5-Star restaurant world, and just what the characters are up against. Insights into the aspirations of the principals is done well too.<br/><br/>The characters are all likable and developed extremely well in minimal time, and the voice talents are all in top form (my personal favorite was the totally unrecognizable Jeanean Garafalo doing a fast jabbering French accented Collette).

It wasn't totally smooth sailing though - the story and subject matter took a while to grow on me - but they did and won me over.<br/><br/>In general terms, this story is about a rat that loves to cook and gets a chance to pursue his dream ... in the world of humans.<br/><br/>If that sounds corny, kind of boring and aimed at kids, that's how I felt. But even if you start out with this feeling, the fast pace of the movie and great visuals will keep you distracted long enough for the movie to grow on you.<br/><br/>The characters are so well performed (both visually and vocally) that this becomes a character movie and you start to care about what happens to the characters - rats and all.<br/><br/>This is a movie that can appeal to everyone - kids through adults. Even if you come in with reserved expectations, you'll be happy you saw it."

","I recently saw ""Paprika"" and ""Ratatouille"" in close succession, in that order. I can only say that ""Ratatouille"" was an intense disappointment, especially when measured against a film like ""Paprika,"" which demonstrates the adult potential of animation. The Rat story was a kid story with a good moral but was unexceptional and banal in its execution on the screen. Unlike ""Spirited Away"" & ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" which are both moral stories appropriate for children (as opposed to, say, ""Grave of the Fireflies""), ""Ratatouille"" was not at all sophisticated or imaginative in its presentation. Big noses and crooked teeth are a limited device for conveying the Gallic character and the villain's pencil-thin moustache made him look as if he'd been recycled from a WW II animated piece on the Pacific theatre.<br/><br/>I am not an unmitigated fan of Japanese popular culture which is often kitschy and misogynistic, but its clear that if animation is the measure, American productions are the mega-losers."

","..you'll be COMPLETELY enchanted with this.<br/><br/>As such,you may still find this offering from PIXAR(and Disney),their eighth,to be quite a charming film.<br/><br/>Remy(voice of Paton Oswalt)may be a rat,but he's a rat with a enhanced culinary sense. His sense of smell,taste and what-goes-with-what gives him a unique ability to appreciate and make food. It also,unfortunately,gets him and his colony(including his father and brother,voiced by Brian Dennehy and Peter Sohn)in trouble and gets them separated. He somehow ends up flushed down the sewage lines until he eventually ends up under the Four-star restaurant belonging to legendary Chef Gusteau(Brad Garrett,who could make a career on pretty much vocal work alone if he wanted),who was said to have died of a broken heart from a very harsh review from a joyless food critic scribe named Anton Ego(Peter O'Toole,adding to his already voluminous and impressive resume). It is there that Remy begins to make his mark(all in the name of survival,of course)by helping a hopelessly inept kitchen worker--""Garbage boy"" is how he's generally described--named LInguini(Lou Romano),become the toast of the establishment(nay all of Paris)by turning him into a wiz chef,using Linguini as his artist brush(if you will)in creating art and beauty in cooking. <br/><br/>Naturally,there is a fair amount of skepticism that arises over their newfound protégé,which is pretty much represented in all of the kitchen staff,particularly the scheming head chef Skinner(Ian Holm,unrecognizable)and,to a lesser degree,the attractive but somewhat prickly assistant chef named Colette(JAneane Garofolo,also unrecognizable!). The friendship and symbiotic relationship cultivated between Remy and Linguini is tenuous,of course,and what stands between Linguini being tossed and Remy out of food and shelter is always a revelation away. A plot twist has Linguini even more connected to the restaurant than he might initially appear.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Brad Bird(the helmer for the over-ambitious but still largely entertaining ""The INcredibles""),this movie has a lot of burners going(pun only slightly intended)to put together this story,but for the most part,this movie works perfectly. The afore-mentioned plot twist involving Linguini seems somewhat superfluous,but it never really gets in the way of this story's charm.<br/><br/>Maybe someday,PIXAR's exercises in eye-popping visuals and unique characters might hit a wall in terms of have both popularity and quality,but for now,it seems like the wizards of computer animation(who've since mended fences with Disney from a few years back)have another winner. You don't need kids to enjoy this one,but if you have 'em,they probably will. Bon apaetit and enjoy this tasty,lovable selection."

","Not Pixar's best and I for one love food and cooking.<br/><br/>Every movie needs to suspend reality for its audience but this movie seemed to suffer from an uncomfortable case of stage fright. To be sure, an infestation of rats is not the most pleasant subject even in animation. But instead of ignoring this fact, Brad Bird goes to rather painful lengths to explain every minute detail of Remy and Linguini's unusual relationship. The problem is: if you're a child, such explanations are unintelligible and if you're an adult they strain believability and do little to advance the plot or develop the characterization, which are far more important than why Remy doesn't walk on all fours.<br/><br/>The kitchen and the sewer are teaming with chefs and rats and trying to keep each character straight let alone appreciate each of their quirks is challenging to say the least. Here again, instead of letting the characters introduce themselves in a memorable fashion, Bird seems intent on spelling it out for the viewer which is neither lasting nor helpful. But most importantly none of the characters are lovable. Let's face it, this is a kids movie that even adults should find palatable but I was as annoyed with Linguini as the top chef and the rest of the staff with his constant psychoanalysis. The only truly memorable character was O'Toole as Anton Ego, perhaps a little over the top but masterfully concluded.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I found myself questioning the direction of the storyline. The beauty of CG is that each scene can be essentially shot and reshot again and again unlike traditional film making. Having watched most of the DVD extras for Toy Story, Monsters, Cars, etc. I know to what extent the Pixar animators tweak each element of the storyboard to make a cohesive whole. However, Ratatouille seems to lack such cohesion. The opening sequence on the farm seems disconnected from the rest of the movie and Ratatouille's conversations with Gusteau is served up as an odd accompaniment throughout.<br/><br/>To be sure, the animation is stellar and Pixar raises the bar with each new movie. Apparently, this movie completes a list initially envisioned by the creative think tank at Pixar long before Toy Story and A Bugs' Life. However, in this case the best was not saved for last."
"nyskins1","10","0","2","11 July 2007"," Somehow familiar, but also altogether unique, ""Ratatouille"" is the best animated film since ""THe Lion King""
","Ratatouille's protagonist, Remy, explains near the beginning of the film his love of food: ""Each flavor was totally unique. But, combine one flavor with another, and something new was created.""<br/><br/>This philosophy can apply perfectly to Ratatouille. The film is composed of very familiar elements--the love story; an underdog's triumph; family turmoil; scheming businessmen-- but all of these different elements are combined in such a way that an entirely new and wonderful thing is created. As any chef can tell you, too much or too little of any element can kill a dish. Ratatouille's strength is in its balance. Each of the separate story is given its room to develop, and they complement each other as a white wine complements risotto.<br/><br/>Ratatouille is also Pixar's most mature venture yet; the film is a story first and a comedy second. Instead of pouring too much sugar into the film in gag upon gag, the filmmakers allow the plot's inherent charm to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>And entertained the audience remains. The movie is long for an animated feature--at nearly two hours, the film may test the patience of younger viewers. However, the story flows with an adroitness rare to animated features--the story does not feel hurried, as The Lion King does, nor does it feel drawn out, as does Cars.<br/><br/>Pixar also demonstrates that it is far and away the leader in CGI technology; crusty, bubbly French bread is given all of the texture and detail it deserves; Paris and its kitchens come alive in vivid, exacting detail. But Pixar's greatest wisdom is in leaving its humans as cartoons. No human could portray the lovable gawkiness of Linguini, nor the Napoleonic inferiority of Skinner, nor the grave mortality of Ego. By allowing themselves to make the characters caricatures of themselves, the filmmakers are injecting more character development than any amount of exposition could.<br/><br/>Ratatouille's name is rather fitting; in the hands of a lesser chef, ratatouille is a simple, unexciting dish. But in the hands of a great artist, that simplicity can be used to create something extraordinary."
"amit_kumar13","10","0","1","11 July 2007"," What makes this movie tick
","Was there a rush of cartoon movies in the recent years, well then this is just the cherry on the cake. Have you noticed a movie theater audience all stand up and applaud at the end of the movie. Well believe me it happened where i went to watch the preview of this movie. This is not a just another kids movie for sure and this is one of those movies that can make you just keep you entertained the whole time you are watching the movie and give you a great feeling when you are out of the theater.<br/><br/>What makes this movie tick? <br/><br/>* Great concept and story, so much for a cartoon movie... man you could have made a mega serial out of this.... is some one going to make a TV series ..... I am sure some one is already thinking about it <br/><br/>* Wonderful humor and emotions, very less real actors could act better than our hero rat :-) <br/><br/>* Amazing animations<br/><br/>* The voice of the cartoons.... accolades to those who spent hours to get the voice and emotions matching.<br/><br/>* If you are thinking that this movie is too complicated for a kid then you are just too wrong... It has enough fun to bring joy to the kid too. when did rat chase scenes become boring for kids :-) <br/><br/>I am thinking Oscars for this movie... Pixar just showed who rules the world of cartoon movies by making this movie. Ratatouille in real may be a peasant dish, but the movie is just like a meal at a five star hotel.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies for which I can say... If you haven't watched it you are missing something."
"cathie454","7","0","4","2 July 2007"," Good animation, but not the best Pixar
","First, I have to say that Pixar movies are amazing, and Ratatouille is no exception. Great animation, especially the views of Paris at night (of course, how could a view of Paris at night not be incredible?), the scene when Remy is swept away through the sewers under Paris and the first ""chase"" scene in the restaurant's kitchen, when the cooks are trying to catch the rat. I liked that the other rats seem more like rats, swarming through the garbage or when the old lady's ceiling collapses and is full of rats. But I still wouldn't rank this with Nemo, Toy Story or Bug's Life, and I can't quite say why. I thought the first hour was much more enjoyable than the rest of the movie; by that time, the jokes didn't seem as funny, it was a little too slow-moving, and I just wasn't as interested. But it is a good movie. The audience I was in was enjoying it, but not, I thought, as much as the audiences for Nemo or Toy Story. Even though I thought the story idea was good, other than the woman chef, the other characters just didn't seem as interesting by half way through the movie. Still, it's a fun summer movie. The animated short at the beginning, ""Lifted"", was excellent, really inspired, and got many more laughs than Ratatouille."
"zombiez67","8","0","1","25 June 2007"," Rats....that was good
","Kids of all ages will like this film, Pixar has put out some great titles and this will be another one in a great film making history. Very good story and of course animation of the best quality, characters are fun and not over done. It made me laugh many times as the whole theater did, and even got an applause at the end from the movie going patrons.<br/><br/>You should get the family together and jump in the car and catch this movie, and when the DVD comes out get it and put it with Toy Story, Monsters Inc. as it falls in line with these great animated films.<br/><br/>Kids will watch this one over and over again. I know, because my kids made me watch it twice in three days, and i didn't mind.<br/><br/>I will say nothing about the movie and give no clues to its content, you need to watch it and find out for your self. I think i will take my neighbors kids next, just so i can go see it again."
