","Easily not the best mission, but thanks to JJ Abrams direction and an absolute menacing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman this movie is more than deserving of repeat viewings."
"shiftyeyeddog","7","40","53","5 July 2007"," A HUGE improvement over #2
","Not bad at all. After the John Woo craptastic crapfest that was MI2, Lost creator JJ Abrams takes over and makes a flick that is at least as good as the first one, possibly better in some respects. Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast, and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure, it's mostly same-old same-old, but it was fun and action-packed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain, but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual, but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24: The Movie. ...which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3, and I think that'd be just fine."

","If you are craving a non-stop action movie with a decent plot and acting, go no further than MI-3. Tom Cruise reprises the role of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent extraordinaire who is attempting to leave the IMF field work to others as he takes over training of new agents. Can he stand it? Of course not! or the movie would've ended in 10 minutes!<br/><br/>He's engaged to marry Michelle Monaghan as his fiancée Julia. I think their chemistry was pretty good. I recently watched her in Source Code and she's a terrific actress. At an engagement party, Ethan gets a call and next thing you know, he's back in the field. He just has that itch and needs to scratch it. Cruise does a decent acting job of a guy torn between two worlds, where he wants to be just another normal guy, but his whole team is telling him that he can't have a normal life. <br/><br/>His team delivers, particularly Ving Rhames, who is so Mr. Cool. Also Maggie Q has a unique ability to blend in as nobody special, but be made to be very sexy when needed. Jonathan Rhyss Myers was standard. I saw him in Bend it Like Beckham, and he's OK as an actor. Laurence Fishburne delivers as a mega boss type guy who takes no crap or bs from anyone. And finally Billy Crudup as Cruise's mission chief who aids and abets Cruise outside the authority of officialdom. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple, good guys against bad guys. Phillipe S. Hoffman absolutely delivers as evil, sadistic, feelingless arms dealer Owen Davian, who sells anything to anyone for a price with no concern about anyone. Hoffman, RIP, has some tremendous scenes with Cruise, where they go toe to toe in life or death struggles. Whoa, those scenes are really intense emotionally and physically.<br/><br/>The action spans the globe from the US to Germany to Italy to China and back. At a little over 2 hours, the film is nicely paced. There are no real down moments where you feel the movie drags - it's non-stop. At the end, you don't really care about the Rabbit's Foot as much as you do about how it's going to go down. Just strap yourself in and enjoy this fine installment to the MI series. Enjoy."

","J.J. Abrams, creator of Lost, takes on the third instalment of the action franchise, which sees human yo-yo Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in rare human mode as he plans on making an early retirement to be with his nurse wife (Michelle Monaghan), only to be go on another impossible mission as he plans catching sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). To aid him are Ving Rhames, Jonathon Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q, and, this being a third, there are gadgets, explosions, sets and plot twists like now other.<br/><br/>You've got to hand it to Abrams  he certainly knows how to keep an audience on their toes. Drawing on a few of his popular plot devices from Lost (flashbacks, a crescendo to the turning point), he sets us up neatly into his little world, where Ethan Hunt is now a man trying to live a normal life. Whilst that scenario may be a hard to buy, this is redeemed by the many action scenes in the film which are each exhilarating. To go into detail would be spoiling it, but let's just say there is an extremely breathtaking sequence involving a fulcrum, an amusing one involving Tom Cruise disguising himself as someone, and lastly, but by no means least a helicopter chase which is utterly awe-inspiring and barely lets the audience pause for breath. All this, and you get a Michael Giacchino score that perfectly blends action, anxiety, fear and anger.<br/><br/>The cast in themselves are a treat. Tom Cruise, though not given the most trying of tasks in playing an action hero, does a good job with his usual intensity. In the action scenes, his facial expressions are concentrated and focused and utterly convincing. However, Cruise fails in having any genuine chemistry with Michelle Monaghan, for and the romance comes across as rather bland. This is not aided with the poor writing in these scenes. Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q merely look cool as his helpers, and Laurence Fisburne and Billy Crudup successfully bring that edge of moral ambiguity to their characters. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellently malicious as the elusive and extremely dangerous Davian, shining in his lizard-eyed role and bringing some genuine terror to the villain. His scenes aside Tom Cruise are superb, as they practically tremble in tension and quiet hatred on both characters parts.<br/><br/>You will go to see Mission Impossible III expecting some grand-scale set pieces, and you will not be disappointed here. Each one of the four is masterfully executed, with a breezy slickness that is both cool and exciting. We're talking non-stop action, occasionally interspersed with those corny Hollywood love formulae, cruising as ""emotion."" Its big, its bombastic, and it could be the Summer blockbuster of the year."
"Jay_Exiomo","8","282","432","3 May 2006"," So what is the ""rabbit's foot"" anyway?
","""Mission: Impossible III,"" the latest installment of the blockbuster movies which in turn were based from a TV series, is for those looking for a way to start off the summer season at the movies. Here is a movie filled with action and nothing more. There are the usual: Tom Cruise running and getting banged up, high degrees of improbability, explosions, gadgets, the whole shebang. Still, ""M:I:III"" is a fast-paced thriller that manages to get hold of you for the 120-minute span of its running hour and never lets go.<br/><br/>After retiring as Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team leader to lead a ""normal"" life with his fianceé Julia (Michelle Monaghan), Ethan Hunt (Cruise) returns to the team to help recapture criminal arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has escaped from prison and is now making life difficult for the IMF. As for Hunt, his encounter with Davian has upped the ante for him: he not only has to save the world now, he also has to save the woman he loves. Cruise (either you love him or you hate him) still fits into his role well, and Hoffman, who has just won an Oscar for his portrayal of Truman Capote, also effectively displays a chilling seriousness to his villain role. The rest of the cast - Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Michelle Monaghan, etc. - all give nice performances.<br/><br/>It's a given that this film would offer little in terms of intellect or depth in the script. Yet the way director J.J. Abrams and his co-writers injected humor and emotions, plus how its action scenes were superbly handled, save ""M:I:III"" from becoming just another passable popcorn movie which is why I liked it. It is a film intended solely for the purpose of escapism and it achieves that purpose. Although there is a feeling that it could have been more, it easily surpasses the first two ""M:I"" in an explosively stylish way."

","I heard nothing but good things about this movie, so I rented it the first day it was available recently.....and I wasn't disappointed. Oh, it does have a bit too much action and a few politically-correct annoyances but neither are much and overall the movie is a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>The action scenes are not only interesting; they're spectacular at times. Overall, the photography is slick. It's a good visual movie. Not only the cinematography, but the director did a nice job with many of these shots. The version doesn't have all the gimmicks the first Misssion Impossible film, but it certainly has the best action scenes. The only bad movie of the three MIs was the second one. This one makes up for that.<br/><br/>All the characters are interesting. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, is excellent as the main villain ""Owen Damien."" Michelle Monaghan makes for an attractive fiancée of Cruise in this movie, but her role is not a major one. Cruise's ""team"" is fun to watch: a PC group consisting of a white guy, black guy and Asian woman.<br/><br/>The action is improbable as Cruise's ""Ethan Hunt"" would have to be Superman to perform the stunts and acrobatics he does here. (I would never claim this movie is credible, or even ""intelligent"" - just escapist fun.)<br/><br/>Just put your brains on hold, and go along for the wild ride. The name of the game is entertainment, and this movie provides it in spades, hence the good rating."

","I saw this as a sneak preview with my fraternity. I was hesitant to see it because of how bad Mission Impossible 2 was, but I think it more than makes up for the 2nd flop and I would even argue that it's better than the first. The action really is non-stop, and there aren't any cheesy love scenes slowing anything down. The bad guy doesn't change every five minutes either. The plot moves quickly but it doesn't lose the audience at all. You don't need to have seen either of the first two to understand what is going on (I can't remember the plot from either). Lots of guns, loud explosions, cool gadgets and fun locations. I can remember on more than one occasion where the audience clapped or reacted to the action. It does everything an action movie should do very well. I would highly advise anyone who likes action movies to go see it. Even if you think Tom Cruise is a little insane, MI:III is extremely enjoyable."
"DouglasK919","8","14","19","11 May 2006"," great action!!
","Overall I thought this movie was great. I went to it expecting it to be a good action flick. One with good fight scenes and explosions and got just that. The story line could have used a little work, but this blew the 2nd installment out of the water. This movie was definitely needed to revamp the Mission Impossible series. I was kind of hoping for a few more lines from Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but he still played an excellent villain.<br/><br/>As far as story line goes...I'd rate the trilogy this way. 1st movie, 3rd movie, and then dead last is the 2nd.<br/><br/>As far as action...I'd rate this 3rd installment as the best! If you are looking for an entertaining movie this will definitely grasp it. Enjoy!"
"craig-hopton","7","4","4","19 October 2015"," Forgettable but excellent!
","A strong movie in the series. The action is pretty constant and of high quality throughout. But its real strength comes from Philip Seymour Hoffman who is excellent as the ruthless, suave, in-control bad guy.<br/><br/>The curious thing about Mission Impossible III is despite being very good it's the most easily forgettable of the series. I think this is because of the plot - which centres round the theft of a 'rabbit's foot' but we never really find out what the rabbit's foot is.<br/><br/>Highlights include Cruise jumping on the roofs of skyscrapers, electrocuting himself, and plenty of good old face-mask trickery. It's delightful viewing."
"murrayspeer","5","85","152","7 May 2006"," A Depressingly Ordinary Action Film
","If you liked ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" then... go watch it again instead of seeing this movie.<br/><br/>MI:3 tries to have intrigue, espionage, action, suspense, and a touching romantic subplot, but it falls short on all levels. There is no 'mystery' to the mystery - only vagueness and obscurity that fails to engage the imagination. The action is unoriginal and confusing, and the ""Ethan's love interest"" plot line is more of a hindrance than an enhancement. The 'twist' ending fell flat as no suspense had been built and I didn't really care about the characters or their mission. The eventual (and obligatory) scene in which the bad guy explains ""why"" is simplistic and lacks any sense of high drama.<br/><br/>Paramount has managed to take one of the most incredible high-concept television series of all time and in the course of three films turn it into a mediocre franchise that bears only a passing (and mostly musical) resemblance to the source material.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Hoffman is brilliant as always, and the people in this movie are certainly pretty (Maggie Q wearing an evening gown that qualifies as ""half-a-dress"" is definitely a highlight). It's not that it's a BAD movie, but there's nothing great or worthwhile about it. 5/10"
"kraddick-1","9","207","394","2 May 2006"," MI:3 Raises the Bar Again
","When you walk into a movie expecting to be blown away by death defying  stunts and tremendous special effects, it's easy to be disappointed.  What a monumental task directors had in making MI3 even more  over-the-top and more spectacular than the first two. Mission  Accomplished. (Sorry.)  Tom Cruise takes Ethan Hunt to new heights. Fishbourne is great as the  ambiguously dirty IMF leader. But the best actor in the movie is Philip  Seymour Hoffman. Not many actors can take a role that's more  one-dimensional than Doctor Evil and turn it into a deeply layered  performance. From an acting standpoint, there was almost a feeling that  he was too good for this movie and the actors around him. He doesn't  breathe the same air as this cast, not even Tom Cruise.  The women in the movie are a dichotomy. On the one hand you have Bahar  Soomekh, an unknown actress who kicks ass and takes names on par with  the bad boys, Cruise, and Ving Rhames. On the other you have Keri  Russell in a part we've seen too many times in this kind of movie. The  wide-eyed innocent who becomes the villain's prize and the hero's  salvation. Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan spend most of this movie  tied to a chair. I hope they're not method actresses. They would have  to spend the last year of filming at home, bound and gagged in the  kitchen. At least they made Monaghan a doctor, so we know she's smart,  even if she's so naïve she thinks her husband works for the department  of transportation.   Forget the love story, forget the corruption at IMF, forget the plot  entirely. None of it matters. All that matters is ""how are we going to  get in"" and ""how are we going to get out"" and the magnificent twists  and turns that follow. Some action movies spend way too much time  milking the set up of a weak script before the explosions and the  stunts finally kick in. Others dull your senses with one mindless  montage of violence and car chases, without a point to be found. MI3  walks the line perfectlythe story is simple enough to understand but  well-thought out enough to not poke gaping holes in it. Now let's get  to the action.   MI3 manages the action sequences smartly, expertly getting your heart  rate (and hopes) up and then bring you crashing back down to earth. The  thrill of victory, the agony of defeat, followed by a 10 minutes of  blah blah blah.   ""You shouldn't get married,"" Ving says to Tom in the middle of a  dangerous operation. ""You know guys who do what we do can't be  married."" By the way, this is another well-worn action film technique.  Inject casual talk between principals during the most intense and  dangerous scenes. It shows that they're so highly-skilled and  confident, they can chat nonchalantly about relationships while in the  middle of an elaborate Vatican City break-in. Thank you Quentin. Thank  you Bruce Willis. But the breaks in the action work. They give you a  chance to buy into the suspense each time, from your feet up.  Acknowledging that you're drained from the previous sequence, they give  you time to catch your breath and then come at you all over again.  The air-to-ground assault on the Washington Bridge is astounding.  Cruise attempting to catapult between two skyscrapers in Shanghais is  beyond belief. Watching him descend way too fast from said skyscraper  in a flimsy parachute, knowing he's going to crash down onto the busy  freeway and immediately be run over by a gas tanker? Priceless.   Remarkable stunts, solid acting, and a villain that may be the best  ever in this genre (Hoffman) makes MI3 the best of the series and maybe  the best action movie ever made. Until 4, that is."

The film is actually really good. The story stronger than before, and they play nicely on feelings this time.<br/><br/>There is also plenty of action :) All in all i would give this 8 out of 10. I personally think there is some really good acting in this one. We have Philip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy, perfect role for him. Others worth mentioning is Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I recently saw an other movie with him - Match Point - and I must say like this actor. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is very mainstream as always.

","Well, this was straight to the point. Finally Hollywood seems to be over their boring (hoping for Oscar) drama movies. Good old Cruise returning as Ethan Hunt is what you will see here. Action consisting of explosions, clever bombs, helicopter chases, flashbacks to True Lies without spoiling too much, evil villains, heartbreaking stunts and a pretty okay script is what you can expect.<br/><br/>Some predictable scenes, but the fast paced action made the effort worth it with some very welcome ideas. You also got to love the scenery. Berlin, Vatikan and China is refreshing to see.<br/><br/>007 look out, hard to match this one! <br/><br/>Long time since I had such fun at the cinema. 9/10!"

","** WARNING ** SPOILER AHEAD **<br/><br/>Recap: Ethan Hunt has found the girl of his dreams and has left active duty at the agency. Now he only train new agents. When one of his former students get captured, Ethan resumes active duty. To his wife-to-be, who of course knows nothing of Ethan's past, he tells that he has to go out of town on a conference. The student, Lindsey Farris, has been captured by a black-market dealer, Owen Davian. Davian is obviously a man with no conscience and has more than a little sadistic twist. Ethan is of course able to rescue Farris, but only to have her die in his arms after Davian planted (during her capture of course), activated and detonated a small explosive charge in her brain.<br/><br/>The mission a failure, Ethan gets a scalding from his superiors. To redeem himself he goes to Rome to capture Davian. This time the mission is a success, but he is about to learn that Davian has a connection to the agency's top level, a connection having lethal consequences...<br/><br/>Comments: I'm not sure whoever took a coffee break here, the director, the writers, the producers, the studio... but somebody did. This is the third installation of the MI movie series. For med MI stands for technical ingenuity, brave plots and plans exercised masterfully keeping everyone (including the viewers) on their edge. This movie does not. The most technical ingenuity, the most MI:ish, I saw was wearing rubber faces and faking voices. I vaguely recall that being done somewhere else. Oh that's it! The previous MI movies!<br/><br/>The problem with a sequel is that you have to top the previous ones. Be a little more clever, have some new gear, offer some new thrills. Evolve. MI3 does not do that. It doesn't even try. I remember the first movie when Ethan and Co broke into and stole from Langley. Apparently so does Luther Stickell as he before what could be the biggest heist yet says (something like) ""Langley was easy"". The movie makers does not, and instead of giving a thrillingly heist, they offer a big great anti-climax. All we get to see from the heist is Luther and the team sitting in their car complaining that Ethan is late. Not a single shot, view is shown from inside the building Ethan broke into. It is not even described, or for that matter, spoken of. That's the coffee-break people! MI _not_ showing a break in, a heist of epic proportions. COME ON! You got to do better than that... or at least try.<br/><br/>To really rub it in, the mastermind behind the evil Davian is a mole inside the agency. What a shock! Wait a minute... now that too feels familiar. Oh yeah... haven't there been moles and rogue agents in the MI movies before? Ah well, both actually! Actually IMF, as the agency is called, must be the worst agency ever. Want to make the world a safer place? Your first step should be... must be to stop IMF. Obviously it is they who educates and sets free the biggest criminals in the world.<br/><br/>I hope you get it by now. MI3 is not new, fresh and clever. It's old, everything has been done before, by themselves nonetheless!<br/><br/>So what we get is a predictable story, decent action and some decent thrilling moments, but nothing new. Not MI, and that's why MI3 is not worthy of the legacy. It is just like any other action flick.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Movieguy_blogs_com","6","161","321","10 May 2006"," I think this movie should have been called 'Ethan Hunt: Superman'
","In 'MI-III' Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). Ethan is an instructor, he is no longer in the field. But when his Protège student is captured by a ruthless arms dealer, he decides to break out of retirement and go to the rescue.<br/><br/>I think this movie should have been called 'Ethan Hunt: Superman'. I think since Tom is one of the producers, he wants to go out with a bang. It is loaded with all out action; so much action that it is really quite unbelievable in parts. I thought the plot was a little weak, however it is certainly better than 'MI-2'. I was very disappointed that Philip Seymour Hoffman had such a small role. He does have a couple of good scenes, but does not appear to be a main character. This movie is all about Tom.<br/><br/>This film pales by comparison to the original 'Mission: Impossible'."
"schappe1","5","54","100","7 May 2006"," Too much Cruise, not enough Schifrin, as usual
","The TV show, which I loved, was about outsmarting people. The IMF was a government sponsored confidence team whose job it was to manipulate events in such a way as to thwart and get rid of the bad guys without anybody even knowing they existed. They use some gadgets but mostly impersonate people to set things up so that they didn't even need to be there for things to play out the way they wanted. They hardly ever used violence and their plots never came down to a car chase, a firefight or a boxing match between the head of the team and the bad guy. That would have been way too sloppy. They would be clinking champagne glasses, knowing ""Our work here is done"" while Lalo Schrifin's classic theme, which had followed them throughout, accenting their every move, began to play in an upbeat mode in celebration of their achievement. They made their impossible missions seem very possible while the audience wondered what it must be like to be that clever.<br/><br/>The movies are about a government sponsored high-tech commando team that uses force to achieve their goals, including Spiderman-like stunts, video-game-like chases, explosions, firefights and duke-outs with the bad guys, all of which would advertise their presence to the world and likely negate anything they accomplish while signing their own death warrants. Obviously a decision was made that this is what the public wants in its action films and that it would find a tradition Mission: Impossible story too boring.<br/><br/>I don't find the movies boring but I do find them exhausting and not very satisfying. What I would have liked is for the first half of the film to a sort of biography of the villain, showing how he became what he was and how he formed his plan for what he wants to do that makes him, (or it could be her), such a threat. Then have the IMF head show up in the middle and get his assignment in some imaginative way, pull together his team, (and let's find out who these people actually are and what interesting things they do when they aren't on assignment-remember that in the TV show they all had other professions), and then run a con that foils the villain, who never knew what hit him.<br/><br/>But the conventional wisdom is that you have to give your audience their first glimpse of the star immediately and these films are all about conventional wisdom. Unfortunately the conventional wisdom didn't include the liberal use of Schifrin's classic theme, which appears slightly at the beginning and over the closing credits of MI:3. I recall in the first movie that the use of the theme over the final action sequence, (its only use in the film), brought the loudest ovation I've ever heard in a movie theater.<br/><br/>That sequence illustrates the problem with the movies better than anything. The bad guy arranges to exchange the MacGuffin for money on the bullet train as its heading for the Chunnel. He then climbs to the top of the speeding train to grab a ladder dropped from a trailing helicopter just before they get to the Chunnel. Does that sound like something a genius would think up? Does any of it in any of the three movies? The impossible has been replaced by the improbable."

Besides the whole ""let's capture the evil bad guy who has a weapon that may destroy all mankind there's also an important twist. Ethan Hunt is betrayed! ZOMGD! An by whom? Well, either: a) His boss, who is always nice and tries to help him (he even lets him escape) b) His boss's boss, who is a tough individual, and doesn't like Ethan nor his attitude<br/><br/>If you answered b), you haven't seen most ""twists"" in the movies lately. It was the bastard ""friendly"" guy all along... Who'da thunk it? The best scene must be where Ethan is handcuffed, and, IN 4 OR LESS SECONDS, head butts the bad guy, steals his pen, and uses it to open the handcuffs! I laughed so loud during that scene, I thought I had done some internal damage. I know he's supposed to be the best of the best, but why not making something more plausible like having him shooting fire bolts from his ass? Then, Ethan is implanted a device in his head. Whilst most people couldn't even move because of the pain, he is capable of crushing the bad guy; creating his own defibrillator in order to die and be resurrected thanks to his wife (who can learn how to properly shoot a weapon in 4 seconds as well... I've heard of gifted but...) AND! saying the cheesiest line possible (right before getting electrocuted)""Wait wait wait....(pause for drama) I LOVE YOU! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!! WHYYYY???

The fact that nobody knows how Ethan can enter a highly-secured vault inside a heavily secured building and come out with the ""Rabbit's foot"". My guess is he disguised himself as a pizza delivery guy, and rang the bell. You know how those Asian folks are suckers for pizza with anchovies and a little Tom Cruise on the side...*sighs* I'm sure there were some good action scenes, but the overall silliness of the whole movie just wiped them out of my memory."

Plus everyone smiles a lot and all go to the same great dentist.<br/><br/>Oh yeah Ethan loves his wife to be so much that an out of the blue mission to save a former female infatuation of his results in Ethan accepting the mission almost immediately.<br/><br/>Such love but I guess that childish paternalism with a former employee is greater than your new life with the most important person in your life right? Oh well I guess the film would have stopped there had he refused the assignment, so off we go on a wild goose chase for some ""holy grail"", ""preperation H"", ""rabbits foot"", ""mojo"" ""x"" who cares? who knows? nobody it's just an excuse to break into places and blow things up.<br/><br/>I saw it on the big screen and can only imagine how boring and shallow such a production would look watching on small screen.<br/><br/>The overall impression I had was a shallow story, nothing to drag you in and keep you hooked. Zero suspense nothing had me on the edge of my seat not even once.

"Theo Robertson","6","16","26","28 July 2010"," Okay Blockbuster
","MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 was originally to have been directed by David Fincher but he dropped out . Next director was Joe Carnahan but he quit before third choice JJ Abrams was hired . Condidering Abrams had never directed a film before you get the impression that the studio were starting to get desperate not to pull the plug on the project . Humanity might have struggled on without seeing MI3 and evolution wouldn't have been affected one way or the other but a studio needs to make money <br/><br/>It's an okay Summer blockbuster , not something you'll remember days later but not something you think you've wasted two hours of your life over and could have been far worse due to the production problems . . It's an uneasy mix of the two previous films in the franchise , where as the first was too complicated for its own good and the second was overly simplistic the third one tries to be character driven as well as plot driven . The back story involves Ethan Hunt failing to save a female IMF agent from the clutches of international arms dealer Owen Davian so makes it his life's mission to bring Davian to justice . Hunt almost succeeds which leads to Davian making it his life's mission to seek cruel revenge on Hunt and Davian is used to seeing his plans succeed <br/><br/>This character driven dynamic of the narrative just about works but it's more to do with the cast rather than the writing . Philip Seymour Hoffman was considered to be the world's best actor when this was released and easily carries the film as baddie Owen Davian . He's hardly the most multi layered written character in the history of cinema but he probably doesn't have to be . He doesn't have to do anything evil because he has the money and power to get other people to carry out his dirty work . Tom Cruise is of course Tom Cruise rather than Ethan Hunt . He smiles a lot which means he's a good guy and you don't want to see him get tortured or killed . One slight casting distraction for Brits is that Simon Pegg who is forever associated with Channel 4 sitcoms crops up as does Sean McGuire who will be forever known for his role in EASTENDERS along with a spectacurally unsuccessful pop career <br/><br/>The film's major set piece , one which involves Davian being rescued by his mercenary team on a bridge . It's an impressive enough Summer blockbuster set piece but unfortunately after this the final third lacks a climax to match this . Instead there's plot turns revealing a traitor and double crosses , lots of running around and Ethan trying to save the woman he loves along with cinematic convention that says if you're heart has stopped it can be easily started by heart massage rather than a defibrillator"
"Quentintarantado","8","94","192","2 May 2006"," This isn't MI:3; it's M:I, and the first worthy to carry that name.
","I agree with most of the posted comments, it's easily the best of the three and I think the secret recipe this time is J.J. Abrams. Producer Cruise has surrounded himself with talented actors before (Henry Czerny, Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave in M:I and Anthony Hopkins and Dougray Scott in M:I 2) and it didn't work so well. He chose a vacuous hole as an actress for M:I 2 (Newton) so we don't buy the romance. He chose two talented directors (DePalma and Woo who have done far better work elsewhere) and it didn't help. Robert Towne did work in both scripts and his contribution didn't turn the movie into a cohesive whole. Both movies were a mess, with some great parts and a lot of bad parts.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has had years of work doing spy drama in Alias, and he seems to recognize how to bring the movie back to its roots.<br/><br/>I mean, essentially, that's what the TV series was, they had a mission and they'd carry it out in the most convoluted way possible, and the suspense was how they'd pull it off despite the million of things that could go wrong.<br/><br/>Abrams is like a magician. He knows the main plot is hokey so he has techniques to misdirect the audience, so we won't be poking sticks into the plot holes and we essentially buy the drama.<br/><br/>It also helps he brings in his own IMF team to make M:I 3, his scriptwriters from Alias, plus the fact he also writes scripts. Who else is better qualified in divining the scriptwriters' intention and directing the scene than one who was a member of the scriptwriting team? With a cohesive writer-director team, add a good team of actors (Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Simon Pegg and the two female leads, Michelle Monaghan and Keri Russell) plus a great scorer (Michael Giacchino who did a great John Barry impression for The Incredibles, doing a great Lalo Schifrin adaptation here), it's like an engine with all cylinders firing in perfect tune, the audience is taken for quite a wild ride.<br/><br/>Even the essence of the story, that they are looking for the ""rabbit's foot"", Simon Pegg's explanation is brushed off as ""It could be my imagination"", and when Fishburne was about to explain it, he didn't! It's a McGuffin, and it's a nod to Hitchcock. In the end, Abrams winked at us and we still ended up grateful for the experience."

"bob the moo","Null","11","17","28 May 2006"," Provides plenty of bangs for the buck but lacks tension or excitement beyond the superficial
","In an attempt to get closer to a ""normal"" life, IMF Agent Ethan Hunt has stepped back from field work and into a training role. His fiancé is none-the-wiser and believes that he works with the local traffic commission, studying patterns and planning improvements. When he learns that one of his top pupils has gone silent in the field and is believed kidnapped, Hunt accepts the offer to lead a rescue team to extract her. The mission sees him coming directly into conflict with the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian.<br/><br/>I didn't expect a great deal from the man that had given me Lost and Alias  both series that rely on forward motion to keep them going rather than doing anything in terms of depth or foundation. And so it was with MI3, because despite a few failed efforts to flesh out Hunt's life with a dog and a wife, the action is the all and we never go long without something going bang. Opening with a tense and engaging scene, the step back in time to Hunt's training role was a bit of a blow but it moved past quickly enough. The actual plot is then rolled out and despite being total nonsense from start to finish, is probably enough for those looking for summer thrills. Those looking for more (which, as a fan of the first MI film, I was) will probably not get it because generally the film eschews any detail or sense of intrigue and heads right for the action and spectacle. This has its merits of course but I must admit I wanted more than just that. As it was I let the noisy and shaky cameras bully me into submission and I found myself enjoying the film even I never doubted that it was quite an unremarkable film that attempts little of interest outside of the visual aspect.<br/><br/>As director Abrams shows that he has an eye for movement and excitement but he mostly does it by artificial means as the material is not there to help him. It is not a great turn from him but he has certainly improved on the disappointing second film in the series. The cast are a strange mix but surprisingly nobody really makes much of an impression and they almost all come over like mere plastic models in one big special effects shot. Cruise does charming, driven, angry or determined as the story requires but other than that he lacks depth and in this film his charisma only got him so far for me. Hoffman is miscast although I can see why he accepted the role; he has good presence but the material he is given is below him and aside from one or two genuinely menacing scenes, he mostly just shouts. Rhames is so-so but the film doesn't do much with new crew members Maggie Q (who admittedly looked great) and Rhys-Meyers (who has a knack of grating on me in most of his performances, not sure why). Fishburne is an obvious red-herring; Monaghan is a non-person, unconvincing in the extreme and only there as a pretty narrative device. Simon Pegg was a very strange discovery and his version of Alias' Marshall didn't really work for me and didn't fit with the flow of the film.<br/><br/>Overall then a noisy film that has plenty of running, shooting, shouting and bangs to make it fit the ""mindless summer blockbuster"" gap at this time of the year. Those looking for more will probably have worked out that Abrams was not the man to give it to them, since hollow but engaging movement without substance is what he does best. The story just about hangs together and I did enjoy the noise but by the end I was longing for some actual, quiet tension and build-up, the like of which the film opened with promisingly but then never managed to deliver again."

Personally, I find it an indigested soufflé full of heavy duty ingredients that don't seem to melt all that way together. Fortysomething super star Tom Crusie - one of my favorites from the 80's and 90's - runs like the wind from Shanghai to the Vatican (the one in Caserta not the one in Rome)I didn't know what the rabbit foot was and, quite simply, I didn't care. In fact I didn't care about any of it. It took a me little while to realize that the wife in jeopardy wasn't Katie Holmes and I was kind of embarrassed for Philip Seymour Hoffman and Billy Crudup. To think that with all the power at Cruise/Wagner's feet, they could be making the most extraordinary movies. Commercial movies too, but how disappointing to find out that their ambitions are so basic and pedestrian. MI3 as an action flick I guess it's okay but, just okay, shouldn't be acceptable and for what I gather, it wasn't. Come on Tom, you can afford to take risks, can't you? So what are you waiting for?

"nick_mcdougall","8","35","69","4 May 2006"," M:I:III works to reinvigorate a series that got tired after one movie.
","I'll say right now i'm not a fan of M:I:II. i saw it out of patriotism, but couldn't have been more disappointed, considering the first movie is an incredibly tense and well thought out thriller. this third installment however, is a strong step back in the right direction, and probably outshines even the first film. After seeing this, i cant wait to see what will happen in the future for this series.<br/><br/>One hugely important element here is the supporting cast, who are all brilliant without exception. Michelle Monaghan as the fiancé makes you completely understand why Ethan Hunt would want to turn his back on his secret service days. Hoffman is unflappably calculating, evil and awesome, the kind of bad guy who doesn't evil monologue, doesn't reveal a thing, and is watching you every second to uncover your weakness. Billy Crudup works perfectly as the agent who seems out of his depth and yet seems completely trustworthy. Jonathan Rhys Myers seems perfectly at ease transforming from one disguise and accent to another, and gives what would have been a throw away part so much more character. Maggie Q is beautiful, and like Myers, gives her character much more than what seems to be written for her. Laurence Fishburn speaks each and every line of dialogue with a degree of cool reserved for his acting style alone. Simon Pegg, i cant watch this man without laughing, he manages to make anything seem funny. If they do in fact make any future instalments for the MI series I really hope they keep some of these characters going on. Ving Rhames has staked himself recurring ground and it would be great to see a few more familiar faces.<br/><br/>Secondly is the direction, Abrams makes his big screen directorial debut count in every way possible. he manages to balance his exploration of both the significance of the characters and the significance of explosive action set pieces in a way that satisfies exactly what i was hoping to see from this film.<br/><br/>The script seems to have taken the strongest elements of the first two movies and mixed them together, so we get to see the intelligence of the first movie through the spy thriller genre, as well as the fast paced, highly stylised antics of the second movie through the action genre. the result is one of excellent cinematic entertainment. rush out and see it. SEE IT NOW I SAY!!!"

","I've seen swiss cheese with less plot holes than this story. Um, can anyone tell me what happens between the moment that ""Ethan"" lands on the building that houses the rabbit's foot and then suddenly appears crashing through a window??? I'm pretty sure they had the budget - OK, no there is NO QUESTION they had the budget.. so why did we avoid this sequence which would have (in my eyes) been a very intriguing super-heroic example of why Ethan is a demigod (although at this point, if you're going to put Tom Cruise in it, you might as well put aliens in as well as part of the back up team).. and yet, no sequence, just some random phone conversation. This dull action non-action movie (and I'm a girl who loves 5th Element and the Transporter) was heavy on the emotional ""choosing marriage"" scenes - there were people laughing out loud during Tom's crocodile tears scene. I mean, it felt like a personal ad about why he's choosing to settle down in a rustic Scientologist family life (hah!). The best thing about this movie was cool chick from KISS KISS BANG BANG (who, other than Lawrence with his awesome scowl, was the best actor in this with a stupid role written by someone who obviously thinks that nurses are people who don't have access to the internet and wouldn't notice their husbands coming home scarred and messed up). The ""big action sequence"" was so horribly shot that (and nonsensical) that there was little scope of the bridge, no explanation why Tom was the only one able to run around and even less rationale in HOW they failed to notice and respond to the set up. Did action heroes need to be portrayed as stupid people, is that it? And if I wanted to see a not-so-cleverly disguised ad for why short actors who subscribe to cult theory are choosing to show off their pro-marital (with a way younger woman which is suspect to begin with), I'd go into a Dianetics center! Geez, what's next? Battlefield Earth part 2 by Tom?"

I would say this movie is like the 'Bourne Identity' or the American version of 'James Bond'. I am big fan of spy movies and I have enjoyed this whole movie and times it was gripping. The movie starts with Tom Cruise being tormented about revealing the truth about the where abouts of a 'Rabbit Foot' as opposed to getting his girl friend killed. The beginning is explosive and the location shots were excellent...I really enjoyed the chopper scene and It has been a while since I have seen such adrenalin rush."
"dead47548","8","8","12","8 January 2008"," A whole mess of fun.
","Certainly one of, if not the, best action films of the decade. A wickedly fun ride with some amazing cinematography and gorgeously intense action scenes. Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers another top-notch performance as one of the greatest villains in cinema history. Billy Crudup is perfectly cast. Though their roles are particularly small, Keri Russell and Simon Pegg could not have been cast more perfectly. I absolutely adore Keri Russell as well. She's so cute and sweet, yet she plays a gun-blaring badass with ease. However the film goes a bit over the top sometimes, and I was really desperate to murder Jonathan Rhys Meyers any time he came on screen. His character is so corny and weak with some of the worst lines I've ever heard. I really wanted him dead every time he spoke. And although it's been a decade, I still can't believe Tom Cruise as a badass secret agent. He's much more believable in this one though, I'll be honest. Easily one of the better films of the straight up action genre."

The action was non-stop, maintaining suspense and excitement that made for a great viewing experience. This film had all the characteristics of a great action movie, until the last ten minutes! It was as if the writers had a block and decided to finish the film with classical repercussions. This was a surprising shock as the script was very solid and elevated this film above the previous Mission Impossible films. This sucked, lost sense of reality with over-used clichés that really let down a great action film."
"adudewhoiscool","9","10","16","19 August 2006"," See it regardless of what you think of Tom Cruise
","We have all heard many things in the media about Tom Cruise, good or bad. We all might be a sick of hearing about him preaching about his ""religion"" and ideas. We all might be sick of the whole ""TomKat"" media infatuation, but one thing that I am not sick of is his movies. The man makes decent movies and that is what we pay our money for anyway. If you are using everything you hear as an excuse to boycott this don't because you would be missing an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has retired as an active agent in IMF, but he has stayed on to train new field agents. Ethan Hunt is then called back into action to recover a missing IMF Agent. Complications arise when Owen Davian holds his fiancée hostage. To safely get her back, Ethan must go retrieve the ""Rabbit's Foot"". Ethan Hunt does retrieve the ""Rabbit's Foot"", but loses it. Ethan Hunt still saves Julia though, without even being able to retrieve the ""Rabbit's Foot"".<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" is a great start to the summer movie season. From the first scene to the very last ""Mission: Impossible III"" grabbed me by the hair and never let go. The action is not too over the top, were you are thinking, ""You have got to be kidding me"" like it was in ""Mission: Impossible II"". The opening scene, which I will not go too into, is very intense and made me want more. A rescue mission was the first of the big action sequences. There are other action scenes too, like an explosive battle on a bridge which is shown in the trailers, which will not disappoint action movie fans. When I was watching this, I was thinking to myself, ""I hope I don't have to use the restroom during this movie."" <br/><br/>What I liked most is that this was more of a team effort then the previous ones, especially ""Mission: Impossible II"", and in order to do that you need a good cast, which this had. Tom Cruise is well Tom Cruise (I mean Ethan Hunt); there is nothing more I can say about that. He does carry this movie but not as much as the other two ""Mission: Impossible"" movies. This is what makes it much better then ""Mission: Impossible II"". <br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman stole the show as Owen Davian; he was very threatening and villainous. Michelle Monaghan played Ethan Hunt's fiancée Julia. Ethan and her had had some chemistry together, but it does not seem hard since Michelle Monaghan at times looked like a Katie Holmes clone. Maggie Q (who plays Zhen Lei) and Keri Russell (who plays Lindsey Farris) were both butt kicking females; which JJ Abrams (the co-writer/director) is very familiar with because of ""Alias"". Lawrence Fishburne and Billy Crudup played Ethan's bosses, John Brassel and Musgrave, which were very likable. Ving Rhames returns from the other films as Luther Stikell and he gave a nice performance as a familiar face. Jonathan Rhys Meyers had a nice role as the transportation expert, Declan. Simon Pegg had some humorous lines as Benji Dunn, an IMF Technician that assists Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Another cool thing is that the movie kept it open for a fourth installment. So why does this movie keep it open for a fourth? It is because the ""Rabbit's Foot"" was never revealed. The audience does not know what the ""Rabbit's Foot"" is. In a way this is a negative though, since there was so much emphasis on finding the ""Rabbit's Foot"", that not discovering it is was a little disappointing. I picture a fourth movie dealing with understanding what the ""Rabbit's Foot"" is and what it does. <br/><br/>JJ Abrams did a great job. I expected this to be more like ""Mission: Impossible II"", where it is more of a brainless action movie then anything else. Instead, this was a realistic spy movie along the lines of the first ""Mission: Impossible"". It was not only a brainless action film, but a brainless action film with twists and a decent plot. This had an ""Alias"" type feel to it, which was not a bad thing. JJ Abrams proved that he could do more then just direct popular television series like ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", he is a motion picture director as well. I cannot wait to see what his future brings up! <br/><br/>Overall this is a lot better then ""Mission: Impossible II"", and just about up to par with ""Mission: Impossible"". I definitely recommend watching this at least once. This has a lot of action, suspense, good supporting cast, and an engaging plot. This is a must see regardless of your thoughts of Tom Cruise!"
"Tweekums","8","4","5","26 April 2014"," An exciting third instalment
","This, the third instalment in the franchise, opens with protagonist Ethan Hunt being questioned by villain Owen Davian. He wants to know where an item called the 'Rabbit's Foot' is and if Ethen doesn't tell him by the time he counts to ten he will kill his wife! When he reaches ten we hear a shot then cut to the opening credits. When he film restarts it is some time before the opening and Ethan, now retired from front line duty and engaged, is called back to rescue an agent he trained who has been captured by Davian. This sets in motion a series of events that will take Ethan and his team to Berlin, the Vatican and finally to Shanghai where the opening confrontation is destined to take place.<br/><br/>Once again the series gains a new director; J.J. Abrams, and anybody who watched his TV series 'Alias' will be used to the device of opening with a scene that comes from near the end of the story a device that works because it gets the viewer wondering how we will get there and more importantly how it will be resolved. From beginning to end there is plenty of exciting action including gunfights, leaping from buildings and the almost mandatory exploding helicopter! Rather than the highly choreographed action of the previous film this feels rougher and more painful. The plot isn't exactly complicated but that doesn't matter; it is all about the ride. Tom Cruise and the regular cast put in good performances and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman is suitably unpleasant as the sadistic Davian. Overall it may be very far-fetched and a little predictable but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun if you enjoyed the first two films you are sure to like this."
"dfle3","8","4","5","21 January 2012"," Solid action/thriller. 77.5%
","I watched this movie on DVD yesterday (Saturday, at the time of writing), after having seen the sequel, ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol"", and not remembering certain developments in the main character's (Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise) life. I know that I'd seen the first two movies...must have missed this third one...perhaps because I didn't like its predecessor that much...or something (I watched the 4th in the series because the cinema chain showing it gave you the chance to win a car if you booked a ticket online...ah, marketing!).<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie does indeed fill in the missing pieces from the 4th in the series. It concerns a romantically entangled Ethan Hunt no longer working in the field for the IMF organisation (his love interest's reaction to what that acronym stands for pretty much spoke for me!) and now working there part time as a trainer of would be field agents. Of course, the IMF comes calling on him again to help out in a mission to rescue an agent he trained who has been kidnapped (the beautiful Keri Russell as field agent Lindsey Farris...the IMF seems to have impossibly high beauty standards for new recruits!).<br/><br/>Predictably, things go pear shaped and soon Ethan Hunt has to deal with a mysterious, shadowy figure called Owen Davian (played coldly and malevolently by Philip Seymour Hoffman...a chilling performance as a truly nasty piece of work). Davian is seeking to sell something of unimaginable value...and possibly something of great power.<br/><br/>The best thrills/tension comes from when Ethan is stretched to his limits trying to save the women he cares for.<br/><br/>The beautiful Michelle Monaghan perhaps has a thankless role (unless she had posters of Tom on her wall while growing up!) playing Ethan's love interest, Julia Meade. She is suitably adorable.<br/><br/>Watching this movie I did get some odd moments with it...where I wasn't engrossed in the proceedings...like: <br/><br/>* Ethan Hunt cracking a smile near the end of the movie...no doubt that is the 'money shot' for Tom Cruise's female fans...I can imagine the director wheedling that out of him with a ""Come on Tom! Show us those pearly whites!"".<br/><br/>* Near the end of the movie, there's a moment which comes across as comedic, concerning some extraordinary measure which must be taken to stop Ethan from dying...maybe everyone knows it's all a bit silly, really, but maybe Tom just doesn't pull off those many moments where he has to emote in this movie...his expression in that scene comes across as something from a teen comedy.<br/><br/>To close, the DVD I watched has some extras, including deleted scenes. There was a good action scene missing from the movie, featuring the beautiful Maggie Q as Ethan's field agent partner Zhen Lei. Hmm...I was watching a scene in the Vatican in the movie...she wears a very revealing dress...I played a scene slowly where she reaches for an item hidden near her leg...something struck me as 'weird'...had a look higher up on Zhen's body...the 'weird' thing was her underwear! I sort of got the impression that she had been digitally altered in some way...haven't seen Basic Instinct...but I was thinking in that direction...don't think anything was digitally altered though...it's just that in trying not have distracting underwear for the actress it actually proved a distraction! <br/><br/>Watching the making of featurette did also remind me of another couple of instances I utilised the slow motion ability of my machine...there are two scenes where Ethan and Lindsey pirouette together in action sequences...apparently Tom went for that ostentatious move...it definitely does catch the eye though. It also seems that a middle aged, behind the scenes woman who is interviewed is not credited...have no idea who she was!"

Life is good for Tom Cruise in Virginia. His IMF days are relatively calm as he trains specialists while posing as an ordinary guy with new fiancé Michelle Monaghan. However, things are about to shatter in striking fashion as a crazed international arms dealer (recent Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) is after an elusive device deemed as an anti-god weapon only known as the ""rabbit's foot"". Thus it is up to Cruise and his new team (franchise alum Ving Rhames and newcomers Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to attempt the difficult and accomplish the impossible. IMF leaders Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup round out the high adrenaline mix. From Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai, ""Mission: Impossible 3"" takes out all the stops and winds itself up into a heated frenzy from its shocking opening sequence all the way to its dramatic, action-packed conclusion. Making the audience forget the disaster that was ""Mission: Impossible 2"", first-time director J.J. Abrams (best known for ABC's breakout television hits ""Alias"" and ""Lost"") gets back to what made the original in 1996 so great and interesting---liquid mercury flow and pace. Cruise is near the top of his game and Hoffman is a legitimate scene-stealer in every sense of the term (even though his screen time is somewhat minuscule when you stop to think about it). The premise did not end up being Jerry Maguire vs. Truman Capote though as the duo gets into a crazed match of wits and verbal exchanges that culminates into sparks that are just as well thought-out and executed as the most intense of action motifs. As summer blockbusters and entertainment vehicles go, you can't do much better at the movie house than this winner. 4 stars out of 5."
"DeamonBROES","7","17","32","28 May 2006"," Worth watching at home.
","This movie is great if you have some free time to spend at home. After watching parts 1 and 2 I thought the 3rd part would be much worse than it actually is. The action is pretty intense, it's definitely not a boring movie. It's a 100% action movie, contains no message at all, just pure entertainment. The acting is pretty good, the cast was well chosen. What to expect from this movie? Explosions, shooting, more explosions, funny hi-tech gear, and so on Just like in the previous parts. But, it ain't a movie that I'd go watch in a theater. It's not the kinda movie you go to see in a theater. I admit, I had fun watching it, but was kinda disappointed. Basically because the movie doesn't show anything new. They use the same gear as in the previous parts, the plot is predictable and not innovative, although there is a surprising twist of action at one point. Overall, its a good movie to watch at home, but I wouldn't waste money on going to a theater."
"john_murdoch2002","5","27","55","6 May 2006"," Mission: Unbalanced
","Mission: Impossible III starts out promising a great premise for the series: a deeper story with a realistic grounding. There was the first Mission: Impossible, which had a cool and slick facade, but left many feeling confused, even betrayed at the movie's treatment of Jim Phelps. Then along came John Woo's version, which stated that it would have a simpler plot with better action scenes, but the plot was so simple to the point of being non-existent. Now, TV wonderment J.J. Abrams (Alias & Lost) promised a healthy synergy of the slickness of the first part with the intensity of the second. Of which, we get both, but the MI:3's pace is so rigid in juggling these two premises that the movie seems to play out like a long television episode.<br/><br/>Not to say that a long episode would be a bad thing, as Mr. Abrams has created two of the best shows on TV right now, but the problem lies with the dialog and the delivery. In one moment, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his new fiancé (Michelle Monaghan) are on a rooftop as Ethan is trying explain to her that he is going somewhere, but can't explain where he is going. The actors speak so quietly for so long that the emotion of the moment is almost lost. There are moments where Mr. Abrams' style of dialog does come out, but one must wonder if the other two writers actually hindered his dialog.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around Ethan Hunt's secret that he keeps from his fiancé about his true job working for the IMF and whether or not an agent can actually have a normal life. Said theory is put to the test when Ethan is called for a mission to retrieve an agent that has been captured, who was Ethan's first trainee that he personally graduated. A mishap with her during the mission causes Ethan to want to dig deeper into the nature of her mission which led to her capture.<br/><br/>Enter our henchman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who does make for the best villain of the series (much like Blowfeld to James Bond) and Mr. Hoffman is an excellent actor, but when pitted against Tom Cruise on the screen, he does not come across as being threatening as much as he does a pawn in a much greater scheme (of which the movie begins starts to take more clever turns). Overall, the goal of the villains is never established except to come across that they are villains.<br/><br/>But audience don't go to Mission: Impossible for a coherent story or a balanced story during the summer, they go for spectacular action sequences. After all, this is the movie that is kicking off the summer season of blockbusters. This is where J.J. Abrams displays his talents as a director. This movie has many great espionage moments, the break into the Vatican is one of the best choreographed thriller scenes in recent years as well as the missile attack on the bridge scene one of the best action scenes of the decade. The action scenes are where this movie truly shines and it's a good thing there is an abundance of them in this film because when the film comes to meet one of it's more emotional scenes, it's such a jerky transition that the audience can feel like they're experiencing first hand what a manic-depressive goes through.<br/><br/>Still, the Mission: Impossible movie franchise has yet to find it's feet and by the third part of the series, it can seem a bit exhausting as the audience waits and compares the style. After three films and nearly $350 million spent on all three, you'd think it would be time that the series found a reliable foundation to fall back on to the way that James Bond or Indiana Jones has. However, the movie churns along like a giant tree without any roots: all display and grandioso, nothing grounding it."
"Michael-70","2","16","30","26 July 2006"," Hoffman's Very Good, the rest is just ludicrous. Disenchanted once again.
","There were enjoyable parts to this film, mostly the scenes with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but overall, this was a completely inert action film. Way too much was simply not believable or acceptable, even when you take into account the routine suspension of physics as we know them on planet Earth that happens frequently in action films. <br/><br/>That helicopter chase with them flying through the wind generators was just ludicrous. Why couldn't the pilot just pull up fifty feet and fly above the damn things? Even though the helicopter in the Chunnel at the end of the original Mission Impossible was equally as dumb, I enjoyed that because at least director Brian De Palma knew it was stupid and made the scene playful by adding one hairy stunt on top of another.<br/><br/>There is a lot in this film that has been stolen from other films. I know that everyone steals, but some people at least try to cover their tracks a little. But in the case of this film, strangely, I think the filmmakers simply may not know that the elements they stole were from other movies. There is a healthy dose of True Lies, License To Kill and On Her Majesty's Secret Service in Mission Impossible III. <br/><br/>The action is mostly incoherent, hard to follow and shot in a quick-cut, hyper-fast way that makes everything look unbelievable and implausible. Surprisingly, the stunt coordinator was Vic Armstrong who has arranged the stunts for several James Bond films (Die Another Day, The World Is Not Enough). He is obviously someone who knows what he's doing, so where did the failure occur? <br/><br/>In the case of Mission Impossible III, it is the filming of the stunt work by TV veteran director J.J. Abrams that is faulty. The other movies in the Mission Impossible series were directed by heavy visual stylists Brian De Palma and John Woo, but this third one has no filmic style at all and in many ways suffers for it. <br/><br/>I wanted to like this film and they did succeed in giving us a good villain (something missing from the recent James Bond films), but there is no evidence that this was intended. I think the filmmakers just got lucky with the casting of Phillip Seymour Hoffman who recognized this kind of film as a lark and seemed determined to have as much fun with the part as possible.<br/><br/>At one point when Tom Cruise is in full make-up so he looks like the villain played by Hoffman, I made a mental note to say something about Cruise's sense of humor and seeming relish at playing the villain while trying to remain the good guy when I stopped myself. It was really Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing this part, not Tom Cruise in make up, so it was once again Hoffman making something completely fun out what was probably dull on the page. <br/><br/>Regarding Cruise's sense of humor. . . well, it has become non-existent. There is a scene at a house party early in the film where all of the woman at the party are maneuvered by the script (rather unbelievably) into saying how sexually attractive they find Tom Cruise. This comes out of nowhere and seems to be here simply to massage Cruise's ego and help dispel the constant ""gay"" rumors that bedevil him. What has happened to Tom Cruise? He seems to have no sense of humor at all anymore and an ego that needs to be massaged by having all the extras fancy him. Whatever happened to that nice kid from Risky Business?<br/><br/>A personal peeve: when a person's heart stops beating and it is luckily re-started by an electric jolt, the person doesn't jump up completely coherent. If your heart has stopped, there is usually something very wrong with you physically and you're not likely to just wake up and go about your business as if nothing much has happened. I hate movies that do this because it is so misleading. Yet this medical lunacy is a major dramatic plot element in Mission Impossible III and was one of the main reasons I disliked the film."
"kooleshwar","6","16","30","12 June 2006"," Enjoyable movie but wheres the intrigue? and wheres the big ending?
","Being the 3rd movie in the series I went into the movie with the required lowered expectations.<br/><br/>This movie met my expectations in some departments while disappointed me in the others.<br/><br/>The movie started out promisingly enough with a sequence involving the rescue of a kidnapped operative. We can see the reason why the retired cruise decides you come out of retirement.<br/><br/>What really doesn't go down with me is that how nowadays all movies EVEN ACTION MOVIES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY LOVE. Are they no other emotions driving mankind, what about the simple action movies what about other sometimes stronger emotions such as greed, survival, patriotism, duty, revenge. Why are we subjected to movie after movie where the whole world revolves around love. It was cool in the first few films but its increasingly irritating that movie makers in order to appeal to a wider audience are force feeding romantic elements down your throat.<br/><br/>To add to that we are forced to cope with Sensitive Action Heros, Strong Women Who rise to the occasion, the over predictable double cross, the faithful team, the oh so simple plot that is as clear as water. Whatever happened to complicated multiple double cross and multiple motivations driven plot where I actually know that people went to see it twice just because they didn't get it the first time. This movie is sanitised for my liking.<br/><br/>The acting especially from Tom Cruise was top class he played the role of a returned special agent all to easily and for the first time and thankfully so looked his age. The rest of the cast which included some great fresh new faces especially Maggie Q were also great making this all to plain movie slightly better.<br/><br/>Hats off to Philip Seymour Hoffman who sent chills down my spine as a menacing arms dealer without the theatrics. He somehow achieved this effect merely by saying things as unemotionally as possible and looking at Tom Cruise with no expression in his face. Just the coldness in his eyes and words were enough to make him a memorable screen villain.<br/><br/>The plot was to simple to be mentioned and the direction was top class but just good as any other A-list Hollywood movie. The locations were again run of the mill and nothing worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Special scenes were the opening sequence with the daring rescue which ends surprisingly. Clearly the best scene was the attack on the bridge on Tom Cruise. The scene had some great action and mind boggling special effects.<br/><br/>The movie lacked the big ending that we have come to associate with the series. The thankfully eliminated the predictable IMPOSSIBLE HEIST but I would have still liked to see a bigger better more exciting ending.<br/><br/>In all a good package that will unfortunately or fortunately appeal to all audiences. Liberally scattered with some great scenes that keep you interested throughout.<br/><br/>Watchable with lowered expectations.<br/><br/>+s a memorable screen villain, great acting and cast, a couple of great scenes, fast pace, complete package, Doesn't Disappoint DESPITE THE HYPE,watched it half price in the morning show hehe <br/><br/>-s tooooooo simple, toooooo predictable, no big ending, complete package, NOTHING NEW TO OFFER.<br/><br/>total 6/10 (however if seen in absolute terms its a 4 but considering lowered expectations reaches a 6)"

The film contains an interesting story in flamboyant treatment, worth two hours'time, written by Alex Kurtzman and J. J. Abrahams and based on the vintage characters by Bruce Heller. Lalo Schifrin's classic score television is again well reused here, at a much higher decibel level and adding a stirring soundtrack by Michael Giacchini. Fascinating and luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by Daniel Mindel. As usual, Tom Cruise co-executive produced, along with Paula Wagner. The motion picture is perfectly directed by J. J. Abrahams. He's a successful producer, writer and director as Television(Lost,Alias, Felicity) as cinema and today is film-making a Star Trek movie, in production.

","The movie is full of action-suspense-tension-nervousness. It will truly impart the idea of impossibility in achieving a mission. Tom cruise is the best choice in this franchise. He successfully delivers the love and interests towards impossibility in achieving a mission. He superbly performs about thinking 2-3 ways at the same time and taking tensions multidimensionally. This is really praiseworthy performace. Tom is just superb even in climax of the movie where he says ""I love u"" before allowing his wife to kill him!. Restless storytelling is needed in this particular movie in order to impart the feeling of rush to the audience. The characterization, story-line, believability will be shadowed by the adrenal rush of the presentation. Definitely not for matured minds. You will need a different perspective to like this movie. If you need relaxation or tired of steadiness, and you want change this is a must and it's also a good choice.<br/><br/>
NOTE----Just think once, not all people are selected for such a dangerous mission. Those people with intelligent and restless minds falls under this vicious circle. The makers of the film thought flawlessly about this concept."

","Again I'm writing about a movie genre that I like very much. This is the first from the new generation of mission impossible movies. Differently from the second one Ethan appears to be more connected an dependent on his friends and his team. In a good way. The character is more realistic and emotional, he's afraid for his wife and you can see he's emotionally disturbed in the appropriate parts, but even then his skills are more than enough to solve the problems. But it's again more realistic than the second one in this aspect too. Footage is improved and there's a nice combination of fast cars, beautiful women and nice clothes and landscapes. But in a certain way, they seem to give less importance to that than they do in 007's movies.

It really has stood the test of time.<br/><br/>What makes MI-3 especially thrilling is the acting performance of the bad guy played by none other than legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. Without a doubt Hoffman plays the most convincing crook in the whole Mission Impossible series. This ferociously vicious character gives MI-3 it's cojones.<br/><br/>The action is over the top and non-stop, like it should be. But it is still credible action, not of the ridiculous kind, well a bit ridiculous, but still very very enjoyable. What a rush! This movie furthermore has a real gritty, tough feel to it. I really liked that. But there are still some excellent jokes in between to lighten things up. And for the first time there is a romance interwoven into the story. I normally hate romances in action movies, but it works well.<br/><br/>I get all I could wish for in a good Mission Impossible series: non stop powerful action with hilarious stunts, tight story and terrific acting performances.

"zkonedog","5","2","2","10 March 2017"," Great Action But Lacks Originality/Characters
","After the widely-acclaimed disappointment that was ""Mission Impossible II"" this third installment (helmed by the formidable JJ Abrams) provides some much-needed polish to a franchise in desperate need of it. Sadly, though, there are too many missed opportunities for character growth and plot for this movie to truly rise above an ""average"" categorization.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""MI3"" sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) called back to the IMF one more time to save a fellow agent (played by Keri Russell). When that operation uncovers international villain Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt is drawn into the chase in more ways than one when his wife-to-be Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is drawn into the plot as well.<br/><br/>In terms of action/gadgets/technology/freneticism, this movie likely has what you are looking for. The nonstop action rivals anything that, say, a ""Bourne"" or Jason Statham flick could ever produce, and the visuals are stunning and slick. For those only looking for action/adventure going in, there's no reason to be disappointed.<br/><br/>At the same time, however, two fatal flaws exist in this film:<br/><br/>First, the characters are mighty weak. Monaghan (though perfectly built for her role) is only ""the girl to be saved"", Hoffman is a terrible villain, and the script doesn't really give Cruise all that much of an opportunity to grow.<br/><br/>Second, the plot (while twisty/turny) is nothing that spy fans haven't seen countless times before. The names/places/dates may have been changed, but pretty much everything else is stock fare for espionage flicks.<br/><br/>Overall, then, while JJ did polish up this franchise a bit, I felt that he didn't buff out enough of the imperfections to make it a truly great film. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it to rocket atop any ""best of"" lists."
"DICK STEEL","8","16","32","2 May 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Mission: Impossible III
","The burning question in everyone's mind will be, does this third Mission live up to its hype, justify its mass publicity, and above all, surpass the first two movies? In my opinion, M:I:III makes it an explosive start to the summer lineup, lives up to the hype it built, but though it took on a more personal look into the life of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, I still felt, and no offense to JJ Abrams, that while it balanced action with personal drama effectively, somehow it lacked that X-factor oomph after all the smoke has cleared, to truly make it one heck of a classic action thriller.<br/><br/>Sure, elements of M:I are there, the mysterious calls, high octane action and technology driven gadgets which self-destruct in 5 seconds, save for the missing traditional opening sequence where images and agents photos are juxtaposed as Lalo Schifrin's theme comes blaring. But that nit pick aside, and don't get me wrong, I did enjoy JJ Abrams contribution to the franchise on the whole.<br/><br/>The gem in this movie is not that large explosion on the bridge where everything blows, or those action scenes in Shanghai. Rather, it's the first few minutes. It's truly intense, and I'd say it's one of the better suspenseful openings of films this year, which sucks you in right into the heat of things, and slowly demands an emotional response from you, which is quite rare in a genre movie like this. It provided Cruise a platform to showcase his acting range of fear, moments of calm, intense rage, desperation, all rolled into one, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, just absolute chilling. If you think that the teaser trailer piece by him is good, wait till you take a look over here, right at the start.<br/><br/>Ethan Matthew Hunt the man is explored in depth, and faces domestic issues that most uniformed men do - the dreadful fear of a loved one put in harm's way. It never is easy to suppress those romantic and primal emotions, and it makes matters worse when you're an agent sworn to secrecy. Hunt in this movie explores this side of his humanity, as he gets embroiled in yet another impossible mission. And I thought given Cruise's recent relationship and marriage to Katie Holmes, it might have helped him to bring across those emotions fairly easily.<br/><br/>This time round, JJ Abrams made better use of the Team. Comprised of old hand Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (Maggie Q), we see the classic IMF teamwork in action as they go from mission to mission, properly utilizing their skill sets. Well, that is until somewhere along the line where you start to realize that Stickell's the joker with the punchlines, Declan's a generic agent, and Zhen is a looker. Well, at least there's a team!<br/><br/>The main villain, Owen Davian (Hoffman), turned out to have very limited screen time, but the Academy Award winning actor managed to make the most out of it. Although his Davian character is one of the more ambiguous villains of late, with agendas not fully spelt out, he gives you the feeling that he's one whom you will do your utmost not to mess with. Either finish him off and do it twice for good measure, or suffer the consequences this cool killer dishes out.<br/><br/>There are some nice ""first times"" in this movie, like watching how the agents banter amongst themselves while executing their plans to a T, how a latex mask is created in real time, and the showing of the interiors of the highly secretive IMF office, but there are some rehashes from the first two movies, and even references from Cruise's earlier movies like Top Gun (motorcycle alongside runway anyone?). Shades of plot repetition like a mole in the organization (I think every secret organization will surely have one), leaping from buildings (I think this is a Hunt specialty) and techniques like falling and breaking fall with the use of cables just inches off the ground, are tongue-in-cheek like references.<br/><br/>If you're a nitpicker, there are also quite a number of obvious security-related flaws in the plot (hey, you're IMF!) - use of codenames is a must, as is the procedure for transporting highly dangerous criminals. It's probably broken a number of standard protocols, but hey, it's a summer movie, so please don't look too much into it (that's a reminder to self). On a fun side, it did have a poke at the US foreign policy, but that's only a poke, before tossing that idea aside from boring audiences who are in for some cool set action pieces.<br/><br/>The much beloved theme surprising becomes a little low key in the score, so don't hold your breath as you wait for it to come on. And if you have a question as to why DHL has so much clout in the marketing efforts, the movie will provide you a satisfactory reason.<br/><br/>All in all, M:I:III provided a fair share of action and quiet moments, personal vendetta versus grande plots and schemes. Will I root for another M:I sequel? Sure, why not, as this installment proved that there is still some mileage in the franchise, after the disastrous M:I:II. It's a good start to the summer."

Ethan Hunt swings to the top of the bad guy's building, disappears inside, and magically retrieves the mystery bad stuff without even showing us how he managed. This, after tricking a half-dozen highly trained guards to look the other way. Golly. I couldn't really care anything about the characters...Ethan Hunt gets married and the bad guy who tortures women captures her to get the good guy to retrieve the bad stuff.

I don't seem to remember more that 30 sec in the whole film that dosen't cut back to scene with T.C. even Ving Rhames ""the only other recurring part"" is reduced to almost a bit part and Philip Seymour Hoffman is great but should have had a bit more time to develop the bad-guy character.

I just can't buy Tom Cruise as an action star. The rest of the cast fits in pretty well, but not enough to save this movie. The plot is weak and the action is sparse. The bottom line is this is a great rental, but save your money and don't go and see it at your local movie house. I found myself near the end of the movie dozing off. The fight scene between Philip Seymore Hoffman, is the best part of the movie, seeing Tom get his ass kicked was the highlight for me, however it did not last long enough.

","For about the first hour and a half Mission: Impossible 3 is the most intense and exciting and quite possibly the sharpest executed Mission yet, but once it gets to the last twenty minutes things start to fall a little out of place, but your heart will be pounding until the last frame. The film tries to combine elements of the first two films; the intelligence and surprising plot twist of the first film, and the intense, loud action of the second, but part three does try to do one thing different that has yet to be done; giving our main hero and lead spy, Ethan Hunt a personal life, and you don't have to have seen True Lies or the first few episodes of Alias (which was created by J.J. Abrams) to know that spies can't have a personal life, it just flat out doesn't work. Just ask Jason Bourne. I originally thought, ""Well this is going to be interesting, it's going to get really personal, and I bet that'll make it much more intense. Cool."" But what this really does is shift the focus of the film from ""the mission"" to Hunt's wife, whose life is now in jeopardy. Hmmm... that doesn't sound much different from the last thirty minutes of M:I-2 does it?<br/><br/>M:I:III isn't really that much different from the other films in the series, and some people might come out saying that this installment is the best of the series. The film does show us for the first time just how a real IMF team carries out missions, which is kind of strange to think that only by the time we get to the third film in the series that it feels like we're seeing it all for the first time. And do you remember how in the first two movies Hunt used a number of face masks to disguise himself? Well we finally get to see where those masks come from and how they are made, and we also get to see how they get their voice to pull the whole trick off, which was actually pretty neat to watch. What's also pretty cool is the variety of missions and different locations that M:I:III travels to; from Berlin to Washington, D.C. to Vatican City and finally ending up in Shanghai, which all makes for some very interesting scenery.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat hard to explain, mostly because it's so vague it's really hard to conclude just what in the hell was actually going on. It's not quite complicated in a fun and interesting way like the first film, and it's not as easy to follow as the second. The film is over stuff with big action stunts and loud shootouts. This film is easily packed with more action than the first two films combined, but there's no real flow to it all like M:I-2, but some of these scenes early on are quite exciting and highly energetic and thrilling, like one particular scene where Hunt has to jump off the roof a skyscraper in Shanghai (which looks like an amazing city at night I must say) only to swing over and crash on top of the building next to it, but overall this movie does feel like a really intense two hour episode of Alias, and I'd expect a little more from Cruise, but this is pretty much exactly what I would have expected from director Abrams.<br/><br/>The romance that the film is built upon isn't that convincing, probably just as convincing as the one in the last movie, but here we are just forced to ""accept it"" and move on. The film also tries to inject a little humor that wasn't really present in the first two films. Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg plays Hunt's techno. guru that did manage to make me laugh, but casting Pegg in a small role wasn't the only good choice in casting, no; the film is pretty well cast throughout; from Keri Russell as Hunt's protégé to Billy Crudup as an IMF team manager, Laurence Fishburne as the IMF operations director and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the icy villain, but they are all underused, which is a damn shame, and even though these are all great choices and it certainly keeps the film entertaining and exciting.<br/><br/>Part of M:I:III is brilliant and some of the best moments in the series. The cinematography is absolutely great, the lighting was brilliant and the action is very intense, but some of it should have been saved for the ending. The first hour is amazing, but the second hour doesn't really surpass what we've seen in the first, and it shouldn't be that way. The first two Mission films peaked with excitement with their finales; with the train sequence in the first and that awesome motorcycle chase and fist fight in the second, and the film tries a little too hard to play it safe in the end, it would have been better if they had just allowed it to take a few more risks, but it chickens out. I would recommend checking out M:I:III if you liked parts one and two, and finishing up at just a little over two hours long, is very well paced and NEVER has a dull moment, and make sure to expect the impossible. This is one of the best action films of the year, and it's sure to push your adrenaline levels to the max. So pop some popcorn, turn off the lights, crank up the surround sound and have some fun!"

","This is, without a doubt, one of the best action movies to date and just as good as the new Mission: Impossible film, Ghost Protocol (which means the best). Ethan Hunt (played by the awesome and bad-ass Tom Cruise) has just gotten married; life has never been better, until the IMF calls Ethan in on a rescue mission to secure and transport a fellow agent, whom Ethan previously trained and mentored. Before the mission is completed, things go from bad to worst; Ethan looses a friend, and a massive terror plot is unveiled for Ethan to prevent.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams, one of the most imaginative and intelligent directors/writers of the decade, mastered this film without breaking a sweat and took it so far that Tom Cruise was even thrown against a car by a (very) close explosion. Tom Cruise is at the top of his game here, giving not just a great acting performance, but a believable take on a man with everything to lose, and shows it in just about every action scene from middle to end. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames, the genius Luther Stickell, and new arrivals Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers play out their roles perfectly. All in all, this film is a great addition to the M:I film series and a wonderful action-packed thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final scene.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars***"
"quatermax-1","8","6","10","8 February 2008"," By far and away the best of the MI movies to date...
","By far and away the best of the MI movies to date, the first having the gall to make the character Jim Phelps from the original TV series into the villain (what were they thinking, and what quicker way to alienate an established fan base?) and the second abandoning the old MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE team formula completely, making it a one-man show and just cashing in on Cruise and the title.<br/><br/>Here the formula is re-established. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now the IMF team leader, having been coaxed back into the field from the training of potential new IMF agents. A team is assembled, with photos and bios a little more hi-tech from the 60s presentation perhaps, and each rightly having their own distinct personality and expertise. Not only that, they are given three (appropriately) Impossible Missions to perform, namely rescuing a fellow agent (and one of Hunt's students) from captivity in Berlin; kidnapping the world's no. 1 villain and arms-dealer (Hoffman) from inside the supposedly impregnable, security-wise, Vatican City itself, and also, as a bonus, leaving the world, and more importantly his buyers, to believe he's dead, then a daring raid atop the nighttime skyscrapers of Shanghai to steal the mysterious and much sought after weapon 'The Rabbit's Foot', the nature of which is never disclosed, and therefore which, like NORTH BY NORTHWEST and many other Hitchcock movies, becomes the 'MacGuffin' of the movie. Hoffman's character sums this up best with the line ""What I'm selling and who I'm selling it to are the least of your problems"". Added to all this is the fact that that Hunt is now romantically involved and his spouse consequently becomes the target of Hoffman's villain's revenge, and also adds a much needed humanity to Cruise's character.<br/><br/>The wit and wiles of TV's IMF squad are admittedly replaced here by ridiculous yet riveting stunts, but when these are beautifully realised and executed under the direction of veteran 2nd Unit director and stuntman/co-ordinator Vic (Bond) Armstrong, you can't go far wrong, especially with a budget that Eon would cry for.<br/><br/>British actor Simon Pegg (SHAUN OF THE DEAD - see my review in the archives) makes a welcome appearance as a 'Q' like computer boffin at IMF HQ, and eventual reluctant inside man to rogue agent Hunt. As I know of Simon's love of cult 60s TV this must have been a dream of a job. He's also appeared in the new BBC DR. WHO series and narrates their accompanying 'Behind the Scenes' documentaries. Good man Simon.<br/><br/>Recent multi-award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman's (CAPOTE) villain is wonderfully underplayed and just plain arrogant and mean. He's great in this, and I couldn't help but feel there was a little, perhaps deliberate, touch of the Bond/Le Schiffre frisson (in the notorious wicker chair sequence in the original CASINO ROYALE novel) in the attention grabbing teaser which may foreshadow that forthcoming movie. The final and inevitable punch-up between him and Cruise is particularly, and necessarily, brutal and satisfying. The rest of the cast also pull off some top notch performances, considering the material.<br/><br/>On top of all that there's more of Lalo Schifrin's glorious original MISSION music, notably the militaristic 'THE PLOT', which underscores the team's preliminary preparations, as it should. Okay, the identity of the inevitable double-agent/sneak within the IMF organisation is a bit telegraphed, but that's okay. At least it gives you the satisfaction of thinking you've sorted one of the plot points out ahead of everyone else.<br/><br/>Considering that the spy TV series of the 60s were spawned by the Bond movies, this one has surpassed its progenitor. This is Ludlum meets Fleming, i.e.: Bourne meets Bond, and both of those franchises are going to have to go some to beat this.<br/><br/>This one also puts the floundering Cruise firmly, and literally, back in the picture."
"Camera-Obscura","Null","6","10","27 December 2006"," Spiderman Two and a Half and the Rabbit's Foot
","This comment is mainly for those who already seen the movie and wanna read how users unload their frustrations about the levels of stupidity in MI:3<br/><br/>This is not Alice in Wonderland, but we're looking for the Rabbit's Foot. Nobody knows what it is, and we'll never know. This is Mission Impossible The Third, which means everything is done in the name of action and nothing else. I repeat NOTHING else. From the little joke about marriage in the opening scene at the party, expect action on a grand scale and levels of stupidity on an even grander scale.<br/><br/>It's like having the large steak, but you forgot to order anything on the side. There's nothing wrong with the steak, but some fries, salad or sauce would be nice. It's a bit raw this way, but basically, every idiot can serve it like that. What matters is what a good chef can do with it.<br/><br/>In the latest entry of the franchise, you can prepare your' own damn steak. His Royal Highness, Tom Cruise, has officially become a comic book hero in possession of supernatural powers. Now, in part I and II, we already learned there has to be lots of airborne action. Cruise jumps of buildings, threatens dangerous villains by hanging them upside down from a plane, jumps of bridges, jumps from one tall building to another, parachutes of tall buildings, flying from skyscrapers, climbs high walls near The Vatican. For credibility's sake, this does leave him a little scratched. He's no comic book hero yet. He's still half-human, half-God, after all.<br/><br/>Davian, an evil arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) is the super-villain here. The IMF seems to know all about his secret technology deals with Korea and ""some Jihad-like"" country or organization, but they don't know anything about the man's habits or whereabouts, which seems to be a perfect excuse for not telling the audience anything about him either, which makes the character not very interesting to begin with. Furthermore, we are made clear that the IMF cannot find this man in any way. At least that's what we hear in the beginning of the film. But, when Ethan is involved, he is tracked down almost immediately, not once, but every time they want to go looking for him.<br/><br/>Now, many people will argue the sole purpose of the film is action, and MI:3 delivers just that. Well, partly. Basically, we have three long (about twenty minutes) action sequences, with some scant - mostly confusing - plot elements thrown at the audience, that don't make a whole lot of sense. Now, there are lots of films that can put credibility to the test, but the way it's done here and right from the start, it greatly distracts from the action. When all credibility is thrown out the window with the first action sequence, it's hard to believe anything that follows and the enjoyment of the action sinks to levels of little boys who wanna watch explosions. The provided locale is clearly not chosen to help the plot. Not even the slightest hint is given why we are in Berlin, where big evil Davian hides in an abandoned factory. Next, evil Davian is in The Vatican, where - naturally - arms dealers do a lot of business, next they drive on the Chesapeake Bridge for no reason. Well, the script says they have to land the plane somewhere in Delaware and drive 200 miles across the bridge to Virginia where the headquarters of the IMF are based, so we can have a convenient location for some ass-kicking action on a cool-looking bridge. Next, he is in Shanghai, next...<br/><br/>It doesn't matter because we already stopped caring. <br/><br/>The action is well done, no question about it, but with a plot, set-ups this stupid, and a total lack of humor, the only way to look at the action is for technical achievements. Compared to this gibber jibber, Steven Seagal's films begin to look like inaccessible intellectualism. You won't be bored by MI:3. For that, it's simply too well made, with some impressive, almost non-stop, action, so in that department, it delivers. On all other levels, it fails completely. Soulless, mindless stupidity.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 5/10"

OK, but did it connect? <br/><br/>OK, from the top: The intro scene is supposed, by tradition, to be spectacular, and hopefully connect to the rest of the film. Well, here it's merely kind of ""This was a strong scene let's put it first as well"", out of order, and juxtaposed for maximum effect, beyond acceptance if you ask me. Bad guy: ""...10"" Blam! / Over to: Party party - happy Ethan getting engaged. Supposed to be disgusting and it is. And when it happens again, the shooting scene, it turned out somebody else got shot, of course, not the real wife, just some woman we don't care about... hello?<br/><br/>But the real problem is the plot, where did the what-ever-it-was go?<br/><br/>And the end, the Happy End, was simply too much, the concentrate version of happyending, Boss is kind, wife meets his friends, everyone laughs, hugs, they leave in slo-mo as the friends cheer in the background...?! <br/><br/>Sorry, too much, too stupid, too bad."
"LeslieLLKing","1","15","32","9 May 2006"," Mad TV are you warming up?
","This film is a tough nut to crack. Why? It is based upon good vs. evil. What is the evil founded? We know terrorism is evil. And, we know it is founded upon hatred for America, ""anti-American sentiment."" The picture of terrorism is clear and we know exactly why violent crimes occur. But, in MI III, the force behind the evil is not clear, and that diminishes our identification of good vs. evil. Evil takes the form of Davian, none other than a demented man set on grotesque women maiming, as in the case of agent Lindsey Ferris, (Kerry Russell) one of Ethan's newly accomplished students, and Julia, (Michelle Monaghan) Ethan's new bride. Davian's anti-woman charms seem trite, and so does terrorism for that matter, but the sad fact is, neither is extinct from our culture, only a part of it.<br/><br/>Why does Tom have to play such a battered hero? It seems like I just recovered from War of The Worlds. But everyone has different breadth, so to speak, and he uses his to best portray the character he is identifying.<br/><br/>Ethan's first mission is clear, save agent Lindsey, captive of Davian. Unfortunately, Ethan can't intercept, a deadly body implant chip. His second mission proceeds logically, capture Davian. When Davian takes Ethan's new bride hostage, Ethan follows Davian's instruction, for the safe return of beloved, Julia. Suddenly, John Musgrave, (Billy Crudop) Ethan's consultant, admits his own opportunities for steeling the rabbit's foot. Hunt's ultimate mission prevails, save a second woman's life. The first one died. Ving Rhames, as Luther Strickell, delivers a fine performance, under the pressures of his role too. Laurence Fishburne, as Hunt's boss, John Brassel is likewise is good. But for the lack of identity in this rabbit's foot, his role weakens in credibility. It's like choosing to engage in fighting a war, not knowing if the country really has weapons of mass destruction, that will be used to harm others. Almost every country has weapons of mass destruction, but are they threatening to use them to kill millions of people or any people for that matter? <br/><br/>Once Ethan has possession of the bargaining chip, he realizes that even that does not matter. The last mission is clearly to save his wife, whatever the cost, even his own life. It's the one mission that he doesn't fail, the one he wasn't meant to fail. Who restores his lost breadth? His wife of course, pounding on his chest, for any last hope of a heart beat. Undoubtedly, he's got to be ready for that honeymoon. He proved to be an active agent and husband, but at what price? <br/><br/>This script is incredibly weak on depicting reasons to evil intent, which truly detracts from Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, to one of mere crazed bully, in need of great help, at being healthily and happily integrated, with the female species. In moments, Ethan's resentment towards Davian is equally vicious and crazed. Hoffman is such an excellent actor, but as is the case, his evilness is portrayed at a lesser value, debasing it to incomprehension, unfortunately. A simple point to remember is that, just as much as I want to know why someone is good, I also want to know why someone is evil  the root, lack of love.<br/><br/>There are some great bells and whistles, that inspire the camera, raising our eyebrows in interest  an exotic Asian woman, in a sexy red evening gown, a bright orange Ferrari, that is set for wonderful detonation of self-disposal, and lest one not forget, the modern and vintage downtown landscapes of China. But frankly, for all the physical work Tom had to do, I would have polished him up, in something other than a priest's habit, at the Vatican. In the second half, I might, as well, have been watching War of the Worlds. It was all a little too ""Go Army,"" for me. Yet, the close-up shot of him in the black and white suit, among the green landscape, following Lindsey's funeral was sweet. I had a piano, that photo could sit on top of it. Personally, a little more James Bond portrayal would have been sweeter. So, it's not Hallie Berry coming out of the ocean in a bikini, it's Tom Cruise, in some nice trunks, beaching it with his new wife, sipping on tropical drinks, with little umbrellas in them. Maybe another scene with Tom zipping through tight streets on a moped, rather than an x powered Harley. In this film, he is always in need of a truck, not a motorcycle. If I was him, I'd say put the honeymoon scene in first, and then I'll do the picture. Some men ought to have smarter women dealing for them. That's what I would have pushed. So, I am talking a little less explosive and a little more naturally refined. James Bond meets Ethan Hunt, viola! You have probably near the perfect hero! Every hero has to have some special vulnerability, related to female sensibilities and charms. Bond, as we know, probably has too many, maybe Hunt, too few?<br/><br/>Movies are a chance to shape physical action to the script's story. For the painstaking, if not punishing stunts that Tom performed, both action and story were typical and unmemorable  missing charm, creativity, and most of all opportunity, to captivate an audience in the way that they could be, by more deeply portraying good vs. evil. Maybe the rabbit's foot was really nothing, but a story once told, nevertheless a reason for Davian to say that he must have it. And in the end, the elusive rabbit's foot, could have been quite possibly a story, a folk tale. One woman died a brutal death, and one walked away free, with strength and belief enough, to save the hero's life. And from that lesson and that result, good prevailed, and the love of mankind, and the sanctity of peace and care."

","Yet again there is another woman in peril, who Cruise must save, some action sequences borrowing directly from the Matrix, with all of the jumping and slow motion, and Tom Cruise has yet to show me he can act. He seems to have the opposite of the Midas touch, everything he touches turns bad, but the problem here is that Cruise produced it, this was pretty much his baby yet again, and he made the plots so hokey, and clichéd (how many time has someone been on a motorcycle looking like he's mad at the world with sunglasses?) And Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall?! When he said that I was like 'Are you kidding?!' I can't believe he actually said that. I don't know if Tom Cruise really thought he was cool, by now he and his team who pretty much look like GQ cover models have not proved they can act, they look good, but they can't act.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the one who takes the cake. Here he is one of the richest men in Hollywood, got that way pretty much on his appeal as a sex symbol, used to be clean cut, and now he is trying to reinvent himself as some goteed rebel, but it just doesn't work. He never was a rebel before, just some pretty boy who couldn't act, and he never could. The story is not about any kind of spying it is about Tom Cruise being cool. Everything seems to work out perfectly for him, no matter how bad things get every time some car is barreling for him it manages to stop just in time. I wouldn't be so upset with it except he seems to expect the audience to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laurence Fishburne, two fine actors have no business appearing in this movie. They are very good actors and they need to stick to good movies. I guess they both felt they needed the exposure or the money. No one in this movie is required to act, and that is the most sad for those two. Cruise's acting really is his make up, which make him look hurt, or tired, but he can't do it himself.<br/><br/>The ultimate problem with this movie is that there is very little resemblance to the original TV show. It didn't have this kind of action, or slow motion beat downs, it had some but most of that show was with your mind, and they figured everything out without beating people up. If they want to make a movie like this fine but don't call it Mission Impossible, this has nothing to do with the original classic series anymore. By now pretty much all of the action runs together, it looks the same, feels the same and pretty much has the same consequence, and this movie has the same formula so many other movies do: A lesser bad guy and then the main bad guy. Both of them find their unusual ways to die, which happen to be so cool, but still so clichéd.<br/><br/>I guess that is the ultimate problem with this movie: clichés. This pretty much was no different from any other action movie, and with a 150 million dollar budget I guess I expected too much. And I guess I shouldn't have expected it any better, the only reason I saw it was on account of the movie I wanted to see started too early. StillI am hearing Cruise is gonna star in a remake of 3:10 to Yuma. I plead to you Mr. Cruise: You have ruined a classic TV series, please don't ruin a classic movie too."

","So what went wrong?...<br/><br/>Well, first off, there seems to be a great difference in general about the prequels to this movie. The first one was an intense movie that lacked action a great deal whereas the second one was really just action and absolutely nothing more. <br/><br/>Now, if you ask me which movie I like best and which one is the most true to one of the TV-shows bla bla bla I have to draw a blank. The first one, for me, can be seen more times and the second one gives me the 30 minute adrenaline rush at the end every time. I like them both at their own merits and I can't determine which one is best, it depends on my mood, so no I will not shoot down the second one.<br/><br/>What has happened now is what might seem like the ultimate solution to appeal to a wider audience, combine the intense plot with tons of ""impossible"" action. I must admit that even to me that sounds great... On paper. On the big screen, as it turns out, it just doesn't work. Who would have figured that?<br/><br/>In this movie they try to expand on the character of Ethan Hunt and they simply fail. They try to almost copy/paste the story of the first movie and damn if they don't try to copy John Woo's action style (only in the beginning though Abrams leaves his mark in the few uncreative ways he can think of). Wanting to succeed so bad in both the thriller and action genre seems to have forced J.J. into formula film making. This is always good for the youngsters so the movie will make it's money back.<br/><br/>For those of us over 15 we are left standing lonely in the outside the theater hoping for the manager to realize what he has done and give us a refund.<br/><br/>Some quick tips for those who haven't seen it and are on the fence about it:<br/><br/><ul><li>If you liked the first movie but not the second, don't see this one. - If you liked the second movie but not the first, don't see this one. - If you just like a lot of un-innovative action and a predictable storyline, well gosh darn it if this isn't the movie for you.</li></ul><br/><br/>4/10 - For some entertainment value here and there."

Can midget's be action heroes? Of course. I'm not prejudiced against the vertically challenged. But to be an action hero midget, you've got to be more than a midget. You've got to also be an action hero. And Tom Cruise isn't an action hero. He's just a goofy little midget.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood can kick my ass. Bruce Willis can kick my ass. Sigourney Weaver can kick my ass. Even Joe Pesci, that quasi-midget bumbling bandit from ""Home Alone"" 1 and 2, can kick my ass. They are true action heroes. They destroy you with their deadly silence and sudden flashes of violence.<br/><br/>But Tom Cruise is no action hero. Action heroes don't work in teams. They don't use words like ""mission impossible"" and they don't hang upside down from ceilings like overdressed acrobats.<br/><br/>A common misconception is that action heroes must do action. No. A true action hero prides himself in in-action. Clint Eastwood roams his films silently and slowly. But when his hands do finally drift toward their holsters, ten people die, ten seconds later. Do the math. Ten corpses in ten seconds. Sixty corpses in one minute. Thirty six hundred in one hour. 86400 deaths per day. Clint Eastwood could kill the population of China in less than a year.<br/><br/>It took Tom Cruise half an hour to kill 12 people in ""Mission Impossible 2"". It took him twenty minutes to kill 2 villains during the final showdown of ""Mission Impossible 1"". These are clearly not the mortality rates of an action hero.<br/><br/>But to make things worse, ""Mission Impossible 3"" is about Tom Cruise's wife getting kidnapped. His wife? Domestic drama does not belong in the ""Mission Impossible"" series. If I wanted to watch a movie about women and midgets I'd watch...I don't know, ""Little Women"".<br/><br/>What's Ethan Hunt doing in a romantic relationship anyway? Action heroes only have one relationship. The relationship between them and death!<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver spent 4 movies kicking alien butt, but I didn't see her begging for a husband. Charles Brosnan didn't moan about his dead wife whilst mercilessly gunning down punks.<br/><br/>To be a true action hero, you've got to be a cocktail of quick carnage and quiet wisdom. You've also got to have no human attachments. From the wise Japanese samurai of ""Yojimbo"", to Bruce Willis' John Mclane in the ""Die Hard trilogy"", true action heroes all have one thing in common: they're loners.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood don't need no stinkin' sidekick. Lee Van Cleef always rides alone and Rambo didn't even bother to learn English. Who's he gonna talk to? His guns? Even John McClane, the ironic action hero of the 90's, kills a skyscraper full of terrorists just so he can tell his wife he wants a divorce. That is true manliness.<br/><br/>But nah, the golden age of the action hero is dead. These days we got pretty boys like Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruise jumping around like little sissy girls on wires.

The audience thought it was a hoot, but this dopey scene belongs in a slapstick comedy, not in an action picture which tries so hard to be taken somewhat seriously!<br/><br/>Next, I want some character development, so I can care about some of the characters, just a tad bit. For example, I'd like to know something about this relationship between Ethan Hunt and his newly wed wife. In MI3 romantic love comes across as maudlin and forced. Like a bad 50's movie. Nothing lifts the heart. There simply is no satisfaction on any level! <br/><br/>Now comes the acting. When I start yearning for Arnold Schwartzenagger, I know Tom Cruise has hit rock bottom. His acting is not the least bit convincing. He almost comes across as uncomfortable madly kissing his ""wife"". All I can hear in the background is, ""where's my contract"", ""I want more money"", or ""I got places to be, people to see."" Memo to Tom: What happened to the depth you have shown in Risky Business, Born On The Fourth Of July or Jerry Maguire? If your hearts not in it, don't do it, Tom! Stop treating yourself like some commodity on an exchange! Otherwise, you will wreck your career all that much sooner! It was Friday night, and only about 25 people were in the audience in a theater that easily sits 500, and MI3 has only been out for a couple of weeks! <br/><br/>Lastly, I would love it if the story made some sense. Here's one good example: What's the connection to the Vatican City? Nice film-making, too bad it wasn't a travel documentary! Oh, it's so ""cool"" when the MI3 crew gleefully blow-up their $100,000 sports car, like any garden variety terrorist, while still inside the tiny Vatican City's walls. But I hope the Pope, or anyone else, for that matter, was not passing nearby! How stupid, on so many different levels, can Corporate Hollywood get? If you need to take a swipe at the Catholic Church, can it at least have something to do with the story? If I have deterred a single person from spending their hard earned money on this trash, then it was worth the effort to write this review. Vote with your pocketbook so Hollywood is not tempted into making MI4! If you got to see it, wait till it comes out on DVD and borrow it from your local public library for free!"

","J.J. Abrams is the director for part three in the Mission: Impossible franchise, meaning that there is an excess of lens flares but also a surfeit of top-notch action making this one yet another small step in the right direction for the series.<br/><br/>This time around, retired agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes back in the field to try and apprehend Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a sadistic arms dealer who is trying to get his hands on a device code-named ""The Rabbit's Foot"". In doing so, Hunt not only puts his own life at risk but also that of his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan).<br/><br/>Where parts 1 and 2 were sparing with their action scenes, Mission: Impossible III's pace is much faster, Abrams going all out for tension and excitement, including a superb helicopter chase through a wind-farm, Hunt breaking into the Vatican to capture Davian, an explosive attack on a bridge, and a perilous leap for our hero from one skyscraper to another. As slam-bang Summer blockbusters go, it definitely doesn't disappoint, even though the plot does tend to get a bit silly at times (yes, the rubber mask disguise routine makes an appearance and is still as daft as ever).<br/><br/>In the supporting roles, Hoffman makes for a very credible villain, Monaghan is likable as Hunt's Achilles heel, Simon Pegg is reasonable enough as comic relief tech geek Benji Dunn, and Maggie Q supplies the glamour as IMF agent Zhen Lei (while also adding appeal for the Asian market). Billy Crudup and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, on the other hand, are forgettable and Ving Rhames is sorely wasted."

","Although this installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is certainly a better effort than the abysmal showing we had in MI:2, this movie still misses the mark by miles.<br/><br/>We have come to know Ethan Hunt, or so we think, but even familiarity with that character is taken from us and we are never allowed to know him or connect with him again. We are introduced to his ""new"" team, but the characters are never fleshed out and we never connect with any of them. Hunt's girlfriend is thrown at us and we are to gather that he loves her, but we never are allowed to get to understand how they came to meet, or make a connection with the couple. Likewise the character of Hunt's protégé whose rescue takes up a large part of the film is tossed at us and only much later are we allowed to understand Hunt's connection to her.<br/><br/>Unlike MI:2, at least this outing has a plot, but even then, the story is tossed at us in pieces and in flashbacks too long after the questions arise in our minds to help us understand or enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise needs to stop now before we have to endure an MI:4 which could be subtitled Action for Action's Sake."

There isn't any suspense, JJ Abrams thinks he's writing for television, so the movie is structured like a double-episode of an action TV show (season finale or opening of a good one like Prison Break or 24), no psychological portraits, valuable message on anything, soundtrack or funny parts, just a very enjoyable action scenes stream. And what a stream! The h.o.l.l.y.w.o.o.d. ending is kinda lame, some 'But Ethan Hunt have feelings now, he's a guy, just a guy, a simple guy, a simple guy with feelings' scenes are pretty annoying and some characters are almost badly written (Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q ones) but who cares ? That's not the point.<br/><br/>While Tom Cruise does his generic action hero thing again, PS Hoffman is simply amazing ; just imagine a mix between Clarence Boddicker, Hans Gruber and some cold eyed, blond haired torture radical (an evil Jack Bauer if you want)..

Throughout the movie my heart was pounding and no one dared look away from the screen or they might miss something. An eight out of ten rating may be a little bit high, but I had fun watching this movie and it was a great movie to see with your entire family. There was no cursing or awkward scenes. This was simply an action packed movie with a better plot than I thought it would have. I would definitely recommend people go see this movie, just for the sake of having fun at the movies, even if it isn't an epic drama. There are those scenes where Tom Cruise almost gets killed, but he is still able to take out all the bad guys and escape. So what if it isn't realistic. I loved it.

","The first two movies were action packed, thrilling and overall highly entertaining, and so is MI 3. But this one simply outdoes both of them single handedly. MI 3 is the most powerful and one of the best films in the franchise which gets everything right: action, performances, suspense, scale and of course, its title. It really has situations which will make you care for the characters and even wonder if they can succeed. The challenges are intense and stakes are high. MI 3 is even more fun, and apart from all the explosions, stunts, chases and fights, the film also provides you a real menacing villain. Even today, MI 3 is one of the greatest action films of all time."

","Mission: Impossible III is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. The first two films were formulaic, average action films, this is when the franchise started to really find its place. Delivering on its potential, this movie is truly special from any other action, it will keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish, as well as truly having you care for these characters. The stakes are higher this time as a result of being more grounded, instead of Ethan Hunt having to save the whole world, like in the second film, he instead merely has to keep his wife safe, it's far more personal, making it more concerning for us as an audience. <br/><br/>It does take a while to get going, while I do appreciate the time it takes to develop the characters, there does come a certain point where we just want to get on with the action. I just do not think it needed to have as much dialogue heavy scenes as it did. <br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, all delivering performances that are significantly more powerful than your typical action film. Tom Cruise is as great as ever as Ethan Hunt, boasting great chemistry with Michelle Monaghan, and Simon Pegg serves as excellent comic relief. As well as that, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is spellbinding as the films antagonist, he is thrilling and immensely intense in every scene, a realistic villain that grabbed me from start to finish. <br/><br/>The franchise finally finds its place, and it is a great place to be. Action packed and very engrossing, Mission: Impossible III is a stellar movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. <br/><br/>After getting engaged, Ethan Hunt is put in to conflict with a ruthless arms dealer, putting his fianceé in danger in the process. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Cruise"

I would agree that it has that perfect balance of fun, escapism and entertainment balanced with just enough reality to buy into it. It is not easy to pull off!<br/><br/>I am a sap though, and love the fact their is a real romance in this one. It adds to the tension so much more than when there is no emotional strings to play on the audience like in the most recent addition. Also the supporting cast is so good in this movie.

","I very much enjoyed this installment of the Mission: Impossible series. In fact, I think it is by far the best of the three! Digital technology was not overused like it was in the first three, and the characters were more interesting. Simon Pegg as Benjii was excellent, and the plot was vaguely believable, although predictable. However, there were some things that made no sense to me. Why, if IMF is so secret, did a couple dozen agents surround Hunt in a CROWDED, PUBLIC SPACE, and shoot him with a taser? Also, how did the drone end up in US airspace without being challenged AFTER 9/11? Other than those strikingly bizarre details, though, the movie was quite well done. In short, JJ Abrams has done it again!"

","During movie debates with pals, the common enquiry of 'which is your favourite of the trilogy?' will often arise. Well usually I can easily answer that straight away, whether it be the early Star Wars, Godfathers or Miller's Max films. But Mission Impossible when pondered isn't cut and dry. Brian De Palma's 1996 opener, was a well crafted classy affair. A tight detective thriller laced with superb action scenes and great cast, modernised for a new younger audience, whilst staying faithful to the original series. John Woo's 2000 effort, was very cool, very action packed and a great piece of action cinema from the Hard Boiled Director. MI:3- Well, all I can say is that if you take James Bond's most action packed episode and times it by ten, you may be somewhere near the mark!<br/><br/>Pre-credits we are thrown into a grizzly scene. Cruise's Ethan Hunt strapped to a chair, bloodied and bruised, pleading to a menacing Phillip Seymour Hoffman to spare the life of a bound and gagged Michelle Monaghan. It's a brutal and unforgiving opener,but thats just Abrahams letting us know what sort roller-coaster we're going to ride for the next two hours. Then the famous fuse is lit and titles roll.<br/><br/>Is was a ballsy move by he Director to play the 'intrigue with a scene and then work on the weeks leading up to it' card. But it works very well. Making Ethan's every decision a tense affair, as you know what is in store for him and is fiancé, Monaghan's Julia.<br/><br/>The plot is a basic one that you will have seen many times before: Retired agent pulled into the field on that one last job and things not going quite to plan. But that's all we need. There is the odd twist, but nothing overly complex. Anything more in-depth would only complicate matters and detract from the astonishing action set pieces, and impressively clever gadgets on display.<br/><br/>The action comes thick and fast, machine guns rattle, buildings are detonated and helicopters chase one another. There are no limits here, and at times you almost feel out of breath. The sturdy yet basic plot, allows for multiple types of missions, from a hostage rescue right through to an extremely impressive caper on the neon skyline of Shanghai.<br/><br/>The gadgets utilised by Ethan's team of specialists( A returning Ving Rhames, pilot Jonathon Rhys meyers and the slinky Maggie Q) are high-tec and a touch sci-fi, but similar to Bond never overly unbelievable. The infiltration of the Vatican is a standout section of the movie, where we get to see most of them put to use. To speak more about this scene would only spoil things but it is stylishly put together and very slick.<br/><br/>As a villain Phillip Seymour Hoffman is perfect. Arrogant, Sinister, chilling and cold. By resisting the temptation to overplay him, Hoffman's Davain is completely believable which only adds to his creepy presence. The fact that his past crimes and future intentions are only hinted at yet not fully explained is also a clever notion. We are aware that he is a black market businessman who will murder to get his way, but is he just finance driven or is there a taste for world domination? Open to debate.<br/><br/>Is this the best of the trilogy? possibly. Although light in tone, with a few humorous moments, ''Humpty dumpty sat on a wall'', but never silly or tongue in cheek. It's extremely easy watching even with it's harsher moments, where Abrahams pushes it's 12a certificate to the absolute limits.<br/><br/>With Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol in the works ,with once again, a different Director, The Incredibles' Brad Bird. It could wrap Ethan and the IMF crew's adventures up nicely.<br/><br/>So which is your favourite of the quadrilogy?"
"The_Void","7","4","6","24 September 2006"," Entertaining action romp and not much more
","Whether or not the Mission Impossible series needed a second sequel is debatable, but Tom Cruise and his ego obviously thought it did; and while this film doesn't exactly stink of brilliance, it has to be said that Mission Impossible 3 succeeds in providing a good old fashioned action romp, and I thoroughly enjoyed the two hours I spent watching it. Director J.J. Abrams seems keen to take more influence from Brian De Palma's original than John Woo's somewhat silly follow-up, and rather than all out action; this film features more on build-up and suspense before the over the top set-pieces kick in. It has to be said that a lot of the movie is as difficult to take seriously as its lead star, but then again; it is mission 'impossible', so you've got to expect that. The plot once again focuses on Ethan Hunt; the daring agent who has decided to hang up his rubber masks and various technical gadgets to settle down with his new wife. Of course, it's not long before he's back in the field and on the case of something called 'The Rabbit's Foot', a secret object being sold by a callous weapons dealer to an unknown buyer.<br/><br/>Of course, the main point of this movie is to give an excuse for Tom Cruise to flex his ego, and the fact that every single sequence in the film is obviously designed to make him look awesome shows that quite clearly. This could be annoying, but even though I don't like Tom Cruise much; the film benefits from the same idea that made the first sequel fun to watch; that being getting to watch Cruise making himself look a little bit silly. Cruise is joined by series co-star Ving Rhames, who once again isn't given a lot to do. Phillip Seymour Hoffman effortlessly steps into the role of the bad guy, and given what we all know he's capable of; it's safe to say he sleepwalks through it. Of course, the performers aren't the real star of the show; as that accolade goes to the generous special effects budget, which is put to use well in a series of stunts, which are well shot and great to watch. A sequence on a bridge is of particular note, and the locations used offer a varied platform for the stunts to take place. The fact that a major plot point is left open at the end to create mystery feels lazy; but considering that this is a third entry in a series that I'm not a massive fan of, and that it entertained me throughout means that I have to give it a thumbs up overall."
"corrosion-2","5","15","33","3 May 2006"," Lowest point in the series
","MI3 is definitely the low point in this series. It looks like a TV movies, lacks imagination & tension and is entirely predictable. In fact any single episode of 24 packs more tension, excitement and twists in one hour than MI3 manages in two.<br/><br/>The only saving grace here is Phillip Seymore Hoffman who makes a splendid job of portraying the baddie. There is zero chemistry between Cruise & Russel and the his team members' roles are so thinly written, they look like cardboard characters. I am a big fan of these series & sincerely hope that Mr Cruise will get a decent team of writers & directors and put back the series on its right track."

","I'll be nice and start off with the good things I have to say about the movie. I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy myself in the theater. But that is probably saying more about my lousy taste in movies, than it says about the quality of MI3.<br/><br/>Okay, I said I would start with the positives As always the special effects, were incredible. And the Mission Impossible theme is still the most thrilling spy-movie music ever written. Yes even better than the traditional James Bond theme. Well, I think that anyway. That theme just gets my adrenaline pumping every time.<br/><br/>But after saying this, it just goes down the drain. I don't think I have ever seen Tom Cruise play this lousily. He should never try to act in an emotional scene, he just doesn't cut it. The guy is like an emotional block of liquid hydrogen frozen granite.Besides, said emotional scenes seemed so out of place in this move that i barely could keep myself from bursting into roaring laughter, every time.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING: The resurrection scene at the end, is still now, an hour later, giving me the urge to laugh like a hyena. It is a stupid try to reproduce what Ed Harris and Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio did so splendidly in The Abbyss.<br/><br/>END SPOILER.<br/><br/>Now, back to MI3.It helps a little that Tom does the action part pretty well, but it doesn't take away the ridiculousness of the whole movie. The plot is so recycled and so minimal that it isn't even funny. It wouldn't even fill a full written page. And within the first minutes we get a clue the size of the Milkyway, about what will happen in the end. Why such a splendid actor as Laurence Fishburne agreed to be in on this move is beyond my comprehension. Some of the things done by Ethan hunt here, would have fit nicely into The Matrix, but in the ""real world"" it just isn't possible,to the point of being ludicrous.<br/><br/>Finally, that villain were so two dimensionally boringly acted by whomever did it that it was laughable.The actor didn't seem to make an effort at all.<br/><br/>So why the heck I enjoyed this movie, I do not know. I think I need to have my head checked.<br/><br/>That's all folks Paladin Steelbreaker."

","I can't decide if it's the worst action film ever or a hilarious and biting satirical statement about the state of the film industry.<br/><br/>either way it will definitely 'blow you away'.<br/><br/>from the start this movie runs headlong into the ridiculous and comes out the other side swinging. Thanks to JJ the film has a similar feeling to that of the TV series LOST in that absolutely nothing makes any sense whatsoever. The plot is flimsy nonsense, and all of the 'twists' in the 'plot' are so telegraphed that it's debatable as to whether they can actually be called twists. Apart from that the film is just a series of tired 'saving-the-world-with-1-second-to-go' clichés and poor dialogue.<br/><br/>Not only would I recommend that you don't see this film at the cinema or on DVD, but even if someone else rents it or you get it bought for you by some well meaning relative with horrifyingly poor taste in movies, I'd still recommend that you destroy it rather than watch it. it really is THAT bad.<br/><br/>put it this way, it's on a par with Charlies Angels: Full Throttle.

Philip Seymour Hoffman was once again amazing acting in this film.<br/><br/>The Sunset Blvd style beginning was good and I liked the ideas of superiority used in the film and the methods behind some of the stunts that the IMF team use.

He tries to make up for poor acting and a weak script, by throwing in many explosions and shootings. He is obviously so full of himself, that he focuses long sequences where he pushes his emoting. He has lost the edge that he had in the first two Mission Impossible films and other greats like Top Gun and Jerry Maguire. He should have stayed home with his young honey.

","Yawn......<br/><br/>Here we go, another foolish pseudo-spy story. Well, it was better than the last one, at least, but still utterly predictable and dull, despite the supposed action sequences.<br/><br/>The problem with this type of movie isn't the silly spy-tech gadgets and the laughable concepts of supervillains, wild car and helicopter chases through cities, etc. It's the lack of intelligence when it comes to the realisation of any of these things.<br/><br/>For example. One of the more interesting moments is a helicopter chase sequence. You basically have a venerable old Huey being pursued by a Cobra attack helicopter. Now, I'm no expert at helicopter tactics or design. But I'm guessing that a Cobra will run circles around a Huey all day long without breaking a sweat. Granted, a Huey might have longer range, but in a chase, that isn't gonna matter much. But the thing that annoyed me most, was the singular lack of anything resembling a brain in the scene-planning. Sure, it was cool to have the helicopters flying through a veritable forest of giant wind-turbines, but even an idiot would realise the Cobra didn't have to be there. Assuming the pilot training is above average for gunship pilots, you'd think it'd be sensible to fly above the turbines? And maybe fire down into them? Not fly through them? Bah! It's this kind of idiocy that ruins a movie experience for me. And when that happens, I start picking holes in everything else that I'd normally gloss-over.<br/><br/>Such as the explosion whose shock wave radiates out, realises it's missed Tombo, then does a ninety degree turn to knock him sideways into a car. Looks good, until you think about it even a tiny amount.<br/><br/>Another thing which bugs me is Cruise himself. I'm not sure if it's all the controversy that surrounds him these days, but I find myself far less forgiving of him as an actor now. His acting range seems to be limited to frowns, rictus grins, slight head-twitches and bug-eyed insane staring. And he uses this ""repertoire"" to convey every emotion required of him in a scene, from love to hate. It's actually quite unnerving to watch in some instances.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, if you can switch off your brain and just let it all wash over you, then this is an OK movie. But, if like me, you're cursed with an IQ greater than that of the average sock puppet, then you'll find it all just a tad irritating."

Geez, great action flicks are so few and far between. Anyways, M:I-3 was smart, tight, and the pacing was just right. Action sequences were incredible and inventive. Tom Cruise is good as he always is and the supporting cast meshed well together. Ving never fails to bring in the needed comic relief. Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as well. Finally, a worthy adversary. I hate it when the villain lacks charisma and presence. <br/><br/>Also, I'd like to mention that the cinematography was great and the film stock they used resulted in gorgeous images. <br/><br/>Lastly, we got to leave poor Tom Cruise alone. Who cares about his personal life when he can ACT so damn well? This movie may not be the best vehicle to showcase his great thespian abilities but he's great in this film. Let him be. <br/><br/>I'd recommend M;I-3 highly. Brings life back into the M:I franchise."
"pointless-stupid","1","15","34","6 May 2006"," boring but loud
","Perhaps the writers have confused ""story"" with ""audio volume"". Indeed, this movie has a lot of explosions, a lot of gunfire, and lots of running. It looks kind of like an action-packed workout video. And it's very loud. Did I mention that? You'll definitely not catch any Zs during this flick.<br/><br/>It's very good technically (from a video and audio point of view), but then again I suppose you can say the same thing about porno films.<br/><br/>I didn't pay to see this film but I still somehow feel cheated. I don't watch a lot of TV so I'm not used to wasting my time watching mindless trash - is this what most movies are like? Loud, mindless drivel?<br/><br/>Overall: Boring and very, very loud."
"Screen-Space","9","12","26","1 May 2006"," Just screened in Oz....
","Just screened for critics and exhibs in Australia ahead of local release Thursday.....<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the biggest movie star of our generation for one very simple reason - he knows how to deliver the goods.<br/><br/>Sometimes he chooses smart material that resonates (Collateral, Jerry Maguire, Few Good Men, Rainman, Risky Business); sometimes he promises and, most importantly, delivers great popcorn entertainment (Top Gun, The Firm, War Of The Worlds); sometimes he makes crap that coasts on his charisma alone (Vanilla Sky, Mission Impossible 2, Days Of Thunder, Cocktail). Regardless, he's the biggest movie star of the last 20 years - and if he keeps making them like Mission Impossible 3, he'll be at the top of the tree for 20 more.<br/><br/>With a smart, plausible storyline that instantly engages and a finely-attuned emotional undercurrent that provides heart and humour, MI3 is the standout of the three MI movies in every aspect. By quite a long way, in fact.<br/><br/>The film's key action scenes are breathtaking, esp an extended sequence set within Vatican City. Director JJ Abrams shows no sign that life as a TV director has narrowed his vision - he utilises every inch of the widescreen canvas to bring vibrancy of colour and fluidity of movement to his action. Though at times frantic, the action is never indecipherable nor implausible (well, occasionally implausible, but I was along for the ride by that stage).<br/><br/>Best amongst a superb support cast is Billy Crudup, though all contributors - a returning Ving Rhames, newcomers Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers (his Italian DHL guy is a hoot!), Laurence Fishburne, Keri Russell - make the most of roles that are surprisingly fleshed-out and solid for an action film. Special mention must be made of Maggie Q - Abrams shoots this stunning actress with obvious affection and she comes across every inch a movie star. THAT red dress will go down in cinema history! Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers as the bad guy in a subdued performance that doesn't stretch him as an actor but which supplies all the menace required of the role.<br/><br/>And The Cruiser? After the dumbing down of Ethan Hunt in MI2, Cruise has gone all out give depth and scope to the emotional core of his franchise hero, and in doing so has added immeasurably to the film as a whole. MI3 isn't the sort of stuff that will win him that elusive Oscar, but it is a performance that greys the usual black-&-white action hero role to maximum affect.<br/><br/>It is film that is enlivened by a young director with a natural understanding of what makes movies enjoyable, and giving his first shot at big screen glory every effort. Abrams obvious enthusiasm rubs off on all contributors to the film - not only the cast, but the crisp cinematography (the virgin print screened in Oz was gorgeous), the production design work and the stunt choreography. Also, though I know it was there, the CGI work was undetectable.<br/><br/>MI3 kick-starts the American summer season with a real bang. If the other studios come to the party with their own super-charged, smartly-penned product in the weeks ahead, 2006 could be the blockbuster season we've all hoped for for so long."

","First things first: the mission impossible series couldn't gotten any worse. The first two sucked harder than Jenna Jameson on a busy day. So I took my seat in the theater and prayed to the gods above: please, let the third one be the proverbial charm. And what do you know? The gods listened. The prologue kicks frickin'ass and has the perfect set up to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>(Spoiler: this scene is a preview of a terrifying torture-scene where Hoffman's character really hurts Hunt in ways you can't imagine).<br/><br/>The film was of to a good start, but could it sustain this level of nail-biting tension? Hell, yeah! This movie has more mind-blowing action pieces than the other two combined (a helicopterchase through a windmillpark for example). Plus it has some real emotion. Hunt is married this time around and Hoffman's bad guy takes full advantage of Hunt's only weakness, his wife.<br/><br/>Furthermore the direction J.J. Abrams took the story is as close as you can get to a real homage to the original series. There's is a real life team of IMF agents kicking ass and taking names. Ving Rhames is just too cool for school, but also the minor parts really deliver in this high octane action-thriller.<br/><br/>Stand out is Simon Pegg, the genius behind Shaun of the Dead, he is just hilariously clueless as a computer-nerd helping Hunt on his many missions.<br/><br/>I know when the filmmakers of the new James Bond-series see this movie, they leave with cold sweat dripping down their backs. They know they better deliver a brilliant Bond come end of the year, because for now MI 3 can call itself the king of the spy-world."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","11","8 May 2006"," Tom Cruise's trump card
","While one-time action top draws like Gibson, Ford and Willis are all making their genre (NOT a typo for gender) change, Cruise has met with enviable success in filling the vacuum. ""Mission Impossible"" is unquestionably his trump card.<br/><br/>The first two MI installments went for STYLE, with two directors that, even not quite at the height of masters, have strong claim to membership of the auteur club  Brian de Palma and John Woo. MI-3, however, goes all out for ACTION. More specifically, it offers 4 meticulously crafted action sequences  3 ""missions"" by the good guys and one by the other side (to rescue of the villain)  that should satisfy even the most hard-boiled action junkie. Each of these 4 sequences has its own characteristic.<br/><br/>The first one, taking place in Germany, is the rescue of Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) protégée Lindsey (Keri Russell) who has not only been captured, but also had a mini bomb planted inside her skull. This one is fast moving to the extent of almost nauseating, from John Woo style shooting on the ground to smart rocket dodging in the air, squeezing in between attempts to disable the bomb-in-the-head with shock treatments.<br/><br/>The second one is the closest you can get to the good old black-and-white TV series, with everything from clockwork planning and execution to mind boggling high-tech, in the teams mission to kidnap the villain in the Vatican. Worthing particular mention is that we see hot-off-the-Oscar-ceremony Philip Seymour Hoffman playing not only the chilling villain, but also playing Ethan Hunt impersonating the villain. Another highlight is model-turned-action-actress, Hong Kong's glamorous Maggie Q in her full radiant beauty in a con scene, a welcome change from the rest of her other appearances in this movie, in top-form action.<br/><br/>The third, back in the US, the rescue of the villain en route, offers some of the most stunning explosions and demolitions you ever witness on a screen. The last one happens in Shanghai when Hunt tries to steal the device ""rabbit foot"" (we were never told what exactly that is) in exchange for the life of his kidnapped wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). My only comment about this scene is ""Who needs Spider Man""? <br/><br/>All told,the actions are roller-coaster like and the plot conveniently doesn't get in the way, by which I mean being free of unnecessarily convoluted complications. Die-hard fans of the good old black-and-white series are probably going to complain that there's too much of a one-man hero show and not enough of the clever team work. Of the cast, in addition to the ones I've mentioned, there is also miserably underused Jonahtan Rhys Meyers, who is so impressive in ""Match Point"". There is also huggably lovable Lawrence Fishburne who plays a bureau chief with a large-than-life personality, who does not tolerate having ""his rhetorical questions interrupted""."
"leorican","5","6","11","7 May 2006"," MIssion Impossible: The Tom Cruise/Katie Holmes Story
","When I first heard JJ Abrams was directing I said to myself, this is going to be one badass movie. I love ""Alias"" and Lost"", ""Alias"" being more in the same vein as M.I. Finally, this franchise is going to be kickass. Well, you cant have everything. JJ Abrams does give this flick the kick in the butt its been needing since it started back in ""96""...but unfortunately the lack of plot keeps it from being anything more than a loud, crash bang, Tom running around like a lunatic, plane exploding entry( take some advil or tylenol before seeing this) I left with a headache. The plot is simple; Big bad guy has this thing called the ""Rabitts Foot"" that everyone wants and Ethan Hunt is called in to get it and the bad guy and bring them all in. Thats it in a nutshell and aside from one little twist at the end, thats the plot in a nutshell. When the movie begins you feel like you watching Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes having a bad day at their Scientology Church...then we are shown how it all began....and again, I felt like I was watching the Tom Crusie/Katie Holmes story. The actress eeriely resembles Katie. Look for the scene where Tom and Michelle actually look as if they are competing to see who can keep their eyes from blinking and make themselves cry during a dramatic scene.(you'll know what I'm talking about) What bothers me most about these movies is that, unlike the original TV series, these films cater more to Tom's character than the group as a whole. M.I. was always about the interaction of all agents called in on a mission. Where the women are as able as the men. These movies are all basically about ""Ethan Hunt""...One scene that bugged me was a chase scene in which the female IMF agent, played by Maggie Q, could have finally been more than just the pretty face/smart girl. She is shooting through the back window in the backseat of the car at the baddies chasing them. How they get out of this situation and what happens next should have been her key scene but they make it about ""Ethan Hunt"" as if he the only one who can kick butt and get everyone out of trouble. I guess I'm spoiled from watching Sydney Bristow on ""Alias"" which is what this movie basically is. If you look closely you can see the Alias counterparts all over this movie even down to the quirky computer guy played very well by the guy from ""Shaun of the Dead"". The one true badass chick in this flick is played by Kerri Russell, in a cameo performance, showing she is prime for action movies. She looks great and handles herself toe to toe with Ethan Hunt. To bad the part is minor. Her character and this whole scene is what the flick should have been like with all the agents. But alas, as I said you cant have everything. An honorable mention to Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played his part very well and was a great choice for the ""Baddie""..And Laurence Fishburn..who plays his part to the hilt and has the best lines in the movie..Now heres a real kick in the pants..for anyone who cares on having closure...You wont get it. What everyone just got killed over or almost killed for is never elaborated on or explained at the end..I guess we would have to be killed if they told us...this movie will self destruct in five seconds....please."

Unfortunately, the evil actions of arms dealer Owen Davian mean his is recalled to the service for one last time.<br/><br/>The first Mission: Impossible was an old-school spy thriller with a complex plot acted out well by a top notch cast. The second installment was an brilliantly choreographed extended MTV music video. I expected the third to be both and more. It is neither and less.<br/><br/>The few decent action set-pieces are inferior to the second film and the plot is nonsensical rubbish. You really get the feeling that this film was written as they went along, possible by the chief make-up artist.<br/><br/>By far the best film thing in this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. His excellence is rewarded by being almost entirely cut from the film in an effort not to overshadow the uninspiring Cruise.<br/><br/>Having said all of this, the opening sequence can justifiably rank as one of the best ever committed to film.

Do your selves a favor and enjoy it in a theater not in your couch or pc screen. Although you would think that Hoffman is not up for the role of a bad guy in an action thriller you will find your selves surprised.

","I got to see in advance the first big blockbuster of the summer in a press screening. I must say that the summer begins quite nicely. M:I:III does the same for the franchise as Batman Begins did for Batman. Both had to follow one of the worst sequels of all time. However to put a newly found rising talent as director and take a darker grip on the story both do wonders.<br/><br/>The plot, that was long held secret is as follows: Special Agent Ethan Hunt has left field operations to get married to beautiful doctor named Julia. However, when Hunt's friend and former student gets caught during a mission, Hunt must return. And then something goes terribly wrong etc. Sound like a standard action-movie so far, doesn't it? But the real surprises are yet to come. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams (Alias and Lost) has directed a film that works as well as his previous work. Feels the same, too. The story twists don't get too big as in the first movie, though.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Tom Cruise isn't the least bit irritating in this one. I got to hand it to the bastard, he sure can pick up the best projects from the best directors. Hunt's team mates are now present throughout the movie, so the movie centrals around an agent team more rather than just Cruise's super agent. Simon Pegg is fun as the Q-like gadget-expert. One would have liked to see more of him. Or at least little better scripted appearances. The best of them all is however Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. His weapons dealer is cool as ice, ruthless and totally merciless. The new Bond-movies badly need such baddies, but you haven't seen them since Blofeld was dropped in a chimney.<br/><br/>The bast thing about this movie is that it's exciting. A couple of scenes in the beginning really make you believe that these characters are in mortal peril. You relate to the characters just enough to care what will happen to them. Even Ethan Hunt is a human being this time around. The Bond movies have never had that kind of thing, except maybe On her majesty's secret service or From Russia with love. The action is, of course great and the familiar M:i-clichés, such as self-destructing tapes, real-like rubber masks and jumps on a wire, appear.<br/><br/>All in all, a very satisfying action movie and a positive surprise.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>The Best Part (Spoiler):<br/><br/>The opening scene, where Hoffman questions Cruise about an object with a gun on his loved one's head."

Mission: Impossible needs something similar or they would be as well packing up now and quitting while still marginally ahead.<br/><br/>Why? Well, we've seen it all before really. Twice. Big explosions, minimal plots, a shameless and shallow attempt to shoehorn in a 'family' theme (wonder whose idea that was?), MORE moles - why bother going into work in the morning? Your mission is a decoy EVERY TIME, cartoon baddies, guest stars who look as if they have no idea what they are doing there, etc.<br/><br/>It watches like a television drama with a bit of money thrown at it, which I suppose is not entirely surprising but, for the third time the credits rolled on an impossible mission and for the third time I thought: 'That's IT?' It looks tired, the production looks lazy and the paying public deserve better. Not that many of them will notice, however."

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back-this time on the trail of a merciless arms dealer (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who's implanting deadly devices in people's brains in order to obtain what he needs.<br/><br/>Six years after the last movie, Mission:Impossible III hits the big screen. But from it's opening weekend onwards, it has been performing disappointingly at the box office and causing cynics to question Tom Cruise's reign as the king of the blockbuster. Whether it's just people getting fed up with this type of movie, or whether Cruise's antics in interviews and on TV on behalf of his Scientology medium have just put people off anything to do with him, we don't know but Mission: Impossible III looks set to be both a financial and, from the look of it, critical failure.<br/><br/>Even most of the stunts and special effects on display are strangely unimpressive. Maybe I'm just fazed by movies like this, but they all went right over my head. Even if they themselves had blown me away, although the conclusion is obvious from the off-set, still it doesn't matter how outrageous or spectacular the stunts become, there is never even the slightest element of danger that he will come out from his ordeals dead or even slightly scathed.<br/><br/>Coming from someone who's never actually seen Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut or even Born on the 4th July, some might find this a bit presumptuous, but as I've said before, Cruise has always struck me as more of a 'movie star' (suited to this kind of thing) than an actor and he's rather at his wooden worst here. Hoffman is actually a high-point as the villain, managing a very cold and humourless but ultimately rather empty and cardboard character. Support from Ving Rhames, Laurence Fishburne and Simon Pegg is standard but does nothing to raise a dead rat script any further out the gutter.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very empty and unaffecting experience indeed. It's only May and if these are the type of Summer blockbusters we've got to look forward to, I don't hold out much hope for those released in July or August. **"

","Now I like a good blockbuster like any other person and awaited MI-3 with great anticipation. Having seen the film though I came away feeling pretty under whelmed by the whole thing.<br/><br/>My main issue was that MI-3 was just a big screen version of Alias, JJ Abrams (the director's) other noted spy drama. Basically the plot can be condensed as follows. Ethan has personal life, Ethan hides professional life, Ethan gets drawn back into professional life, Ethan steals baddies toy, baddies kidnap someone close to Ethan to get toy back, Ethan has to get that person back. If you substitute 'Ethan' with 'Sydney Bristow' you'll see that this is a typical Alias story.<br/><br/>The action scenes were well executed but nothing to improve on the first two movies. They seemed to have upped the ante when it comes to guns. I can't remember Ethan using them that much in previous outings.<br/><br/>As always, no Mission Impossible movie is complete without Ethan jumping of a tall building, however whilst the other two movies had explosive finales, (Euro tunnel train helicopter chase in the first and high speed bike duelling in the second) the third was truly a damp squib.<br/><br/>In summary, The Mission Impossible movies have been simply reduced to an elaborate series of (well executed and directed) set-pieces and little else. I don't think it's unfair to say that this franchise is hardly getting better with each film and has probably had it's day.<br/><br/>Maybe they need to do a bond or batman with it and reset the whole thing to year 0."

"almajo","4","7","14","8 May 2006"," Better stay away from this movie
","This movie was slightly creepy, for various reasons. But more about this later.<br/><br/>First of all, I really enjoyed the first M:I movie, and couldn't bear watching the John Woo sequel. So, with a free ticket in my hand and some pals coming along with me, I decided to go and see the third installment.<br/><br/>The original score by Lolo Schiffrin has been so mutilated, they had better used the them song from the 60ies TV show. Anyhoo, here's the plot: The first act is tremendously poor. Who on Earth would have Germans hired as killers and assassins these days? Maybe the writers thought it as just plain cool, which it isn't. But this wasn't the only supposedly ""cool thing"" in the movie. Of course, you blow up your own truck with all the unused equipment in it... Germany is displayed very, very convincingly (a dark industrial surrounding that could be anywhere in the Western World and sure;y there are wind power plants just outside of Berlin... LOL).<br/><br/>The scenes at the apartment and at the MIF basis are very, very cheesy and I wonder whether personal insight's into a secret agent's life couldn't have been portrayed a tad bit more strained and dark. This is a film about secret agents, not some wishy-washy bubbly soap-opera, for sheep's sake.<br/><br/>The musical score is annoying. It's this generic soundtrack that has been used so many times before. They probably thought it would help enhance the storyline, but where there is no storyline, it appears as if they had to cover up lengthy and faulty scenes and sequences by using this fake orchestra kind of score.<br/><br/>Not a single character is drawn out, they all remain soulless, without a proper motive (apart from Hoffman's, whose aim is absolute cruelty and - later on - perfect retaliation). Only Ethan Hunt stands out as a sort of ""Ubermensch"" who doesn't even catch a single scratch after a drone has just blown up a piece of the road. An explosion smashes him into a parked car... No injuries, he stands up and walks on... Very realistic.<br/><br/>Then they give so much away. The scene inside the plane, after they've successfully kidnapped Hoffman's character. Rhames yells ""Ethan"" about six times to Cruise. As if professional agents would call each other by name. Sure, that's an easy thing for the weapons dealer to count one and one together. Then the scene outside Vatican City when Cruise and his ally fake an ""Italian Conversation"". Aaaarghh... So much for clichés... Then seeing Cruise in a ministrel's robe... Made me laugh... And think of Cruise's past as a choirboy. What an irony. Of course, nobody seems to question a foreigner entering the center of the Catholic Church. Then the Germans appear again, later on at the bridge (somewhere in... California? Or Florida?). No idea, where the scriptwriters could imagine some KSK 9 guys show up in a helicopter somewhere in the States, in open water, without causing any noise or troubles... Logical reasoning, where have you gone?<br/><br/>The only thing that really stood out in my viewer's experience was Philip Seymour Hoffman, and he probably was the reason why I originally wanted to see this flick. He's so damn cold and emotionless, yet he's able to play this really convincingly. <br/><br/>Isn't this the irony when you look at Tom Cruise's facial expressions, repeating themselves in every single movie he makes. The way he fakes a smile, the way he tries to put on a stone-cold, serious face... Look at ""Top Gun"", ""Days Of Thunder"", ""Cocktail"" or whatever... That's no actor playing a role, that's Cruise playing Cruise. And his eyes are so absent, you'd think he always with Katie Holmes and thinking about some new project that he's about to pull off to show off his greatness. I don't know, but Tom Cruise as an actor is overrated. ""Magnolia"" maybe the only time where he actually showed a different approach. Otherwise, he often reminds me of a brick wall or a robot.<br/><br/>The use of the ""Rabbit's Foot"" is an old trick and a nod to Alfred Hitchcock and the ""Red Herring"" device. Watch ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho"" again, or look it up on a good website for more information.<br/><br/>The creepy thing about this movie is the apparent similarity between Michelle Monaghan and Katie Holmes... The eyes, the shape of the face, the hair, the behaviour. Does this portray Tom Cruise's obsession with his current wife or what? Also, women in this movie are all weak characters, who are essentially losers and incapable of achieving anything successfully (apart from Monaghan's character at the very end). Further proof to that are the dialogues between male and female characters, which usually go like this: (Man) ""Trust me."" (Woman) ""I don't know what to do, I'm confused."" (Man) ""Promise you trust me."" (Woman). ""OK."" They had better done this movie without Tom Cruise in the main role and with less uberdimensional explosions, less CGI and maybe a storyline.<br/><br/>But then again, it's the wonderful studio system that gives a bleep about the audience and continues pouring out garbage. Eventually, they'll lose their customers pretty fast. It will be too late before they've realized how bored the audience has become with the same standard blockbuster recipe each year... No fire, no compassion, no likable characters (Ethan Hunt's crew is never really introduced), no spirit, no ideas, all just a collage of old film tricks... It's really smelly. And I personally think this movie has a lot more to do with the philosophy of Scientology and Cruise's personal influence as a producer than one would maybe think."

Kerri Russell was completely wasted in this  she deserves better roles. This is Tom's show  and Tom's show alone. That's fine with me  he IS Ethan Hunt after all  but he was very annoying this time around and his screen presence was definitely lacking. The action scenes were only so-so.

","Mission Impossible 3 is simply the best in the series. JJ Abrams did an amazing job directing. As he created 'Lost', there were some things in there that seemed very familiar, eg. some music seemed very much like lost's music. Tom Cruise is excellent in this movie, I think that it is the first time I have seen him cry. It was also interesting seeing what IMF was really like. It reminded me of the CTU/CSI building.<br/><br/>It was great seeing Luther again, his role seemed bigger in this one compared to the other two. Also Lawrence Fishburne(hope that was correct spelling) does a great job as Director of IMF. Unfortunately I think that the role belongs to Anthony Hopkins, but I would not mind seeing Lawrence again. The girls were also great. I cant remember the actresses but Ethans wife was brilliant. I think she has been one of the best Hunt girls, in fact, she IS the best! Well I highly recommend this film to all Action/Cruise fans. this one is a keeper."

","When this movie tries to impress you with its' slickness it fails by not being that slick. When it tries to impress you with the action, there simply isn't enough suspense or realism to engage you. This is watchable from start to finish unless you utterly hate Tom Cruise and can't stand his image on the screen.<br/><br/>I found Tom to be unconvincing in his role as a super agent. He looked more like he should be handing out towels to old men for tips in a gay bath house in san francisco somewhere, not heading up a special black ops unit. He is about as convincing as Colin Ferrel when he tried to be a tough guy in swat. Another lip gloss moment in both of these pretty boy's careers- they simply are not convincing when they play the role of a man.<br/><br/>The story was kind of interesting as a kernel of a story- but not enough details to the story- no real character development. This movie relied on improbable eye candy whenever there is no plot or the plot has spun out of control into comic book land impossibility- in order to distract you from obvious inconsistencies.<br/><br/>This movie is a result of poor casting, bad editing, Tom Cruise not studying for his role in playing a man, and Hollywood coke heads coming up with the plot twists. I could see what is was stabbing for- but it was doing so with a limp noodle.<br/><br/>This whole thing is watchable if you don't play close attention. If you try to follow the plot, you will notice that it's kind of slow in developing. In fact- the entire premise of the movie could have been a 45 second intro to open the real plot- you know.. the one that took some skill to write.<br/><br/>PLOT: International arms dealer and all around annoying rich guy must be stopped by Tom Cruise- however his highly trained team of special ops guys blew his cover in a totally unrealistic plot twist so now he is the target!<br/><br/>Add missiles, and a anemic Asian girl in a dress that needs a sandwich badly- and you have the rest of the movie."

The story was a little shallow and cliché but was decent entertainment (at least compared with the junk that has been out there lately).<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is trying to settle down and take it easy, but gets called in to help one of his protégés who has been captured. From there we had several infiltrations into impenetrable locations. Throw in the girlfriend has to be saved and a Benedict Arnold in the organization and you pretty much have the story.<br/><br/>Many, many action scenes with a few story scenes. The story scenes were good, but were too few. There should have been more character building. They had some interesting characters, but they didn't go deep enough in the character building for me to really care about them.<br/><br/>The movie didn't get political, but did have one allusion near the end where the Benedict Arnold character said that they could use this as an excuse to invade a middle eastern country and start building infrastructure.... frankly this kind of passive Iraq war bashing gets on my nerves.... but it was a very minor line, so if this bugs you don't let it stop you from seeing the movie.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it was an action movie that can entertain, but was nothing special."

I can really say that since 1996 I have been a fan of this franchise (sorry to the people that hate it because they loved the TV shows they were before my time) I saw the fist one probably 150 times and the second one I liked the fights but it just did not have a good enough plot... but this movie redeems the M:I name and you'll be surprised I'm sure."

"ranjinirao18","3","6","12","7 May 2006"," Last in the MI series for me
","I felt this 3rd in the MI series left a lot to be desired as compared to the previous 2. I love movies where the plot and the story line challenges the intellect and makes you think about the movie for a long time after you have left the cinema. MI 3 begins with a scene that shocks you and sets your expectation for a great plot, but somewhere between Tom Cruise reluctantly accepting this new impossible task and the tour of Shangai at the end, the plot definitely takes a backseat and the movie ends with more questions than revelations - might be in preparation for a MI4, but not in a way depicted in other movies like 'back to the future'. However, the movie does good on many of the action scenes (albiet unbelievable, but hell this is Mission Impossible, so I'll give JJ Abrams the benefit of doubt on that). J J Abrams clearly looses his midas touch, which made him famous with his 'Lost' and 'Alias' fans. The end clearly leaves you hanging like 'Cirque de Soleil' performer, stuck in mid air, with no immediate future of a landing."
"disarm_u","3","6","12","6 May 2006"," Disappointingly generic - Alias re-done with Cruz instead of Garner
","Short Version - Certainly not good, but not horrendous either - people who care nothing about plot or small details and like a bunch of action with no substance will probably like it. <br/><br/>Long Version - For those of you out there who follow the Alias series, this movie is pretty much just like it. Me personally, I've watched through the first 3 seasons - it's a pretty good show with a very involved plot (which is what i like about it) - however, there are many many plot holes and unrealistic parts to it that keep the show from being great. A lot of it feels very dumbed down for the American public - like whenever someone is on a mission, and someone is talking to the agent through their ear-piece, the agent always holds their hand up to their ear - this would never happen of course because the hole point of having the device in your ear is to a) keep your hands free and b) to make sure no one else can tell you're talking/listening to anyone else. But, the directors feel the need to have someone put their hand to their ear just so everyone watching knows that they have a piece in. ----- This movie is just like that - dumbed down for the public and for plot line purposes. Is it a bad movie? No. Some say 'well it can't be totally realistic, look at what's going on, you have to let some things go.' I can accept the over-the-top plot (it's supposed to be that way) - but I don't accept a movie not keeping people interested in the plot just because they're explosions and action sequences. It's a sell out to me and that's the way this movie is."
"parker1177","10","6","12","5 May 2006"," Do Not Accept This Mission
","superstar Tom Cruise puts his perennially adolescent persona to the latest live action video game, Mission: Impossible III, and comes up with another non-stop assault on the senses.<br/><br/>Designed to promote Cruise, Mission: Impossible III is standard action stuff from beginning to end. Cars blow up, rockets scream toward their target and a tormented protagonistCruise in his third outingbounces around as if he is made of rubber.<br/><br/>Cruise's retired agent Ethan, now a trainer, is in love with a young woman which is like watching a soda pop commercial. It's a choppy introduction to the theme, if one can call it that, that work and love can co-exist.<br/><br/>During a party to celebrate the couple's union, Cruise is beckoned to a convenience store, where he meets his boss (Billy Crudup). His mission: rescue a kidnapped female agent (Keri Russell, watchable as always) whom he trained. She's being held by Team Villain, led by Philip Seymour Hoffman in his first role since winning the Oscar for Capote.<br/><br/>Action is admittedly not this writer's favorite genre and, having happily avoided seeing the first two in this franchise, very loosely based on a suspenseful TV drama, Mission: Impossible III was not a top choice. That said, it is not as terrible as was expected. For those who prefer action devoid of thought, it is downright acceptable.<br/><br/>As the ear-splitting intervention unfolds in Berlin, Cruise loses an agent, whose flat-lined facial expression haunts him. He attends the funeral, flashes back and prepares for the next jaunt, all while trying to prove to his third-time cohort, Ving Rhames, that marriage can be compatible with career. Two others on the team, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and someone named Maggie Q, play along purely for show. Nothing lasts much longer than a couple of seconds.<br/><br/>Next stop, the Vatican, which is believable if you accept that technology can conjure a perfect likeness of another human beingvoice, hair and facein under a few minutes. Whizzing by to avoid even a nanosecond of scrutiny, this section is the most thrilling, though it is completely implausible, with a chi-chi cocktail party inside the Vatican, manholes, men's rooms and, naturally, a briefcase. This time, Cruise gets the job done.<br/><br/>He inexplicably loses his temper, presumably tossing out ten years of Impossible Mission Force (IMF) training in an embarrassingly histrionic display in which his identity becomes known to Hoffman's snide villain. Faster than you can say True Lies, a bridge is ambushed, the wife is taken captive and it's off to China to watch Cruise do his robotic running like he did in his last picture, the unbearable War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>As he did in that movie, Cruise wells up repeatedly, befitting the picture's dominant emotion: chronic fear. Cruise does his regular routine of facial expressions and posturescocky, intense, victimizedand includes the Risky Business sunglasses.<br/><br/>The action, something to do with a conspiracy involving Hoffman's weapons dealer, is too quick, jerky and hard to follow, heavy on close-ups, with plot and character development in low gear and hokey dialog that doesn't match. But the big caboodle bumps and bustles. It's not here to make sense.<br/><br/>As the top IMF dude Laurence Fishburne <br/><br/>adds stature and the cast on screen for what feels like eight minutes per actor, enters and exits on cue. The movie, pumped, zipped and ready to ship, belongs to Cruise, still filling the screen with his practiced smirk and making all the right moves in the wrong direction."

","There is only one word to describe MI3 and that is MEGA. After the brilliance of the first movie in this trilogy and the ridiculousness of the second, I had no idea what to expect. Let me tell you, this movie is huge. From the opening sequence to the thrilling finale you only have a few moments to catch your breath and this is the way action movies should be. For so long too much thought has been put into plots that drive the two to three action sequences in big Hollywood movies. Forget that. The action in MI3 drives the story and that is what makes this movie so fantastic to watch. There is no shortage of killing, no shortage of explosions, helicopters even jet fighters. The beauty of the way MI3 has been shot as opposed to something like The Bourne Identity is that while the action is very fast you can actually follow what's going on and that just heightens the intensity. While the plot is thin it holds the movie together just enough to keep this movie from becoming MI2. 9/10"
"gerrit_chn","Null","4","7","1 February 2007"," MI-3 is a cheap remake of James Bond
","This is the directorial debut of J.J. Abrams, a hot TV commodity (Felicity, Alias, Lost) making his transition to the big screen. From a purely technical standpoint, Abrams does a competent job. The chase scenes and other action sequences are presented with the proper level of spectacle. The globe-trotting locations are given their due - we see plenty of Berlin, Rome, and Shanghai. But there's an intangible missing. Things explode, characters take death-defying plunges, guns fire round after round after round, helicopters move in for the kill, and none of it is all that exciting. Maybe it's because we've seen it before. Maybe it's because a TV show like 24 does this kind of thing on a weekly basis, and does it better (although not as spectacularly). And maybe it's because we're not as invested in Ethan Hunt as we need to be to care. Even Mission: Impossible III's single shocking moment turns out to be a cheat. <br/><br/>While watching this film, I kept thinking of a cheap James Bond rip-off. There are the gadgets, the stunts, and the world locations. Laurence Fishburne does a credible M and Simon Pegg is Q. Michelle Monaghan is pretty enough to be a Bond girl, although she's dressed up more like the girl next door. And, like the last successful of the 007 features, it doesn't gel.<br/><br/>What do you think about it, is MI-3 an easy remake of James Bond?"

"MovieAddict2016","10","4","7","14 May 2006"," The best ""Mission: Impossible"" -- or at least on par with the original
","I don't think anyone will deny that the second ""Mission: Impossible"" was...well...to be blunt, crap. Way too long, silly, overly-dramatic and John Woo-ish for an ""M:I"" film, it also abandoned much of the basic concepts of the television show and first film in the series - mainly the whole spy angle. ""M:I-2"" was an action film thinly veiled as something it wasn't.<br/><br/>""M:I-3"" has a lot of action - more weapon combat than any of the previous movies - but it's also the smartest and most entertaining film of the series (or, at least since the original, which I know was only two films behind, but it's been a decade and feels a lot longer).<br/><br/>I was really worried because the ads for the movie didn't look very reassuring and the director, J.J. Abrams, was a TV veteran who had also co-scripted that awful Joe Pesci/Danny Glover blunder, ""Gone Fishin',"" a few years back.<br/><br/>However, the direction is apt. (Reminded me of Spielberg in recent years with his hand-held shots to be honest.) The plot is confusing at the end because they try to implement the typical ""twist"" - and in that sense it's a lot more like the first film, which did a similar thing - but the build-up actually works quite well and the two hours + fly by.<br/><br/>The acting - Tom Cruise picked up a lot of criticism recently because of his stupidity as a public figure (being the Scientology-promoting, couch-jumping, Katie-loving, psychiatry-slamming guy he is), but he does well here - the audience only laughed at him a few times to be totally honest.<br/><br/>The scene-stealer is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is the best villain any of the ""M:I"" films have had yet. His strong presence and chemistry with Cruise makes the movie a lot better.<br/><br/>The movie has its fair share of breathtaking multi-million-dollar action set pieces - including one aboard a bridge that involves helicopters that reminded me a bit of ""True Lies"" - but it also has a good number of quieter scenes, and builds up Ethan's home life before the action begins, which none of the other films managed to do. As a result he comes across as a believable and very human character as opposed to the long-haired mountain-climbing god he was in the last sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, this is probably the best ""M:I"" (although it's been too long since I've seen the first to really compare them properly) and is leagues ahead of the last film. If you hate Tom Cruise and were one of the people who protested him by boycotting this movie, you may want to reconsider because as a film it's pretty good."

People say that MI 1 was confusing. I say: look the Bible was marked by the Drake Hotel in Chicago. That meant that Phillips took the Bible to remain current on the issues which meant money to him and then Ethan found it and later realized what was going on. the second was all about ""Man Tom Cruise is cool"" which is not enough to carry a movie.

I was slightly disappointed with Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain Owen Davian (not because of him, because I think he's a great actor, but the script didn't call for any character development). J.J Abrahams, the creator of ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", does a superb job in his feature film debut - he knows how to pack the punch with the action sequences.

The action/stunts in this film are VERY ORDINARY. The camera work is way too over done in the action, making it difficult to discern what is going on. The sound mix is way too over the top )made me whine every time someone fired a gun!). And a side point: I found this entry in the series way too nasty. They tried to up the gravitas of the movie by making the villain more psychologically sadistic, but I feel that Mission: Impossible should not really be the place for these kind of depictions. If anyone wants to see a good Mission: Impossible movie go watch Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"". If you want to see a great Mission: Impossible movie then go watch ""The Sting"".

The lines too much predictable! We always could say the lines before the actor! The Movie is produced by Tom Cruise so like as the previous chapter all the action and the story is around the character of Ethan Hunt! I Know he is the central character but all the other actor(Fishburne, Russell, Cudrup, Monaghan, Rhuys-Davies, Rhames, Q., Pegg, and Hoffman are all supporting nothing more than that!), So All About Tom! Many of them could give to the movie so much talent and intensity, but Cruise is the HERO! P.S.: As in the M:I:2, don't search the plot! You will dying before finding it! That's a GOOD POPCORN MOVIE FOLKS, That's It...<br/><br/>Éryck Bergeron"
"ferguson-6","5","5","10","5 May 2006"," A Trilogy ... hopefully
","Greetings again from the darkness. The biggest star, the best actor, a cool theme song, great cast, hot director, high tech gadgets, a $300,000 Lamborghini and some great shots of Rome and Shanghai. All of this should lead to a killer action thriller. Instead we get little more than a two hour TV episode. The dialogue and story are elementary at best.<br/><br/>Super freak Tom Cruise reprises his Ethan Hunt role in what we can only hope will be the final installment in the MI series. Cruise, of course, puts on his best Tom Cruise impersonation as he struts, sprints, scowls, stares and smiles through the whole film.<br/><br/>The Cruise circus is not the surprise. What is surprising, and near criminal, is the total wasting of the sterling cast. Ving Rhames has a couple of one-liners, Lawrence Fishburne is in a couple of scenes, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are just eye candy. The rarely seen Billy Crudup (in awful pink lipgloss) is just plain awful as he bows down to Cruise in their shared scenes. Up and coming megastar Michelle Monaghan gets to do little more than smile, cry and smooch on Cruise. The biggest waste of all is the use of Philip Seymour Hoffman who flashes his brilliance in his too few scenes as evil incarnate. This had the chance to be one of the all time great film baddies, but the part is so short and poorly written that even the magnificence of Hoffman can't quite get it there.<br/><br/>Turning this over to TV boy wonder (""Lost"") JJ Abrams may have been the biggest mistake. He was obviously not ready for this project. It disappoints throughout and Abrams does not have the chops (of DePalma in the first one) to improve the script and provide some flow to a weak story. His direction is muddled and sloppy and even out of focus at times. The big scene on the bridge with the drone and helicopter is just a mess. And what is with the lack of use for the classic theme song? Such a disappointment!"
"j30bell","6","5","10","5 May 2006"," Cruise Control slips into third gear
","Ooooh scary  and that's just Tommy's collection of teeth. There simply must be a scene with Tom (from Tom & Jerry) playing them like a clavichord after the Cruiser gets biffed with a frying pan. <br/><br/>But I digress Following the first MI, dumber US teenagers, who appear to be the staple of Hollywood screen tests, complained that the plot left them confused. Poor loves! And so MI:II was born: simple plot (Face Off, for teletubbies); premise summaries every five minutes (in case you've got bladder problems or are trying to watch the film and play Grand Theft Auto) and a director whose reputation for brooding cogitations on the dynamics of the human psyche fell somewhat short of, say, Tony Scott.<br/><br/>Fortunately MI:III is a definite improvement on John ""Hard Boiled"" Woo's bewildering (if impressive) collection of clichés and personal leitmotifs. It starts, oooh, dark; it messes around with a non-linear storyline (well, almost); it's got something more than a comedy villain in the fantastically sadistic Philip Seymour Hoffman; and overall it could just about pass as a decent, if slightly bonkers, spy thrillerexcept <br/><br/>there are many, many jarring and incongruous moments in the film.<br/><br/>Take for example the opening sequence. Excellent acting, some wonderful (if brief) suspense building up to an emotive final gunshot. Screen goes blank, cue jaunty opening theme. Hmmm. Don't get me wrong, the opening scene is a cracker, and the theme tune is necessary. But put them together and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>The film is full of these mistakes. Take, for example, the comedy. Used wisely, comedy can lighten the mood, allow an audience to draw breath, and generally introduce some dynamic range. Done badly, however, and it jars painfully with the rest of the material. In MI:III it is done badly. In fact Ethan Hunt's mood changes quicker than a hormonal, sofa-jumping celeb on Oprah. One moment he's ruthless, single-minded and driven, and the next he's cracking a joke.<br/><br/>While we're on the subject of life mirroring art, why is Ethan's wife a spitting image of whats-her-face the bland one from Dawson's Creek? The Cruiser is a great actor (if a bit lazy recently) but, frankly, I could have done without this forcible reminder of his freakshow of a personal life. We paid to see Ethan Hunt, not Tommy K.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the valedictory last scene. You know the one you get on American Soap re-union specials: Cheers, for example, where they all stand around and wave? Yeah, it was that horrible. Not as horrible as the end of The House of Flying Daggers, but Not Good.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, because it's a jolly entertaining piece of cinema when it's not buggering it up for the sake of ""humour"" and/or sentimentality. MI films are never going to be cerebral, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I wasn't scaring the natives of West India Quay, E14 by slapping my forehead and screaming Noooooo! in a very loud voice. Tom slipped briefly out of Cruise Control and into 3rd. Big Phil alone justifies the price of admission. I don't think I recall seeing anyone in a mainstream movie so thoroughly and believably vile. Good film. Go and see it. Take a sick bag for the ending.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and (spoilers) waking up from being dead is not the same as waking up from a bad dream. Please can you remember that for next time? I laughed. I know I wasn't supposed to, but I did."
"vicki957","4","5","10","4 May 2006"," Don't come into the theater expecting a great story
","The pace of the movie was sooooo slow, I fell asleep three times. Every time I woke up, I could still follow the story. I don't even feel that I missed much.<br/><br/>Could it be the directing? I think so. Maybe it's because he came from directing TV shows such as Alias and a few episodes of Lost. I mean, there are things you can do in a small screen and things you cannot do on the big screen. One important thing is the pacing of the story. You can keep on dragging on and on with a TV show because the suspense is what keeps the audience tuned in. You just don't do that in a film, especially in an ACTION film. Sure, it had excellent action sequences. (I stayed awake for those. Awesome!) But everything else...<br/><br/>Come to think of it, it felt like watching Alias. (No offense to people who like the show.) It felt like watching a TV show. It was so episodic (hence totally predictable. Lost isn't though. Haha. I love that show.). Anyway, all it lacked was the commercial breaks. I didn't pay to see a TV show.<br/><br/>Did anyone else have a say on how the story was going to progress? There are few people who can both write and direct effectively (in film). It could've been a setback that the director also wrote the thing. There was no one else to 'editorialize' the thing, bring in something new & exciting to the end product.<br/><br/>I honestly think John Woo would've made a better film out of Mission Impossible III.<br/><br/>I felt that more could've been explored in the film had it not dragged on with some parts (for who knows what reason). The drama in the film. Jeez. I was more drawn to the possible storyline between Ethan and Lindsey (Keri Russell) than to the real deal with the girlfriend. (It was mostly because Keri gave a better performance, in the short amount of screen time she had, than Michelle Monaghan.) <br/><br/>Bottomline, I came out of the cinema feeling cheated out of my money and time. Too much hype. Falls short of (my) expectations. I expected too much from an action flick."
"oriaphyn","8","5","10","4 May 2006"," 3rd Installment redeems MI:2 and Tom's weird antics
","*** WARNING: MILD SPOILERS *** I have to say, before I saw this movie I was pretty impressed by the trailers. I was not however impressed by the 2nd MI movie which is by far one of the worst movies of all time, or by Tom's weird religious antics/couch jumping. However despite all that, this movie was pretty darn good.<br/><br/>The performances were pretty flawless and J.J Abrams is one director who knows damn well how to direct good action sequences. The action begins in flashback of a moment just before Davion (Hoffman) is threatening to execute Ethan's (Cruise) wife right before his eyes. And then the movie begins with intrigue going from a frantic helicopter rescue, to Italy, to the much hyped bridge scene (which lives up to all the hype and more) and doesn't lose pace from there for another hour until the end.<br/><br/>All in all, after watching this movie I can really forgive the entire MI franchise and also Tom cruise. He may be a bit weird, but when he does what he does best which is act, he does a mighty good job that is well worth watching."
"joeytiger7","10","5","10","4 May 2006"," M:I: III - the best of the Missions
","Hunt (Tom Cruise) is strapped in a chair with a bomb in his head and a gun to his wife's head. Multi-billionaire villain Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) threatens to pull the trigger on the count of ten if Ethan doesn't tell him where the ""rabbit's foot"" is. The count reaches ten, we hear a bang and the film flashes back to Ethan's engagement party to Julia (Michelle Monaghan) from which Ethan is pulled away to rescue a fellow agent, Lindsey (Keri Russell). Thus starts all the action and special effects, which is about all this movie is. There is certainly no character development or much of a plot and absolutely no premise. It's the insubstantial ""James Bond"" franchise carried to its logical extreme.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's not entertaining. It wasn't edge-of-your-seat stuff like you see on Fox TV's ""24,"" but it's good enough that I only looked at my watch three times during the 124-minute running time. The stunts are interesting. We don't see any planning, even though what we do see would require months, if not years, of planning to set up. But Ethan and his buddies, Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and Zhen (Maggie Q) plan complicated heists in the blink of an eye. It's fun to watch the schemes develop and succeed, even if it's not especially tense (anyone who thinks some of these schemes might not succeed, go sit in the corner). <br/><br/>Director-co/writer (with Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci) JJ Abrams does the best with what he has, which is really just a schematic that sets up various special effects, breaking into the Vatican, an attack on a bridge that looks like its in the Florida Keys, breaking in a highly secured Chinese building, etc., etc. This is a movie of special effects and stunts. The script simply segues from one to the other. Surprise, surprise! The music is based on the TV theme by the legendary Lalo Shifrin.<br/><br/>This is just about as formulaic a film as you could possibly imagine. If you're sitting through the entire film, however, to find out what the ""rabbit's foot"" is, I'm going to break it to you right now. You won't find out. In times gone by, when a movie had a McGuffin, it was something that people could understand, like a Maltese Falcon. I guess Hollywood has become so sophisticated that it can now make an entire $100 million movie that lasts more than two hours and never tell its audience what all the hubbub was about.<br/><br/>Summary: The best action movie of this year. Great actors,actresses, fantastic adventures, great 2 hours. I like this film."
"subcoolandice","9","5","10","3 May 2006"," Excellent movie
","I just watch Mission Impossible 3. A few hours ago and it was a blast. Awesome action sequences and it went back to what mission impossible is all about. Teamwork! And this feels more real! Not like the last one, which was a one-man show. I love john woo but it was just over the top which made it surreal and it's like watching a game not a movie. I just want to say the acting for this movie was top notch. I was really surprised how good it was for a blockbuster action film! I give 5 stars to JJ Abrams for his directorial debut. He did a wonderful job! He has a bright future being a director I think. As the creator of Alias he should know how spy movie should work! And he pulled it off. The story needs a little work but it's decent. But no matter what, you'll be sucked in and it doesn't disappoint. The start was pretty slow but it's different and a change for a typical action blockbuster film of this size. I was also amazed that they featured one of my favorites site in the world Suzhou. One of best places to photograph without people.They called it the Venice of East. Well, enough of that. All I can say that this movie is better than the second. Maybe even better than first or equal! I'll leave that for you to judge! But for me, I'll say it's going to be one of best action films for 2006 in my book."

","Finally, an action movie with lots action, witty dialog, cool characters and very neat toys. JJ Abrams has certainly breathed news life into the series. It's an exciting 2 solid hours of non- stop action. The characters are fresh, likable and cool. I only wish we had more Phillip Seymore Hoffman. He's so good at being bad. Even Tom Cruise is back to being likable. Paramount really has hit a home run with this one. Go ahead and order your tickets now. Sell out crowds for the weekend for sure. What a way to kick off the summer movie season! I can only hope that subsequent summer flicks can measure up to this one. Last summer there were weekends with nothing worth seeing. Go see MI3. I'd pay to see it again."
"dandeanuk","1","6","13","11 June 2006"," Awful
","The worst most gruelling 2 hours in my life. Awful re-hash of a tired formula, spent the whole film wishing it was over. Didn't care about any of the characters, was hoping Tom Cruise would die, had no empathy for him at all. Some class actors were in it, but awful script and awful tedious boring story. Box office sales say it all - 'over the hedge' has made more money and deservedly so. If this is the best Hollywood can do than they're in for some rough times. What wrong with original exciting new work instead the churning out the tedious uninteresting sequels that they do, wasting the vast array of talent that they have at their hands. Stop at the first film, this film was so bad it makes me angry and I wish i could get my £6 back, they don't deserve any of my hard earned cash. No wonder so many people have taken to illegally downloading their movies, it's not worth risking your hard earned cash on watching a turkey!"

","This is only my opinion but I knew this film was going to be a monstrosity of awfulness as soon as Abrams was put in as director, having seen the film I have been proved right, here I will back up my comments.<br/><br/>Firstly from the very start the camera is shaking about and moving like a flimsy tree in the middle of a hurricane what the hell is the point of this it only distracts you from the film, the story - what story??, and ruins the atmosphere, aldo Hoffman is so average in this film, however I would have really liked it if he was cast as a different type of villain say similar to the joker in batman and with a Droopy Dog voice! lol that would have been worth watching, bottom line this movie sucks, the acting sucks there's no passion and it's just not believable another triathlon of a dull-fest brought to you by reality man Abrams, I say Boooooooooooo!!!!"
"MocRocker","6","6","13","4 May 2006"," Movie was okay
","Well, I just went and saw the midnight showing of MI:III. Started off nicely enough. The gadgets and what not that are used within the movie were pretty cool. I liked how they (filmakers/characters) utilized the cool stuff. A couple of twists and turns in the movie literally and figuratively. Philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job playing a bad guy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was an excellent IMF agent, would like to see him in future MI movies if they do make them. Could have gone better in depth with some of the action sequences as well. I felt there was lacking some intensity with them. Simon Pegg added some good comic relief when needed. And of course the movie depended upon some cheesy lines that made the audience laugh more so than the previous two MI movies. All in all... I rate it a 6 on a scale from 1-10 but a B- on a typical grade scale."
"Kev585","10","6","13","27 April 2006"," JJ Abrams Makes This Film
","I honestly believe Abrams was the godsend that not only kept this film from being junk but also made it nothing but entertaining to watch. I can only stand Tom Cruise so much as the director he works with know how to control his personality and Abrams did as good a job as anyone I've seen.<br/><br/>Much of it will feel familiar to anyone who's a fan of Alias, MI:3 uses the same spy interaction with much of the tech used feeling the same. The plot felt like an expensive Alias episode, not that there was anything wrong with that. So, unlike what John Woo did with the second of the series the action here is believable and therefore exciting.<br/><br/>I don't know if there are any hardcore fans of Mission Impossible but I believe they will enjoy this installment."
"david_wennberg","1","7","16","4 November 2006"," Mission: Implausible...
","This is easily one of the worst movies of all time, a true moron's delight to be honest. This series has always been implausible but this one is numbingly, eye-rollingly far-fetched. The actions scenes are cartoonish at best, laughably retarded at least! This is just one more vehicle for Cruise to astound the world with his amazing lack of talent, unnerving lack of charisma and fading good looks. He is a shameless egomaniacal diva who takes himself way too seriously. He thinks that glaring into the camera while flexing his jaw muscles or smirking like some high school jock picking on the class nerd is acting. The cold truth is that he wouldn't know how to act his way out of a paper bag and this film is a prime example of his monotonous ""acting"" abilities. Surrounding himself with better, more dignified actors only succeeds in exacerbating this sad fact. Electing a fan as director was a foolish move as scene after scene plays like a school-girl love letter to closet case Cruise, lingering close ups while decked out in physique enhancing wardrobes come across like those tedious scenes in soft-core erotica that are supposed to pass for exposition. Hell, even scenes where he is bloodied and bruised or being beaten play like psychotic gay porn he's always intended to look his best in every frame testament to the careless lust of his female audience and the innate yet suppressed homo-tendencies of his male fans who must secretly fantasize about being in just such situations on some juvenile level. Director J.J. Abrams is just such a fan, he's crafted a horrible boyhood fantasy flick here filled with outrageously unbelievable action, nearly non-existent character development with even less elucidation. Marvel at the sheer stupidity and have no doubt why this was the box office disappointment that it was."
"actionman133","6","7","16","3 May 2006"," A little schizophrenic about this one....
","Mission Impossible 3's trailers left me slobbering at the mouth. Hoffman seemed like a cunning, conniving (and emotionally intense) villain... juicy, given how well he does in other roles. There was the love interest which seemed to look credible in the few shots that it's presented... The action looked intense, and there was the good ol' music theme.<br/><br/>What could go wrong? Well, first of all, I felt that it did go wrong. Secondly, all the cool bits in the trailer were the problems in the film. The first half hour shows so much of Ethan maintaining his double life with his fiancée, that I just wanted it to continue. There are some good scenes for setting up later events, but there's just too much there. The romance also could have been toned down.<br/><br/>I normally like a movie to get into the details about characters and relationships, but it felt inappropriate here. Mission Impossible should be about Ethan Hunt completing an impossible mission, but it gets bogged down by the exposition. If it were released under a non-franchise name, it would probably have gone down better with me.<br/><br/>Another detractor was Hoffman. He looked like a deliciously complex villain in the trailers, and a volatile one at that. But what you see in the trailers is not what you get in the film. Hoffman spends 95% of his screen time without facial expression or vocal intonation. It's supposed to convey that he is (likely) sociopathic... so is every other Hollywood villain. He has one great scene (the opening scene). His personal vendetta against Hunt seemed half baked, and we never learn anything about him.<br/><br/>Other than Hoffman, the other performances were very good. Rhames rebounds with flair from his walk-in-the-park role in Mi-2. Cruise and his girlfriend seemed authentic on the screen, and Cruise even gets quite intense (again the topper is the opening scene). The characters share a lot of humorous banter (Luther criticizes Ethan's love life while on mission, while occasionally switching back to discussing the mission)...<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film could have been absolutely superb, but it either tried too hard (the romance) or not enough (Hoffman)."
"triggermike","9","7","16","30 April 2006"," The Mission gets emotional
","Director Abrams really put something new to the sequel, while saving the world, Tom Cruise has to save his wife, too. And all the characters get emotional.<br/><br/>Nevertheless there is ass kicking action in it, like the rocket attack on the bridge, which bombs you into the seat! You get to see how these masks and the voice chips are made which are often used in the movies and there is a Maggie Q, however without a Martial Arts fighting scene. But she looks absolutely beautiful! Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great villain and gives Tom Cruise a really hard time. An intense tension flows through the movie, but how Ving Rhames says in a scene where Cruise Jumps from a big building, throws himself with a parachute into a window and is redirected by the wind, just to land softly on the ground:""please make it, please ..... YES, he did it!""(paused) ......... ""I knew he would make it!"". So after all we are on high tension with the story even if we know that he makes it anyway.<br/><br/>A really good movie, with a great cast."
"freemantle_uk","9","3","5","9 March 2008"," An extended episode of Alias...
","...and I loved it for it.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is Ethan Hawk is recruited back in IMF after going into semi-retirement. An agent he had trained had been captured by Owen Davian, a major weapons trader, and Hawk has to go and save her. She gets killed during the rescue and this leads to Hawk having a vendetta against Davian and his team captures him in the Vatican City. At the same time IMF are looking for a secret weapon called the Rabbit's Foot. Subplots of the film are Hawk's relationship and marriage and his guilt about the death of his former agent. (I don't want to give too much away).<br/><br/>Mission Impossible III was directed by J.J. Abrams, creator of Alias and Lost. He wrote the script with two other Alias writers and the film has many features that were in Alias. The action was non-stop, the acting was good, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as Owen Davian, who seemed to really enjoy playing a villain. The film has many qualities of Alias. They are international locations, including Berlin, Rome and Shanghai. The use of martial arts and the characters being resourceful. They were also good dialogue in the film and some humorous moments, especially with Simon Pegg who was playing a Marshall type character from Alias. If you are an Alias or Bond fan (especially if you liked Pierce Bronsan) then this film would interest you. It may not have the gritty realism of Casino Royale or the Bourne Trilogy (which are both excellent, especially Casino Royale), but it still has the felt that it set down to Earth, unlike Moonraker or Die Another Day. Many people have said that the film was more like the show because of the use of teamwork. I cannot judge because I never watched the show, but it's better then the previous two films because of the use of a team.<br/><br/>My only complain is really a complain of the series. It is basically Schizophrenic because in the first film Hawk was with the CIA, second IMF was a part of an Interpol type organisation and the third its an independent US agency. I would have preferred it if they dropped the IMF title and made it a CIA dark-op division or something on those lines.<br/><br/>The film did not do as well as expected in the box office, but it was not because of the film itself, but because of Tom Cruise's off-camera antics."
"tostinati","Null","3","5","16 July 2006"," Child of Raiders
","I have to hand it to MI3: It delivers nonstop action and the kind of over-hyped ""intense"" moments of which Hollywood builds prefab popcorn movies with sleep-walking regularity. I find no plot holes to carp about. In fact, the film is to be commended for not letting anything so burdensome as a plot get in its way. Almost every second of screen time is given to explosions and athletic stunts and sweaty last second cliffhanging saves that tax physics and credulity to the tensile snapping point. <br/><br/>This sort of film is the logical conclusion of a development in film-making begun with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1980. If you recall that film from the time of its release, you know exactly what I mean. It was next generation Hitchcock that built a celluloid shrine to one single object, the all stops pulled set piece. That single object had but one purpose, for these fan boy plunderers of the Hitchcock legacy: To stagger you under the one-two gut-punch of crazy plot revelation AND slick bit of film-making, the FX or and the way a scene was shot and assembled. Raiders and its legion of imitators took the Statue of Liberty scene from Saboteur, the Mt Rushmore scene from North by Northwest and the Merry Go Round scene from Strangers on a Train as their inspiration and rolled one of these magical film instants out every 7 minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>Inflation being what it is, the time between big moments has narrowed to more like every 2 minutes. And the actions which seemed far fetched in Raiders -- Indi being dragged top- speed under a truck down a gravel road, the face off in the pit of a thousand million snakes, the final blowout confrontation between supernatural forces and the bad guys -- are tamed by comparison with the downright giddy visual hyperbole by the time we get to the MI franchise. I don't exactly regret that Raiders ever happened; it was a rousing, loving, and perhaps above all, a history-savvy homage to a certain type of film moment. But what has happened to Hollywood since then is hard not to view with regret. Still, it's not Spielberg's fault that his palatable take on Hitchcock's deft touches has evolved from slightly overwrought parody to witless and ham-handed overkill.<br/><br/>The story is-- let's be generous -- strikingly simple: The bad guy who wants the Mcguffin back gets to Cruise's squeeze and, holding her captive, is able to make him dance -- which in this case means make him deliver the Mcguffin back home. How all this happens, in terms of filmed language and gestalt, makes the cartoon caffeine cinema of Michael Bay look like the glacial floe of Robert Bresson's oeuvre. If I have seen more shaking camera, strobing light and one second edits, I'm not sure where.<br/><br/>Maybe because I searched for something as old school as the faint must of ""literary quality"" to the script (silly me), my favorite MI3 bit is what you could call a storytelling conceit. It isn't original. It's the Citizen Kane gambit of beginning with the end, flashing back, and progressing to the same point by film's end. They put a surprise twist to this gambit, but that isn't really very original either (sort of like the old TV series or Wild Wild West). So, um, forget the search for literary quality here. <br/><br/>I give the film 5 stars of 10."

"sullibrandon","8","3","5","23 May 2006"," Mind-blowing nonstop action
","Mission: Impossible III is an action packed adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat virtually the whole time, with plenty of taut tense moments where you honestly won't know what happens next. Though the storyline itself is a little bit predictable, it is a a few steps up from the second Mission: Impossible. It also gives us a new side of Ethan Hunt's character, one of the high points of the movies, and one of the main reasons I am giving it such a high rating.<br/><br/>The first half hour focuses on Ethan Hunt and how he is engaged to be married to a woman he is completely in love with. We learn how he is no longer doing field work, but has instead chosen a quieter life where he just trains new recruits into IMF. Not surprisingly, something goes horribly wrong on what was supposed to be a routine IMF mission, and Ethan decides to take part in a rescue mission to attempt to retrieve an IMF agent that may have valuable information in relation to a mastermind criminal known as Owen Davian. From the moment the mission begins till the end of the movie, there is virtually no break in the action, except for maybe the occasional three to five minute interval, but even those are filled with tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams, and he had a hand in the script as well. You can expect great things from the creator of two of TV's biggest smash hits, Lost and Alias. Abrams proves he is not just good for extending tension through forty minutes of TV, but two hours of film as well. His talent translates well onto the big screen, something which I was slightly apprehensive about. He also breathes new life into the Mission: Impossible series by showing us Ethan Hunt's personal life, what goes on outside his mind-blowing missions. He is not just a mindless, perfect agent automaton anymore. He has a heart. He has a life. He has love, and it is this love that drives the movie, helped along of course by Tom Cruise's incredible acting.<br/><br/>The action is relentless, creative, but when compared to the first movie, with the unbelievable scene where Ethan Hunt steals the NOC list, it falls just a little bit short, so I must deduct points for that. In M:i:III there are plenty of amazing and grandiose stunts, but they seem a little extreme sometimes, trying to outdo the first one by making all the stunts huge and big, with massive explosions and jumping from buildings hundreds of stories high. All the stunts are beautifully pulled off, but may be a tad bit too much, from a critic's standpoint.<br/><br/>The villain of the film is another high point - though we've all seen the calm villain that proves he is evil by talking calmly about horrible things, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Academy Award winner for Capote, if you'll recall, makes it just interesting enough to hold our attention without dismissing him as just another typical calm/evil movie villain.<br/><br/>The storyline of M:i:III is the worst part about it. And when I say worst, I mean it works really well for a spy thriller, but it's just a tad bit too generic. It is predictable, where they are going in the movie and how they are getting there, but only on a grand scale - the many twists and turns within the movie are enough to overshadow this by a large amount, and there are plenty of gasp moments in the movie and ""oh my gosh!"" Of course I cannot review M:i:III without mentioning Tom Cruise's making a fool of himself over the past year, whether it be raving about how much he loves Katie Holmes, or spouting how everyone should follow Scientology. This is a man who has done something that no Hollywood star has ever done before: created a perfect track record. His movies have not made less than $100 million in years. Even those that have not have earned critical acclaim or created a massive following, such as his debut, the incomparable Risky Business. He is a genius when it comes to picking movie projects, and everything he touches can pretty much be guaranteed to turn to box-office gold. He has an unbelievably charismatic personality. And he went away and threatened to destroy all that by making a fool of himself. M:i:III will be the deciding factor on whether or not his off screen antics affect his box-office potential. I have no doubt M:i:III will make a lot of money, probably between $150 million and $200 million, maybe even a little bit higher. But it won't be enough. If makes anything less than the second movie, it will prove that the age of Cruise is drawing to a close.<br/><br/>On the whole, M:i:III is a beautifully directed, beautifully written, beautifully choreographed, and beautifully acted movie. I recommend it without any reservations. It functions very well as its own action packed movie, with plenty of character development and creative, mind-blowing action. Well worth the price of admission."

","Mission Impossible 3 did what it was meant to do - obviously no-one seeing it is expecting a deep film commenting on big issues. <br/><br/>Good entertainment and it kept the tension as explosions erupted scene after scene.

Philip Seymour Hoffman is particularly chilling as the bad-guy<br/><br/>I thought it was an improvement on the other two, so definitely worth it if you're into action movies!

","What a way to start the summer season of blockbusters! The opening sequence, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt tied to a chair struggling to fight the bonds on his hands, sets the pace for the next 125 minutes of pure adrenaline. We are transported to the world of beautiful locations - Vatican City, Rome and Shanghai; drones firing missiles into the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; leaps onto and off of skyscrapers; and; of course, a dangling Ethan Hunt. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a standout performance. His performance oozes evil. One complaint I have is that I wish there were more scenes showing off Hoffman's nastiness. Besides Hoffman, the movie has a cast of great actors; including Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup and Ving Rhames, but because of the story were only given a limited time to show their skills. I shouldn't complain, though, too much time spent on characters would have meant too little time spent on blowing something up. One thing J.J. Abrams made sure of was that there were a lot of explosions. A good blockbuster should allow fun, action, and escapism. M:i:III delivers."
"james.p.taylor","7","3","5","5 May 2006"," Cruise losing his pulling power?
","Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is lured back from semi-retirement and sent on a mission to rescue a captured agent from a sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman). Reunited with Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) they set off to Germany. Lots of explosions and gunfire later, mission seemingly achieved they find out exactly how bad Davian really is. Bent on capturing Davian the team break protocol and head for The Vatican to kidnap the arms dealer. What happens next is the riskiest mission they'll ever do, all to protect Hunt's love Julia (Michelle Monaghan).<br/><br/>I have two main problems with M:I III. The first is the 'monkey's typing on a type writer' script. Seeing that J. J. Abrams was one of the main writers it looks and feels like a feature length episode of 'Alias'. A revenge theme, a loved one in danger, a possible traitor in the Impossible Mission Force ranks. Any hack could write this stuff. Any hack could write better. You also see traces of Alias in the tech guy (Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn).<br/><br/>The second problem is Cruise. Over the last few years his already thin acting ability has been stretched thin and here he has to do emotions. Running around and getting blown up, Cruise is fine, but the intimate scenes with his on-screen girlfriend Julia don't feel right. There's no passion or spark that I could see.<br/><br/>So, what are the good points? Rhames, although very much a background character here, is great and plays opposite Cruise fantastically. Maggie Q as Zhen is stunning and tough. Hoffman is brilliant, just scenery chewing enough to make a great bad guy, controlled enough so you hate him. The action licks along with great pace. Especially brilliant is the break-in at the Vatican. Also try and spot the homages to Cruise movies of old, including the original M:I film and Top Gun.<br/><br/>If you want a really good spy thriller find copies of The Bourne films (either). If you want a popcorn summer action film, but don't want super hero's then this is okay."
"Baldrick44","6","4","8","10 May 2006"," Frustrating and Annoying
","The first three or four minutes of this movie promises something that should have set it far above the other two Mission Impossible films- a real sense of danger and loss. But as the movie goes on these promises become lost in a movie full of unnecessary twists and pointless plot lines in order to get to a happy ending. A shame really.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Mr Ethan Hunt again, who is now settling down into the role of family man with his fiancée. Unfortunately this is all interrupted when one of his pupils is captured behind enemy lines by one Owen Davian- an arms dealer who is after something called the rabbit's foot. Unfortunately Ethan soon finds himself in the position of exchanging said rabbit's foot for his fiancée's life in a race against the clock.<br/><br/>The film is shot in all sorts of exotic locations and uses all sorts of whiz-bang gadgets, but really, there comes a point where whiz bang gadgets have to take a back seat. Admittedly there is an excellent sequence in the Vatican with the construction of one of the famous masks but otherwise the gadgets seem now to be standard fare.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise sleepwalks through the film on two cylinders, almost as if he's waiting for the paycheck. Much more convincing is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Owen Davian who acts Cruise off the screen in their scenes together and Simon Pegg who provides comic relief as the IT specialist back at HQ.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, that if the writers to the risk of actually perhaps going the extra mile and leaving the first sequence as it was ( I don't want to give too much away ) instead of tampering with it afterwards with what seemed like little more than a disclaimer, there could have been a good, maybe even a great movie here. Instead the last third of the movie, though throughly improved by the performances of Hoffman and Pegg, was basically wasted."

"turnerpa-1","3","4","8","5 May 2006"," Mission Inconceivable!!
","I'm not entirely sure where to start, I've never written a comment here before but for some reason I feel compelled to do so after watching M:I:3. Anyone who has watched the first two films would no doubt be looking for much of the same only bigger, brasher and louder. Sadly I was mistaken.<br/><br/>Maybe because the previous films in the franchise were too good at delivering what we all need in an action type formula or maybe I just expect a little more I found M:I:3 a bit stale.<br/><br/>In my opinion the storyline seems to be very thin, coupled with that is a cast of surplus characters with no background or history. This all gives the feeling that you are watching a selection of clips from other plots that really don't seem to flow. Take out the few CGI assisted stunts that we've already seen hundreds of times over in the trailers and TV spots and you essentially have a 2 hour episode of 24.<br/><br/>More surprisingly, considering it was opening night, the cinema in the UK's capital was barely a third full and once word of mouth starts to spread, I'm pretty sure many of them will stay that way.<br/><br/>If you don't already own them, I'd strongly suggest buying the previous Mission Impossible DVD's instead of spending on a ticket for this one. However, If you want to watch something completely forgettable, then you can't do any worse than this."
"CinemaBrit@aol.com","9","4","8","4 May 2006"," Mission: Impressive
","Director J.J. Abrams amps up just about everything that worked in the first two Mission films: the smarts and chicanery of the first; the action at the end of the second. The IMF team is very much part of the story this time round, nicely played by the likes of Ving Rhames, John Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q. The movie opens with a gut-wrenching interrogation scene that injects real emotion into the ensuing two hours. The villain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is such an uncompromising SOB, there's always a great sense of urgency underpinning the flashy high jinx of the team's various missions.<br/><br/>Lastly, Cruise is on top form as Ethan Hunt, the super-agent here given a vulnerable dimension; tying his home life to the story lends him a gravitas missing from the first two movies. There's simply more at stake for his character.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this effort. The action is exciting, the pace furious, and the script well above par for a summer spy flick. A terrific start to blockbuster season 2006."
"Jack_Yan","8","4","8","4 May 2006"," Shanghaied off to China
","It's been a decade since the first Mission: Impossible film, so by now any resemblance to the TV series, theme music and opening sequence aside, is purely coincidental. Mr Cruise and his team have managed to create, successfully, a new world with very little resemblance to the original idea from Bruce Geller.<br/><br/>In fact, the story is told in reverse: it opens with an event that does not take place till much later in the film, before cutting to the story's true beginning after the match-lighting credits.<br/><br/>This time out, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is at his engagement party when he receives a telephone call from his immediate superior at the Impossible Mission Force, Musgrave. He's urged to get out of training agents and into the field for a rescue mission, an event that leads Hunt and his team (Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, while Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers join the cast) into the usual double-crosses and red herrings.<br/><br/>The rescue scene near the opening is indicative of the new Mission: Impossibles: Hunt et al have to use weaponry and gadgetry to rescue an agent, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), rather than trickery and intelligence. From that point on, this is an action spectacular that will wow mainstream audiences.<br/><br/>Only thing is, even die-hard Mission: Impossible TV fans like myself come in expecting the sort of action set down by the first Brian de Palma film now. In fact, M:I III resembles the first actioner more than the John Woo-directed second outing, with a question mark eventually over whom within the IMF agency is a mole.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams' touch as a co-writer and director is felt. Any fans of Alias will not be disappointed: the movie comes off with more of that flavour, but with far more explosions and cameras encircling walking actors than one might expect. Michael Giacchino's music works well with the action for the most part and the re-arrangement of the Lalo Schifrin themes sound spectacular with a full orchestra. The musical surprise is an updated version of 'It's Impossible' over the end credits.<br/><br/>The mask-making process is shown more clearly this time aroundthe use of electronic gadgetry once againas is the learning of an enemy's voice (no more Rollin Hand here; this is high-tech voodoo, too).<br/><br/>The script holds up reasonably well; certainly it is infinitely superior to the previous outing. For an action spectacular, there is sufficient plot, though it is used to hold action sequences together. The mole's motive is not that clearly explained, while the main villain, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), also disappoints as a baddie who prefers using guns and fists to brains.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III has taken over from the James Bonds in certain respects. The spy actioner theme is the most obvious. Secondly, the films go to more exotic locations, with Shanghai being the setting in the second half. The film-makers have used the Chinese city to good effect, showing it as a futuristic metropolis hanging on to some traditiona 1,000-year-old fishing village and some of Shanghai's back streets are also shown. Some Ford Motor Company (Land Rover, Lincoln) and DHL product placement is evidentanother cue taken from the Bonds.<br/><br/>If audiences seek a ""bigger"" Mission: Impossible, then Cruise and co. have delivered. It's quite a ride, enough to set it apart from other Hollywood action flicks, but not quite enough to make it a supremely satisfying movie. Still, it is worth parting with your money to get the action on the big screen, particularly those Shanghai sequences."

","well, i'm not a fan of MI neither of Tom Cruise and I must admit i was pretty scared about seeing a TV guy making an action movie. Well, some details are quite naive and some twists in the script are kind of annoying, but the rhythm of the movie + action are really brilliant. All the fashion effects (slow motion, blurs, handy cam), often boring, are well made, and action is very over the top and inventive and believable in the same time. Well, I love blockbusters, and this one is pretty decent. Hope you will keep in mind the bridge + Vatican sequences, which are truly enjoyable. Some people will say bad things about the all ""anti-terrorist"" thing, which remind a little bit of the James Bond times. But even the terrorist aspect is intelligent enough to be accepted as a simple background matter. The movie has to be considered as a remake of TRUE LIES, in better. I'm a huge James Cameron fan but True Lies is so stupid i couldn't watch it. The bridge sequence in MI III refers to the one in true, lies, except you don't have here any stupid jokes or racist visions of Arab people. The movie goes fast, J.J. has been intelligent enough to use Lalo Shiffrin original score as the very core of the movie. That makes a brilliant soundtrack, even if stolen, for a pretty good action packed movie. Hope you'll enjoy that."

"detienne","8","4","8","4 May 2006"," Just like Star Wars new episodes, number 3 is the ONLY good
","This movie is great for more than one reason. This first reason is M:I:III is the third of a very poor series. The first movie was insulting for the original TV show (the betrayal of Jim Phelps, the very reduced team). The second movie was just ridiculous (too much masks, no team except for Luther, too much Cruise, beyond unrealistic fight scenes). After this, I swore I will not see the third movie but when I saw the cast, I changed my mind. I was right. The third movie is very good and, compared with the 2 first, it's excellent. The second reason is the cast: what a perfect cast! So up to date! Hoffman is the bad guy we was needing, Monaghan is the girl everybody wants since ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", Simon Pegg is the funny guy of the moment since ""Shawn of the dead"", Jonathan Rhys-Meyer had to confirm he was a good choice for the perfect ""Match point"", Ving Rhames'role change to become THE Cruise's buddy what is enthusiastic, we've missed Laurence Fishburne since Matrix: What a good cast for the year 2006! The third reason is the very good choice in the organisation of the narration: the first scene is stunning and then it's the calm and after the increase in tension with a lot of action during all the time. You can't see the time running. The forth reason is the explanation of what was always lacking (how they make the masks) and the eludation of what is common in all action movies (what is the lethal weapon which threaten the world: who cares? Let's destroy it!). In few words: I love this movie. Go and see."

","Finally, a movie dares to keep the best bits for the actual film rather than spoiling them in the trailer. I went to a staff showing of this last night at my cinema and was expecting a 3rd rate actioner, but J. J. Abrahms really worked hard on this and it shows. Plenty of gadgets, and none of them as 'impossible' as the film's title suggests. Not an invisible car in sight (!!) but rather gizmos that could actually possibly work in reality, using modern technologies. The ending was kind of sudden, although it squeezed every last ounce of action onto the celluloid. Fans of JJ's 'Lost' TV series will notice a direct relation between Ethan Hunt and Lost's 'Charlie Pace' from the episode where he was thought hung and dead, until.... All of this, AND it features the always brilliant Si Pegg in a small but important roll. It may have been sliiightly out of character of the film to include a character of his type, but it's Si Pegg.

He's attempting to save the life of his girl-friend who inadvertently gets involved in the action- shades of 'True Lies'. The good news is that the atmosphere of this movie is less like the dreadful extended rock video that was MI2 and more like the thriller-cum-action that was MI1.

"foxes4","7","4","8","3 May 2006"," It's good...to a point
","I got to see a sneak preview of the movie yesterday. Let me start of with the pros. Philip Seymour Hoffman is hands down one of the best villains portrayed to date. He carries with him an aura of brutality, cunning, and a seemingly mind-reading ability to know what's coming and how to outsmart Cruise and his cohorts. The plot is simple yet clever, portraying Hoffman as a dealer of ""goods"" in the black market. It also contains enough twists, turns, and latex masks to keep the audience interested, while not over-complicating the subject matter as the original Mission Impossible did to a certain extent. Cruise does a decent job as the super spy Ethan Hunt and Laurence Fishburne portrays the hard-ass, doesn't-always-play-by-the-rules head of the IMF very well. The actions scenes are great, though perhaps too sparse.<br/><br/>It wasn't perfect. Cruise came up short numerous times when trying to carry over intensity. Despite the downright sadistic bad guy, a sense of foolishness permeated throughout the movie, due in part to the sappy ending, but also due to Ving Rhames being demoted to the stereotypical black-guy-whose-always-the-comic-relief character. Another problem was the attempt by the producers to make the actions scenes more ""realistic"". Apparently this means getting insane closeups in the middle of a gun fight along with camera shaking that would rival withdrawal symptoms, often rendering the scenes confusing and disappointing. Even still, the action scenes contain enough suspense, gadgets, and guns to hold the attention of the audience, even if camera work isn't on par. Predictably, the attempts at making Cruise a romantic fell flat, as they seem to be no more than an attempt to appeal to Cruise's waning female fan base. Though the love interest in the film (Keri Russell) was aptly played, the whole romance aspect seemed out of place in a movie whose predecessors seemed dedicated to violence and brutality.<br/><br/>An enjoyable action flick with some pretty good scenes as well as a well-executed (no pun intended) antagonist...if you can deal with the sappy romance and lame attempts at humor interspersed within the film."

","Let me clearly state that I had no ultra high expectations of this flick. The teaser was extremely cool but then again, that's what teaser is supposed to be. What really got me excited where the samples from Michael Giacchino's score on soundtrack.net. They where so marvelously complex in orchestration and so perfect in execution that it thrilled me to the bones. It also clearly stated that we where going to see a real spy film.<br/><br/>And what a film it is! This is without doubt one of the best spy films I have ever seen. It kicks True Lies from his throne. This film is the Incredibles of the live action spy-films. The script is awesome, focusing more on Hunts personal live which gives him a depth the character didn't had in the previous films. The overall acting in the film was from a extremely high level. Hofman shines as bad ass Owen Davian. Shaun of the Dead star Simon Peg steals the show in the scenes he's in and Cruise gives away his best performance to date.<br/><br/>The emotion in this film is tremendous. From heartbreaking till terrifying till adrenaline pumping. The action scenes in this film are so breathtakingly awesome that they really squeeze your throat only to let go when the show is over, leaving you gasping for air. The cinematography was top-notch. The gritty movements made the most spectacular sequences feel so realistic that they never became over the top.<br/><br/>So no negative points on this flick? Yep, one, the Kanye West song in the credits. What a horrible way to end this film. Specially when you have a score so brilliant as this one.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this high enough! It's one of the greatest spy/action films ever made! It has scenes unlike any you saw before.

What else is new? So much more is at stake, well at least for us, whom whose shoes we step into is that of Ethan Hunt's. I won't see more about what is at stake, but anyway witness superior IMF skills like forging a mask at a moment's notice, calculating math impromptu and in a very hilarious scene where our hero is captive - lip reading where Ethan must ""show someone the courtesy of looking at him when he speaks.""

","I caught a special advance screening of MI:3 last night. Some rough impressions: After starting off fast, the movie's pace is uneven for the remainder of the first hour, before finally paying off in hour two. The quality of the performances varies. Ving Rhames, Lawrence Fishburne, and Simon Pegg are excellent in supporting roles. Michelle Monaghan and Billy Crudup are less convincing. Tom Cruise gives a typical Cruise performance. I didn't really like Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain Owen Davian.<br/><br/>In the wake of Brian DePalma (M:I) and John Woo (M:I2), J.J. Abrams relative lack of experience as a film director is apparent. Too much of the film is shot as if it were a TV show, focusing on tight facial close-ups even when it might have been better to show the characters in space. There's seems also--to my tastes--to have been an over-reliance on hand-held cameras.<br/><br/>Much of the action, however, is impressively staged, if not particularly original. The plot, too, while twisty and at least as good as that of M:I2, is not up to the standard of the original film. I felt that Abrams never got out of his established ""Alias"" comfort zone here. The screenplay was co-written by Abrams and two frequent contributors to that series, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Again, while mildly entertaining, I felt that the story might have benefited from the perspective of a writer outside of Abrams' circle."

"byrann_gowan","7","2","3","21 December 2011"," Leave your brains at the door
","I truly do recommend this flick to anyone who loves action.<br/><br/>The story is that Ethan Hunt must deal with an arms dealer while protecting his identity from his girlfriend, Julia. The story here really doesn't matter, since the action is the main thing in this series, but the actors do deliver here.<br/><br/>This time around, Hunts team is played by Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, and Ving Rhames. All of these guys do a great job in their roles. Keri Russel plays a field agent that Hunt and his team have to rescue in the beginning, and she does a great job as well. Michelle Monaghan is great in the damsel in distress role, and unlike many other damsel in distress roles, she's not annoying at all. Plus, she's hot, so that's a bonus.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour-Hoffman plays a great bad guy. He is truly the baddest of the bad guys of all of the Mission: Impossible movies, and he is so believable, he almost steals the show. However, you can't have a Mission: Impossible movie these days without the main man Tom Cruise. This is, without a doubt, his most famous role, and it is a role that he was born to play. In 20 years, I could still see him playing this role.<br/><br/>All in all, a great action flick. The performances are all great, but you will only enjoy it if you leave your brain at the door. I know I did, and I loved every bit of it. A 9/10 for me."
"theinaniloquent","8","2","3","11 December 2011"," ""Mission Impossible III""
","Ethan Hunt comes face to face with a dangerous and sadistic arms dealer while trying to keep his identity secret in order to protect his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Now this is what I'm talking about. MI:1 brought us something new. It brought style and felt as if we were a secret agent. It was intelligent and super fun to watch. MI:II came out, people wanted to like it, but everything fell apart. The movie, for me, was a disaster. Everything was turned into an action-packed film, but even THAT failed. Now with MI:III, I came in with huge expectations. Why? J.J Abrams (creator of Lost, Cloverfield) comes into the spotlight and brings us the Mission Impossible we needed! I love the director's style, and everything he has released has been a cinematic delight. Now with MI:III, he modernizes the series (you can say?) and brings his substance into the dish. Not only, he packs in great acting, great special effects, and thankfully a good plot. Both MI:I and MI:II had the same exact plot (expect with a few minor differences) but MI:III brings something new to the crowd. From the opening scene (fantastic) your drawn into the best villain yet. He is menacing, strong, and intellectual. Props for Philip Seymour Hoffman for creating a much needed character to keep things running. Next we have the action. I loved how the movie breaks away from MI:I slow pacing and brings action AND intense scenes. It doesn't make you distracted at other things, which the first minorly did for me. The pacing was great, and once things start going (isn't that... right away?) your going to be strapped in your seat, pumped. The film also provides some emotion too. The film does have other things going on, but mostly the film focuses on Ethan's wife being rescued. Tom Cruise was okay in MI:I, horrible in MI:II, but in MI:III he shows his true acting ability and punches the doubters in the face. I seriously recommend this film. It's smart, entertaining, action-packed, and intense. It was one of the best films of 2006, and hopefully in Ghost Protocol, we will find out what the hell the Rabbit's Foot is. 8/10."
"KineticSeoul","Null","2","3","8 November 2011"," Third time is the charm for this spy thriller franchise
","This franchise is slightly becoming similar to 007 franchise in a way where the sequels doesn't really relate with the previous movie in the same franchise. Which is a good thing in this case since M:I 2 wasn't a good movie, nor does the female protagonist Ethan fought tooth and nails for in the second movie make a appearance. To sum it up this is a brand new set up with Ethan Being involved with the IMF. But to some degree I guess it can be a sequel to the first movie though. Lets just think of M:I 2 as non-canon to the franchise, I personally think it's for the better. It seems the franchise is back to it's root of being a good spy thriller with a good mash up of action in it. The twist and turns isn't anything spectacular but it's still a entertaining action thrill ride that isn't just about the action either. Tom Cruise is plays Ethan Hunt as a cool agent while not being way too over the top with it. And Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a pretty darn good villain, I mean he isn't one of the best movie villains or anything like that. But he does really well with what he is given in this movie. The plot and everything else just goes in a direction where it's more entertaining than the previous 2 films. Now this movie is a great mix of spy thriller and action.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"Haynerator","4","2","3","16 February 2009"," 'What's that on your mantelpiece?'
","There's not really much to say about a blockbuster designed for entertainment, however, this was only barely entertaining, and I shall dictate why. We start off with a somewhat interesting opening, which has clearly messed around with chronology and was actually a good scene to pull people in with. After this it slows down to an engagement party of 'Ethan' and 'Julia' (Michelle Monaghan), and as a scene it felt like it was unnecessarily long due to the obvious prediction that this will be where he's called out for his initial mission to instigate the films plot.<br/><br/>Pretty much after this, we move into all the 'whizz-whizz, bang-bang' and it escalates from there with various visually pleasing action sequences throughout the film. There always felt like there was something missing in some of the action sequences, it felt like they were trying to accumulate to something bigger. This wouldn't have been a problem had they been structured around each other better, but the mix of 'half-cocked' and 'fully-cocked' sequences were a bit messy, added to this, my mind kept saying ""wow"" or ""cool"" but this wasn't felt.<br/><br/>Some of the most entertaining parts were actually the build-ups, such as infiltrating into places, preparing their trademark prosthetic masks and voice changers to temporarily steal someone's identity and such. But there was a lot of building up, and mixed in with the 'half-cocked' action sequences, we are left in limbo, hoping for something much bigger and better to come along. <br/><br/>The various tension created in certain action sequences were pointless. Being a Hollywood blockbuster we know how the events will turn out so the attempted doubt of 'will he/won't he' is fairly negligible. This goes for most films designed to entertain, but it's a bad sign when it becomes worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The emotional scenes between 'Ethan' and 'Julia' were stomach churning as well, and they make you laugh because you simply cannot take Tom Cruise seriously. To date, the only films I've appreciated and liked him in have been 'Collateral' and his bit part in 'Tropic Thunder', apart from this he is never a character, he is always an actor playing a character.<br/><br/>'Cloverfield' producer and executive producer of 'Lost' J.J. Abrams makes his feature film directional debut here, and he was clearly a poor choice. If by any chance you're looking to assess Michelle Monaghan's acting talents, don't choose this film. The director and/or writer clearly did not care about her, nor her character. 'Julia' was a very stereotypical weepy housewife type character whose sole purpose was absolutely nothing more than a plot device; a simple prop would have sufficed for her role.<br/><br/>The only actor who did stand out, however, was Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played our supreme villain. Unfortunately his character felt underplayed, and this is a great shame because it would have been nice to see more of him. His character, 'Owen Davian', was very shallow and heartless; Hoffman played this perfectly being that the only emotion that came through him was anger, the rest of the time he was always very calm, and had no problem with doing what ""needed"" to be done.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers, was very strange in this. Perhaps he's spent too much time away from home and has had his natural dialect affected, because his Irish accent was very inconsistent. This is very peculiar considering he was born, and grew up, in Ireland.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg also had a bit part in this. He was great in his scenes but his purpose was poorly executed. It seemed as if he was there only to provide some light comic relief to certain aspects of attempted drama, but this failed being that the drama was never very dramatic, it made you laugh more often than feel anything negative.<br/><br/>There were a lot of instances of laughing at bits not intended for humour, but it couldn't be helped. It was often during moments of dead seriousness from some cast members, the majority of the time from Tom Cruise, who is irritating from the outset. Sure he can carry a role as an action hero well, but he's the same in them all. In this film, he distinctly reminded me of the character he was playing in the first 10 minutes of 'Minority Report' that I managed to sit through.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's very hard to care about any of the characters in this film. If any of them were to die suddenly (even 'Ethan'), I'd doubt anything would be felt. The same goes for the story, the introduction was interesting but this is lost during the film because you just want to see the action. Various scenes of dialogue leave you thinking 'C'mon, get on with it!' and this is a bad reaction to have when they've attempted to convolute the plot, but you just don't care.<br/><br/>This is fairly typical, and in keeping with the first two 'Mission: Impossible' films, however, they should have just left it at the first film. The second was greatly disappointing, and this one just comes across as a trilogy for trilogies sake to redeem themselves of the second film. It's a fairly standard, predictable and cliché piece of entertainment, which only just barely gets away with it.<br/><br/>I rate this 4 out of 10. Interest isn't sustained, there's a lot of building up with failed tension, a lot of bad acting, lack of care for anything that's going on, and its unimaginative dialogue. The aspects that were good though, were Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Simon Pegg, and the balance of realism between suspension of disbelief. This film was entertaining to see once, but a second time would be purely exhausting. Being that I would have been quite happy to dip in and out of this; overall, the film is more like an ornament on a mantelpiece, which you glance at every so often."

","After the very awful Mission Impossible in 1996 and then the sub standard Mission Impossible 2002 i believed that there would be forever a string of bad James Bond and Bourne Identity wannabe's starring Tom Cruise and the name Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Yet somehow Mission Impossible 3 has quickly proved that there is some life, a new and exciting one at that in this world of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) The film written by Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman and J.J. Abrams who also directed bring a new flare to Etahn Hunt that we have not seen before.<br/><br/>When we begin the film we see Hunt now much more of a family man and ready to commit to marriage, and yet the job quickly comes before it all when Billy Crudup's character asks Ethan to go and find and retrieve an IMF agent who has been captured by Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Hunt accepts and with his old friend Luther (Ving Rhames) and two new recruits Maggie Q and Jonathon Rhys Meyers they set off to find the hostage.<br/><br/>Que big explosions, guns fights and that certain look on Tom Cruises face and we have a big action piece, including a helicopter chase through a large field of wind turbines which results in the bad guys chopper quickly being brought down. However the hostage dies and now Hunt wants revenge, he wants Davian.<br/><br/>The film moves with quite some pace and yet somehow still feels like a long film indeed, its quite amazing to think that this film is as long and how it moves so fast. The direction by J.J. Abrams is brilliant and gives something to what was already a tiered series after two films, he brings a certain something which ups just about everything in the film.<br/><br/>Now the stand out performance in this film certainly has to be Hoffman who delivers a very evil performance, the best villain by far in this series and i wouldn't be surprised if the Bond guys look to him in the future! He is evil and so charming in the short amount of time he has on screen, he is truly brilliant! Cruise is also on top form giving his best performance as Hunt, he delivers something more this time around a much more caring Ethan Hunt something that was missing before. While Cruise delivers a wholly better performance its still somehow very difficult to watch him act, in places he seems to fall flat while in others he wins hands down, its a mixed bag with him.<br/><br/>Action i hear you say? Well this film has plenty, the film is filled with big guns, big action and just everything big. There are a few big set pieces that literally make this film go with a bang. The entire Vatican sequence was simply amazing and really credible, the explosion on the bridge was fantastic and didn't seem to drag, and the building to building jump was jaw dropping. All the sequences have a certain something, they were certainly the most credible stuff the franchise has done and certainly make this film worth the watch to ask how in the hell did they do that? Abrams is a true master of what he does here, if this film is anything to go by then we have no fear about his future as a director. He shows a great vision as a director and a true artist and gives a visual flare missing from the previous missions.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film featuring some of the best stunts of the series, the best villain of the series, in fact best everything of the series. If you were somehow and god knows how impressed by any of the two previous installments then this film should flash Oscar in your eyes. Descent performances all around mean for a great popcorn film not seen in the cinemas or on screen for quite some time.<br/><br/>This review will self destruct in five seconds....<br/><br/>******* out of **********"

"Mccadoo","4","2","3","13 November 2006"," I had a lot of problems with this movie...
","I enjoyed the first two movies in this series, the first one most of all. That being said, this entry was quite a letdown. I wasn't expecting much, just a good action movie and it is that however, it had some problems that I just couldn't get past; I know his performance was lauded on all sides and there was much talk that he stole the movie but I just couldn't accept Mr. Hoffman as a villain, I found him totally unbelievable and over the top. In the final fight scene it looked to me as if Cruise was fighting the Pillsbury Dough Boy.<br/><br/>In that same vein I couldn't buy the Ethan Hunt character as a family man, the scenes with his fiancé/wife seemed forced and false. I won't even go into the creep factor, that the actress playing his wife is a dead wringer for Katie Holmes.<br/><br/>And while I know it's all make believe when a movie causes me to say ""oh come on! while watching it that's not a good thing. This movie elicited that response not once but numerous times. Among the absurd scenes that rated an ""oh come on"" were the following; The opening scene where you're led to believe his wife is about to die then later in the movie the cheap cop-out they use to resolve the scene.<br/><br/>Cruise and Hoffman are in a jet, at altitude, going 400+ miles an hour and Cruise OPENS the cargo hatch and suspends Hoffman over it. OK, it's a movie but who didn't realize that Cruise, Hoffman, and everyone else in that aircraft would have been sucked out through that hatch from rapid de-compression. Just an aside; the in flight shot of the aircraft showed a Falcon Jet, when they landed in the US it had transformed into a Boeing 727, OK most people probably wouldn't notice that but still...<br/><br/>Cruise spends three seconds showing his wife how to operate a handgun, in a very high stress situation, and suddenly she's Annie Oakley! She drops not one but two bad guys just like that.<br/><br/>The scene on the bridge in which Hoffman's character is rescued, lots of problems with that one but the main ones were; who in the world would be able to mount an operation like that in the US on such short notice, or on any amount of notice. A missile firing drone? A helicopter? and absolutely no law enforcement response as all, none. If they were near Washington DC or Virginia I can't help feeling the aircraft would have attracted some attention from someone, say the military? Also, Cruise shoots down the drone with no problems at all once he had the machine gun but seconds later he can't seem to hit the helicopter (a much bigger target) and then just seems to give up, lowers the gun and watches Hoffmans character escape, all while the helicopter was still well within range.<br/><br/>The final scene with his wife and co-workers all bonding, please, it was totally out of character with the rest of the movie, I felt like I'd jumped to an old episode of the Waltons.<br/><br/>Over all I just didn't buy most of the characters or the plot, the villain was too over to top and unbelievable, the story line was absurd, the stunts, while entertaining to watch did nothing to strengthen the story and were too spectacular, they actually took away from the viewers ability to accept what they were watching, I watched them thinking they were there just so they could say forget about the lame ass story, wasn't that stunt cool? It wasn't a horrible movie, it just wasn't a very good movie either.<br/><br/>It left me yearning for the next installment in the Bourne series."

"HonestJudgement","8","2","3","13 May 2006"," Highly entertaining!
","Mission Impossible III is exactly what Tom Cruise said in one of the promotional interviews: just a highly entertaining ride. No great philosophical insights or whatever to ponder about once the movie is over, but what did you expect anyway?! <br/><br/>From the exciting beginning through to the end I was captivated by the beautifully done action sequences, effects and a very pleasant quick pace. The story was fine. The ending was acceptable, though the very last scene was a little too much. Apart from a couple of things (2 or 3) here and there that are just not possible, the story and events are 'buyable', though a lot of people who just like to whine (even though no one claims that the events in the movie are realistic) can burn the movie down if they wished. <br/><br/>The acting was fine, P.S. Hoffman portrayed the villain exquisitely, and Cruise's IMF-team did a great job too. Camera-work and directing were done equally great, if you ask me. In summary: acting was good, action scenes were stunning, story was well paced, interesting and highly entertaining. If what you want is an action-packed, adrenaline filled, thrilling ride, go see this movie. Hollywood mainstream popcorn action in all its glory, just how you like it!"
"meger_7","9","2","3","12 May 2006"," Cruise into this incredible MISSION!
","There is no vacation, no time off, and no escape for newly dubbed IMF trainer Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), when it comes to impossible missions. You see, when you're the best at something, its hard for people not to recruit you and bring you in, which is why for the third time, Hunt is coming back to work to help lead and direct the next impossible task. The mission for Hunt, if he chooses to accept is, to assemble a team and rescue one of his top trainees Lindsey (Keri Russell), who was captured while on a simple reconnaissance mission. Sounds simple enough, but once into it Hunt realizes there is a lot more to just Lindsey being at the wrong place at the wrong time, after finding out Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a malicious arms dealer, was behind the whole thing. Shortly after that when Hunt and Davian cross paths, Davian swears to get back at Hunt in the worst way possible, by hurting everything that Hunt held dear. That of course meant Hunt's fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who up to this point had no idea what her fiancée really did for a living. But, all that would change quickly when Davian gets his hands on Julia, forcing Hunt and his team {Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (Maggie Q)} into a new rescue mission, all the while stopping Davian from doing whatever he had plans to do, eventually leading to a wild conclusion full of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Setting aside my bias nature for Cruise and everything he does in film, this cast was one to remember at the end of the day. Having a great iconic leader in Cruise though never hurts, but I must say everyone else involved here pulled their weight very well, making this, in my opinion, the best cast of the entire series. Clearly any cast led by Cruise is one to watch, but to then bring in such polished veterans like Laurence Fishburne and Philip Seymour Hoffman was something else. Both these guys know their way around the big screen and no point did I feel they were taking away from the other less notable actors like Michelle Monaghan, Billy Crudup, Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Hoffman especially made this movie a ton better in a role I thought I would never see him in, but apparently there's nothing this guy can't do. But, any actor that can steal scenes away from Tom Cruise has some talent worth talking about. And to do it with such power was awesome to watch and see. I mean, just in those few scenes with him and Cruise; you could feel every moment and just get stuck within the drama taking place.<br/><br/>Of course, much of that could be due to Cruise too, as he was as cool as ever reprising the role that has made him so much money over the years. And to me, you just can't say enough about a guy who takes it up that extra notch every time he steps on a movie set, to make sure everything is perfect and accounted for. Cruise sells his roles so well and to me might be the only actor who you can literary get stuck watching with the mindset that your still watching Tom Cruise. That's bigger than life folks and why he is the man among men in Hollywood. However, as I said earlier, he wasn't alone and back along his side once again was Ving Rhames, playing the very lovable, yet cunning Luther. Rhames, along with the rest of the cast already mentioned made this film about as smooth as it could get.<br/><br/>As much as the story and cast made M:I:III what it was, it would have been nothing without the clever writing and direction of J.J. Abrams. And to think, two directors bailed before Abrams got the call. But, that's the reality for Abrams, who for those that don't know, just happens to be the brilliant innovator of TV hits Alias and Lost. And now, to add to his resume the co-writer and director of M:I:III, a film that should go down as the best of the three. Of course, time will tell whether that's true or not, but know this, without Abrams, this movie would have never risen above all that follows Cruise these days. I don't know, there' just something about the way Abrams choreographs scenes and sets them up, that is like no other. This is especially true with his action scenes and sequences, which by the way, is the mantra for this coveted series. He just knows how to shoot some action and he does it with such intensity. For anyone that has seen Alias or even Lost, neither show is lacking in the intensity department. So, already knowing that, I expected a lot from Abrams, and he still blew me away with some of the most incredible and intense action I have seen in some time. That combined with his ingenious writing, collaborating with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci on the script, made quite the summer blockbuster to watch. And if this is what Abrams brings to the table in his directorial debut on the big screen, I can only imagine what's next for a guy who can't seem to cool off these days.<br/><br/>Setting aside all the negative press surrounding Tom Cruise these days, the one thing I know is this, the guy can make some movies. Intense action sequences, coupled with a script that is better than most highlight this action thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. So, forget about everything you may have read or heard and just go see M:I:III, as it is probably the best and most enjoyable piece to this amazing series."

I strongly urge everybody to go and watch it as soon as possible. From start to finish, the action was exhilarating and the writing was tight. The performances of all the major characters were absolutely ace. In my mind, Mission: Impossible III trumps the first movie. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I believe this to be the best movie this year so far. It will take a mammoth effort for any other movie to try and top this! Still, the year is far from over.

The set pieces , one of which features a bridge being blown up by a fighter jet, are supposed to be huge and epic but are poorly shot and over-edited - you can only just about comprehend whats going on ! <br/><br/>Poorly handled action aside , MI:3 is a solid piece of popcorn fare and if it serves an apology for the atrocious MI:2 then apology accepted !"

","This was the best installment of the franchise and a blast. It is a bit tongue-in-cheek and a movie made to make you feel good and give a great start for your best summer ever. If that is kept in mind then the slight lack of constancy can be ignored. It has a mean cast with Tom being of course the center piece and doing one of his best acts. The pace of the movie is such as to leave you breathless and I didn't even feel a pressing need for a nature call which I normally do at movies. The flick is not to be taken with any seriousness, so serious people, like, don't bother, with one exception - the reference to the Bush administration and its ""war on terror"" and unlawful occupation of Iraq. I prophesy it to become the biggest hitting of Tom Cruise movies."
"MustRunFaster","8","2","3","11 May 2006"," Huge improvement
","The original Mission: Impossible was terrific - taunt, thrilling, and intelligent. It proved that an action movie doesn't need stuff blowing up every 3 minutes to be a good action movie. Mission: Impossible 2, though entertaining, was basically your typical BDAM (Big Dumb Action Movie).<br/><br/>This third installment combines the intelligence and style of the first one with the constant, in-your-face action of the second one and it works. Whereas the second one was predictable, this one kept me guessing...I knew somebody in the IMF agency had to be on the wrong side, but I wasn't exactly sure who. The bridge scene where the helicopters are flying around, attacking Hunt isn't great just because of the stunts (which are, by the way, fantastic), it's great because we realize that Ethan is in way over his head. That's exciting. It's exciting to see the hero beaten down...it makes his triumph in the end all the more fulfilling. I loved it when Hunt was taken in and locked up by his own agency. He's all alone in his fight. This essential element was present in the first one...the idea of a rogue agent who must prove himself. But, it was lost in the second one...or at least glossed over.<br/><br/>This movie also tried to provide more insight into the character of Ethan Hunt. Yes, it didn't delve very deeply, but it didn't have to! The purpose of the first 15 minutes or so of the movie is merely to establish where Ethan Hunt currently is in his life, not to provide some deep, profound insight into the character (which I think is rather unnecessary for an action movie. Did the first one have it? Not really). The opening minutes showed Hunt's relationship with his fiancée and that's all it needed to do.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was great. I think a lot of the reason why this film didn't do as well as expected is because of Cruise's life off-screen. However, I have never let an actor's off-screen stunts affect my judgment of his/her acting. An actor's work and life are separate things and I think Cruise did a great job here...not Oscar-worthy, of course, but great nonetheless.."
"MsMovie","7","2","3","11 May 2006"," JJ Abrams revives the MI franchise!
","Firstly, I don't buy into any of the whole Tom Cruise personal life affecting this movie - let me get that off my chest instantly. The reason this movie did not open well was simply because Mission Impossible 2 was so AWFUL, that many people would really not want to see this movie until they heard the buzz from everyone who did pay to go see MI:III. I understand this - movie going is expensive after all, so you have to wait until you are sure you really want to sit thru 2 hours of potentially bad movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully, JJ Abrams, of ALIAS fame, has worked the story well - it has some depth, you get to see Ethan Hunt living his regular life and trying to be a normal guy away from his spying career. Ving Rhames' character returns and is STILL the most likable thing about the whole franchise.<br/><br/>So, we have Ethan with a personal life and a girlfriend ( no spoiler there as that is in all the trailers ), and he gets involved in some stuff, ya dee ya dah.<br/><br/>This is a good action movie - it could have done with some more development of the bad guys role and of Keri Russell's role, as those parts seem to be over really quick and you're trying to work it all out while still following the plot. There are a couple of nice plot twists, which most film-goers will not see coming, much in the line of ALIAS's interesting plot lines.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie if you enjoyed the original mission Impossible movie - read some of the reviews written about it and you will see that it is well worth the price of at least a matinée ticket (big explosions and stunts are way better on a movie screen).<br/><br/>And if you are planning not to see this movie because you don't like Tom Cruise personally because of his behavior I say GROW UP - I have met a few actors in real life and believe me, a lot of them are total JERKS off screen (not saying that Tom is a jerk, but you get my meaning), but here is Tom Cruise, the actor, playing a role, that is TOTALLY not what he is like in reality - therefore, if you are a normal, reasonable human being, you will get that this is a movie, and Tom is an actor playing a role and this movie is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 4 now really does seem possible, but ONLY if JJ does this sequel - otherwise forget it - and for goodness sake keep John Woo away from it!"
"socrates99","8","2","3","8 May 2006"," J.J. Abrams pulls out all the stops, propelling Ethan into high orbit
","Tom Cruise has got something almost no one else in Hollywood has, a searing focus and intensity that comes through like some military laser. Despite all the recent hoopla, no one else could possibly seem as dedicated to the mission as Tom. And for some reason that helps us join in on his adventures from our cozy seats in a way others can't deliver as consistently. But without a story and a director to go with it, it's all for naught. Well, fear not! Like Roeper of Ebert & Roeper, I think this is easily the best of the Mission Impossible movies. J.J. Abrams delivers an adrenaline rush that only falters a little near the end, when we're near exhaustion anyway. This is a guy's movie and it kicked off my weekend in fine form. True, it starts out with a somewhat 'feminine' premise, namely that Ethan wants to settle down with the comely Julia, played by Michelle Monaghan. But it only uses that simple motivation to kick off the full-tilt festivities that are captured beautifully by ""24""s director, J.J. Abrams. Having just recently gotten into ""24"", I was not expecting the movie I got. Abrams was able to reach a level not really hinted at in the TV series.<br/><br/>Kudos to Philip Seymour Hoffman, too. And I have to agree with Roeper on Hoffman's performance as Davian: I wanted more. In fact, if there's a real flaw in this film it's that it didn't take full advantage of Hoffman's coolly riveting interpretation of a oh-so-connected and arrogant arms dealer."

","I didn't know what to expect in M:I 3 considering i didn't see the first or second one. It proved it didn't matter much since the storyline didn't depend much on the prequels. For a 2-hour movie, it sure was exciting and eventful! It was easily the most action-packed movie i've seen this year. The conversation at the end between Hunt and Brassell prove there will be yet another sequel. If it supplies as much action and a great cast as M:I 3, I'll see Mission Impossible 4 in a heartbeat. The only thing about Mission: Impossible 3 that nags me is the stupid red thing in a bottle that they refer to as the ""Rabbit's Foot.""

This movie has something a lot of movies are lacking in my opinion, and that is mass appeal. Most of the movies that have been surfacing as of late are good at what they do but don't factor in the fact that most of the people that like a good action movie have kids who want to come along or in some cases have no choice but to come along. This movie is PG13 and makes the most of its rating; just enough to make the average guy happy but mild enough to bring the kids.

And yeah...for sure my expectations got done...JJ is a master of non-stop action as we can see in this movie...126 minutes of pure action and of great scenes without a lot of special effects as in MI:2... Here we have a story of a man looking for a real love...a real woman and he's in love with measureless... Besides that...we can see a surprising thing... All supporting holes are great...Fishbourne finally convinced me that he's such a great actor...Johnathan Myers did well too and Monaghan was a mystery for me, and now i think she's a good actress too... Well Seymour Hoffman for me was a little disappointing...I Thought he was a little robotic and not feeling well to act with Tom Cruise supporting him... OK...Womens here are great..Beauty queens at all..as expected in this kind of movie... Finally i'd like to say that Abrahms can be very proud of this picture...and with that he assure us that stardom is not a surprise for him... OK..Bond movies are a little bit out of date and MI-3 is the answer that we are seeking for...(Bourne did well too) Bond..step back...Abrahms will get there"

","MI:3 was an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I didn't find myself tearing the movie to pieces trying to figure it out. The beginning was a little slow, but once the action started it was fast paced till the very end. Cruise does an acceptable job on a pretty good action movie. Go into the film with an open mind & you'll have a hard time not enjoying the film. As in most action films...don't go looking for an Oscar, just sit back & enjoy.<br/><br/>Complaints: JJ does the action sequences just fine, but he should have developed Hoffman's character more. There was just no depth. In MI:2, they spent a good bit of time developing the bad guy & you came to loathe him. Here, Hoffman is just kinda bad guy eye-candy (the fact that Hoffman won an Oscar doesn't mean that he can make an empty character come to life all on his own). His scenes are good, but without the back-story - it just feels empty. As far as putting Fishburne in the movie...again not much in the way of depth. Finally, the last 3 minutes of the film were a bit goofy. Happy-happy-joy-joy (enough said). BUT none of this takes away from the fact that this is a fun movie to watch!<br/><br/>Overall: MI:3 was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Go see it."

Creative is the way I would describe JJ Abrams' way of telling the story. There are a few twists in his direction, but I really love the part where Tom Cruise took the Rabbit Foot. Why? Something you usually see in other heist / spy movies is missing. You'll know when you see the movie.<br/><br/>In this movie, you can expect a lot of tension, non-stop action, and a lot of suspense (mainly due to the way JJ Abrams structured the story).

"Quinoa1984","6","8","21","5 May 2006"," as the first turn-off-your-mind and suspend major disbelief action picture of 06, it's decent at best
","I'd be more inclined to recommend Mission: Impossible 3 if I was as ready as I maybe should have been to prepare for the amount of preposterous twists, goofy dialog, and out-of-mind action sequences that this movie holds. But coming from the first two films, which were good on their own terms in doing the summer-Hollywood-popcorn action deal, I thought there might be at least some credibility in some of the parts of the story or characterizations. As it is, this third installment is just OK as far as attaining a level of suspense, even as it goes further and further to wear down my expectations. This is the Tom Cruise world of escapism, after all, and his co-writer/director JJ Abrams (of TV's Alias) is definitely not an un-talented guy by evidence here. Even as his camera goes with a jittery hand-held way, and his editing style pushes into the kind of kinetic mode that might've made Scott/Bruckheimer proud (indeed, there's the kind of dialog in this flick that almost out-ranks their works with cheesy talk).<br/><br/>What maybe bugged me throughout the usual strokes of the movie was that, well, just that, the usual strokes going through. There are a couple of twists meant to be of the pretzel kind (but then again who's going for the story), and the enemy of the film in Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is a good one. So, what, if anything, do I really have to criticize about anyway? Is it just a personal preference that, while not by a long-shot, this is my least enjoyed installment in the franchise, or am I just carping about the parts that are maybe better than the whole? Maybe one thing is that in the other two films, while not to a great degree, there was some interest to be had in whatever it was Cruise's Ethan Hunt was seeking out or protecting, and in this film as he goes after the MacGuffin-like Rabbit's foot, the interest just wained and wained. And the more the script tried to intermittently shake the importance of this obscure object of espionage desire, the more I resented it for how much more so they went for the action scenes.<br/><br/>A kind of balance that can work in action films is slightly askew this time, and for all the little moments I liked, i.e. Cruise and team's scenes getting in and around the Vatican, part of the chase in Shanghai. While others were just, to put it in short, about as dangerously formulaic as possible (bordering on, if not just, stupid). This being said, I know that if you're reading this and still want to see it anyway, all I can say is have fun, as it is quite a preeminent force in the big, loud, exploding-kind of Hollywood thriller this year. But I would also say it might not be the best to look for either. 6/10"

We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films.
The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.<br/><br/>The acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered.

"davidmvining","6","1","1","26 November 2019"," Don't lie to me
","For most of this movie's runtime, it's quite an enjoyable high tech spy thriller, but I absolutely hate its last twenty minutes.<br/><br/>I've only seen this twice: once upon its initial theatrical run and just recently on Amazon Prime. I remember feeling largely the same reaction then as I did this time, and the epicenter of that visceral reaction is actually the opening few minutes of the film.<br/><br/>You see, the opening sequence is actually a scene from late in the film, pushed forward, and it's a complete lie. It shows Ethan Hunt strapped to a chair as Owen Davian, the antagonist, counts to ten and shoots Ethan's wife in the head. On its own, it's a wonderful bit of tension filled filmmaking, but in the context of the rest of the movie it becomes obvious that it's actually a mistake narratively. You see, we spend the rest of the movie until we catch up with that opening scene with the knowledge that Julia, the wife, dies. This paints every interaction with her with a sense of inevitable sadness (which I like), but the character is thin. We excuse the thinness because of the tragic ending we know is coming.<br/><br/>However, Julia isn't actually shot in the head. They used one of those awesome masks to hide the identity of Davian's assistant (who had failed him previously). So, we've spent about 90 minutes of the film believing that Julia had a certain fate in a deliberate editing trick meant to deceive the audience. Also, the movie doesn't really build up a character at all. She's just nice girl Ethan marries because she's not part of the spy game. It's all a lie intended to trick the audience into an emotional reaction only to immediately pull it away and say, ""Never mind!"" Instead of earning an emotional reaction, the movie tricks the audience into one and then just pulls back the curtain immediately.<br/><br/>To make things worse, the movie after that point is poorly written and ridiculous. Last minute rewrites are delivered flatly while nice little Julia ends up killing several trained assassins. It's such a terrible way to end a movie that actually has me for most of its running time.<br/><br/>And it does have me for it. Brushing aside the first few minutes, Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force teammates run around Rome and China having a grand adventure with neat gadgets and pinpoint timing. Breaking into the Vatican is really fun. The insistence on getting into the nitty-gritty of building the mask for Ethan to wear and impersonate Davian is a wonderful source of tension that carries most of the sequence really well. The actors are charming and fun. The action sequence with Keri Russell, breaking her out of a large abandoned warehouse outside of Berlin is inventive, gritty, and really well executed.<br/><br/>If not for the needless emotional fakeout, I would like this movie a good bit more, but, even with a second viewing under my belt, I cannot let that pass. It's dishonest and makes me want to throw things."

The fourth one, which is the best in the series, came out during the holidays first in IMAX and then rolled out wide to much success.

","Mission Impossible III is the third installment in the Mission Impossible series and has Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. In this Mission Impossible Ethan Hunt and his team must stop a sadistic arms dealer after he threatens Ethan Hunt and his wife. After Mission Impossible II, John Woo left the franchise and J.J. Abrams took over. Before J.J. Abrams directed Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness this was his directorial debut. So the previous events of Mission Impossible II are gone and this has no connections to the previous film so you can watch this film and not be confused. Paramount realized that MI II wasn't the best one because it had way too many flaws and plot holes and they have learned from their mistakes and made some improvements. In the end the results are clear that the Mission Impossible movies have come a long way as the team behind the Mission Impossible franchise have dropped the action packed with a rock n' roll soundtrack to combing spies and action all in one movie. This movie is simple from the plot to the characters as it shows that its not trying to be the next big blockbuster, but to have an action packed movie that's fun and enjoyable. In a way I consider this to be the end of a trilogy as we see Ethan Hunt torn between being a spy and being a new husband and leave his old life. And we have an amazing villain portrayed by the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman as he breaks Ethan Hunt because unlike in the previous films Ethan Hunt gets addictive to the spy lifestyle. Ethan also has to find something called the Rabbit's Foot, which I assume is a virus, but we don't know that because they never give an explanation to it. Not everything needs an explanation and quite frankly I didn't care what the Rabbit's Foot was in the first place because I enjoyed this film and I don't want to see something that the writers came up with on the spot. Overall, this is the best one in the franchise as it's a simple fast paced action movie that does it job and knew what it wanted to be."

The sound and special effects were decent. Nevertheless, the magic of the original Mission Impossible television series continues to be neglected for the most part the the plot suffers as a result. The climax of the movie also seemed weakened by the lack of screen time and character development offered to Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

","Just from the opening sequence, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's fantastic villain I knew that this one is gonna erase John Woo's dull sequel from my memory. MI III is incredibly fast-paced that there is almost no downtime. However, that didn't stop the emotional stakes from working. It also has breathtaking action set-pieces, cool stunts, dazzling special effects, twisty-turny plot that kept me thinking throughout its entire runtime. Its plot is twisted and convoluted yet, unlike the first installment, never confusing. Instead it's actually so clever and thought-provoking. Everything kept turning upside down, and I enjoyed that!<br/><br/>Also this movie has an awesome cast. Besides Tom cruise who did his best as always, the cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman who made a fantastic villain that, in my opinion, we didn't need any more depth to his character as long as what we have more than enough to serve the plot. Michelle Monaghan is great as Julia. Ving Rhames is badass as usual. Also I think Laurence Fishburne was a pleasant addition to the franchise. Simon Pegg didn't have much screen time, but the couple scenes he was in are pure GOLD!<br/><br/>Loved how the score fits the action scenes perfectly, and the cinematography also is very good, although I had some difficulties while watching with the excessive use of close-ups.<br/><br/>The wrap-up could have been a little bit more convincing, but it's fine nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say that J.J.

"Hey_Sweden","8","1","1","16 August 2018"," A fine entry in this ongoing series.
","Tom Cruise again essays his continuing role of super-agent Ethan Hunt, here tasked with rescuing a protege (Keri Russell) who managed to get herself kidnapped. It turns out, this plot point is just the tip of the iceberg, in a typically extravagant action-adventure spectacular that has Ethan doing battle with a dastardly black-market arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). For Ethan, the whole operation hits way too close to home when the bad guys kidnap his new bride Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who has no idea what he really does for a living.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams stepped aboard as the third director to tackle this franchise, giving us our money's worth and then some. The story probably wouldn't hold up to a lot of scrutiny, but at least with movies like this, they entertain you so thoroughly you're not given that many quiet moments to ponder how insane all of it is.<br/><br/>Naturally, there is some first-rate, amazing stunt work, as well as the expected pulse-quickening action scenes, and plenty of explosions to hold our attention. The story does have the requisite number of twists and turns. For example, its opening two minutes just grab you right away, although we can sense that this sequence is actually from much later in the tale.<br/><br/>Cruises' star charisma (and physical prowess) are on full display here, and he's aided and abetted by a very strong supporting cast: Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Simon Pegg, and Eddie Marsan. The radiant Monaghan is appealing as Hunts' wife. And since movies such as this are dependent on the effectiveness of the villain, Hoffman admirably fills the bill. He's just incredibly cold-blooded and controlled. Aaron Paul of 'Breaking Bad' fame has a small part.<br/><br/>What helps the storytelling is that Abrams and his screenwriters introduce a level of humanity, as we get to see Hunt off the job for once. He truly believes that it's possible for someone in his line of work to have a normal, healthy relationship, although his co-workers doubt this.<br/><br/>Solid stuff overall, and indicative of how the series has continued to flourish, despite its lacklustre second entry.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

"PyroSikTh","7","1","1","2 August 2018"," Rivitalised the Franchise, but Pales in Comparison to its Bond and Bourne Cousins
","In many ways, Mission: Impossible III laid the groundwork for what followed. It was in production in the height of Bourne revitalising the spy genre, around the same time as Casino Royale similarly breathed new life into Bond. It took the over-the-top action of II and grounded it into something a little more gritty and emotionally affecting. It put Ethan in the retired camp, wanting to settle down with a wife and dragged back in after the death of a former trainee. Unfortunately it pales in comparison to it's cousins, who did similar but simply better. In the microcosm of Mission: Impossible though, III was somewhat revolutionary, resurrecting a franchise many had thought dead after II wasn't quite as well received as anyone would have liked. And as I said, it laid the groundwork for what followed, and there's no denying how strong Rogue Nation and Fallout have been because of it. We simply wouldn't have those fantastic action movies without III.<br/><br/>III carries the action focus on from II, but grounds it, and this is its greatest strength. As much as I love II, it's action scenes are over-the-top and cheesy, full of gadgetry and lacking in any intrigue. It's more like an old-school Bond movie than a Mission: Impossible movie. III brought Mission: Impossible back down, and it results in some fantastic action sequences. The opening factory rescue is stylish yet practical with lots of cool moments, and the team breaking into the Vatican to get at Davian is some of the most intriguing spy work in the entire franchise. Then there's the breakout on the bridge which throws around and batters Ethan more than ever before, not only showing his humanity as a hero, but also providing some really touch-and-go moments.<br/><br/>But another of III's strength is in it's character work and world building. I mean it's still a Mission: Impossible film, and expecting something truly great in this regard is unrealistic, but it does add a hell of a lot not only to Ethan as a character, but the world he inhabits as well. We finally get to see inside the IMF, and all the cogs that make it tick, from tech analysts and medical examiners to a hierarchy of management and reference to trainers and trainees. It's not just Ethan being gifted mysterious exploding mission packages from a faceless spy organisation any more. Furthermore we get to see a more mature side of Ethan thanks to Julia, his wife-to-be, and the reason why he wants to retire. It goes a long way to add some very real stakes, as well as giving Tom Cruise something to really sink his teeth into.<br/><br/>The opening interrogation sequence is almost pitch perfect in every way with how Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman bounce off one another. Ethan is desperate and powerless, attempting to reason with a different kind of ticking clock, and Davian is calm, cruel, and cold. Honestly the entire movie lies on how strong these two performances are. Cruise was never going to win any awards for this, obviously, but the performance he offers proves he can carry emotional beats as well as physical ones. Philip Seymour Hoffman though, steals the limelight. Davian honestly isn't all that an engaging villain on paper. He's an arms dealer who has connections he really shouldn't, and when sleighted, he takes what ultimately amounts to petty vengeance. However Hoffman manages to elevate the character off the page into a franchise-best villain. His delivery is calm and threatening, quietly aggressive until he needs to be more forceful. The way he threatens Ethan and everyone he loves while in a position to not really be making threats, with a cool and calm demeanour as if everything he says is just everyday language, gives him such a nasty edge that you love to hate. Davian turns from a lacklustre villain into a nasty, vindictive, unfeeling asshole all thanks to Hoffman's performance alone.<br/><br/>But III isn't perfect, and as I said it lacks something that Bourne and Craig-era Bond manage to tap into. It's still kind of cheesy. The settling-down/romantic element of III is something I love about it in concept, and it changed up the tone of the franchise massively. And yet oft times it still feels like a sappy romance shoehorned in to a movie that is at odds with it. The happy-ever-after ending, with Ethan walking away hand-in-hand with Julia doesn't particularly help either. There's a reason why Vesper doesn't make it out of Casino Royale alive, and it's because our heroes are more interesting and engaging when they're not tied to a love interest. It's no surprise, of course, that Ghost Protocol (as far as I can remember - it's been a while) completely drops the whole thing as if it never happened.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugs me, moreso now than it used to, is the cinematography. This is J.J. Abrams' feature directorial debut, and he brings his television sensibilities with him somewhat. His trademark lens flare dates back to this (and possibly before), and that coupled with the Bourne trend of shaky-cam results in some messy shots. There's also a lot of close-ups, which don't help the shaky-cam, but they do add a lot of intensity and emotional claustrophobia. But what gets me now is the colour-pallet, which still looks quite television-y. It's super bright and colourful with really sharp contrasts, and while it does give it its own visual identity, it doesn't always look that great. When Tom Cruise looks like he has jaundice, maybe you should consider adjusting the colour balance a bit.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, III is still a fine addition to the franchise, and it's probably safe to say that it was the best Mission: Impossible movie at the time. It showed a self-awareness that let you know it never takes itself too seriously, and knows exactly where it came from. It helps that there's a lot of great stuff here that's enough to overshadow the slightly irksome. Davian is simply delectable, and seeing Ethan hunt desperate and struggling really helped the franchise in the long-run. Really good action sequences helped too, of course. I give Mission: Impossible III an enjoyable 7/10, that has unfortunately been overshadowed by both its follow-ups and its cousins of the time, but is still pretty good in its own right, and it gave us Benji, so plus points there too."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","1","29 July 2018"," What is the rabbit's foot? Even J.J. doesn't know.
","Essentially, 'Mission: Impossible III (2006)' takes the series back to its roots and eases off on the action slightly, though not entirely, to make a movie much more akin to a spy thriller than a straight up action one. It still focuses much more on its high-octane set-pieces than its espionage elements, though. For all intents and purposes, it sets a precedent for the franchise. Subsequent films would go on to raise the bar significantly every time and it never reaches the heights of the first feature, but this flick towers above the series' second instalment and provides plenty of entertainment in its own right, including a fantastically unflinching opening, even though it falls victim to constantly unsteady camera-work and a weak, macguffin-reliant plot. 7/10"
"cruise01","8","1","1","26 July 2018"," M:I 3 is a kinetic action packed sequel that throws you into a wild ride.
","Mission Impossible 3 ( 4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 3 is a pretty fun exciting and action packed sequel. J.J. Abrams does bring a fresh style to the spy action film with a kinetic style, lots of action, a simple plot device that puts characters in a globe trotting adventure, and it is very fast paced that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I will say though, J.J. Abrams who did tv shows like Lost and Alias. This film does feel a lot like an episode from Alias just replace Jennifer Garner with Tom Cruise. And using similar music score from Lost. Which has the same music composer Michael Giacchino. <br/><br/>The plot follows Ethan (Tom Cruise) finally settling down with Julia (Michelle Monaghan). She does not know his secret life of working for IMF. She thinks he goes on business trips when he leaves for a mission. When a mission in Berlin has him rescuing an agent he once trained Lindsey (Keri Russell). He discovers that an arms dealer Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is after a mysterious device known as ""Rabbit's foot."" When Ethan and his team extract Davian and have him in custody. Davian will test Ethan when stakes are high when the threat comes to his wife Julia. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams script uses the rabbit's foot as a plot device. Were the audience will not know much more about it. Except that it is a high valuable target to arms dealer and the bad guys will try get their hands on it. With the good guys trying to prevent that. It is a simple plot. But it sets up characters going on one set piece to another. <br/><br/>The action sequences are awesome and kinetic with energy. From the suspense opening sequence. To an action scene in Berlin were Ethan breaks into a warehouse with gun torrents causing destruction. And there escape on a helicopter being caught in a dogfight with another helicopter. Then, the film pauses a little bit and give a bit of a love story with Ethan and his wife. Then, flashes to Rome were Ethan and his team infiltrates an auction and tries to capture the villain. Which leads to a menacing conversation when Davian threatens Ethan on the plane. Foreshadowing for more to come. And than there is an explosive action sequence on a bridge with a drone destroying a convoy and Ethan trying to stop the bad guy from escaping. The action does not stop there. J.J. Abrams knows how to keep the pace moving and having wild action sequences that makes it the best movie out of the three. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is great yet again. Philip Seymour Hoffman does play a menacing villain. He does not have to throw a punch but his words can make you feel unease. Michelle Monaghan was decent, as Ethans love interest. Their love story in the film is the weakest part. The movie plays like action and explosions than slows down when Julia is thinking Ethan is hiding something than it rushes to another action set piece. And it follows this pattern throughout.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible 3 is a good action film. The action sequences are plenty and visually exciting. It runs at a fast pace with several action set pieces. The plot is okay with a boring sub plot with Ethan and Julia. J.J. Abrams direction is energetic. He does have a lot of close up camera shots that is zoomed in characters faces. But still the best Mission movie yet."
"AnishMisra","8","1","1","23 July 2018"," Mission: Impossible - III Review
","Mission: Impossible - III is a film directed by J.J. Abrams. After the dismal second instalment, I wanted something that could revamp the series and bring new energy that the series deserves. This film exactly did that.<br/><br/>Plot: Ethan Hunt is called out of retirement when one of his trainees is captured by black market arms dealer, Owen Davian.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is the debut of J.J. Abrams as a feature film director. He had a huge responsibility of bringing the franchise back on track and he delivers. The writing team (Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Orci) do know what the franchise needs, gives the fans (like me) satisfying moments that was longed for in the second part. Abrams being into spy thrillers (Alias) was the perfect choice. For the only time in the series, we do see the IMF office, which was a wonderful take. Also shown very beautifully is what happens when the professional life overtakes the personal. The characters that are newly introduced just go with the flow of the film in addition to leaving their own impression. Some of the action scenes too are just powerful and full of adrenaline. The music by Michael Giacchino is suspenseful and adds to the wonder this film has. I did like the colour palette that the film used which gave the film a very gritty and dark look. The main issue with the film is regarding the cinematography. There are certain scenes where there are close-ups for very long time and also there was a lot of shaky-cam which interrupted my viewing a couple of times. Also, there were certain scenes where some explanation or even a small description would do justice.<br/><br/>Performances: It was good to see Tom Cruise back into action after his tireless romantic attempt in the previous instalment. Ving Rhames provides good support to Tom's character. Simon Pegg does a wonderful job as Benji. So does Michelle Monaghan as Julia. Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup are great in their performances. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are awesome as IMF agents. And finally, Philip Seymour Hoffman is probably the best villain the M: I series had. He is ruthless and cunning. Philip nailed his role perfectly.<br/><br/>Favourite Scene: It would be the one where Ethan tries to exact information from Owen by threatening him to throw him out of the plane. Without any fear, Owen replies that he will find every loved one of Ethan's and kill them right in front of him. This scene showed the devilish side of Owen and I was impressed.<br/><br/>Verdict: Even with its flaws, Mission: Impossible - III serves as a good film with loads of suspense and action scenes and ample of entertainment. <br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"carlos37andre","9","1","1","11 February 2018"," A rush and raw adrenaline-full movie
","My god! This movie is good. <br/><br/>MI3 is just a class about how to make a good action thriller movie, this thing is just breathless all the way down, you can't take a break, you're tense through the majority of the scenes.<br/><br/>So many amazing moments, like the parkour scene in Xangai, the jump from the building, the interrogation scene (both of them), etc etc etc. This movie clearly build all the path that the franchise would follow for the years to come. It's not a ""trash"" vibe of movie, it take itself seriously, but in order to do that, it makes you feel worried about the characters.<br/><br/>It's amazing to see how JJ started with the right foot on his first movie. Probably the only little thing that bothered me was the close ups, is not a awful thing or anything, but I think that sometimes the screen can be too ""crowded"" with the excess of close ups.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman destroys as the villain, his character is so threatening even though you don't know anything about him. The interrogatory scene in the plane is fantastic, when you realize that they gave him the only thing that he needed (Ethan's name). Amazing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise again kills it, the dude is a monster, and continues to impress everybody with his stunts. This is also the first of the MI movies that he needs to use some of his ""dramatic skills"", and he delivers. <br/><br/>The script is well writing, the twist of ""who is the inside bad guy?"" really take me by surprise, and I love it. I also love the first minutes of the movie, when you see Ethan's party, it's soo well done, because in a fell different ordinary situations you get almost all that you need to know about Ethan, how is his life, how is his relationship, and that kind of stuff, in something that last like 5 minutes.<br/><br/>In short, MI3 is a fantastic action movie, that with absolutely certain took the franchise to a whole other level."

","Even though he is retired from actual field work, ""Ethan Hunt"" (Tom Cruise) is asked to join an IMF team on a mission to rescue a colleague named ""Lindsey Farris"" (Keri Russell) who has been kidnapped by an international arms dealer by the name of ""Owen Davian"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman). At first the mission is a great success as they not only extricate Lindsey but also take a couple of badly damaged laptops with them as well. Unfortunately, Lindsey dies not long afterward due to a small explosive device implanted in her brain and there is some doubt as to whether the IMF will be able to retrieve any information on the laptops. Needless to say, the IMF director ""Theodore Brassel"" (Laurence Fishburne) is not very happy with the outcome and lets all of the agents involved in the mission know about it. Fortunately, one small piece of information is gleaned from the corrupted disk drive on one of the laptops which reveals that Owen is scheduled for a meeting in Rome and it's at this time that a top-secret mission is launched to capture him alive. However, what Ethan doesn't realize is that there is a traitor within the IMF organization and things are going to become exceedingly difficult for him not long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be an exciting film with plenty of action and suspense all the way through. Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance and having three beautiful actresses in Michelle Monaghan (as ""Julia""), Maggie Q (""Zhen Lei"") and the aforementioned Keri Russell certainly didn't hurt. In short, I thought this was an entertaining movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","1","29 August 2016"," Third time's the charm
","The third time's the charm for Tom Cruise in this excellent action flick which blows all the rubbishy memories of WAR OF THE WORLDS away and proves that he's still rightfully the world's biggest star. Easily eclipsing the previous two movies in the series (with the first one's over confusing plot and the second's lack of it), this movie delivers one blistering action sequence after another, getting better and better as it goes along, before finishing with a powerhouse climax that'll have you pounding on the arms of your chair! <br/><br/>Cruise slips into his character of the hero (after his hit-man role in COLLATERAL) with ease and is goofily likable. It's good to see that the charismatic Ving Rhames is back as Luther, while there's a whole new cast list full of kick-ass female characters, a sinister Laurence Fishburne, a funny Simon Pegg, and a truly evil Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. The action set-pieces are superbly handled by J.J. Abrams, especially the attack on the bridge (shades of TRUE LIES) which is phenomenal and takes special effects to new levels. The other shoot-outs and various infiltrations are great, the tension off set by genuinely funny one-liners (the humpty-dumpty line still cracks me up) and to say more is to spoil it. All I can say is that MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III is one of my favourite action thrillers of the 2000s, is undoubtedly the film of the year, and everybody should make an effort to see it!"
"brando647","7","1","1","23 January 2016"," A Fun Return to Form for the Series Following the Disappointing M:I:II
","Needing to flush the sour taste of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II from my mind, I've followed it with a viewing of the 2006 installment, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III. The third film in the ongoing franchise is the on I'm least familiar with. I didn't get around to seeing it in theaters and I watched once when it was released on DVD before my copy was lost. At the time, I remembered this one blowing my mind and establishing itself as my favorite of the series. Does it hold up now? Mostly, yeah. I don't rank it as my favorite of the original three films anymore (that honor returns to the original 1996 film) but it's still significantly better and more entertaining than the second film. From J.J. Abrams in his feature-film directing debut, the movie begins as IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has settled down in life. He is no longer a field agent, opting to train new agents so he can build a stable life with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan). When Hunt learns a former protégé (Keri Russell) has gone missing on an operation where she was assigned to follow notorious arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt rejoins his team to bring her home. But it won't be that easyDavian is a mad-man and he's not afraid to murder in cold-blood to discourage others from interfering in his business. Hunt is about to learn the dangers of crossing one of the most powerful, well-connected international criminals when you've got something to lose.<br/><br/>M:I:III improves over its immediate predecessor by scaling down the action and making it serve the plot, instead of vice versa. The action isn't the centerpiece; the characters are. Specifically, Hunt. This is a personal mission for him. He personally trained Lindsey Farris, the agent captured in the beginning, and feels responsible for bringing her home safe. Later in the film, Davian discovers that Hunt has a pressure point in the form of his new wife and uses it to control the situation. These, my friends, are stakes and what M:I:II was missing to make me care about Hunt and Nyah. We get to spend some time with Hunt and Julia in the first act of the film and see them interact. We get a sense of their relationship and how happy they make each other. Hunt is so in love that he's willing to quit his globe-trotting life of spy adventures for the woman. See? Character development. Even Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), member of Hunt's team since the first film, gets it better this time around and isn't limited to whining about his Gucci shoes. The villain of the piece, as played by Hoffman, is a terrifying man without having to do much. From the moment the movie opens, we see the lengths the man will go to get what he wants. He never loses his cool. He's calm, collected, and soft-spoken and it works for him because we've seen how dangerous he is. Hoffman's a pro and makes for an excellent baddie.<br/><br/>I'd stated before that the action is ""scaled down"" in this one and that's because it goes for quality over quantity. There are some pretty sweet action sequences in M:I:III. There's an awesome helicopter chase through a wind farm and the big action piece in the middle of the film where the villain employs a military-grade drone to escape a convoy on a bridge. Honestly, my favorite sequence in the film isn't one of the grand battles but the infiltration of the Vatican when the IMF team realizes they have a chance at acquiring Davian. It's not bombastic; it's more of the cooler spy stuff I loved about the first film. I always find I love these movies more when their treated as a spy film with action elements, rather than an action film with spy elements. I love that we get to see more in M:I:III about how the IMF works behind the scenes. We spend some time in IMF headquarters and there's the question of a possible mole working in the highest rankings of the organization (which, you'll remember, was also a big part of the first film). MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III brings the series back to the elements that I loved in the first movie while giving it a little more humanity and personal stakes. It was a fun improvement over John Woo's installment and almost as good as the original Brian De Palma film. A few years after this movie came out, it wouldn't matter as much anyway because Brad Bird would give us GHOST PROTOCOL, what I believe to be the best of the series and the one that blew all of the original three out of the water."
"p-jonsson","6","1","1","12 January 2016"," Decent action movie, still not my idea of a Mission Impossible movie.
","This instalment, the third movie, in the Mission Impossible series is better than Mission Impossible II although it has to be said that this is not that difficult as far as I am concerned. The movie is more balanced in pace and the stunts and action scenes are not so totally over the top and ludicrous as in the second half of Mission Impossible II. Having said that there are still lots of pretty outrageous action stunts. This movie also has a real bad-ass villain that would not have been out of place in a classical James Bond movie.<br/><br/>The plot is as uninspired as one can expect from a Hollywood action movie. Hero crosses bad guys path and acquires something that the bad guy wants. Bad guy gets pi--ed off and grabs good guys wife to force him to get the stuff the bad guy wants. Big show-down at the end and bad guy bites the dust. Throw in a traitor in the mix just to mess things up at regular intervals. Nothing to write home about in other words.<br/><br/>The entertainment value of this film, as of the two previous ones, comes entirely from the various, more or less contrived, stunts, tricks and action sequences in the movie. As one can assume from the movies budget the film delivers well in these areas.<br/><br/>What I find annoying is that Ethan, again, finds himself alone and without support from the IMF team as well as having to deal with a traitor within. I find that kind of stuff tiresome to say the least. While I am in ranting mode I can also say that the silly idea of ""dying"" and then getting kick-started again, especially given that the time between ""dying"" and being kick-started again suffered from the usual lack of the concept of actual time elapsed so often being shown by Hollywood directors, was pretty silly.<br/><br/>As I wrote, it is a decent enough action movie but I would really like to see a ""true"" Mission Impossible movie where the team gets a mission and executes it with the full force of IMF behind them."
"mindtrick711","9","1","1","12 December 2015"," Great action that ramps up
","Has foot stomping edginess, very fast, some moments out paces the viewer with tight and awesome action. Little time to digest details but don't worry, discreet details are forgiving. The movie just grabs you and off you go. Story plot is easy to follow, scene to scene has plenty of clever edges and smart angles that won't let you think. Kind of like jumping off a cliff and watching the bottom come at you. The only thing you know is, the fall has to last the length of the movie. Good acting and directing. Timing won't let you sit around to accumulate boring facts. The cast is great, Tom Cruise is relentless, Phil Seymour Hoffman is a cunning and diabolical villain. The scenes sweep by with seamless flowing interaction between characters. Some impossible cinematography scenes look so entirely possible it makes you think, ""Is it really possible?"" Seen it twice. May have to see it again. A really good movie to watch and entertain friends with. The end feels good as all Mission Impossible movies do. Love this."

","I'm glad there are so many positive reviews of this movie. It should be telling that the negative reviews are all 0 starts, or ~5 stars, it just goes to show that it isn't meant for every audience, and I'm left wondering why indie-film buffs are leaving reviews on an action title.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned this movie is exceptionally well made, I was excited the whole time and was surprised by the precision with which it was executed.<br/><br/>It's an action spy-movie, that sets the bar somewhere in the mid-range, and this title is easily in the top 15 percent, especially considering it's the first box-office endeavor of a young director. I'm not sure why indie-film buffs are even making an entry. <br/><br/>If you find yourself hating movies like this, stay away from any movie with action in it, because obviously you don't get it.<br/><br/>Bourne Supremacy was horrible by comparison, there was much less action, plot, and character development...apparently people think that less dialogue and wide-angle shots of European cities makes a film more artsy. None of us are going to MI:3 wanting artsy, we want well executed action and (sorry but Tom Cruise is an amazing actor) awesome characters.<br/><br/>Highly recommend, esp w/ popcorn and loud sound!"

"AmyJenson1995","7","1","1","10 September 2015"," Much better than MI2
","This third installment of the Mission Impossible series is a mix between MI1 and MI2. While the first Mission Impossible focused on the story and MI2 on action, Mission Impossible 3 is allowing both of them.<br/><br/>The storyline is much better written than the one in the first sequel. The scenarists got the good idea to include a romance within it. A real romance where Ethan is in real love and is about to marry. This makes him more human than in MI2 but also much more vulnerable to his enemies. And Davian is particularly a mean one. The confrontation between him and Ethan is what make this movie so thrilling because the villain is mentally torturing Ethan making him his pawn and forcing him to do the dirty work for him. It's something we haven't seen before and it's quite well played by both the actors.<br/><br/>But MI3 is also an action movie and it's full of it. The only difference with MI2 is it's not overplayed. In MI2, because the story was inexistent, all was focused on the action staging with a lot of explosions, spectacular combat moves and bike chases. Here it is simpler but it's still entertaining because there is an efficient storyline alongside it. The locations are still breathtaking especially Shanghai and the Vatican.<br/><br/>In conclusion I gave it a 7 out of 10. If you are looking for a great action movie, watch MI3."
"moviemattb","9","1","1","31 August 2015"," Outstanding Film Debut for J.J. Abrams
","J.J. Abrams is well known for his two popular TV shows like ""Alias"" and ""Lost,"" as well as directing the first two ""Star Trek"" movies and my favorite of his ""Super 8;"" now he is off to direct the new ""Star Wars"" movie and I'm not so sure about it. I'll just have to wait and see. With that said, ""Mission: Impossible III"" is about Ethan Hunt who is now enjoying with the love of his life Julia Meade as he receives a messages from the IMF to have him come back on the force as he brings his team to track down Owen Davian as they are wanting to know about the ""Rabbit's Foot."" Moreover, Julia gets kidnap by Davian as Ethan tries to get her back for whatever it takes to stop Davian for killing her. As far as this is Abrams' film debut, its actually quite outstanding. I thought the premise of the movie is a step up from the second movie, and it really does keep me going as the movie goes. The action in this movie is really good, and I don't think its has some of that jumpy editing or the camera being shaky. I can see perfectly fine on what is going on. The cast in this movie all did great. Tom Cruise is still Ethan Hunt, and still being awesome. So much praise for Cruise, if you ask me. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job for playing such a villain. I don't know if he is a three dimensional villain, but I love him anyway; it is sad that he is no longer with us, and will surely be miss. Rest in peace, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Moving on, Michelle Monaghan was actually really good to play Ethan Hunt's love interest, and is probably the best female lead in a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie in my humble opinion. The rest all did fine. Michael Giacchino's music and his arrangements for the theme song was fine. I don't like it as much as either Hans Zimmer's or Danny Elfman's, but its fine on its own. The movie does have some good stunt work, especially for Tom Cruise when he has to run in this movie. Quote from ""Minority Report"" ""Everybody runs,"" but hey he is Tom Cruise and he is always into the action. The final confrontation between Ethan and Davian was decent, but not as good as the last fight between Ethan and Sean from the second movie. I do wish if the fight was a bit longer, and I guess have Ethan not worry about the bug that is planted inside his head. Also, have a true proper death scene for Hoffman's character instead of getting hit by a truck. I don't know if you would agree with me on this one, but all I'm is saying that the final confrontation could've been a lot better. But it is to each of their own. Overall, I enjoy ""Mission: Impossible III"" and I really had a heck of a fun time! I give it a 9 out of 10."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","1","23 August 2015"," Thrilling, memorable and featuring the best acting the franchise has ever had
","The main problem that has faced this franchise is that the newer installments are less consistently memorable, but the originals are lesser in quality. However, I'm fairly certain that JJ Abrams' Mission Impossible 3 sits squarely in the middle of those two issues and does both well enough to make it my favourite of the lot.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has retired from field ops and is now teaching and happily engaged to the lovely Jules (a delightful Michelle Monaghan who is just right for the part). He is dragged back into the job when one of his students is compromised on an espionage mission. Throughout the film, dual loyalties and suspicions are unearthed like in every one of these films, but this one does so with great suspense and doesn't feel like its just going through the motions. The problem with this franchise is that very few characters actually carry over between films, so the film has to build up and establish all of the new characters. We need to therefore spend heaps of time building up Hunt's friendship with Musgrave in order to misdirect his later betrayal. Because of this, Hunt's team of Maggie Q and Jonathan Reith-Meyers become mere afterthoughts – which makes it hard to accept that they go rogue to help him later on.<br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian is an absolutely incredible villain – not only the best this franchise has ever had but one of the great cinematic villains of all time in my opinion. He is utterly ruthless and without remorse and when Hunt is at his mercy I was truly tense. But the difference between a great villain and a great performance is the quality of actor and Academy Award Winner Hoffman really outdoes himself. In a scene which most of us probably forget, Hunt must impersonate Davian and appears in a Davian mask and voice. Hoffman manages to capture Cruise's pure essence – his intense stare, his frenetic gestures and even his charm. Its absolutely incredible work from Hoffman. Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames are always great in these movies – and this is probably the only movie outside the original where Rhames is fully utilised – and there's a terrific performance by Laurence Fishburne thrown in. Fishburne gets some of the best lines in the film and delivers then with a scathing wit.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Davian's pursuit of a Macguffin called the ""rabbit's foot"" and Abrams is way too coy trying to keep it mysterious. There is a point where ambiguity just starts getting frustrating (wait this guy made Lost? Hmmm I see the pattern). The film has a couple of great action set pieces and JJ Abrams sculpts it well to create fear and helplessness. For whatever reason, Abrams decides not to show us Hunt's capture of the Rabbit's Foot in China, focusing on his boring and forgettable teammates in the van. Maybe he wanted to slow it down between action scenes, but come on man.<br/><br/>The film is very relentlessly edited, with an average of 2 second per cut in some of the action sequences (yet there's time for a 20 second uninterrupted shot of Tom Cruise running) which makes watching the whole thing a headache to watch – one really has to absorb it as a whole rather than being able to watch it. But that's not to say Abrams isn't a good director – the film's opening scene (which is revealed in context later on) is one of the best directed, scripted and acted scenes I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible 3 has the memorability of the early films and the quality of the latter. I don't think I'll ever forgive JJ Abrams for steering Lost off the road and into a time portal, but he makes a great movie here with high quality acting and a decent plot."
"robsta23","8","1","1","9 August 2015"," Hunt is Much More Emotionally Invested
","The opening sequence for this film is my favorite of the series. It throws you into the story out of chronology like some of my favorite films (Pulp Fiction, Inception, The Prestige) and it is very tense even though we don't know the exact context of the situation. It sets a standard for the rest of the movie to live up to, and it does so at least as far as the character of Ethan Hunt is concerned.<br/><br/>After this tense opening, we get a feel for Ethan's personal life as he has left IMF for the time being to live with his fiancée. He clearly has retained some skills as he can lip read a conversation which concerns him between some females at what I assume to be a wedding shower. This isn't really an effective way to show he misses his work, but what do you know, during this shower he receives a call and meets up with his superior in a convenience store. His mission calls for him to rescue a female spy whom he mentored, and when he fails he sets his priorities straight - Hunt spontaneously marries his fiancée and wishes to protect her.<br/><br/>Once we get into the main plot of the film, there is a focus around the Philip Seymour Hoffman villain, and Hunt and his crew kidnap him in a sequence which illustrates how the mask-making works - exciting! What's awesome yet a little strange about this villain is he takes this threat to him extremely personally. Instead of talking at all about the Macguffin referred to as the Rabbit's Foot, Hoffman's character calmly asks Hunt if he has a wife or girlfriend and threatens to kill him in front of her if he ever gets the chance. This pushes Hunt to a near breaking point, but we never get a clear explanation why this is so personal to the Hoffman character. Either way, it ups the stakes for Hunt as the villain is eventually able to track down Hunt's wife and uses her as a hostage to get Hunt to obtain the Rabbit's Foot for him.<br/><br/>It is clear in this film that the Macguffin is the Macguffin - a plot device which drives the movie but has little importance - as we focus more on whether Hunt will be able to save his wife/himself in the end or not. This makes Mission: Impossible III a better movie than its predecessors as we are more invested in the characters as Hunt is more emotionally invested in the mission this time around.<br/><br/>As an action movie, however, this film is just a little bit of a letdown - there are about 3 elaborate action sequences spread throughout the movie that are brief and only somewhat exciting. The climactic sequence of the movie is a good showdown between Hunt and the villain, but is not as climactic as it could be, taking place in a village of small buildings without the opportunity for cool tactics to be used, but as I said, this movie is more about Hunt's struggle to protect his wife, making up for this lack of great action which this series is all about.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

","I'm working my way through the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise of films, and I have to say that I just absolutely love this movie. The cinematography is a good blend between the first two films, with the good film color of the second but without the goofy overdone fight scenes that ruined it. <br/><br/>The story is well written and well told, and the entire cast of the film does an exceptional job. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show as the main villain, and Cruise is once again a convincing lead role (something that diminished more than a bit in MI2). The movie keeps you interested and its last half an hour is sure to have you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 stars!"
"Al_The_Strange","8","1","1","2 August 2015"," Mission Impossible III Review
","For years, a third Mission Impossible movie seemed unlikely, until JJ Abrams accepted the mission to make it happen. As Abrams' debut picture, Mission Impossible III is a rip-roaring thrill ride full of color and energy.<br/><br/>From its first scene onwards - half of a torture scene that is ultimately revisited later in the picture - the movie sets itself apart from its predecessors. It is grittier and more violent, showing agents skirting death and disaster in the hands of dangerous villains. There are really neat scenes of infiltration and deception, including a daring operation in the Vatican and a building in Shanghai. There's also a lot of loud and frenetic action, to include a thrilling helicopter chase scene through a windfarm, a drone attacking cars on a bridge, and plenty of gunfighting.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action and energy to keep the film rolling at full steam ahead, without being overblown. As welcoming as the pace is, one thing keeps it from being perfect: the cameramanship. Photography is good a lot of the time, but there are a lot of scenes where the camera shake becomes erratic, and it often hinders the action more than it helps. It's not quite as awful as The Bourne Supremacy or anything, but I would have liked MI: III a grade more if the camera would settle down a bit more.<br/><br/>What makes this film work, thankfully, is the storytelling. It's a pretty simple and straightforward affair. The plot ultimately revolves around people fighting over ""The Rabbit's Foot,"" the full details of which are never disclosed (although it's not too hard to figure out what it could be in the end). It's ultimately not the focus of the story; it's just a device to showcase the true conflict, which is between the hero and the villain. At this point in the series, Ethan Hunt has become a more reluctant hero, having found a woman to settle down with. When he's dragged back into action, he spurs the villain, Owen Damien, to hit back where it hurts the most. Characterization is at its best in this film; Ethan is finally given something for the audience to latch onto emotionally, and when it becomes threatened, it reveals Owen Damien to be one of the most chilling and heartless villains committed to the big screen. This simple focus on characters makes the story and action flow much better than everything that happened in the previous movies, representing a huge step-up in quality storytelling.<br/><br/>This film is captured with very striking photography; colors are very vivid, details are sharp, and the film looks very slick overall. Camera shake does rear its ugly head in many scenes, but for every shaky scene there's also a very good-looking scene, so it balances out. Editing is pretty sharp and concise. Tom Cruise seems to play Ethan with more maturity than before, ditching most of the cockiness and adding in a decent amount of emotional heft. Phillip Seymour Hoffman excels as the villain in a chillingly perfect performance. Michelle Monaghan is lovely in all respects, and it's great to see Simon Pegg and Maggie Q in the mix. Other actors aren't bad. Writing is pretty straightforward and good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, special effects, and some real-looking locales. Music is pretty good.<br/><br/>The first mission had great scenes, but came off as being rather dry. The second mission was just crazy. The third time is the charm, thanks to the focus on an actual story with actual characters worth seeing. This mission comes highly recommended, even if you haven't seen the others.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Pretty Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)"

","Mission: Impossible III is directed by J.J.

In this one, there's so much action, maybe even more than in the second film in the franchise, but it's so well executed. Every eye-popping action sequence in the movie is just beautifully shot and expertly executed. The stunts are amazing, the musical score is also great and intense. Every minute of this movie is just crazy intense! From the opening scene to almost the end credits it's just intense as hell.<br/><br/>The movie is at times unbelievable, some of the things that happen are just a little over the top sometimes.<br/><br/>But overall, Mission: Impossible 3 is an excellent action movie and, in my opinion, is better than the original in almost every way."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","22 July 2015"," Best Mission: Impossible Movie So Far!
","The third instalment in the Mission: Impossible film series is also the very first that manages to get every single thing right for it is an intensely engaging, relentlessly paced & absolutely thrilling sequel that packs in a riveting plot, crazy stunts, cool gadgets & explosive action to succeed as the finest chapter of its franchise and is great enough to rank amongst the best examples of its genre(s).<br/><br/>The story of Mission: Impossible III concerns Ethan Hunt who has retired from the field work for IMF & now trains new recruits. But when one of his protégés is killed while investigating an international arms dealer, Hunt plans a mission & prepares a team to apprehend him but soon finds out that his latest adversary is far more dangerous than imaginable & is hellbent on taking away everything Hunt holds dear in his life.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by J.J. Abrams, Mission: Impossible III also marks the very beginning of his filmmaking career and he certainly couldn't have asked for a better start. This sequel does benefit from the new director's fresh insight as Abrams envisions the story as a never- ending chase and keeps it sprinting in only top gear from start to finish, thus never allowing its viewers a moment to settle down once the main plot surfaces.<br/><br/>The screenplay tackles the shortcomings of previous chapters by adding more substance to its plot while also giving greater attention to its characters & their arcs. Production design is stellar, locations provide an exotic layer to its events, Cinematography makes excellent use of hand-held photography, the colour tones n textures encapsulates the story with a vibrant feel, and the dynamic movements of its camera wonderfully enhances its chaotic action.<br/><br/>Thanks to its tight editing, its 125 minutes of runtime is fiercely paced plus its effectiveness can also be felt in those brilliantly-edited action or chase sequences. VFX team does make ample use of CGI but it never steps into the realm of absurdity. And last but not the least, the background score by Michael Giacchino is loud & bombastic but also incredibly fitting and is equally responsible for keeping the viewers firmly gripped to their seats throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Mission: Impossible III features a fabulous cast in Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan & Ving Rhames with added input coming from Laurence Fishburne, Simon Pegg, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q & others. Cruise is at his most committed yet again but this time he's pretty much overshadowed by Hoffman's terrific rendering of his character and even in his limited screen time, he manages to leave the most lasting impression.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible III is a fascinating blend of kinetic direction, solid script, exuberant camera-work, blistering pace, mind-blowing action, brilliant performances & fantastic score, all of which work in seamless harmony to deliver the goods in a manner that's far more enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying than expected. Although it isn't entirely flawless, Mission: Impossible III nonetheless works as a top-gear action spectacle that's clever, imaginative & downright fun. An absolute must for action aficionados."

","I would have to say this is my favourite of the Mission Impossible movies to date. Slick and stylish with amazing action scenes, great special effects & locations, a gripping story and a fantastic cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman who kills it as the bad guy here. Very intense and just awesome.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise also gives 110% to his role and you can tell. Lots of fast, intense running scenes for him as well as some very heartfelt tears -the scene where he thinks his wife is dead and also when he asks her to trust him, no questions asked.<br/><br/>I thought the scene where the team busts into Vatican city, and all that entailed was excellent and wow that action sequence on the bridge, taking special effects/action to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The tiny bombs being implanted in peoples heads was a new idea and one I found quite freaky. On that note I can't seem to get Keri Russell's blown eyeball out of my mind. Just an all round great movie experience. 6/7/15"
"gdematties","8","1","1","16 June 2015"," A thrill ride!
","J.J. Abrams adds his stamp of excitement and twists in his feature film directorial debut as he ups the ante in the third installment of Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. The film opens with Ethan Hunt rescuing one of the IMF agents (Keri Russell) who has been captured by enemy agents. Unfortunately, she is killed during the rescue and Hunt assembles a team to track down the villain (Philip Seymour Hoffman) responsible. When he escapes capture, he tries to take personal revenge on Hunt by kidnapping Hunt's new wife (Michelle Monaghan) as a threat and to ensure Hunt steals a weapon for him. Some excellent, well-publicized high tension stunts done by Cruise highlight much of the action sequences, which are top notch, as Hunt's team travels the globe from the Vatican to Shanghai in search of Hunt's wife and the ""Rabbit's Foot"" weapon. A great thrill ride, and a sign of things to come for Abrams, putting him on the forefront of action films."
"danielloe","7","1","1","15 June 2015"," Smart, tense, and dark
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Out of the three Mission Impossible movies I have seen, MI 3 is the best. It combines the intelligent, investigation aspect of the first film, but tosses in a little action for good measure. In a way it combines the best aspects of the first two movies. From MI 1 it gets the tension, and the break in scenes, as well as an intelligent plot, where you don't know who to trust, and we get some big reveals at the end. From the second movie, we get the action scenes (though much more toned down and believable) and we get an actual villain (though much better). This one also didn't feel like a Tom Cruise ego trip (yes, MI 2, I'm looking at you). Tom Cruise gives a much better performance in this one, as Ethan Hunt gets a bit more character, instead of just... agent. He had some personality in the first one, not much, but some, but by the second one, he was an awkward blend of James Bond and Neo. The romance scenes are a little cheesy, but I thought they were used well, as Hunt's romance is a major plot point. Cruise has much better chemistry with the new love interest than he did with Nyah from the second movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman really delivers as the villain. While Sean from MI 2 served as like an evil version of Hunt, Hoffman's Davien is like the complete opposite of Hunt. Davien is ruthless, cold, uncaring, and cruel. You can tell he takes pleasure in what he does, even though he hides it under his calm demeanor. Hoffman really helped make this movie. Another person who deserves the credit for this movie is J.J. Abrams, one of my favorite directors. He really knows how to make a good tone for a movie, and he handles characters really well. This movie is no exception, Abrams is easily the best MI director so far. Brian De Palma shot the first one in such a weird way it looked like it was made in the 60's. And John Woo abused slo-mo something awful in the second movie. It's also nice seeing a moderate level of action, unlike the second movie which was just overloaded with action. The action sequences are also well handled, even though they do feel a bit choppy at times. In conclusion, I think Mission: Impossible III was a good movie, with a great villain, a good story, and some good action. Now, I think I'm finally on board with the Mission: Impossible movies."
"troyputland","8","1","1","7 May 2015"," Back to its best!
","'We put an explosive charge in your head' says Hoffan's Owen Davian to MIF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Then BANG! opening credits. J.J. Abrams takes Mission: Impossible back to its routes by focusing entirely on Hunt. He may have found himself a new team and a cast who prove their worth, but they're secondary to Mr. Cruise and his stunt-battling, gadget wielding, free running nutter. This franchise is his baby, and no one will stand in his way. His name printed on the posters is almost as big as the title. This third outing plays on Ethan's fears and shows you what makes him tick. Weapons dealer Davian exploits this, staying two steps ahead of Hunt and his team who're sent to find him and dispatch him. The plot doesn't thicken any more than this, it's kept ambiguous so Cruise can work his magic. Abrams' effort is marginally better than Woo's conformity, and even a stretch treacherous than the first. Hunt does his best to keep his fiancée Julia (Monaghan) blissfully unaware of his lifestyle, but she becomes involved none-the-less. Davian brings out opposite emotions in Hunt; he's a Bond-esque villain with zero quirks and a full-scale attitude. He's just what's needed for Cruise to scale, climb, fall and roll his way through set-pieces and just generally be a bad-ass son-of-a-gun. The masks are gone, but that's only a tiny blip in a revitalised franchise."

","Now I have not seen Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol so I have to say that this is the best Mission Impossible film there has been and a bit of a make up for the bad film that was MI 2. This film sees Ethan Hunt now retired looking to settle down with his girlfriend until one of his students is kidnapped, returning to the field he attempts to save her and stop an evil mastermind from releasing a weapon on the world. Now I gave Tom Cruise some criticism for his performance in the previous film but he is back in form in this film and delivers a great performance that is easily his best in this franchise. The supporting cast all do a really good job, with the late Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the villain and was great in the villainous role that he seemed to thrive in. Ving Rhames returned as Luther in the film and he once again does a great job with his chemistry with Cruise being great. The guy who plays Hunt's IMF ally does a good job even though his relationship with Hunt isn't really explained or looked at that much. Michelle Monaghan plays his girlfriend and she is really good for when she is in it however, her role isn't as big as you would have expected but she still does a good job. The story is okay with the romance and team unity being extended in this film and it is the best so far, however, their is a mcguffin in the film and the overall idea of the villain is not too strong. The script is alright with Rhames and Cruise having good dialogue but the rest is alright and it doesn't really add anything to the film. The style is really cool with the diverse locations adding to the film and making it feel like a worldwide situation. Overall this is a huge improvement and a film definitely worth watching."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","1","3 June 2014"," Another twisted but better executed Mission Impossible movie
","It's definitely the best film adaptation of the Mission Impossible series yet. With JJ Abrams at the helm, you know you will get a well executed explosion type action thriller, but he also helps give us more character development than any MI movie has given us. He also gave us the best villain yet in Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian. From the opening scene he shows us just how terrifying he can be. This movie also gave us a love interest that we can actually care about. In an action spy thriller, it's the best love interest we have had since Eva Green in Casino Royale. At times it has too many twists and turns for my liking, but the end result paid off. I was glad to see that they kept the mask pulling to a minimum this go around.<br/><br/>It's a hugely entertaining movie and it manages to support character based drama while still staying true to the Ethan Hunt crazy stunts and the absolutely impossible missions. Hoffman is the best part of the movie, but I think Cruise gives a fantastic performance, and possibly his best spy role yet. Michelle Monaghan was also great and I cant forget to mention the great supporting cast, including that small Aaron Paul cameo. I really think the story was also the best yet for MI, but still disappointing that we never get to find out what this Rabbit Foot thing is.<br/><br/>I think the MI franchise is heading in the right direction. I will watch Ghost Protocol soon and I am ecstatic for MI 5 next year. As long as these movies don't go too crazy like MI 2, where the masks are absolutely overused, then they will continue to make loads of money and please audiences.<br/><br/>+Hoffman runs the film <br/><br/>+Only a few mask pulls <br/><br/>+better character drama then previously seen <br/><br/>-maybe a few too many twists <br/><br/>8.2/10"
"bowmanblue","7","1","1","18 May 2014"," The name's Cruise, Tom Cruise
","Yes, it's that time again where Tom Cruise basically gives us the American version of a James Bond film (not counting Matt Damon's Bourne saga). Now, that might be a bit of a copy... you have the typical globetrotting, coupled with the man who's going to sell something bad to someone even worse, not to mention a doublecross which you may or may not see coming. However, the Mission Impossible films just so happen to be really good fun.<br/><br/>For a start they're all serious (i.e. like the 'modern' Bond films, rather than Roger Moore's time holding the Vodka Martinis), so if you're looking for something a little tongue-in-cheek then you won't find it here. And they're filled with enough action to make Bond himself work up a sweat. However, unlike Bond and Bourne, Tom doesn't go it alone. He has a team of IMF agents in tow to help him get the job done. And, in this case, the 'job' involves catching someone bad who's trying to sell something even worse to someone yet still worse (I think I mentioned that).<br/><br/>And, like just about every other international spy film, they have to travel the world to many scenic locations to blow stuff up (not that they mean to blow up every venue they visit, but it just happens to always end up that way). So, if that sort of film is your cup of tea, you'll be in for a couple of fun-filled hours.<br/><br/>Yes, you might have to suspend your disbelief a little bit to imagine Tom Cruise still managing to remain in one piece (due to the amount of punishment he can apparently take), let alone capable of saving the world every few minutes, but... isn't that why we've watched the Bond films for so long?"

","Dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb.. Dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb.. <br/><br/>Soon when the theme by Lalo Schifrin starts to play after the teaser opening, my blood vessels felt like injected by an excitement serum and my eyes didn't blink for a millisecond till the line up of co-stars ends with a loud bang. I know its gonna be a hell of a roller-coaster ride by then. And I was right. Around 1.45 minutes later, I have reached my final conclusion about this film.. Mission: Impossible III is by far the best series than the previous two!<br/><br/>Synopsis: Super-spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from active duty to trains new IMF agents. But he is called back into action to retrieve a captured agent Lindsey (Keri Russell) from the toughest villain he's ever faced - Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an international weapons and information provider with no remorse and no conscience. Hunt assembles his team - his old friend Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), transportation expert Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), background operative Zhen (Maggie Q), - to travel the globe pursuing Davian, and inadvertently puts Ethan's love, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), in a very great danger.<br/><br/>I was really-really thankful for how I underestimated this movie before. When I step inside the Cinema, I have put down my guard, no expectations, and just plainly want to enjoy Mr. Cruise's screen persona which never failed me, and Keri Russell who I have crushed since ""Felicity"". <br/><br/>Apparently all I got is way more than I bargained for. M:i III is back to where the original of the TV series are rooted. Firstly, I love the fact that this film is not an ego-driven vehicle like the first two films. When I got to see Ethan's team hand-in-hand in every mission from start till end of this film, I said to myself, ""This is what I'm talking about!"". I've been a fan of the TV series, and the Mission: Impossible movies (so far) really didn't work that much for me.. Until I saw this one!<br/><br/>I love every aspects of the film. I love the script which focuses on Ethan's personal life, and stresses that teamwork is the key to success. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the perfect slimy piece of s**t named Owen Davian. Seeing him match wits with Cruise's Ethan when both of them are at the top of their respective games is worth the admission price alone. I love the rest of the cast.. Ooohh I love them. Laurence Fishburne is always delivers gritty one-liners. Keri Russel does action bits, are lovely (I love the hair Keri!). The comic stir-up by Ving Rhames, are entertaining. Michelle Monaghan and her sweetness, aside of her being casted is suspiciously because of her resemblance to Katie Holmes. And as for the rest of the cast, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q, although their character are one dimensional, I could understand that this film based on Ethan's point of view. They're there to finish the job, then that's it that we need to know. Too bad, Billy Crudup's character are so underwritten that I couldn't understand and missed the part where his involvement took place.<br/><br/>But that one tiny bit of flaw is already forgotten and forgiven once I saw the ""Facemaker"". Yep, I guess that's what it's name. It was the tool where the agents used to copy the face of their subject, done it into a mask, and, voilà a perfect undercover. And the gadgets to copy their subjects voice are also fascinating. I love the scene where these utilities are written, they're gripping. Just like in the TV series.<br/><br/>I also love the ending. The twists of ""the-who-dunnit"" ending really fooled me. Which is good, that this means the film is out of the cliché universe. <br/><br/>Overall, I love the action scenes. The real star of this movie is, the one and only Mr. Tom Cruise himself. I'm sure he got beaten, battered up, bruised up, knocked down several times to complete these magnificent scenes. I believe his totalitarianism throughout this movie are not in this world. A double thumbs up on his instinct to believe this project directed by J.J Abrams from ""Lost"" and ""Alias"" stardom.<br/><br/>I cant wait for the Special Edition DVD. Sign me up!"

But Ethan was much too smart to tell him but dragged him to an opening in the plane, opened the door and then tortured him with pretending to drop him out. But just to make sure that he knew who was doing this the other team member shouted out ""Ethan"" no less than 6 times, whereas any professional would never use another team member's name.

But meanwhile girl injected virus herself so the bad guys couldn't use it. Then Tom Cruise has little amount of time to rescue her - which he does in the end. So the the whole plot was - Cruise rescuing the girl; they don't care about terrorists, whole earth which can be killed, no. They just want to help girl.<br/><br/>In the III part it's almost the same. We have Rabbit Foot (we don't know what's this but everyone wants to have it), bad guy, Tom cruise and girlfriend (which now is his wife). After all nice action scenes his wife is kidnapped and then starts the motive which is repeated after 2nd part of the movie - he wants to rescue her... Fighting with terrorism is on the second plan.<br/><br/>For me M:I2=M:I3, that's why Mission Impossible (first part) is the best - there is betrayer, list of agents and two ""teams"" trying to get it.

","MI: 3 plays like an excellent yet much longer episode of Alias, basically. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to the viewer. As for me, I thought this was exactly what it needed. With an excellent blend of espionage, action, comedy, drama, and romance, Mission Impossible 3 proves that with a large enough budget, J.J. Abrams can weave a good story and create an entertaining popcorn flick. It is a very good way to start off the yearly barrage of summer films. Unlike most summer films, this one is actually pretty smart and never truly enters the ""mindless action film"" zone. Is it the best Mission: Impossible? I wouldn't know, I haven't seen the first two. But, I am very sure that you will not leave the theater disappointed.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt returns after a good partner of hers is kidnapped trying to recover something. After a few unexpected moments and a failed mission, now the spotlight is on Ethan, as he hunts after a dangerous arms dealer that is threatening to end the life of Hunt's new wife. Can Ethan keep his life a secret and save his wife Lindsey from the clutches of the enemies? More or less this is the plot, and yes Alias fans, it sounds familiar. There are so many references and tie-ins with Abrams' previous creations that an Alias movie should not sound that bad of an idea. It even starts out Alias-style, in which we see Ethan tied-up, and just seconds away from death---then we are traced back to an earlier time, way before the moments of the very first scene in the film.<br/><br/>Abrams and the scriptwriters do a fantastic job in building up the suspense, by giving us glimpses of the romance between Ethan and Lindsey and also the conversations amongst Ethan and his secret partners as they discuss why a marriage and working for the IMF could never mesh well. Also throughout the movie in between moments of tension and action, there are quirky one-liners and funny little moments that gives us a breath of fresh air after it gets sucked out from the last explosive scene. Clever and witty writing is a rarity nowadays in action movies; its nice to see that there is still some effort into writing for action movies at times. To top it all off, MI:3 is not as predictable as the average motion picture.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is such a versatile actor, he can do comedy, drama, sci-fi, action, he can do it all, and this is why he works well here. In this movie we see him at his angriest, his happiest, and at his weakest. He does his action scenes well and really blends well with the rest of the cast without really overshadowing any other performance. The best performance in the film by far is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he absolutely stole the spotlight the moment he begins his threats. The other actors and actresses did a decent job, none outstanding, with Ving Rhames having the best lines. Watch for a small cameo by an actor that has had plenty of screen time in the cult hit that put Abrams in the director's chair for this movie, Alias.<br/><br/>Nothing is too over-the-top, and that is what excels most in this movie. MI:3's moments are not Transporter 2 or James Bonds' ""You've got to be kidding me"" moments, but more like Alias's over-the-top-but-not-too-ridiculous stunts. Whether it's the awesome scene at Italy, or the action-packed sequence at the bridge, Mission Impossible 3 may be smart, but it is a summer film, and will entertain those action fanatics. The fights are not plentiful, either way that is quickly forgotten when the climax is approaching.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 2006's summer box office season is off to a good start as we have a talented man provide his touch to a well-known franchise, and delivering a smart and fun thriller that is sure to entertain audiences of all kinds, from the action buffs to those that like a little bit of everything in their films. J.J. Abrams has done it again, more props to him for skewing the franchise away from the typical mindless action film that we see all the time. Not as much dependence on special effects than on the interaction amongst the characters, the writing, and also the suspense that builds every time the team has to sneak into a building. Highly recommend, this should be the start of a good directorial career for Abrams. Tom Cruise, despite your off-screen antics, you have provided us with a decent third part of a potential trilogy, which almost never happens. Is there a part 4 on the horizon? Mission: Complete: MI:3 is entertaining."

","Well, I truly didn't expect much out of this film. With all the preproduction problems and changes, I thought this would be a cluster. Also, the Bond-ish improbability of some of the stunts in MI-II were disappointing. This movie showed some heartbreak and emotion that was a pleasant surprise. Some of the fight scenes were truly well-done. But once... just once... I'd like to see someone do what they would do in real life if hit directly in the jaw... PASS OUT!!! Geeez!

","J.J. Abrhams has made, in my opinion a fantastic film. It's far better than MI 2, and about par with MI 1. The spy stuff rocks, and the gun shootouts were great. The acting is great all around, and the overall writing was good.<br/><br/>The only real complaints I have were with the pacing and sense of place. The pacing, at one point, was so break-neck for so long, that the viewer gets exhausted. And the sense of place was pretty out of wack. You just don't feel like you're as far away from someone as they are. Like at any second, it would seem like every character could just burst through the door from nowhere.<br/><br/>I am quite satisfied all around.

"Shrykespeare","9","1","1","9 June 2006"," Not as bad as everybody thinks
","As action movie franchises go, MI has had its ups and downs. If you were to compare it to the most successful ""pure action"" franchise ever, the Die Hard movies, it doesn't hold a candle. In those, the writing is better, the dialogue is better, the hero is easier to identify with, and the action is just as intense. Which is not to say that MI has done badly, but just like with Die Hard, you know going in what you are going to get: great action sequences, an interesting villain and a predictable ending.<br/><br/>But the problem with MI1 was that the plot was too convoluted (it took several viewings to really suss it out), and the problem with MI2 was that the action sequences were used as a crutch to make up for a really lame story (typical John Woo, in other words... and really, has Anthony Hopkins ever been completely wasted in a role like this?).<br/><br/>Now, keeping all this in mind, MI3 really does hold up as the best of the three. The action sequences are very good, the acting is better than usual and the storyline is the most entertaining of the three. We can easily follow what's going on without getting a headache, which is always nice in a ""pure action"" movie. It's what makes many of the Bond movies entertaining, as well.<br/><br/>It could be that many people have ragged on this movie simply because they don't like Tom Cruise. With all the hoopla surrounding his personal life of late, it's hard to watch his movies with a detached eye. But his performance in MI3 is no better or worse than the other two, with enough convincing requisite emotion given how the bad guy attacks him in the most personal way. I neither love nor hate the guy, just as I neither love nor hate Ethan Hunt, his character. We root for him, sure, but we know he's going to win in the end, so whatever.<br/><br/>If you are reading this review trying to decide whether or not to see the movie, I'll level with you. This is a very good movie. Tense, taut, and full of adrenaline. In other words, your typical summer blockbuster. It's certainly not the best action movie ever made, but if this ends up being the last MI movie, at least it went out on a positive note.<br/><br/>My score: 9/10."

When I entered this movie I was under the impression that I would hate it but to my surprise I ended up really enjoying this movie. The star studded cast includes Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Keri Russell, Laurence Fishburne, and Jonathan Rhy Meyers (Match Point). But even with that many stars in one movie no one personality stands out or takes over the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman does an excellent job of playing the bad guy. Tom Cruise keeps it together long enough for you to remember that he is still a great actor. Ving Rhames, well he is Ving Rhames kind of like Samuel Jackson, One Bad MF, enough said. Laurence Fishburne also does an excellent job but it is hard to get his roles for the Matrix out of my head. Keri Russell is in the movie for about a total of 10 minutes which brings up the question of , ""why she is even mentioned in the opening credits?"" And finally Jonathan Rhy Meyers is an up and coming star that does an excellent job and because of his role in Match Point he is 2 for 2 on my list, keep up the good work.<br/><br/>From beginning to end this is a great movie which unlike the past two MI movies does not have a scene that is so unrealistic (I am looking at you John Woo, remember when you made Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott have a battle while on motorcycles) that you'd need a frontal lobotomy to believe what you just saw on screen. This may be a case of the fact that MI:3 was produced, written and directed by JJ Abrams and for all of you that are Lost fans we know that he is just a genius. I really enjoyed this movie and if you can get by the fact that Tom Cruise is a nut I would highly recommend going out to see this movie. It is pretty much what you expect from the Mission Impossible series and if you are a fan of these types of movies you are not going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Loyal Readers I have a challenge for you.

"MatthewInSydney","3","1","1","7 June 2006"," Big & Loud. Dumb & Dumberer.
","This is a big loud action film with a script that would have fitted a b-grade action flick back in the late 80's, or maybe an old Jackie Chan movie, but is a joke for a 2006 film costing $150million. The only fun I had was laughing at parts of it with my partner (something I haven't done since seeing Swimfan a few years ago). Apart from the at times annoying action sequences (all noise and jerky cameras), the script was a constant stream of unbelievable and frustrating action-movie clichés. This might have still been okay if it hadn't been delivered so humourlessly. The old Roger Moore James Bond films were pretty silly - but at least they were fun!<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!>>>> Why was Tom's wife so willing to rush into marriage with him knowing he has major secrets - is she really that dumb (or are we expected to not question why any woman would jump into marriage with Mr Cruise because plenty of actresses do so in real life)? Why would Tom be happy to marry someone while lying about the job he goes to each day and NOT appear to feel even slightly guilty about it (because he's a jerk perhaps?)? Why are America's top agents willing to hand over to the bad guy something which for all they know may become the world's ultimate terrorist weapon for the sake of one hostage, relying on the hope that they can get it back later (if Ethan Hunt is that susceptible to pressure maybe he shouldn't be an agent - and maybe he really should have given the marriage thing a bit more thought in the first place)? Was it really necessary for his wife to end up looking EXACTLY like an 80's action-flick-chick at the climax, wearing the obligatory sweaty tight top and gaining unbeatable gun skills after 5 seconds (literally) of instruction? And considering hundreds of millions of dollars were at stake, and that a small army was employed to organise the attack on the bridge, you'd think Philip Seymour Hoffman could have afforded better security to stop Tom escaping and saving his wife at the end (more than two men to guard her would have been a good start). And personally I found all the 'I'm going to kill you in front of your wife' 'no, I'm going to kill your wife in front of you' 'no, I think I'm going to change my mind again...' an obnoxiously cheap attempt at getting us to care about their fate, when nothing else in the picture made us warm to their relationship anyway. Frankly by the end I could have done with Ethan out of the picture completely. The old Mission Impossible used to be about a team, not a singular agent. If Ethan could be killed off, we could get back to that!<br/><br/>In MI1, Tom's fellow agents were mostly bumped off in the first 15 minutes, giving the film a reasonable excuse to focus on the old Cruiser for the rest of the running time. Here in MI3 Tom has 3 spunky fellow agents who could have been fun to watch operating together as a team of equals. Instead they seem to spend most of their time driving Tom from one of his stunt scenes to the next! How many Tom close-ups do we really need? This on screen self-love is especially irksome considering the star's egocentricities off screen these days. Give it a rest.<br/><br/>I won't give it 1 star - I'll give it 3 for some splashy visuals, which might keep you happy if you don't expect any more than that from your action flicks and are happy to have your intelligence insulted. And at least it wasn't as bad as the Matrix sequels (which also starred Laurence Fishbourne, hmmmmm.....)."

","May seems to be the month studios release their best summer movies and this year MI3, X-Men and Da Vinci Code were the three biggies. Of those 3 the best is easily Mission Impossible III. In the first installment in six years, Cruise continues his role as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell but bad guy Philip Seymour Hoffman seems to dominate the entire film in spite of the fact that he's not in that many scenes.<br/><br/>Introduced in an unnerving sequence at the beginning of the film that is thankfully not repeated in context, Hoffman displays his incredible talent at understatement, even when he is suppose to be Cruise. Of course, Cruise does the usual running, jumping off tall buildings and is repeatedly saved by various ropes just long enough to break his fall before he hits something. Probably the best scene for pyrotechnic fans is Hoffman's escape from an armored car on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel."

"FMACDONALD","8","1","1","5 June 2006"," The Best In The Series
","There are 2 roads you can go down in Hollywood, when an action series reaches it's 3rd film. 1 road is release a great 1st film, and even better 2nd film, and a 3rd film that doesn't quite measure up to the 1st 2 films. Sadly this is the route that the Lethal Weapon series went. The 2nd road you can take is to release a great 1st film, a decent 2nd film and then a 3rd film that is the best in the series. This is the road that the Die Hard series went down, and I am happy to say that this is the road that Missin:Impossible went down. When Paramount released Mission:Impossible in the late '90's, which was directed by Brian DiPalma, fans were treated to a great spy thriller. However action buffs were complaining that there was not enough action and to much story. When Paramount released Mission:Impossible II in 2000, Asian action director John Woo (Faceoff, The Replacement Killers) was called in to helm the film. Now the roles were reversed and while action fans got their fix, there was a big complaint that there was not enough story. Now with Mission:Impossible III paramount has recruited J.J. Abrams, creator of TV's bizarre but brilliant LOST, and the acclaimed action, thriller, spy series ALIAS, to helm the film and the results are perfect. Abrams mixes great action and great story together that action fans, and thriller fans should be happy. Abrams should just stay on the series for Mission""Impossible IV (like there won't be one)because he was born to make great spy, action, thriller movies. Tom Cruise, who get's my vote for most annoying person in America, is 1 of the 2 things that make this film work. Cruise's Ethan Hunt, is a good guy that you actually want to route for. It seems to me that in most action films the bad guy's are 10 times cooler than the good guys. The 2nd thing that makes this film work is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. Hoffman is the villain you love to hate, and that's something that is usually overlooked in action films. Soem might call M:I III ALIAS: The Movie. I hope that people who have never seen ALIAS & Like what they see with M:I III will give ALIAS a shot on DVD. Here's to hoping that Abrams sticks around for M:I 4. On a scale of 10 I give Missin:Impossible III an 8."

","M:I 3 is a movie that has a lot to live up to. But in the end, it doesn't live up to any of it. The movie isn't smart, nor stunning, neither are there mind blowing action sequences involved. Its all very by the numbers and predictable, with really nothing special. And Tom Cruise is really looking way too smug throughout the movie (he should stop with the retarded action flicks and do something good, like born on the fourth or magnolia). M:I 1 was the best mission impossible film, and then it went down hill from there. This might be even worse than the second one, because at least the second one had some crazy action sequences going on. Some reviewers have said that the movie has amazing action, but i don't know what they are talking about. if you've been living in a cave for a long time, maybe then yes, this movie has amazing action, if not, then half the scenes seem reminiscent of james bond, and even entrapment! so basically there's nothing new on offer here as far as the plot or action is concerned...and the acting is pretty average too, except for Hoffman, who does a somewhat evil version of Capote, without the voice (of course). So if you decide to what this movie expecting something special, you will walk away with a lingering sense of disappointment. but if you just want to kill some time, i guess you could do worse..."
"shanfloyd","6","1","1","18 May 2006"," Better than M:I-2
","I don't know if this film can mark the revival of the series but this is definitely a positive turn from much-hyped trash by John Woo. While Woo focused unnecessarily on visually stylized boring action sequences without any pace in the story (well, if that's a story at all), M:I-3 rightfully portrays a simpler yet entertaining basic storyline, carefully added subplots, optimum and balanced visual effects for the action scenes all of which are quite helped by decent casting choices like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Maggie Q and to some extent Michelle Monaghan. Keri Russell is surprisingly very under-used.<br/><br/>Well, agent Ethan Hunt has fallen in love with a doctor and got married. Now he got an assignment to rescue a fellow agent (who's also his protégé) from a mission. Then he got much intertwined in the process which ended up with the bad guys kidnapping his wife as a hostage. And that's the maximum I can reveal under a ""no spoiler"" banner. There's two major plot twists after that which made the story decent enough.<br/><br/>I reached to a point in watching action films where nothing except very intelligent ones excite me enough to be marked as a great film. So M:I-3 is not a great film. But it's good enough for the original M:I fans. My expectations were, frankly, quite minimal. But I ended up entertained enough. Some of the scenes truly deserve praise."

","Spoiler alert It takes about 2 seconds after seeing the good guys and bad guys pair up for you to figure out who the real bad guy is who is setting Ethan Hunt up for failure. And while Owen Davian gets away, it would have been more interesting for John Musgrave to get away instead, and perhaps even to make him less ""revealed"" as to add to the suspense for the next movie.<br/><br/>What made the movie fail for me was to have Musgrave commit the cardinal rule of criminals in movies: they explain to the guy they want to kill what their motives are for evil; when the good guy gets away and then kills the bad guy, it all makes sense. Musgrave's reason for setting up Hunt? He (Musgrave) is against affirmative action, and as John Brassel is black, it's all a plot to discredit Brassel so the whiteys can get back in power. At least, that's about the most coherent thing I could make of it.<br/><br/>If that 2 minute scene were either rewritten or dropped, it would have made the movie much more interesting. But just as MI2 had the ludicrous ""we want stock options!"" for the bad guys, MI3 fails due to this completely pathetic reasoning for Musgrave. I mean, evil people don't get ahead in life because they're stupid. They get ahead because they're smart. And this is just not smart."

Plus I really hated M:I II's chase scene, way to much collateral damage there. J.J. Abrams does a respectable job in this, although it at times (especially in the Vatican) seems a little too much like Alias. The story was a little on the weak side, but there were some pretty funny moments like when they exchanged ""rings"" (little dogs on a ring) The gadgets, like the other films, were pretty cool, from the Kodak camera Ethan gets his mission from to the make-up mirror digital camera/face replicator and the micro-dot chip. There were some sad moments too like when Lindsey dies with 1 second to go on the defib machine. As far as best, I'd say it's just behind the original but way ahead of M:I 2.

This one may not be either so I had better review it now lest I forget it and just say it was entertaining, but I don't remember much about it. This one has Ethan Hunt being tortured with his wife about to be killed before him right at the get go. It then shifts to an early time and this was a very nice plot device because I was actually curious to see how he got into that predicament and how he would get out of it. There is a rather cool rescue scene and another where our team must try to capture a weapons dealer. There is one good action scene after another quite frankly and this time Ethan Hunt has a good IMF team behind him and they actually seem to be helpful. This one also has a very good bad guy a few twists along the way (though nothing to hard to figure out) and it has a rather interesting part of the movie where Hunt is getting something for the bad guy but you never get to see any of it except before he enters the building and when he abruptly leaves said building. This movie is not without its flaws, however, to me it was the best one of the series and one heck of an action movie...at least I think I liked it more than the other two."

Now, if he would just do something to show that he is an ACTOR, as well as a Stuntman - that would be GREAT - because HE can do it (remember Born on The Fourth of July???)

I thought it was really action packed and it kept me on the edge the entire time. Tom Cruise's performance was well average. As always Ving Rhames and a new list of sidekicks brought in some comic relief. But the real actor in the movie has to be Philip Seymour Hoffman who played the cold hearted villain, davien. To me, he is one of the best villains in along time. On the airplane, and this is sort of a spoiler, but when Ethan Hunt is questioning him he doesn't even flinch, doesn't even act mad. He just stares coldly and just gives you chill bumps. He mentions to Ethan, while Ethan is unsuccessfully trying to get information outta him, that he's gonna find Ethan's girlfriend/wife if he has one and torture her and then make her watch Ethan die. When he said all this, it just gave me chills. Hoffman's performance is so dead on and realistic that you really sorta begin to hate him. From the beginning to the very end, he just shows no emotion at all. I think he's brilliant in this movie. He stole it. Not just his acting, but the action was awesome. I loved the movie.

","Let me begin by saying that this film is immensely entertaining. There are some intense action sequences that are a lot of fun to watch. Also, there are some nice twists and turns in the plot. However, several slip-ups in the film prevent it from becoming a good movie. First of all, this film never acknowledges what type of movie it is. Is it a spy-thriller? Is it a shoot-em-up action flick? Is it a B-movie? J.J. Abrams and the writing staff never clearly identifies the film with any of these sub-genres. Is it possible that the film fits all three of these categories? Also, Owen Davian, portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is plain and simple a poorly scripted character. There is absolutely nothing to his character. All we know about him is that he's evil and he's a sadist. What a waste of Hoffman's vast talent. I really hated Davian, but I really didn't have any reason other than he wasn't a nice guy. And finally, why does this film have to rely so much on advanced technology (that probably doesn't even exist)? Many of the action sequences cut corners by using technology. I mean, what ever happened to good old-fashioned espionage?"

As this mission becomes too complicated that it becomes a personal vendetta for Ethan, he meets Owen Davian, a vicious black-market lord whose power and influence makes him impregnable to be caught by the many of the world's intelligence agencies. Davian eventually finds out Ethan Hunt's weak spot, which is the woman he loves. And uses her to make Ethan do his bidding.<br/><br/>The storyline dwells outside the typical ""mission"" storyline and gives us a spotlight on what happens if a secret agent's personal security is compromised when his enemies get to the agent's family or loved ones. Mission: Impossible 3 just has a storyline that may rival the finest Steven Seagal movie. With a storyline that has been overdone in Hollywood movies and executed without a shred of originality, this movie is just good if you're in the mood for eye candy action. A dumbed-down spy movie with a silly plot line but entertaining action. This movie just looks like Cruise's own version of James Bond. On the other hand, MI2 and MI3 may not have been awful as James Bond movies.<br/><br/>Although that I'm sure that this movie will indeed satisfy those who crave for hot spy action, and will indeed draw up mass numbers in the box office, I really would not share the same excitement that favors this movie. But what many would find unusually startling is that there are a number of us who dislike these Mission: Impossible movies because these movies have been committing grave acts of sacrilege upon what is already considered a respected Espionage-thriller series. Let me give you a comparison. What if Harry Potter was filmed in teen flick format not found in the books, but just improvised just to draw up numbers in the box-office? What if the Da Vinci Code was made into a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced action flick starring Ben Affleck with explosive action sequences not found in the book, but improvised to make it more explosive action appealing""? Wouldn't that draw up a bad reaction from the fans of the source material? It is the same case with Mission: Impossible, a TV series about a secret agent team which goes into impossible espionage missions, yet they fulfill it unscathed by detection, so much so that by the end of the episode when the bad guys are defeated, they have no idea that they were duped by manipulative spies of the Impossible Missions Force. Whilst in the movie, the main character leaves a trail of explosions. This is a clear example of Hollywood ruining the classics; forever tarnishing the good name for which such stood for (same with Planet of the Apes and how Tim Burton's remake ruined it) The script is written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and director JJ Abrams. JJ Abram's directing is well-executed. But I'm sure he can build up a better reputation with another project worth his talent. On the other hand, Abrams is already enjoying a phenomenal reputation having created the hit TV series' ""Alias"", ""Lost"" and ""Felicity"".<br/><br/>Just like MI2, there is an unusual sense of narcissistic spotlight that surrounds actor-producer Tom Cruise's character. It was as if the entire script was written around him. They should've entitled MI2 and this movie ""The Ethan Hunt Adventures"". He's the producer who pays for the entire movie anyway. The characters of Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, and the lusciously alluring Maggie Q all take a back seat as script wallflowers playing off the main character. There was even a one minute spotlight on Maggie Q's character which was awkwardly not followed-up by the progression of the storyline. Tom Cruise is not a bad actor. It was refreshing to see Cruise as a villain in Collateral. But for him to go back and do the same old protagonistic action hero role, in which he has done for almost 10 years has taken its toll. Not unless it is a movie with an exceptionally good storyline. But with a mediocre storyline and a role that we have already seen in many guises and in many Cruise interpretations, he really could not expect praise for his monotonous role in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman, is another story, though. Because Hoffman has delivered a truly-salute-deserving diabolical villain performance in this movie. Being the redeeming factor of the film, Hoffman has created this kind of fan-inducing villain, which may remind us of the charisma of Star War's Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Sure it's flashy, loud, and explosive. But aside from that, it is nothing special from your average mediocre big summer action flick. Sadly, the thrills, intrigue, and storyline are a pale comparison to one of the episodes of the Mission: Impossible TV series. The good news is that this movie is clearly a notch above amusing. And indeed it is a movie made for the mass crowds who like their popcorn action with a whole lot of explosions, gunfight, and cheesy stunts."

","First and fore most don't see this movie. As you are reading this I suspect you are thinking about it. Think again! I'm a big fan of movies in general and I rarely don't enjoy action flicks. They keep me entertained. This, sadly didn't.<br/><br/>The story is stupid at best. The acting, especially from Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is terrible in parts. And i'm a fan of his, after seeing him in Match Point. He made that movie.<br/><br/>The action gets so boring, that my companion fell asleep. The so called twists are transparent. The so called ""cool"" moments are laughable.<br/><br/>In short the makers of this should be shot!

","Actually, I was pleasantly surprised, a much bigger and better improvement over the awful Mission Impossible 2, but, about the same league as the first film. This has a much better story, better action sequences, and this time, the IMF team is actually a team. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt, who has recently retired from active field agent IMF service is working as a ""construction worker"" and is now recently engaged to Julia, his fiancée and doctor. <br/><br/>Hunt is pulled back into agent duty when one of the agents he trained, (A very kick butt Keri Russell) is captured by international arms dealer, Owen Davian, easily the best spy bad guy of any film in the last decade. <br/><br/>The plot involves Hunt being sucked back into active service to retrieve a deadly agent called ""The Rabbit's Foot"" for Davian, and man, this film makes the action sequences in Mission 2 look like child's play. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film this time around, sure, some of the parts of the story are lame at times, but the action delivers the goods. Once the IMF team hits the Vatican, it picks up steam.<br/><br/>The first half hour is kind of slow, but once the second hour rolls around, it's action galore. <br/><br/>Hunt's IMF teammate Luther is back, along with two new agents on his team, the beautiful Chinese agent, Zhen, (played by the beautiful Maggie Q) and Declan played by Match Point's Jonathan Rhys Myers, who is relegated to driver duty. <br/><br/>Some of the action sequences, including a jump from a Shanghai skyscraper, and an ending bridge sequence are completely unbelievable. Only the director of Alias, JJ Abrams could have pulled off action sequences this amazing without looking completely silly.<br/><br/>This is definitely a massive improvement over the second Mission film, and I would rank it beside The Bourne Identity as two of the best spy thrillers in recent years. <br/><br/>As the saying goes, check your brain at the door and have a great time with this film! <br/><br/>It's a perfect blending of True Lies, Bourne Identity, and the first Mission: Impossible film.<br/><br/>The Mission franchise is thankfully back on track!"

","I saw this at a sneak preview last night, and the only thing holding me back from giving this a higher score is (no surprise here) Tom Cruise. I know he's an actor, but for crying out loud, this is a summer action movie, not Shakespeare in the park. His performance goes from intense to intense and then back to intense again. Beyond that, Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great villain and the decision to put J.J. Abrams in charge was nothing short of inspired. The characters and their motivations were much more believable, the action sequences were exciting, and I even enjoyed the supporting characters - especially Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Definitely a great start to the summer movie season."

Ethan accepts the assignment, rescues Lindsey with his team but she is killed by a bomb inserted in her head. Ethan finds that Owen will be in the Vatican and he joins his group to abduct him.

There are lots of explosions, good actors and actresses, and the ego of Tom Cruise is probably satisfied with his performance in this forgettable film.

","Many people are calling this move mediocre or plot less, personally I disagree. The previous 2 MI movies have had thin plot lines to say the least, but the performances of the actors and the action set pieces more than made up for it. <br/><br/>I'm happy to say that the third in the series doesn't just do the same, it goes at least 2 steps higher. The action hits you from the beginning and Cruise again proves that he can not only be the action man but he can act the ass of any of the other cast. I'm not saying that the other actors ween't good, far from it. It's just clear that this is Cruise's movie from the beginning. British actor Simon Pegg has a scene stealing role as the Q of IMF. <br/><br/>The action was superbly directed by JJ Abrahms (Alias) and some of the cast from the TV show even appeared for a while in a party scene, that made my day.<br/><br/>Overall, MI3 is by far the best in the series, and i believe that the franchise will continue to go from strength to strength especially if they keep the styles as varied as they have done up to now. A brilliant move from beginning to end."
"MovieManMenzel","6","3","6","7 May 2006"," ""Mission: Impossible III"" is a brainless and typical big budget summer action flick with a great performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
","I'll be honest right from the beginning. I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise or the ""Mission Impossible"" movies. The first movie was decent but nothing that needed a sequel. The second one was all special effects and action and had no substance. So, I didn't really have any interest in seeing the third installment other than to see how Philip Seymour Hoffman does at playing a bad guy. Now with that being said I will start my review of the third and hopefully final installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.<br/><br/>Super spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in the third installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. This time around, Ethan has retired from the IMF because he wants to get married to Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and settle down and have a family. In order to keep a job, he takes on the role of training new agents and preparing them to go into the field. However, Ethan is called back into action when Lindsey (Keri Russell) is kidnapped. But it seems the kidnapping is just the icing on the cake as Ethan soon discovers that Owen Davian, (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an international weapons dealer is looking for a weapon known as the ""rabbit's foot"" and will stop at nothing to get it. An unrealistic but some what entertaining movie ensues <br/><br/>I can't really say that I liked ""Mission: Impossible III"" overall but I can't say that I disliked it either. This movie is really a mixed bag. ""Mission: Impossible III"" is very entertaining and action packed but at the same time there is little if any substance to it and is extremely over the top and far-fetched. I mean seriously how many times can Ethan not get hurt or killed? He is riding in a car and then the road explodes and the car flips over and a ton of people are dead but not Ethan, he doesn't have a scratch on him. It's hard sitting through this movie after a while because it's just so far-fetched and Ethan never seems to be hurt by anything from falling off a 200 story building to having his car blow up, nothing hurts this guy. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Also a lot of this movie was extremely cheesy. Some of the lines that Cruise spit out were awful. The whole Humpty Dumpty line was horrendous. Also the film was so unintentionally funny because of poor directing, editing and writing. The whole ending was unintentionally funny because it was so incredibly lame and the director had no idea how to shoot a person giving CPR.<br/><br/>On the plus side, ""Mission: Impossible III"" does have Philip Seymour Hoffman who is the best damn thing about the movie. He plays the bad guy role perfectly and I have to admit I enjoyed the scene where Hoffman was kicking the crap out of Tom Cruise. I think Hoffman's talent showed in this film even though he didn't have much to work with. He just played the bad guy role perfectly because he seemed so heartless and evil. I think he did a great job although I hope he sticks to movies like ""Capote"" but I understand that's not where the money is so why not do a cheesy blockbuster like ""Mission: Impossible III"" every once in a while to earn some big money. I just hope he does more independent work than mainstream because I see the man earning a few more Oscars in his life as long as he continues to make solid movies.<br/><br/>I also have to admit I was pretty entertained by the film for the most part. Like I said yes it was unbelievable but then again I wasn't expecting a realistic film when I walked into the theater. I think if the movie just tried a little harder to have some substance to it, it would have been better. While action scenes are cool and entertaining, too many of them can become boring. And towards the end I felt bored by the unstop action. I just wanted some story to go along with it, but I guess that was asking too much.<br/><br/>So in the end, ""Mission: Impossible III"" is probably the best one of the three however that's not saying that another sequel is necessary. I really think this franchise needs to call it quits because there are no more stories to be told. This one ends in the typical Hollywood manner but it should end where they left it. However, if this movie does do well, although at this point, I doubt it will make its 185 Million Dollar budget, I can sadly see how they can make another one but I hope that doesn't happen. ""Mission: Impossible III"" is your typical summer popcorn flick so don't go in expecting something great and you should be somewhat satisfied.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Mission: Impossible III"" is a 6/10. I feel Philip Seymour Hoffman performance and seeing him kick the crap out of Tom Cruise is worth the admission price at least at a matinée."

","I love LOVE mission impossible BUT!!! This movie I am SO sad to say is only worth seeing for the theme tune and the parts where they say ""This tape will self-destruct in 5 seconds"" and ""your mission should you choose to accept it"" Really, there's loads of pointless dialogue and stupid crappy gunfights, why couldn't they just make it good like the 1st one. Sure I love guns stunts and bombs but the only really good scene in this film was the Vatican cos it was actually suspenseful and clever unlike the rest of the film, I feel so let down by JJ Abrams whom I believe to be not as good as people say. I also think this film has a formula, it goes: Pointless Talk, Guns, Bombs, Pointless Talk, Guns Bombs....thats it; there are some decent parts but there's really nothing that makes this film special. Go and see it because I believe you all should have a say, but in my opinion its average at best....maybe even avoidable."

"chippermoon","8","3","6","4 May 2006"," action over story.
","contains Spoilers Mission Impossible 3 I think that MI 3 takes the action movie to a higher level. One notable scene, takes place on a bridge. It incorporates every piece of action movie making presented to cinema audiences over the past five years. It is visually stunning. The special effects are (as usual) amazing. The superb photography plus some deft editing gave the scene an unnerving sense of realism.<br/><br/>This is very much how the rest of the movie develops. One sizzling action sequence follows, hot on the heels of the next.<br/><br/>The acting is good, especially from Lawrence Fishburne who gives a commanding performance. Tom, as usual is gives us his all. Going through his whole repertoire of big movie acting. And he is good.<br/><br/>Where the movie does not quite deliver is in the story line. It seems disjointed. Anyone not having seen the last MI movie, need not worry. They would not have too much problem following this story line, in this movie. I had the impression the story had been written in separate parts, to be spliced around the action scenes.<br/><br/>The music is impressive. The sound, (imo) was too loud. I like action movies to be loud, very loud. Yet, I found the sound very over the top but that may have been due to my cinema. So that should not be taken as a major criticism of the film itself. As it could add rather than detract from your own personal enjoyment.<br/><br/>There are parts of the movie, where you have to suspend belief. The ending itself, the final moments of the film, seemed a bit syrupy. I could imagine one or two of the actors shuffling their feet in embarrassment. Not even Tom's flashed-on-when-demanded, dazzling smile could mask the obvious 'lead-in' for MI part 4.<br/><br/>To sum up. It never pretends to be anything other than an action thriller. In this it achieves brilliantly. Due more to the synchronisation of the Producer, the special effects, editing, and cut and thrust photography. It is, fast, well-acted, well photographed, with brilliantly worked special effects. Oh, and blisteringly loud. But did I mention that already!! If you like action, you got it."
"underworldjam","8","3","6","4 May 2006"," Redeemed The Brand
","I was a little hesitant about seeing this film as I didn't really like the 1st and the 2nd was awful. I love the original TV series so realise how much potential there is with the right script. I'm not much of a fan of Tom Cruise, but JJ Abrahms direction was a draw. I got talked into seeing it and wasn't disappointed at all. The action was exciting and original from start to finish, with a few good stunts thrown in along the way. The plot had a little more depth than your average action movie but wasn't too difficult to follow as it so easily could have been. I would recommend it to any fan of the action genre, or anyone who just fancies a couple of hours of fun."
"ungy357","8","3","6","4 May 2006"," Mission Accomplished.
","Congratulations to Cruise and Abrams on a mission accomplished. ""M:I-III"" is a taught, suspenseful, action packed thrill ride that packs more excitement than the first two films put together. There are so truly amazing sequences, from the opening mission to the dazzling assault on an overpass by helicopters and jets as Hunt's team attempts to transport Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), easily the nastiest, and also the most low key, super-villain we have seen in the series to date.<br/><br/>If there is one major weakness to the film, is that the plot is extremely thin - as usual, the filmmakers provide us with a ""MacGuffin,"" a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock to indicate an item that the heroes must search after in order to move the story forward (such as the NOC List, which matches agents code names to true names, or Chimaera and Belarafon, the monster virus and it's cure). This around, our MacGuffin is the Rabbit's foot, a mysterious, unidentified object that is the thinnest plot device we've had to swallow yet - Abrams seems so aware that it's merely excuse to provide action that he really doesn't care what the object is (bringing to mind the mysterious suitcase in ""Pulp Fiction."").<br/><br/>But on the bright side, the characters are richer and more fully realized than ever before. Ethan Hunt has left IMF field work behind, and is preparing to marry the girl of his dreams, the beautiful young Julia (Michelle Monaghan.). Ethan's love at first sight relationship with Nyah Nordoff Hall, the character played by Thandie Newton in the previous sequel, is conveniently ignored, but if there's one thing that Cruise has taught us, besides the fact that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance, it's that if you can land a hot young girl, it's best to pretend that your past romances never even happened. The film's first act recalls ""Alias"" so strongly that Abrams even throws in a cameo by Greg Grunberg. In addition to a more fully realized Ethan, we are treated to a true, honest to goodness IMF team, and they are given much more screen time in this film, as opposed to being relegated to the background sidekicks we have seen in the past two movies. This adds immeasurably to the film, and gives it a much less ""American Bond"" feel, and the witty script gives them all their share of humorous dialogue. This was a caveat Abrams insisted upon before he chose to accept this mission, and it pays off gloriously. Abrams also seems to feel the need to flesh out (no pun intended) something on a explanation of where Hunt's amazing disguises come from, and just how they are made.<br/><br/>But despite sharing more of the limelight, Cruise is still in top form as an action hero - he just keeps getting better with age. And the chemistry between Cruise and Billy Crudup, as an IMF colleague, is great. Laurence Fishburne adds to the proceedings as the requisite Agency Chief who suffers from a chronic case of rectal cranial inversion.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is an extremely solid and satisfying piece of summer entertainment, and well worth the price of an admission ticket, even if doesn't exactly break the mold. There are enough eye-popping stunts and action sequences for at least five summer blockbusters. Some may complain that Abram's constantly roving camera is distracting, but overall, a major directing talent seems to have been discovered here, and we eagerly await his next project. If the reports of Abrams helming the next ""Star Trek"" movie are true, it could be just the dilithium crystal needed to once again add power to the engine. And if it's this much fun, we'd welcome a ""Mission: Impossible IV""."

","I am neither a fan of Cruise nor a fan of the MI series.I found the first MI movie to be O.K and the second awful but this new one blows both away.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a bang(literally) and never lets go.The structure of this film has nothing to do with part 2.Here we have a team working together again not the super hero Cruise of part 2(now that i think again,part 2 shouldn't even be called ""mission impossible"" it had nothing to do with the franchise other than the main character's name).There are many surprises in the plot,the action sequences are great(and i mean really great) and Cruise gets really dirty on this one while his teammates are really likable and Lorence Fishbern has a small but vital to the plot part.<br/><br/>So far so good,but there's one thing that really blew me away in this film:the coolest,meanest villain i have ever watched in a movie:Yep,Philip Seymour Hoffman is that good!!I have always admired this actor but here in a popcorn/summer flick he really makes a difference and thank God his character is really well written.We don't have a crazy villain that overacts(ala Jack Nicholson -type of villain),we have a real cruel person that can also be very confident and very brave at the same time.The scene at the plane where Nathan is torturing Davian(Hoffman's character) would ,at a regular film,occur vice versa.It would be the bad guy that would this thing(i won't mention what it is) and the good guy that would show braveness,resistance.<br/><br/>I won't say much more as to not ruin the plot but all i can say is this is the best action film i have seen in years and i hope that Hoffman will start playing in more big summer movies."
"spaceodds","9","3","6","4 May 2006"," A mission you should accept
","After the disastrous M:I-2 (a film that, along with Die Another Day, nearly ended the spy genre) scepticism was clouding my judgement since what was the point about doing another M:I movie. After hearing reports about the delay in production and the change in director, I started to think that Cruise maybe actually doing something special and after seeing the final product I can safely say that I got more than I expected.<br/><br/>M:I-3 has really hit the nail when it comes to summer blockbuster since they took the already used formula and gave it a new and more fast paced look. Although the film took certain elements from films such as True Lies and certain James Bond video game, I cannot exactly cry plagiarism. Although the film has many fantastical gadgets and over the top scenes, J.J Abrams has fleshed out a good solid blockbuster that will wow audiences of any age and he even adds a character development to the film something that John Woo apparently forgot.<br/><br/>Overall this is pure entertainment that will grab the attention of anyone. Although this movie will not exactly set the spy genre on fire, unlike the Bourne franchise, it will certainly leave appetite for more movies. M:I-4 let it roll"
"tccandler","8","3","6","4 May 2006"," Mission: Achieved
","Mission: Achieved There is a trend in recent movies to open with a scene that occurs later in the film. Alternatively, there may be a voice-over explaining something that occurs near the end of the story. Many films have opened with this device over the years, but it seems to be an epidemic lately. Only a handful of films have ever really used the open-book foreshadowing to maximum effect. Were it not for the example in Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) latest impossible mission, I may have been tempted to give this film an even better grade.<br/><br/>As it stands, ""Mission: Impossible III"" is still a really top-notch action blockbuster that comes closer to the superb 1996 classic than it does to the woeful 2000 dud sequel, directed by the pitiful John Woo.<br/><br/>I wish this film hadn't opened with Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) counting to ten in front of a bound and gagged Ethan Hunt, imploring him to divulge the whereabouts of the 'Rabbit's Foot' or else condemn his girlfriend to a bullet in the brain. I would have much preferred to have that scene take me by surprise later in the film. It would have had more impact.<br/><br/>However, on to the good stuff...<br/><br/>After settling down with a nice girl, Ethan Hunt has retired into training mode rather than being a field-operative. His girlfriend, his friends, her family... They all think Ethan is a nice young man working for the highway traffic research department.<br/><br/>Of course, seeing as there wouldn't be a movie without it, there is a scene where he is talked into returning for one last crucial mission -- saving a captured operative that Ethan once trained, named Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell).<br/><br/>In a spectacularly gritty action sequence, Ethan rescues Lindsey from a heavily guarded warehouse and then takes her on a helicopter ride from hell amidst a field full of gigantic energy windmills.<br/><br/>There are about half-a-dozen insanely impossible missions scattered throughout the two-hour running length. One involves negotiating the catacombs of the Vatican. One involves an utterly decimated bridge. One has Ethan restrained like Hannibal Lecter. One has him swinging between skyscrapers in Shanghai. And one has him journey to the afterlife.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams, of TV's ""Lost"" fame, directs this mega-flick with a modicum of coherence, something coincidentally 'lost' on most action directors these days. At no time during this film did I feel 'lost' during hectic sequences. He is sure-handed enough to tell this story without resorting to incomprehensible mess to cover up the parts that audiences wouldn't normally buy.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays his signature role with the self-assurance of a seasoned pro. He is in desperate need of some good press... and I think he deserves some for this thankless film. It is not the type of film that critics like to applaud too loudly... after all, this is pure entertainment. But he is brilliant here as the American version of James Bond.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames also returns as Luther, the suave and oh so confident techno-geek. Ethan's new team members include Zhen, played with elegance and sexy confidence by Maggie Q, and a rather subdued character named Declan played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (recently seen in ""Match Point"").<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan plays Julia, Ethan's main squeeze. She is that 'perfect girlfriend' type... A beautiful nurse who trusts Ethan and all his mysterious secrecy. She is assuredly a new movie star and will soon be offered dozens of 'girlfriendy' roles.<br/><br/>One real surprise was a brief but quite astonishing performance from Keri Russell, who seemed to virtually disappear after ending her title role in the critically acclaimed TV drama ""Felicity"". She plays so much against her delicate image here that it blew my mind. Perhaps that is the reason she took the role.<br/><br/>As for Oscar winning Philip Seymour Hoffman... I am not sure that he gets enough screen time as the villainous Owen Davian, but when he does, he is dastardly vicious and cold-hearted. He was an inspired choice for this role.<br/><br/>Overall, the film delivers all that is promised. I wish they hadn't tried to get clever with that opening scene choice, but the rest of the film redeemed itself. The stunts were inventive and exciting. The characters were more human than they were in either of the two previous efforts. The story had more emotion than most entries in the genre. ""Mission: Impossible III"", should you choose to accept it, is going to end up as one of the best action films of 2006.

","From the prologue of Mission: Impossible III you can tell, this movie will be different from the others. It will be darker, and packed with thrills.<br/><br/>The story is great, the thrills are great, the actors are... you know where I'm heading. Except for the ending, which was a bit too sweet for my opinion (they could've better used a M:I ending: after the last thrill, cut to Hunt back at home, and use the same shot as in the beginning: picking up the phone, hearing a code which makes it clear for the viewers that he'll get another mission), I've got nothing bad to say about this film. On every point that M:I II failed to be a M:I sequel, this movie passed with flying colours. Nothing too romantic, no over-use of the masks, no corny fights or dialogue, more (impressive) impossible missions, a villain that actually makes an impression on you, and a couple of nice plot-twists.<br/><br/>In short, M:I III was better than I could hope for, and if III will be the standard, I can only hope that M:I IV will follow soon."

","Just saw the sneak preview for MI III, and found it the best of the three. J.J. Abrams (Alias, Lost) brings the action to a more true (if somewhat loud) level without the unrealistic special kung-fu effects of MI 2. You kind of see some ""Alias"" in this movie especially in the computer geek at the HQ.(Marshall) Nice, twisty plot, almost non-stop action, and even a little human emotion is in this show. I was disappointed in the crowd that it didn't sell out for such a blockbuster, but the movie did get a standing ovation usually reserved for movies such as the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. With the success that this movie should see at the box office, maybe J.J. Abrams can do MI 4...."
"fallingangelin","3","6","16","9 May 2006"," it must have become impossible to make up something new
","This film turned out to be a disappointment for many fans of Tom Cruise and ""mission impossible"". There are several problems,which the directors probably had. First of all, there is not a single scene in this movie when Tom Cruise appears with a lively face. No, he always makes an impression of a very sick or tired person, who can never relax. When it comes to expressing his love, he finds no other way except making an annoyed face and saying usual phrases like ""you must trust me... it is very important for me"" and the like. When it comes to protecting his family(what seems to be his aim during the whole movie), he reveals nothing but anger and hatred. So after watching the film you don't get an impression, that this person was really interested in what was going on. Secondly, without necessary amount of love scenes it becomes dull, because the balance of love and action scenes is upset. Itan fights well, but it is not just the only thing he does well, it is actually the only the only thing he does in this movie. Thirdly, the plot seems to be unmotivated (the reasons for such statement are all in the previous passage) and too complicated - because you can't make out why Itan makes all these missions possible. It is also too similar to the viewer, who had seen a lot films with such plot. Probably, when the directors couldn't make up anything new for their hero, they used a trick from ""Ocean's twelve"", where Ocean tries to get retired."

","This movie sucked. It was even boring except for a few minutes. It is better than MI-1 however, in which Mr. Phelps is killed off and is revealed as a villain. Come on! Mr. Phelps a villain? That still leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I sit down to this boring movie. Acting is good. Hoffman a genius. Cruise is winsome. Plot doesn't hang together. Camera work is the worst I can remember for a big budget movie. Love story between Cruise and his wife dragged it down. Only descent parts were from the Vatican in Rome. Bad bad movie. Dumbest part was the twist in which the director turns out NOT to be a turncoat. Movie attempts to be funny when team discussses Cruise's (Hunt's) marrying his girlfriend during the time they are setting up their un-clever stunts. All this really does is highlight how unbelievable the movie is. I felt sorry for the Chinese people Cruise murders in the building in which he steals the McGuffin (sp?), that is the rabbits foot, that is the unidentified bio-weapon he is stealing. This movie will not go over well with Chinese people."

","I was reluctant to see this movie because of Cruise's antics. But I happened to be free for the opening matinée. I was struck first off that Cruise's name appears, then the movie title, and then the names of others involved with the movie. I was also struck by Cruise's limited dramatic range and his goofy running scenes. (I had to check myself from laughing out loud). Despite all this, there are many seamless and engaging action sequences. Moreover, the movie is well-paced and keeps your attention for almost all of it and the two hours flow by quickly. However, I have no desire to see it again and I certainly won't be purchasing it. For Cruise fans, MI3 delivers but for those who want to see something original, save your money."
"mmr07","5","4","10","3 May 2006"," Great Cast, Good Action, Poor Script/Story
","Went to the pre-screening yesterday. Everyone was on the edge of his seat even before the movie begins. To me, a mission impossible movie should be all about how the IMF team plan and execute an unthinkable heist. The team in this movie was GREAT, JJ Abrams pulled some of his TV star friends in different roles, Keri Russell was a good choice for the role she played. The old returning Ving Rhames is the team coordinator is great as always, two people uniquely shines are Jonathan Rhys Myers and Maggie Q, they had the funny jokes and pulled off their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman was great but seemed to be having fun doing that part, I think his dialogue could have been more powerful, his character is unfortunately forgettable because of the poor writing.<br/><br/>The action sequences were great, the first one in the Windmill field was some what chaotic, but the one in the freeway and bridge was far better. The Vatican scene may be the best part of the movie because it is the only scene relatable to the original series.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk about Tom cruise because I think he had more than his share of publicity lately, his character is still the same but now with a love interest.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a nice fun movie to watch, but very very forgettable because there was no exciting thing about the story nor the missions. I still consider the first MI movie to be the best because of the classic moments that De Palma created, like the ""String"" hanger scene of Tom in the white room and the Copter scene in the tunnel. This is where you can detect age difference between the experienced Brian De Palma and the very talented but still amateur JJ. De Palma understands that what lasts in the mind of the viewer is not the big explosions or the plane crashes, it is the thrilling chill of a joyride that keeps you hanging (like Tom) throughout the movie."

","I was lucky enough to attend the premiere in London the other night, and after seeing MI:2 was not really hoping for anything other than your average, formulaic, big budget, Tom Cruise Show TM... On walking out I had become a convert. <br/><br/>The film literally blew me away, and I believe that it has everything to do with Mr Cruise's decision to take on J.J Abrams as director and give him free reign on this movie. This really was a masterstroke, as he has taken MI back to its original TV roots (everything from the soundtrack to the opening credits). No more over complex story lines, just a mission and an objective, all conceived with brilliant direction and jaw dropping set pieces. J.J Abrams may have done for this franchise what Martin Campbell (director) did for Goldeneye, and I would be very surprised if there was not an MI:4 in the pipeline after this.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie fans of 'Lost' and 'Alias' will immediately recognise the directors little touches, and I really do think this guy is an autuer in the making. But is what is most fantastic about this film is the fact that it doesn't try to be too clever, or be something its not. It is what it is. <br/><br/>Forgetting about whatever you may read and think of Tom Cruise, his questionable beliefs and/or his private life, do not let that put you off seeing this movie. Although most of it is The Tom Cruise Show TM (just like MI) it is one of the best episodes."

","When the first Mission Impossible movie came out, I went to see it, knowing that it could not possible be as good as the television show. I was right! I did not even bother going to see MI2. But I had some time on my hands this weekend, so I thought I'd go to see MI3. It was not even as good as the first; and that's pretty bad! About the only thing MI:3 has in common with the television show is the title and some of the music. And the music is recycled.<br/><br/>The story is nowhere as good as the plots in the television show. And, although Tom Cruise is not a bad actor, he is no Steven Hill or Peter Graves. If either of them have bothered watching the movie, they probably laughed.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 5 (which may be generous) because it may be a fair movie, if you are not expecting anything near the original show. But if you were a fan of the show, just be happy with some of the episodes you may find on VHS or DVD. Don't bother spending good money to watch a fair rip-off."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","26 February 2008"," The Best So Far
","Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt and this time he's battling a sadistic arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman). This is without question the best in the series and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the previous two films. I thought the first film was way too confusing for its own good while the second one was way too much action and not enough brains. This third film hits on all the right notes and delivers some terrific action scenes mixed with a pretty smart script that doesn't go over the top on brains. The real key to the film is the terrific performance by Hoffman. He's been known for years as a great character actor but when I heard he was playing the villain I honestly didn't think he could pull it off but he comes off quite menacing in the role. He doesn't have any funny lines, which is a great thing because it makes him all the more threatening. Then there's Cruise who delivers another all-star performance. I think, in real life, Cruise is a jackass but he still manages to be the greatest movie star out there. The supporting cast including Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne all do fine work as well. The action scenes are also some of the best I've seen including the wonderful attack on the bridge."
"parhat","5","3","7","8 May 2006"," A More Twisted and Conspiratorial Ending would be better
","This is clearly the best of all Mission Impossible series. Part I was sleepy, conspiracy plans are somewhat too deep, although understandable. Part II was cheesy. Part III is a bit of Saw I but especially Saw II(which is twisted) and makes Hoffman looks good. I mean all movies, villains just look good if they are just twisted enough. I guess this is the key fabric of the movie which gives it it high marks on IMDb with 7/10. The score will go lower later on, no doubt a 6/10, but I am giving this only 5/10 score.<br/><br/>Most of the MI: III weaknesses is Tom Cruise's lack of depth and cardboard personality. I cannot but help that Ben Affleck and Tom Cruise acting are just about cardboard as they can get. I have always associated Tom Cruise to that of a used car salesman, or some door to sleezy men's cologne, or perhaps some other jobs that required extreme superficiality. If it wasn't for his portrayal in Rainman, he would just be as obscure as Ben Affleck. All his movies have that trademark. The other actors, besides Hoffman are just the same, with the exception of Fishburne, who is always good in any movie (Star Wars, Matrix) The movie's strengths is that it keeps your attention throughout the 120 minutes something movie. The weaknesses is that it is too techie relying on too many gadgets and other toys to get the job done, unlike Bourne series which requires wit, skill and intelligence. Intelligence is what is lacking in this movie. Only a popcorn and hotdog audiences who listens to iPod while watching MI:III can truly enjoy. It is one of those movie my pet dog and chimpanzee can understand.<br/><br/>Apparently the movie tries to copy the shaking cameras from Bourne Supremacy. This techniques leaves me nauseated. The other technique that irritates me a lot is the extreme close up. I can't help but admire sweat glands, dandruff or skin blemishes which is not what I wanted to watch. In fact believe or not, I had a premonition nightmare of this scene where Tom Cruise is chained, with extreme close ups of sweat glands, eyebrow hairs and sweat.<br/><br/>The movie could have been improved with a somewhat more twisted ending if Fishburne (this is NOT THE REAL ENDING AND NOT A SPOILER) just say to Tom Cruise, ""Oh about the rabbit's foot we sold it Middle Eastern buyers! Our President of the United States is happy. Your direct supervisor real plan was to dispose of it!"" A twisted conspiratorial ending would have been better (to prepare for MI:IV), given the fact that the present George Bush's present popularity (2006) and corruption are as low as you can get! With that kind of a twisted ending, it is a question of patriotism or humanity. These are the most important thing if you work for a spy agency, follow orders or follow your heart. Who is your real superiors, is it the crooked President, or your direct superiors who follows a crooked orders? Or yourself who follows crooked orders and risking your life for something that means nothing to mankind? It is something like overthrowing Saddam Hussien for his oil.<br/><br/>It would be much more interesting if the movie plots reflect the current public climate about how the public view CIA, FBI or any other covert operations rather than trying to glorify them all the time. This is the point I want future MI series be shown and I would most enjoy the movie if only it was written in that style."

","The first was very complex. We moaned about it.<br/><br/>The second was very simple. We moaned about it.<br/><br/>I guess they wanted a mid-level of complexity to this film, it works in a very basic way but nothing other than some fantastic set-pieces really becomes of it. In fact, the only thing that stops this from being a typical action movie is the soppy romance laced through it and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the baddie.<br/><br/>This particular baddie sells things to people who should own them wants to steal a Maguffin (a completely unimaginative plot mechanism) to sell to the Arabs. Cruise and Co try to stop him but he slips out of their hands and promises to make Cruise cry unless he does his bidding. You don't have to do much to make that happen. Just point a water pistol at him.<br/><br/>The Maguffin is none other than the Rabbit's Foot? What's the Rabbit's Foot you ask? Who cares? Like I said already, it's just an excuse for action to happen. We've seen plots like this before in Pulp Fiction and Ronin, but done to much better and much more intriguing effect.<br/><br/>The action scenes are superb! The chopper chase, bridge attack, skyscraper swing and Vatican Heist are bursting at the seems with excitement and are all shot and cut brilliantly. They add a huge sense of death-defying spectacle to a film that's low on ideas but high on espionage thrills.<br/><br/>There are some weak links though. I HATED Simon Pegg's cameo and his apparent ad-libbing was the unfunniest thing I have ever heard in my life. The romance talk does reek of that corny 'You complete me' scene in Jerry Maguire and Ving Rhame's character STILL gets no development whatsoever, spending practically the whole movie sitting at a laptop, again!<br/><br/>As a popcorn movie it works very well, but I had higher expectations so I was kinda let-down. But it never fails to entertain."
"R_Grey","4","3","7","6 May 2006"," the ultimate product
","MI 3 is good at what it does, namely, selling tickets. We see flashy trailers, Tom Cruise, helpless pretty women, dramatic music, and it looks interesting, for a 30-second trailer. Now imagine that same trailer 126 minutes long and you'll get the essence of MI 3.<br/><br/>Every art medium needs a sound economic foundation to have the flexibility to explore and further itself, but when economic exploitation overbears every artistic limitation, it can no longer be called anything else but a product. And as such, it serves nothing but the selfish few who have conceived it for pure profit.<br/><br/>I've read that Tom Cruise had a trailer even before the production began, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was true. MI 3 follows advertising principles first, artistic merit second, if any such thing can be found. No matter what anyone says, generally speaking, Hollywood films like you to respond to them, they are not passive experiences. Unlike films with substance which push you to respond to that substance in your own way, Hollywood likes to observe these responses, and then, bunching them in chunks, to re-compile them in a way which will attract the largest possible audience. Choose your multiple choice response to a prerecorded question, its not difficult  in fact, it's designed for everyone to get it right in the first try. Go ahead children, get it right, so we can move on to the next question. Go, ahead. Oh wait, let's circle around that one again, someone might have missed it. And so on the film continues.<br/><br/>MI 3 is so mathematical in its calculation of human responses that one wonders if the producers have hired Ph D psychologists and mathematicians to calculate how many laughs or tears they will get at each turn of the story. Just need to balance them out right.<br/><br/>Whereas first MI had the same ""whodunit"" plot, it was intertwined deep within the narrative; MI 3 throws this straight into your face in the opening sequence, which isn't always a terribly bad thing. Such an open construction can work say in character studies like Citizen Kane or Carlito's Way because the narrative there is not as important as the exploration of the character. In the MI series, however, plot is the most entertaining piece of the film and revealing it prematurely (without a substantial payoff) is a mistake that will defeat the film on credentials of its own genre alone.<br/><br/>In the end, MI 3's only purpose is like that of a collection agency, only in theater you give up your money voluntarily. You are not a person to the producers (certainly not to the studio), you are a mass, without individual goals or interests, you are a target audience  so, go ahead, pay that 8-dollar ticket like some of the reviews will tell you, buy that pop corn, cut Tom Cruise another 70-million-dollar paycheck.<br/><br/>Think about the movies you vote for with your dollars. Ask for substance. Proclaim your needs as an individual. Stop being a statistic."

Vengefully Hunt's group decides to bring down the man responsible Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) regardless of being aware of a mole within the agency...<br/><br/>Contrived and forced this plan is obnoxiously bad and features some needless melodrama to 'build' Hunt's character. Obviously the worst of the MI movies, especially given the bounce back to quality in the fourth instalment, ""MI:3"" serves only as a explanatory filler to certain themes touched upon in the follow-up. Almost self-farcical with little zest, punch or laughs, it collapses quicker then the story. Attempts to flesh out a background life with wife and dog end up counter-productive and are probably the least believable scenes in the movie. Despite several pretty well done scenes (if outlandish) delivery of the whole package is extremely hollow, superficial and not meant for a thinking audience. Something that even skyscraper jumping won't be able to compensate...<br/><br/>Surprisingly poor from J. J.

Musgrave has already prepared a team for him, consisting of Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), and his old partner Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), ready to meet him in Berlin. It soon becomes evident that Davian is well-protected, well-connected, and downright malicious as his wife got kidnapped in the process. This forces Hunt to extend his journey back into the field in order to rescue his wife, Julia, and uncover IMF double agents in the process. <br/><br/>I personally felt that the third Mission Impossible has fallen short as compared to the first two.I have to take into consideration for one that this happens to be J.J.

","One might worry that J.J. couldn't do a full film. Sure, he can make a TV episode exciting, but what about a movie of two hours? Ironically, it's the other way around. He's used to contending with the remote and the rest of the networks, so he doesn't dial down the intensity any, and while the frenetic pace is spot-on for 42 minutes(plus commercial breaks), it gets to be excessive and overstimulating when it's almost three times as much. It's too fast, and it gets to be a little straining. The other thing caused by this being his debut on the silver screen is that it simply does not feel as grand as it should; it feels like he shot this for TV. The editing and cinematography are expertly done, they simply feel as if it was made on a much smaller budget, and there are so many tight, close angles. Frankly, at times we can barely tell what exactly is going on, because of the speed and the (often hand-held)camera flat-out refusing to give us a broad enough image to let us know where things are in relation to one another. I mean, this has a lot of production value... why not show it? The action is well-done and effective. This has Tom acting more than in the first two, and he does remarkably well. Seymour Hoffman shines, as expected. Most of the rest of the cast aren't given much to do, particularly noticeable in both of the new team-mates who don't have enough personality between them to fill a matchbox. I guess he couldn't get used to this not being in serial form, and thus the characters(in spite of being well-written and credible) tend to be severely underdeveloped. Pegg is hilarious, in the short time he's in this. He is pretty much Marshall, and that's just one of the million ways this is like Alias. For some reason, the director also channelled Felicity(!) here and there. The plot is fairly engaging, if the ending is unsatisfying in a couple of ways. It is arguably excessively similar to the 1996 one, and I think the trilogy unintentionally reveals how few options you have when trying to make the spy thing work for a Summer blockbuster. Dialog and humor are good. The score is marvelous. There is a little sensuality, infrequent mild to moderate language, and a bit of violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD contains a funny and informative commentary track with Abrams and Cruise, a making of featurette that I will review on its page, deleted scenes and a tribute to the star. I recommend this to fans of those who made it. 7/10"

Listening to the ""Director's Commentary"", my fears have been confirmed.<br/><br/>Mr. Abrams is a Hollywood Player of the highest order. He schmoozes with the best, and has the best kiss his bum. Listen to Tom Cruise and JJ perform verbal fellatio with each other on the Director's Commentary, and you get an idea of how little clothing this Emperor is wearing.<br/><br/>This is Mr. Abrams first directorial outing. And I'm not sure that he is really directing......Tom Cruise has as much, if not more, creative control over this ""property"" as JJ does. The Bad Robots have previsualized this film to such a degree that it is virtually (pun intended) made before any of the live action stand-ins for the pixels go before the camera.<br/><br/>Abrams is highly influenced by Japanese Manga. The ""process"" is much easier if the storyboards are framed in such a way that the live action crew just have to recreate what the storyboard artists have already ""previsualized"". Yet, JJ talks about this film as if he is making Citizen Kane! JJ, you've just made a remake of a tawdry '60's TV show, highlighting the clichés that made people tune in week-after-week, and then added an extra layer of Brian dePalma's chops! The character interaction is calculated, the story designed to tie the set pieces together- it's a popcorn movie. Slick to be sure (6.0 for slickness), but as tasty and empty as saccharine (and about as good for you).<br/><br/>Watch the palette of colours through this film. Pure manga, as are the camera moves, and the hyper-expressiveness of the characters. Eating a brownie would have the dramatic import of Hamlet's Solliloquey here.<br/><br/>I actually posted a ""review"" of the new Star Trek film on IMDb a few weeks ago, but IMDb chose not to post it, as that film hasn't been completed, and won't be released until 10 months from now. So, this review will have to serve as a cautionary tale.<br/><br/>Mr. Abrams is a very superficial film-maker. Nothing in MI-III has any real soul. The clichés of the original series are served up as nostalgia gags, with a little high tech thrown in to attract a younger audience. Star Trek seems to be following the same formula.<br/><br/>And the last thing Star Trek needs right now is more ""formula"".<br/><br/>JJ, if you are going to perform sycophantic fellatio on anyone, please find Ron Moore. He won't swing your way, but if he did, I'm sure you would ""absorb"" some integrity and respect for the art behind the appearance. It may not be there with the Mission Impossible franchise, as that always was confection.<br/><br/>But, once upon a time, Star Trek elevated itself into art, transcended its clichés, and delivered something of cultural import to the masses. Ask Robert Wise, and look at what he delivered. You're not Robert Wise; you're not even Joe Johnston! JJ, spend some time with European film-makers. Attend a few plays. Hang out with John Malkovich, or the Coen Brother. Have John Sayles' baby! Movies are about money, to be sure, but they can be art as well. This only happens when the Director has a sort of sclerosis, and can divorce himself entirely from the business-end of things whilst the art is being made.<br/><br/>To work with both side of the brain, you need a whole brain, not the half-brained sort of movie that MI-III is and this thing called ""Star Trek"" is destined to be. I, at least, know that you are prancing around Hollywood without any cinematic clothes.<br/><br/>Dear readers, spread the word!"

The first film was great and it's one of Brian De Palma's best films (along with Blow Out (1981), Scarface (1983), The Untouchables (1987), Casualties Of War (1989) and Carlito's way (1993)).

It's got more suspense, back story, Special FX, stunts & a better villain. It's even got the original opening credits and theme as the first!!!!

","Usually the third movie of a series/trilogy is horrible. Examples: Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Friday the 13th: Part III, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. And so on and so forth. But Mission: Impossible III is the best of the series! Examples of good third movies of any series/trilogies: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>This movie stars one of the best male actors in the world: Tom Cruise (War of the Worlds (2005), Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, The Last Samurai, Eyes Wide Shut, Interview with the Vampire). It also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar winner for Best Actor in a Leading Role: Capote (2005)). Philip starred in these movies (Capote, Twister, Cold Mountain, Red Dragon, Along Came Polly, When A Man Loves A Woman).<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III also stars other well-known actors such as: Ving Rhames (Idlewild, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible II), Michelle Monaghan (Constantine (scenes deleted), North Country, The Bourne Supremacy), and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead (2005)).<br/><br/>How can they keep thinking of ideas for Mission: Impossible movies? They're still so good! The movies are still so good! And the action just keeps getting better and better and more intense! Speaking of the intense action, it really makes your heart thump really fast. The action is almost non-stop. And there are no cheap love scenes that make the movie boring and uninteresting. That's one of the beauties of Mission: Impossible III.<br/><br/>See Mission: Impossible III. You won't be disappointed! <br/><br/>My MPAA rating: PG-13: Intense Sequences of Frenetic Violence and Menace, Disturbing Images, Some Sensuality and Language.<br/><br/>My Canadian rating: 14A: Intense Violence, Frightening Scenes, Mature Theme"
"billdcat4","2","2","4","9 October 2006"," A movie that the average drooling American will love
","First of all I must say that i'd be pressed to find a more unrealistic film. All of the gadgets, the stunts, practically anything shown in the movie is picked for its coolness factor to mindless drooling American males 18-35. The classic James Bond movies were far better at this genre. Second, Tom Cruise is not a good actor in my book, for the first 5 minutes of the movie he wears a ridiculous grin in his 'happy' expression, throughout the rest of the movie he wears either his 'pained' expression or his 'scared' expression and thats it. It might have been cheaper if they cast him out of plaster. Finally, The plot is full of holes and doesn't follow a straight path.<br/><br/>The first MI film was half-decent, the second was horrible, and the third is just above that. The only mildly amusing parts of the movie are when Ethan Hunt's close friends die. Less torture to go through for all of us. And its not that I hate Americans, I am American, its just the4 sad sad truth."
"Sgt.Wolf","5","2","4","4 July 2006"," mi3 = Tom Cruise infomercial
","This whole movie is basically an apology for his past relationships with women. MI3 is a continuation of his infamous interview on Oprah with a larger budget. <br/><br/>The moral of the movie is that Tom Cruise is the best husband in the world, so please just forget about his previous relationships. The movie starts with him being the perfect husband at a cocktail party, and then becomes scene after scene of him being put in distress and ultimately sacrificing himself for his wife and then coming back from the dead because he is so in love with her. This movie reminds me of the action movies of the 80's where the hero kills bad guys with almost supernatural ability. This movie has very little to do with an elite espionage team. The only tactic they have is let Tom take care of everything. The action in this movie is pretty awesome, but just has way too many shots of cruise in agony because he cant stand being away from his wife. Oh well, at least each of these movies is done in a completely different way."

For once I loved all the women as well as the men cast. I often don't care for the leading lady WITH the leading man, but these two worked for me. Michelle grew on me as their relationship grew. At first I didn't quite I couldn't quite believe the romantic relationship, and her sitting in the chair crying didn't convince me much..why was she suddenly wearing so much makeup? When was it applied?? I loved the teamwork, clever twists, great acting,and Tom's usual power and passionate flair. I watched it twice and it was as good the second time! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great time at the movies. I really don't care to hear about anyone's personal views about Tom's personal life. He's still greater than ever."

I do believe that there will be more missions to come after this one, why not, they only keep better and better as time goes on! Cruise is challenged in this movie like no other time within this trilogy! As with most trilogies, you should see the last 2 installments first to get acquainted with the ""Mission Impossible"" team and how proficient they do what they do.

"that_darn_foamy","8","2","4","29 May 2006"," The best of the three
","I loved this movie because you didn't know what to expect. I actually thought the movie was over after Davian shot ""Julia"". I can honestly say this is my favorite movie of the trilogy. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is an amazing actor. I haven't seen him in much, but I can't wait to see some of his stuff. The character Musgrave really annoyed me. I couldn't tell if he was good or bad. I was relieved when he was finally shot, ironically by a girl who has never handled a gun in her life probably. Don't get me wrong, the actor was great, I just hated the character. The way Davian died was the funniest possible way they could have done it, rather than a manatee shooting out of his anus and stabbing him with a toothbrush, I mean come on, the shoe bouncing and landing perfectly...haha, comedy in an action film. Good stuff."
"taifunu","8","2","4","28 May 2006"," better than I expected
","to be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie - especially after MI:2. in the end, I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. and I was surprised, in a good way. Of course, it has all ingredients and features of the typical MI movie. of course there must be a lot of action, adrenaline , suspense, chase scenes..you name it. but this time there was a real plot, also. a main story, and various subplots. mostly the standard clichés, ( the girl/s in distress, the all-times hero, the boss gone evil, the twist - oops, it's not that boss, it's the other one - the jump from the building..you name it) but it came together fine. And Cruise acted unexpectedly good. I mean, he wasn't over-acting. he wasn't yelling half of the time and playing the fearless hero like he did in the previous MI. He was more ..put together. real. credible ( well...sort of) another proof he can really act , if directed properly. ( see ""Magnolia"" or ""Collateral"") . And for this we must thank JJ. I'm not a Cruise fan, but must admit he made a good role in this movie."
"ivanterry101","4","2","4","27 May 2006"," Ridiculous Plot
","Predictable, flawed and boring. Don't know why so many people gave this film rave reviews, but I think they'll look back in years to come and realize that they were making a mistake - much the same as the academy did after giving the Titanic so many Oscars the same year as Memento and LA Confidential were brought to us.<br/><br/>As soon as Cruise gets caught and is helped escaped by the agent that sent him on the original mission it's obvious that he was just let go to steal the weapon (or whatever the hell it was - since we never find out, like I cared!).<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is sent by the above mentioned agent to save an ex-student of his. In the process he is nearly killed (as it transpires - the agent that sends him tipped off the guards) and several goons are killed off.<br/><br/>It turns out he sent him on the mission so that Ethan would kidnap the person responsible, who'd then escape and kidnap Ethans wife as to coerce him to steal the weapon. The agent did this though believing that original girl may know his identity, and then pretends to shoot Ethans wife to find out if she did! As it was only pure luck that both of these impossible missions (the rescue and kidnapping) succeeded I'd say the agent is an idiot and would be a terrible poker player - he'd have a better chance going all in on a two, seven unsuited in Texas Holdem before the flop than Ethan succeeding in those two missions so he could get him to steal the weapon. <br/><br/>There were some good action scenes though, a bit where a car blew up that was shot well and a hot Asian chick as well. No goodies die as usual."
"jooillim","8","2","4","26 May 2006"," MI 3 delivers!
","I saw this film in 70mm, and it rocked my socks off. Though pure, unadulterated action, it gives just enough character study, just enough exposition (all the things that, say, National Treasure utterly failed to do), to let me dive deeper in. Tom is fine, he does all the action stuff, he gets to drive the boat, but the real star here is JJ Abrams. This guy brings panache and real story telling skills to this baby. He takes a risk by starting the movie at the near-end and then jumping back to the start, but nothing is as it seems, and the risk pays off as the story stays ahead of you. <br/><br/>My biggest criticism is that Seymour Hoffman isn't given enough to do. I mean, it's Capote, so I just expected him to be used a little more. <br/><br/>Ignore the lame press. See it on the big screen! It delivers."

","If you did not like the first two movies that does not necessarily mean you should avoid this movie. It avoids being as confusing as Mission: Impossible and is less cliché and cheesy as Mission: Impossible II.<br/><br/>The action sequences are pretty intense and will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job with acting, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great but he needed some more screen time and character development. Tom Cruise was good and hopefully viewers will overlook his crazy behavior and lifestyle in real life and focus more on the fact that he still is a good actor.<br/><br/>The happy ending is a little bit cheesy."

","OK he's crazy but I wanted to see the movie anyway. Loved the other two they were awesome. This movie wasn't horrible because of Tom's crazy alien worship. It was horrible because 1)There was no new action, or what was new was predictable, ie helicopter. 2)NO CHEMISTRY between him and lover. 3) Opening sequence? What opening sequence? 3) the direction was choppy, it was like a long TV episode. 4)Resolution takes all of 3 minutes. OK everythings resolved all at one time. I was very disappointed with this movie. There has been much better in this franchise and with Cruise. There is definitely something ""off"" in this movie, and its a crying shame."

Given the success of the other mission impossible movies you would never expect this one to over come the bar, but surprisingly it dose.

Ethan Hunt has being assigned to retrieve a captured agent, strait after the mission, lies and secrets start to unfold, making Ethan having, to once again, save the world. Also for all you 'Lost' fans, look out for the lost secret somewhere in the movie. I won't give it away, but look carefully. Mission impossible 3 is a thrilling movie that is worth seeing.

Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy! Just like True Lies, MI3 leaves James Bond standing.<br/><br/>The only thing that lets this movie down is the typical happy/clappy ending you get in almost every American made movie. Its as if Americans are scared to be confronted with the darker side of life or is it the Hollywood movie houses? Forget about Tom's private life and what he believes in. It has nothing to do with his movie talent. He's proved once again that he has the golden touch and as long as he entertains, I'll keep going to see his movies."

Seems that Maggie and Jonathan in MI3 have special chemistry but it didn't explain and the whole story too focus to ""Tom Cruise"".<br/><br/>Tom Cruise not cool at all in this movie but I admit that his acting is good.

"AnonymousTJ9806","8","2","4","20 May 2006"," Summer Season Has Started With M:I 3
","You would think a movie with a star would bring so much bad publicity to the project and then let it all crumble behind, which is what i was thinking going in to see Mission: Impossible 3, starring the world's most bizarre actor/Scientologist/possible crazy man Tom Cruise. I would think just like the last two, it would be all Cruise, even with TV icon J.J. Abrahams on board. But I will say I was wrong, that this is the start of what will become the most exciting summer movie season in the past five years. Mission: Impossible 3 is the one to beat so far. The Pros and Cons:<br/><br/>Pros: -The directing. J.J. Abrahams brings such a twisted and myriad plot and such flawless directing that it seems he will become a more Michael Mann than a Micahel Bay. If he wants an explosion, he gets it, at the right place at the right time. <br/><br/>-Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In his first role after the Oscar win, Hoffman proves himself to be worthy of his Oscar win with his shocking portrayal of villain Owen Daivian. He's sinister without playing it too hard. <br/><br/>-The script. Although I did want to see the original M:I 3 script possibility of body harvesting in South Africa, this script is able to make M:I 3 realistic in the sense that it is a summer action flick that makes the characters human. The romantic side story, although sometimes a little overboard, is very important to the story, unlike other romantic plot lines in action flicks. <br/><br/>Cons: -The ending. Way too TV like. It was everyone gets together and has a big party for Mr. Hunt and his new wife. Way off and didn't even signal a 4th sequel as most action flicks. Shame. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a summer action flick that offers something slightly different. It was not a Tom Cruise fest unlike the last two and he was able to share the scenes with Hoffman, Rhames, Fishburne, etc. And did I mention the new Kanye West track in the credits is catchy as hell? <br/><br/>Breakdown: Acting-16/20 <br/><br/>Directing-20/20<br/><br/>Cinematography-17/20<br/><br/>Screenplay-18/20<br/><br/>Musical Score-17/20<br/><br/>Overall: 88-B+"
"Mlambert523","10","2","4","19 May 2006"," Nice Progression...
","I enjoyed this movie more than I thought. I loved all three mission impossible movies but I enjoyed the ""edge"" this one had. It finally gave Ethan a connection to something outside of saving the world. He had an edge which was great. The villain was the best and most daring yet. Amazing movie and it fit really well into the trilogy. The love interest was well played and it brought a sense of suspense into the movie. It added that unsuspected ending and it kept you guessing which was nice. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first two. Even if you didn't see the others this is a great movie standing alone. Enjoy!!!"
"myfriendcatherine","8","2","4","19 May 2006"," I was impressed
","Great action flick, one of the best I've seen. Cruise's acting has really come a long way, he looks better a bit older too. More manly and less like a boy. The acting was great all around, fantastic visuals, my toes tingled on one roof scene. Quality entertainment at it's best. One of those movies you could definitely see a second time in the same week end! My two seven year old twin boys liked it as well. Definitely a movie to see if you like thrills or just need an escape for the evening. I don't know how they will top this one with another Mission Impossible four, but next one I'll see on opening night. Whatever negative comments I'd read or heard about Cruise were all dispelled at Movies end. When you're good, you're good. That movie took a lot of work and was very well made. Classic.

"matlefebvre20","7","2","4","18 May 2006"," IMF: Incredibly Massive Fun
","I can imagine J.J. Abrams being told by producers Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner: ""Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to direct the sequel of Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II and to make it a worthy action picture and a great blockbuster."" That's a tough job and maybe that Cruise and Wagner didn't get the right person to do it.<br/><br/>Abrams has never directed a motion picture before. His notable works were on television, as he directed episodes from ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". So, let's not hide it, the expectations were very high.<br/><br/>So, what's the result? Did Abrams complete his mission? In two single words: OH YES! ""M:I-3"" is by far the best film of the Mission series and it mixes elements from the previous episodes, while adding a touch of things that weren't. I know now why the majority of the film critics loved this movie, because I was astonished too by the extremely well-filmed action scenes and the surprising, but fairly welcomed drama and emotion which weren't really present in the first two movies.<br/><br/>First, the action. Because Mission is firstly an action scenes maker. I have to say that the action in ""M:I-3"" is by far the most elaborate and the most spectacular, and the locations are well-chosen for them. For example, there is the helicopter chase in the beginning inside a field full of windmills. The cameras are shaking and shaking 'till it's over. The viewer really has the impression of being trapped in a thrilling roller coaster ride and the only thing to do is to grab the seat and hold on.<br/><br/>I also liked the attack on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. These are epic scenes, because of the high level of circulation and the number of fighters involved. The images of Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise, who else?) hanging from the hole in the way are captivating.<br/><br/>There's also a surprisingly high level of emotion and drama inside the movie. Hunt and his wife Julia are an appealing couple and the interaction between both of them is real and attracting.<br/><br/>The gadgets in the Mission series are as inseparable as in the James Bond series. There are dozens of computers, guns, vehicles, chips etc. But director Abrams finally reveals how do the agents create their famous masks and the vocal stickers that come along. I was wondered.<br/><br/>I kinda noticed a lot of references to Quentin Tarantino's movies in this picture. First, there is the very first scene which repeats itself later in the movie and the adrenaline injection inside agent Lindsay's body, which recall ""Pulp Fiction"". There's also the stealing of a secret item called 'Rabbit's Foot', but we only see the before and the after, much like in ""Reservoir Dogs"". However, in Mission case, I don't think that this kind of scene was necessary and it may just hide an event that the screenwriters weren't able to develop.<br/><br/>Another weak point: I don't believe that it was necessary to give Ethan's wife a gun and to make her fight. I simply didn't like that scene. The kicking-ass-woman is too cliché (I don't want to look like a macho, however).<br/><br/>Overall, ""M:I-3"" is a really great blockbuster and it brings a holy part of sunlight into the 2006 movie year. A big, big thumbs-up!"
"etfenton","6","2","4","18 May 2006"," Missing a center
","See Tom Cruise crawl through the catacombs. See Tom Cruise cling to the ruins of the Cheasapeake Bay Bridge. See Tom Cruise run through the streets of Shanghai. Beautiful visuals, gripping action, but something seemed to me to be slightly off-kilter throughout the movie. Maybe it has do to with the fact that save for a 30 second microchip, the most interesting heroic character dies at the end of the first reel. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Ving Rhaymes and Jonathan Rhy Meyers are far more interesting than ""Ethan Hunt"" yet have fairly little to do in this movie. Maybe its the fact that you can smell the big plot twist coming. Maybe its the fact Phillip Seymour Hoffman is so far more compelling on screen than Tom Cruise that I actually started to root for the bad guys. Maybe the writers should remember that in an action movie, propelled from scene to scene by pyrotechnics, we need to have people we care about. Maybe its the fact that they never explained what was at stake, or why we should care. Or maybe its just that this would have been a more interesting movie without Tom Cruise."

"dfranzen70","6","2","4","16 May 2006"," A little flat, standard
","I like to think I can separate an actor's public rantings from his or her on screen work. I'd like to think that, but I'm not that much of a professional. The truth is, when an actor becomes overexposed or otherwise annoying, it registers in the back of my mind. So the next time I see them in a movie, that dormant part of my brain thinks, ""This person's irritating!"" And so it is with Tom Cruise. Poor Tom! He's in the papers more for his shenanigans than for his oeuvre. Couch hoppin', medication dissin', baby makin', and brainwashin', that's our Tom. Kind of puts a few dents in his long-cultivated image of Tom Cruise, Actor Man. So, unfortunately, I sat down to watch M:I-3 already prejudiced against Mr. Cruise.<br/><br/>But regardless of how you may feel about Tom cruise, Actor Man, the movie itself just isn't all that good. It's bombastic, trying desperately to distract you with noise, noise, and more noise, so much of it you'll feel numb afterwards. The Mission: Impossible movies are swirls of gunfire, explosions, and grit, but without much in the way of substance - or plausibility.<br/><br/>In this installment, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has left IMF for a new career as a trainer, and he's fallen for a pretty nurse named Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He's done, he's out, he's moving on - except, oops, they've brought him back in. Seems an agent's been captured, and for some unknown reason only Ethan and his old team can retrieve her. This is just the first improbability to hit the plot.<br/><br/>Hunt's nemesis this time around is black-market dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who's after something called the Rabbit's Foot, and Hunt has to stop him. Has to, you see, because Davian's got his new bride, and he's not messing around, understand? A running theme in recent Cruise films has been that his characters always get set up by someone. Mission: Impossible. Minority Report. Vanilla Sky. This one, too, sadly, but it's not really a surprise. The man is just a bit too trusting.<br/><br/>There are some whaddya-kidding-me moments, such as when one character, having seconds earlier been taught how to fire a gun, shoots a few guys dead without so much as wasting a shot. You know, believable stuff like that. But mostly the action comes at you so quickly that you don't have time to ponder the holes in the plot. Ah, but just when you're figuring it's a lot of sound and fury, there will be a scene that completely stops that ill-gotten momentum in its tracks, as shots linger on expressionless faces for no apparent reason other than to give us a chance to grab some snacks.<br/><br/>With the third director in the series, it seems the M:I movies try a little too hard to top each other (not to mention their contemporaries) in terms of visual effects. Cruise is still a good action hero and leading man, and he can certainly carry a picture even if his star has dimmed somewhat. Frankly, he's a little more believable in these thrill rides than he is in the ""small"" movies, like Collateral or Vanilla Sky; when the plot gets center stage, he simply doesn't have the range.<br/><br/>M:I-3 isn't a total waste of time, but it's no longer fresh and exciting; it has its own minilegacy that it must live up to. Judged thusly, it's probably a good thing (for it) that the movie debuted in theaters before the new X Men movie."
"dswmovie","7","2","4","15 May 2006"," Just thought it wasn't good enough!
","In my opinion, Mission Impossible III seems to be a bit good when J. J. Abrams tried to give a fresh setting on the storyboard. That make it look less uninteresting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when it comes to Tom Cruise, I just cannot say a word. From the beginning of the series, I have already got a sense that he was not the right one for the role of Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Also there is some points for you to notice: Firstly, the warehouse scene was unbelievable. Even the troop can save Lindsey, maybe she had been killed herself long before the rescue to avoid from further torture.<br/><br/>Secondly, being Davian was the most interesting part in the film but it was shown in the wrong way. If we don't notice the disappearance of Ethan Hunt, that may be funnier. It is because audience need a great surprise, not something they could notice so early.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was too good to be true. I never believe Davian would got one question to ask Ethan, for that people always falls into curiosity. And Ethan would be that stubborn at all. The script had to make Ethan to be immortal. That's the last thing I feel unhappy about.<br/><br/>The misuse of top playwrights like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonathan Rhys Meyer give a minus to the whole production.<br/><br/>Mostly, I bet the move should be at the right pace. You have to get somewhere to let people stop because it was going to be a 100% action flick.... but when Tom got it controlled, that would never be fulfilled. That's why it failed to up one level."

","I watched this film yesterday with a good friend of mine. We were only watching it because we had missed a train and nothing else looked good. I had heard bad reports about it so entered the screen fearing the worst. The beginning was amazing and really left you at the edge of your seat. All the way through the film the start ran through your head and you pondered where it would become relevant. The film was very action pact but never seemed to go o.t.t. This kept it semi-realistic and didn't force the watcher to divert and stop believing. There were many twists in the tale and this lead to a dramatic ending which was both tense and emotional. In all this film was very enjoyable (with a lot of beautiful actresses) and I did not regret paying £4.50 to watch."
"drmetal8","9","2","4","15 May 2006"," The Best Mission so far
","MI:3 is by far the best Mission Impossible movie so far. It easily surpasses the first 2 in pretty much any area you can think of. The action is non-stop, and totally believable. Love him or hate him, Cruise is incredible in this movie. He does the emotional as well as the physical acting with ease. Obviously JJ Abrams' (Lost, Alias) involvement in this franchise has turned it around. The plot gets dangerously close to ripping off Dan Brown's book 'Angels & Demons' (the book before Davinci Code- worth reading BTW) with the ""Antigod"" segment and the trip inside the Vatican. Other than that, this movie was great. Definitely worth seeing in the theater."

Let's just say if there is a Senate Over-site Committee on Intelligence, IMF would be shut down. Three movies, three inter-departmental problems where IMF is battling IMF, three times the tax payer's monies (that's you and I dear readers/movie goers) are being spent on this conspiracy. This is the modus operandi of J.J.Abrams. <br/><br/>Look at ALIAS. Cruise did. He loved it. He hired J.J. (for the record, I always thought that ALIAS was the twenty-first century Mission: Impossible.) and before you can say Ollie North, M: I: III is back in business again with all the lip reading, bomb in the head, save the world from toxic dangers, and love interests to boot. <br/><br/>The action is fast paced and the editing is sometimes a little hectic. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character is fantastically devilish and unlike Darth Vader, he can not be saved. It is worth going to see his character Owen Davian alone. <br/><br/>One of the things the M: I series is missing is the scene where Ethan Hunt would choose his team from pictures/files, discarding most, and picking the stars in the show. This way we could see a plethora of other actors in the M: I universe and have Cruise make a comical facial expression as he discards David Hasselhoff, Pierce Brosnan, or Nicole Kidman's profile for the mission at hand."

","Look, if you haven't seen MI:III because Tom Cruise is a psycho, forget about Tom's stupid antics because they're not worth missing this movie over. I went into the theater out of loyalty to the series thinking it would be trash but discovered it's far and away the best in the franchise, not to mention the best movie to come out this year and one of the 10 best movies to come out in the past five years. J. J. Abrams works his magic in a masterful feature directing debut. Get up right now and go see this movie. The storyline is fresh, the action better than ever, and Abrams's film-making techniques reinvigorate a franchise in desperate need of it."

","Not long before his death, Greg Morris saw the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie and hated it so much he walked out halfway through. I didn't. Walk out, that is. But I disliked it for much the same reasons he did - for all the razzle-dazzle, it was NOT ""Mission: Impossible."" And neither is ""Mission: Impossible III"" (I've never seen the second one, but I doubt it's any closer to the real thing); it's more like ""Alias: The Movie,"" which may well be what Paramount hired J.J. Abrams for in his debut as a big-screen director, but it's not right somehow.<br/><br/>Not only does it have a lot of stylistic similarity - both this movie and quite a few episodes of ""Alias"" open with our hero in grave danger followed by an extended flashback to how this came about, both feature extended slow motion, both have Greg Grunberg, and so on - but you can draw parallels between the characters, making it two summers in a row that Abrams' co-writers and ""Alias"" alumni Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have been called on this (remember last year's ""The Island""?).<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is Sydney Bristow (although unlike Sydney, Ethan is really just a cipher - and unlike Jennifer Garner, Tom Cruise never really projects any kind of warmth or anything to make you root for him), his superior officer Brassel is APO director Chase crossed with Jack Bristow (and lets Laurence Fishburne have the best line in the film - ""Please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions""), rookie agent Lindsay Ferris is Rachel Gibson (a wasted Keri Russell, and it's to be hoped that Rachel doesn't meet the fate that greets poor Lindsay), Davian is a less complex Arvin Sloane (Philip Seymour Hoffman, stealing the movie and making me regret there wasn't more of him), the never-really-explained Rabbit's Foot is the Rambaldi device, the guy played by Simon Pegg is Marshall, Ethan's fiancée Julie is Sydney's fiancé in the pilot, and so on. They even have the place names on screen. Frankly, I'm surprised the Bad Robot logo doesn't come along at the end (surprised, and relieved... that thing is scary!). <br/><br/>But what this doesn't take from ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" is the willingness to really go for broke, or indeed the complete and utter absorption; ""Mission: Impossible III"" is never unwatchable, but it doesn't really catch fire either - good setpieces, but the climax is something of a damp squib compared to the Vatican break-in or the assault on the bridge; the echoes of what has come before + lack of human feeling = no real investment. (Ironically, the two moments that really strike home are among the simplest - the scene in the helicopter after rescuing Lindsay, and a brief bit in Shanghai where our hero is trying to get the Rabbit's Foot in the road.) Of course, humanity wasn't what the original show was about either, but it WAS about building suspense - this doesn't for the most part, and it also doesn't cut much mustard when compared to almost any episode of ""Alias.""<br/><br/>For the most part the cast (Hoffman, Pegg, Fishburne, Russell, Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Michelle Monaghan, Maggie Q etc) are free of blame, and Michael Giacchino's score (though not as good as Danny Elfman's) is fine. But while the movie doesn't self-destruct, I wouldn't mind disavowing it... though if it hadn't been called ""Mission: Impossible III"" I may have had kinder thoughts.<br/><br/>Oh, and Kanye West should be shot."
"sko_100","9","2","4","12 May 2006"," Another excellent installment! :D
","JJ Abrams is awesome! If you're an Alias or Lost fan, you have no reason in the world not to watch and thoroughly enjoy this near perfect popcorn thriller. Think Alias, fused with the Mission: Impossible (for that, read Tom Cruise) style and a huge budget to play with...with a talented and good-looking cast and this is what you get.<br/><br/>The acting, let's be honest, won't win any Oscars but was more than adequate for this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman exudes creepy power and sinister criminal genius in his role as Davian, an international terrorist; Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup play their spy movie stereotypes with vigour; supporting team members Ving Rhames et al play their respective parts with comedy, loyalty and downright coolness and as ever, Tom Cruise becomes the archetypal screen hero he seems to born to play, complete with tears, yelling and adrenaline-fuelled rushes towards the goal.<br/><br/>This film WILL have you on the edge of your seat (at the bridge part that you preview in the trailer, my hand was almost shaking in excitement), comprised of a handful of mini missions that'll leave the kid in you grinning, and expect all the questions of loyalty, emotion and righteous anger from the man behind Alias. Cinematography is brilliant, picking all the right angles to accentuate the angles and the score by Michael Giacchino (again from the Alias crew...if it ain't broke....) is spot on. All in all just brilliant. As perfect an action film as I've seen in a quite a while and if you go in expecting an octane, high-kicking rush, rather than a dramatic expose on espionage :P you won't be disappointed! I hope you enjoy half as much as I did."

","I loved this movie. I think a lot of it has to do with J.J. Abrams as director. It definitely had an Alias feel to it. Even some of the characters reminded me of Alias characters. It was packed with action from beginning to end and Tom Cruise was great. I have had a crush on Tom since Risky Business although I had been rethinking that crush over the past year (you all know what I mean, lol). I was skeptical going to see the movie, but wow.....it was great. Tom is a great action hero and has not lost any of that magic. Phillip Seymore Hoffman was great as well. I would recommend this film to anyone. And, I hope they make a MI 4 very soon!!!!"

","OK, so having seen all three Mission: Impossible movies now, I can say that the first was still the best, the second faltered big time, and the third was really not all that bad. Certainly it ran a little slowly at times, but Hollywood works that way. The whole love story was a little odd, but makes sense. You work in intelligence/black ops, and you're not going to want anyone to know what you do either, both for their protection and yours. Need proof of that, research the history of CIA defectors.<br/><br/>As for the plot, this one was pretty decent. The casting helped it out quite a bit. The guys who are supposed to be funny are funny, the ones who are supposed to be serious are very serious, and I didn't really find that any character just didn't fit. To be honest, the only reason I gave this movie an 8/10 is that it still didn't quite live up to the original. Otherwise, it was pretty good. Worth seeing, especially if you're in for a good action flick with a decent plot."

"Derek237","7","2","4","8 May 2006"," Summer starts early this year
","Mission Impossible III has a plot that plays little importance to the actual merit of the movie, but it at least has enough respect for the audience to take into account the fact that we already know this. Whatever element of plot that can be found is merely an excuse for Tom Cruise to play dress-up, travel across the globe, and perform spectacular stunts. This is really what you want to see anyway, and everything else (which is the plot) is just filler. His mission involves something called ""The Rabbit's Foot."" Can it bring down the economy? Hack into government defense systems? Unleash a deadly virus? The kicker is, we never ever find out. All we know is that Ethan Hunt needs to get it. And that's all we really need to know.<br/><br/>We see Phillip Seymour Hoffman post-Oscar win, showing his permanent status as a dedicated actor jumping from art house films to gigantic blockbusters, in a cool, slimy villain role. We get the brilliant inclusion of Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg. We get helicopter chases, brain bombs, parachuting, and some very decent fight scenes including one in which Cruise steals some moves from Russel Crowe by smacking a guy in the face with a telephone receiver. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>Mission Impossible originated as a TV show, so I think it was a good choice to bring in the popular director of shows such as Lost and Alias, J.J. Abrams to do this movie. I've never seen any of his shows but I can safely assume that MI:III is just a longer, big-budget version of one of his shows. John Woo directed the previous Mission installment, and I think he tried too hard to blow our minds with the action sequences and delved into tedious self-indulgence. Abrams has made a fast-paced, action-packed thrill ride that was genuinely fun. I only saw it yesterday and have probably forgotten most of it, though I'm sure I could have said the exact same thing the instant I walked out of the theatre. It's a perfect summer movie, though it's out in early May. Oh well.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10"
"khoaitaychienvn","8","2","4","8 May 2006"," A Delicious Action Flick
","Wow. You can imagine what you gonna have in this movie before watching it. It's full of effects and stunt sences with lots of action. The plot is simple to understand. And I really really enjoyed this 1 and 30 mins in the cinema. Ethan Hunt doesn't eat. Ethan hunt doesn't drink. And Ethan Hunt doesn't sleep. I wonder when he does the toilet stuffs. LOL. He just runs from this country to other countries to fight, to shoot, to do all the action to try to complete his impossible mission. Everything of the mission is calculated to get the most exact. It's exact in every action, in every single second. And yes, Ethan Hunt is good at mathematics. He can calculate an operation of geometry to fly from one to another bulding, under him is a busy Shanghai street. Excellent. This is one of the best action flick I have seen."

","The 1st one was very good, the 2nd was OK, the 3rd was amazing.<br/><br/>This is pretty much describes it, mission impossible means loads of action, unexpected storyline..and M:I 3 was successful in both points by a big margin It has been long time really long time since a movie kept me on the edge of my seat till the last minute.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that you can't be bored for 1 minute, every minute is worth watching, and it is very rare these days to have a movie like that.<br/><br/>The only -ve point is that I felt the movie was so fast, the storyline needed more time, and we needed some more information on ''the bad guys'' especially the Chinese seen where Tom Cruis entered the building full of armed men to get the rabbit foot, and just after 3 minutes he was out with it,,without knowing what exactly happened inside??!<br/><br/>Other than it is excellent, if want to watch a quality action movie, don't miss M:I 3"
"mrliteral","8","2","4","7 May 2006"," Solid Entertainment
","In some ways, this movie is the best of the three starring and produced by Tom Cruise. In other ways, it's not. It depends on one's point of view, and those do tend to vary. There are things that I personally enjoyed about all three. Some things in the first two I hated. I hated nothing in this one, so that would make it my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>Here's what works: the story here is by far the most compelling of the three. The first one had Ethan Hunt's team killed off in the opening sequence, and the rest of IMF in danger of discovery. So what; I didn't know them, and I don't care. I honestly don't remember what the second one was about, but there were bad people who had to be stopped, and only Ethan Hunt could stop them.<br/><br/>Now, the danger is more compelling. His life is being invaded by his work. Bad guys kidnap his wife and protégé. Everything he does is to protect something personal to him. It's much more accessible, and it brings you into the story. Some people might think it's less interesting because they prefer to see Tom Cruise save the world at large from destruction and chaos. I see that as kind of a vague concept, and I've seen enough of it for a while. I'd rather feel what he's fighting for instead of just watching it.<br/><br/>The stunts are fun, the action never falters, and the movie rarely slows down to take a break. This is what I expect of the franchise, of an early summer movie, and it delivered.<br/><br/>There are a number of little things along the way that are kind of silly, in the sense that characters who should know better do something easily avoidable, but these failures never impact the big picture and are easily dismissed. For example, Ethan jumps from a building and parachutes to the ground with a stolen item, yet it didn't occur to him to secure this item somehow and he drops it, then has to chase it through speeding traffic. It's dumb that he didn't secure it, but he picks it up and gets away. It's a little thing that shouldn't have happened because it's out of character, but it doesn't make a big difference so I'm not terribly bothered by it. If someone's pet monkey had picked it up and Ethan had to chase the monkey...well, thankfully that's a different movie.<br/><br/>Another drawback is that director JJ Abrams is not an experienced filmmaker. He's worked a lot in television but the big screen is a bit different. Basically, he can't touch John Woo's visual style, and his storytelling pace feels perfectly tailored to commercial breaks. Again, this doesn't have a big impact on the movie. It's fun to watch. It's an easy thrill. It's worth paying for and sitting through.<br/><br/>If you liked anything about the other two you'll like this one. If you enjoy sitting down to be entertained, go see it. If you want to spend a couple hours not taking anything seriously, it's perfect for you. It's not breaking any new ground, but it doesn't have to. Eight stars of ten."
"LAWigley","3","2","4","7 May 2006"," Mission: Unoriginal
","I want to preface this by saying I love action movies. Kill Bill vol 1&2 are two (one?) of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. I held an emotional investment for The Bride, wanted her to kick ass, and ultimately kill Bill. And yet the end was bitter-sweet because it had depth with her killing her mentor and love. Just an amazing movie experience, and now you have a sense of what I'm looking for in a film.<br/><br/>So there's been a lot of hoopla about JJ Abrams taking the helm on the Mission Impossible franchise. Abrams is best known, of course for creating TV's Felicity, Alias and Lost.<br/><br/>This is my problem: the plot of M:I 3 is all too familiar because I'm pretty sure I've seen it before.<br/><br/>Anyone remember the first season of Alias? The first episode begins with our spy being held captive and tortured. Then for the rest of the season, the plot flashes back to bring us back up to speed as to how the spy got there in the first place. You also find out that the spy's fiancé is in the dark about the espionage career, and is put into jeopardy because of it.<br/><br/>Now, I know it's been ten years -- yes, ten whole years since M:I 1, but does anyone remember that plot?<br/><br/>Right, someone in the agency is the bad guy.<br/><br/>And in M:I 2, one of the bad guys is a former IMF agent gone bad. <br/><br/>So for 3 out of 3 Mission: Impossible movies, one of the the bad guys comes from IMF. Dude, I think there's something rotten in IMF.<br/><br/>You'd sort of like to imagine that when Abrams came on board, that he might have watched the first 2 movies and thought, ""hey, let's not do that again.""<br/><br/>And the surprise twist is hardly a surprise -- trust me, you can see it coming a mile off. I was hoping for something slightly more clever like Julia (Michelle Monaghan) being the villain or that Owen Davian (Hoffman) never really existed and was always a woman in a mask & a suit.<br/><br/>Alas, no evil Francie in sight.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Philip Seymour Hoffman does a creepy enough job but he's not in the movie enough. His part ranks slightly above a cameo. Why have Hoffman if you aren't really going to use him? Cruise is bland. I understand some audiences have clapped when he's being beaten to a pulp. There's some odd awkwardness in how much Monaghan looks like Katie Holmes. Anyone else in the movie is of no consequence.<br/><br/>There's also been a bit of press about Abrams fleshing out the M:I characters. Yeah, well if you want to consider, ""I'm saying a poem about my cat who ran away,"" character development, more power to you. How droll.<br/><br/>And for something based on a clever TV show about team work, M:I 3 still misses the boat. Probably the scene that comes the closest to the original MI is the one in Vatican City. There's some nice team work to accomplish the mission, and it's not all about blowing stuff up or shooting people.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a clever, funny, well-plotted action movie for the Summer, this isn't it. If you want to see a re-tread of plots from previous Mission: Impossible movies, other action movies, and various TVs shows, then this is a fine popcorn flick."

","*** Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Kerri Russel. Directed by J.J Abrams The third and possibly best installment to the espionage thrillers with IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise, in top notch form) up against the odds. While reuniting with his team and going up against arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman, a surprisingly evil villain) who both search to recover a valuable ""Rabbit's Foot"". Cruise and Hoffman battle off with brains and edge of your seat combating action (!). ""Mission Impossible 3"" packs the fun and never fails to skimp out on it. Possibly the best of the series and Abrams first job in the directing job, and does a hell of one too. Which after the second ""MI"" where ironically an action director, John Woo, hardly supplies a decent supplement of action. Instead a boring dose of misguided thrills and spills that fall short of suspense or adventure."

","I watched Mission Impossible one the other day on Sky Movies one, the special effects look abit dated but the story was clever. I then tried watching Mission Impossible 2 but found that the whole idea was stupid, and the stunts where truly unbelievable. I then saw trailers for this and thought it looked as interesting as no. 2 however I noticed that it was by the same person who made ""LOST"" and like most people I like LOST so if anything i believed that the Director would make it be a great film...for once I was right.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough (and is already explained in loads of other reviews so I wont tell you about that) but it was very much like watching LOST in a way because it was simple but it still had parts that where unexpected, you thought or could guess what was going to happen but it was something totally different and I liked that it made it feel as if the people who made it had thought it through and tried to be modern but go back to Mission Impossible one.<br/><br/>People have been saying about Ethan Hunts character and the relationship side of it and the flashbacks but I personally thought that was a good idea to put it in the film, it made him seem as if he was more real and not like James Bond who when we watch it we have no idea about his social life or memories. It was a feel a key part to the way that you look at the film and the story, if you believe what you see then your going to follow it better, and because this character now has a background and now has a life outside what we know from previous films it just makes you think hes human, and hes normal.<br/><br/>I found that the action in the film was spot on it was enough to make you think ""wow thats cool"" but not too much to make you think ""this is boring"" the film is very fast in the way that you see the action, and this is helped by the excellent script. The action seems to make you feel as if you have been put right in the film, and in some scenes there is so much happening at once.<br/><br/>There are several key moments to the film, but I think the opening is the one of the best opens to a film that I have seen since Raiders of the Lost ark, it made you want to watch the film, I wont tell you any more than that because I'm sure you want to see it.<br/><br/>I personally feel that the real star is J J Abrans, he's directing is really good, and the way he works the camera to show different situations is spot on, this film id anything is like watching an episode of LOST, the plot is fast, there are a few flashbacks but nothing to put you off whats going on, the idea is simple, and the camera works is spot on, if you like the first Mission Impoossible then go and see this (in my opinion it is better than the first and this is what the other two films wish they where) And another thing....ignore this Scientologyistic, rubbish that people keep saying about with Tom Cruise, just go and see this film because it's quite simply an action adventure film."

"jon.h.ochiai","9","2","4","6 May 2006"," Mission Intense
","In the opening scene of ""Mission: Impossible III"", a tortured and bound Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) screams at the villainous Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman),""  I swear to God, I will kill you!"" Davian is about to kill someone beloved to Ethan. First time feature Director J.J. Abrams (""Alias"" and ""Lost"") starts full throttle showcasing the sheer intensity of Cruise and Hoffman at the emotional arc. Both Cruise and Hoffman are two of the screen's most intense and driven actors. This dynamic along with the awe inspired stunts fuels ""Mission: Impossible III"" emerging as a great action thriller. This time around MI:3 is more personal, and generates an emotional investment in it's characters. In the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Abrams, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now a retired operative who trains recruits for the IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Kurtzman, Orci, and Abrams also employ an effective narrative device by opening in the middle of the story, then retracing their path.<br/><br/>No longer in the Game, Ethan has found the love of his life Julia (Michelle Monaghan). They have plans to marry. Julia is a doctor, who has no idea who Ethan really is. Ethan's story is that he works for the Department of Transportation as a traffic planner. Apparently, saving the world from global terrorism is in his past-- until Ethan receives a call from IMF supervisor John Musgrave (mysterious Billy Crudup) during his and Julia's engagement party. Apparently, Ethan's star student, Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell), is missing in action. Lindsey was to uncover the covert operation lead by the deadly international arms dealer Davian (Hoffman). Davian covets an omnipotent weapon called the ""rabbit's foot"". The ""rabbit's foot"" refers to the mythological ""anti-god"" weapon. Ethan's mission: Retrieve Lindsey and reveal the whereabouts of the ""rabbit's foot"".<br/><br/>Ethan accepts the mission and reunites with best bud Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), along with new members Declan (charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (stunning and deadly Maggie Q). In the spectacular ensuing operation, things go horribly wrong. Politically savvy IMF Director John Brassel (the great Laurence Fishburne) chastises Ethan and crew for the rash operation. Their new mission targets Davian directly and obtaining the ""rabbit's foot"". There are also hints of a conspiracy from within.<br/><br/>Once Abrams sets the stage for his story, MI:3 floors into overdrive with non-stop thrills, world class action sequences, and gripping emotion. Ultimately, MI:3 is a conflict of vengeance between Ethan (Cruise) and Davian (Hoffman). In the balance of this outcome is Julia (Monaghan), the love of Ethan's life. Consequently, this installment of ""Mission: Impossible"" is the most effective and most gratifying. Director and writer Abrams masterfully orchestrates the visuals and action sequences. Those familiar with the movie trailer saw Cruise bouncing of a car from an exploding missile, and Cruise's free fall dive from a skyscraper is heart stopping. Though what really distinguishes MI:3 is the underlying love story and the dynamic hero and villain conflict embodied by Cruise and Hoffman. ""Mission: Impossible III"" works as personal story of extremes: love versus revenge.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is surprising, powerful, and commanding as the merciless and venomous Owen Davian. Surprising in that this is such a departure from his Academy Award Winning performance in ""Capote"". Hoffman creates in Davian, a villain whose malevolence is almost visceral. Tom Cruise is his match in intensity. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is powerful, and his intensity and innate charisma serve him well here. As Ethan, Cruise is the classic hero: strong, determined, brave, and compassionate. Cruise performed almost all of his own stunts. Whether he uses martial arts skills to dispatch bad guys or is hurling to the streets on a failed parachute, he displays amazing physicality and spirit. Cruise seems to remain ageless. Michelle Monaghan is captivating and vulnerable as Julia. Keri Russell is very strong as Lindsey. Laurence Fishburne is so effective in a deceiving role as Brassel. Ving Rhames is Ethan's rock. Rhames commands a quite power. Though his Luther should have gotten more screen time, he grounds MI:3 .<br/><br/>Abram's ""Mission: Impossible III"" is spectacular and stunning eye candy with its mind blowing action and international locales. Although it is its classic story of the forces of good versus the forces of great evil that compel, and for that acknowledge the talents of Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman. At its heart MI:3 is also a love story that provides its emotional stake. MI:3 is well worth watching."

It's the only movie in memory which I've literally fell asleep to.<br/><br/>So what am I to expect, in the midst of crazy Tom Cruise antics and pointless 'action' movies that bore, not excite? <br/><br/>I've recently developed a philosophy when seeing movies: Take how much hype you have about the movie going into it, slice it down to half, and you'll usually enjoy yourself. So naturally, I went into Mission: Impossible III expecting a decent flick. Fun popcorn fair, right?<br/><br/>I went in expecting a good time.<br/><br/>During the time I went in and the time I came out, I was on the edge of my seat every single second. The first minute was over and already it was the best Mission: Impossible of them all.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise (as protagonist Ethan Hunt) comes back after his outing in War of the Worlds to once again prove that he can lead a movie like none other. What was once just a spy role has become a multi-layered, emotional acting job. Don't go in expecting an Oscar-performance, because you won't get one. Cruise isn't that type of actor. But what you will get is Cruise's best performance since Collateral. You feel with his character, you run down the blown-up bridges with his character, and plummet down dozens of stories with his character. The super-spy is back and better than ever, no doubt.<br/><br/>Next up on the list is academy award-winning actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Devian). To be honest, he doesn't have too many speaking lines throughout the movie, but when he does speak, he's scary. Scary, scary, scary. You really do believe he is going to do what he says he is going to do. He's smart, creative, and downright creepy. Does he have an evil plot? Oh, yes. But he never reveals it out and out. Instead, he's trying to figure out what Ethan's plans are by cleverly playing an emotional and intellectual game of strategy. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast performs remarkably. Rhames is awesome as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell. Simon Pegg is funny as the Q-character. Fishburne floats around perfectly in the gray area as the head of IMF. Everyone is really top-notch.<br/><br/>Now down to the real reason why this movie soars. Pure and simple, it's an action movie that does precisely what a true action movie should. It never bores. It never lets you down. It always gives you something new, something fresh. It keeps going and going like the battery bunny, from the very first second to the very last. There are many movies out there that claim to be action movies. They're cheap imitations compared to MI:III. This movie contains so much energy that you could power the city of New York with it and still have leftovers for Tokyo and Los Angeles. There hasn't been an action movie this good, this nonstop, this crazy, or this unrelenting since 'Speed' or - dare I say it? - 'Aliens'. Who cares as to why we're really in Shanghai or Berlin? They're stages for the best action scenes in a really, really long time. The scene on the bridge was particularly heart-pounding. Yes, heart-pounding. This is a movie worthy of all those kinds of phrases.<br/><br/>Big props to J.J. Abrams and the director of cinematography. Incredible style. I'm absolutely dying to see what happens in the fourth if it keeps the same crew on-board. Face it, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot with a .50 caliber handgun if they didn't anchor J.J. Abrams to the sequel. I've never seen Alias or Lost before, but now I think I might just have to go out and get some DVDs. <br/><br/>This is it - the film that really deserves all those clichéd review accolades. ""No-holds barred, edge of your seat, non-stop."" The roller-coaster ride of the year - and quite possibly the decade.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III is the first perfect action film of the 21st century. <br/><br/>Well played, sirs. Well played."
"badoix","7","2","4","6 May 2006"," Adequate thriller
","MI-3: a fast-paced action thriller, right? Right. I did like the action sequences: my favorite was the one on the bridge. The plot is straightforward enough; Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has to do the impossible to keep his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) alive. To the movie's credit, the relationship between Ethan and his wife is developed well enough for the audience to care whether she lives or not. The supporting cast is accomplished enough but I can't say that they add terribly much to the movie, except for Philip Seymour Hoffman who is convincingly maniacal as Owen Davian. Ving Rhames does adequately as a member of Ethan's team. An enjoyable watch. 3 stars."
"rollonyuebears","8","2","4","5 May 2006"," Worth its 10 bucks and popcorn.
","This film definitely solidified the Mission Impossible franchise. By bringing in JJ Abrams to direct this film, Tom Cruise will definitely be able to star in another MI sequel, maybe two-that is if he chooses to star in them. This film is easily broken up in scenes that are very noticeable. Viewers will shift from scene to scene knowing exactly the intent of the plot. The cinematography is excellent as it brings really solid action to the film. The musical score is also surprisingly great. Kanye West produced this version of the MI theme with a hint of his hip-pop roots, but deviates little from the original's suspense and dramatization. Going into this movie, I had very little expectations, as I felt the second sequel was a huge disappointment. Tom Cruise bounces back from his previous performance as a mortal and irresponsible dad in War of the Worlds. The other actors are terrific in the supporting role... The dialogue in this one isn't too bad. Let's just say I didn't laugh at any of the closeups... (like I did with The Day After Tomorrow) The plot keeps the audience in their seats. And you will be impressed by the change of setting in this film! Terrific film, can't wait for the next one."
"mk1swim","7","2","4","5 May 2006"," Well done J.J. Abrams!
","I just viewed this movie in Orlando after a fun filled day at MGM studios on a vacation. And as such, I would like to compare this MI3 to the Rockin' Roller Coaster. The ride begins going from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds, and apparently, by the time you reach the first turn, the rider is experiencing 3 Gs. The ride is in the dark and you never know which way you are going to turn, and the only clues are the vivid neon lights every so often mimicking California scenery. I experienced vertigo. In the same way MI3 offers a new darker approach and is as fast from the beginning right until the end. There is no way to tell the good guys from the bad and the movie offers political commentary alluding to transitions made that the ends justify the means. Although the approach gives into every cliché of a thriller, how it is all put together is what makes the film refreshingly original. If one can suspend their own personal cynicism of what could conceivably happen in the real world, MI3 allows for a wild ride and is quite enjoyable. The only time to catch a breath during the film is the love story between Hunt and his Fiancé, which is a welcome element of choosing love over saving the world and trying to balance the two. While Cruse performs as... well eccentric and energetic as usual, although commanding, the supporting cast, writers, and director is to be applauded for giving the franchise a welcome element of surprise and a believable enigma of a puzzle for the viewer to solve. Well done J.J. Abrams!"
"ljarsonbeck-1","4","2","4","5 May 2006"," Tom Cruise as action hero is a Mission Implausible
","O.K., o.k. after much argument I finally saw MI3 (as if I hadn't seen enough of Cruise the last six months) and all I can say is Kevin Costner had fewer close ups in WATERWORLD. Tom Cruise has surprised me in some roles ie RAINMAN and MAGNOLIA but he is not an action film star no matter how often he tries to subject us to it. Maybe he should do the research and come to terms with his limitations. And speaking of limitations I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman sounded more like a man with a cold than a hip sadistic villain. Hoffman whom I enjoy watching in anything from ""Happiness"" to ""Capote:"" was more of a heal in ""Scent of a Woman"" than here in MI3. The script lacked originality and sharp punchlines to break up the monotony of ""Tom Sure Shot Cruise"" shoot outs. I love a good shoot out- even if it's over the top- but I was not caught up in these. Also I could see in my minds eye Tom Cruise insisting he finally get a ""good bridge scene"" in his action movie and jumping up and down on his producer couch after reading the ""bridge scene"" inclusion in the MI3 script. It didn't help!! Maybe a director with more vision could have done a better job Unfortunately the director was JJ Abrams who despite the budget found a way to make this scene and in deed the entire movie dull, more of the same and implausibly laughable where it shouldn't have been. Was it the fact that the star was the producer of the movie that limited JJ?? or that the star so intent on forcing the issue of action hero and close ups could only find a director who was leadable and therefore lacking vision hence JJ Abrams. Tom!! you're not as talentless as I thought you were 20 years ago but get a grip on the reality of yourself- if you can do it for Brook Sheilds surely you can turn the mirror inwards- give the audience what they want instead of what you hope to shove(L) on them."
"ld876","3","2","4","5 May 2006"," Some cool effects and scenes, but felicity was cooler than tom
","Who would have thought Felicity would overshadow tom? Oh wait, I guess that's a given. As much as I didn't plan on seeing the film, I got into a free screening, so I figured it wouldn't break my pact for not paying to see it. Anyway, Tom had some bi-polar moments, as one would expect by now, going from happy to sad, to happy, to crazy, to sad in about 6 seconds. But the scene near the beginning when he tosses the gun to Felicity (yes, i know its not her name in the movie) just had a cool effect and camera rotation, and she holds a gun well.<br/><br/>The overall plot just seemed very shallow and less 'life-threatening' than the previous MI's. It jumped around a lot and just tried to employ as many effects as possible instead of trying to get you really into the story. Entrapement was better for the genre. Silent Hill had cooler effects for movies out now. Keep in mind, when I look at Tom, all I can think is ""crazy."""
"alfred-guernica","9","2","4","5 May 2006"," M:i:III - The most spectacular action movie 've ever made, but fails to be a classic
","""I know why you wanna hate me, I know why you wanna hate me, I know why you wanna hate me, cause hate is all the world has even seen lately""<br/><br/>Remember? This song rocked! And it's so actual when we're talking about Tom Cruise. But the man did it again! This will be a total disaster for the Cruise-haters, because this movie kick ass and will be a huge hit!<br/><br/>This is the most spectacular and most professional action movie I've ever seen. You have no time to relax. Not a single minute. Two hour smart action, thrilling run and rush. This is THE SUMMER MOVIE. You'll get what you expect.<br/><br/>The start is brilliant. You see the invincible Ethan Hunt, the guy, who can not lose and always wins, you see him beaten. He's beaten. Tom Cruise is beaten. He doesn't smile on you, he's angry, he's scared, he's totally beaten, ha can not move, has no chance to escape, he's begging and crying to the villain. Yep, the villain. PS Hoffman, who owns this scene. He's absolutely amazing. You just staring at his face and you'll know that he's the perfect enemy. That's the start. Then goes the main MI theme and the title and you are totally pumped. The movie kidnapped you and you will escape two hours later.<br/><br/>All the action scenes are well created, the stunts and the effects are great. The cast is very good. This is not a Tom Cruise-show, there's enough time to the other members. You'll see the IMF team. Not just that, but they show you IMF headquarters and a bit of how it all work, the masks, the strategy... Laurence Fishburne is the perfect IMF leader, Ving Rhames is the perfect fellow, acts like a brother. Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q was OK. I expected a stronger performance from Billy Crudup, but my absolute favorite is Simon Pegg. He has only two scenes, but in those two he's the main attraction.<br/><br/>As of Hoffman: he's absolutely amazing! He should have got bigger part, because when he appears on screen, all the actors around him go invisible.<br/><br/>And we come to Tom Cruise. As one mate said on the forum: ""I don't care if he eats babies next! Whenever he makes a good movie, I'm going to see it!"" And that's the point. He does great movies! Forget what you heard about his private life! Just focus on the movie! It's worth-seeing, I tell you that! He doesn't play very well, but he's not bad at all. But you know, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt. If anybody else played the role, that 'd be a disaster! He's the man for this role! He owns this franchise, he chosen the director, the actors, he's the producer and he stars in it. And when you see a Tom Cruise movie, you'll know that he does the stunts. And there are some incredible stunts! But my two favorite moment in the film are a little bit strange ones, because neither of them is an important scene, but for me it was among the best parts. When Ethan rides that motorcycle for a plane that's taking off, wears those shades, you feel that you're watching Top Gun, and he's riding to the Danger Zone. There's the image of him. And I know that's for reason. It reminds you that 'Hey Top Gun was made 20 years ago, and here's this guy and he's still a star, still great and strong'. And there's the truth. A lot of people want to see him flop, but it won't happen this year neither. And when he's in the airport with those mustache, he looks like the guy in the Born on the Fourth Of July. It was Cruise' main role, his best performance. That image reminds you that he's not an ordinary action guy, he's a good actor. And there's that Shanghai sprint! It was the best moment in the movie for me. The cinematography is very average, but in this scene the set is really good. Tom Cruise loves to run in his films, but this was his best run! He said: ""There was a long sprint in the movie. That was challenging because it was at the end of the picture. My body was run down and I had to do about - I think I had to do it five or six times.""<br/><br/>And after all I have to admit my bad feelings about this film. Why it isn't a classic or the best of the series? First of all, the story is very poor. It is not so good, Although the script is poor, it doesn't destroy the movie, because JJ Abrams is a good director and the action scenes are very cool, but I expected more. The ending is awful - I have to admit that too. The score: It was OK, but when I heard that Giacchino got the job, I was so happy. This guy is a genius. Remember The Incredibles, Lost or Medal of Honour score? This guy is very good! That's why I excepted more, it was OK, but not amazing! Zimmer did much better job with MI2. And yep, where are those massive soundtrack? MI2 rocked with Metalicca and Limp Bizkit, the whole soundtrack was awesome, when we come to this part - MI3 is a disappointment.<br/><br/>But why not the best of the series? Because the movie suffers in one thing. The style. MI had the style, this hasn't. It's a real joy to watch, as I said before, the perfect summer movie, but MI gave more, it became classic, but that's just me, that's what I think.<br/><br/>But MI3 is a very good movie, it's the perfect beginner of the summer, and it may end as the best movie of it. We'll see. You decide! Watch this movie! NOW! :)"
"DonFishies","7","2","4","5 May 2006"," A story would have made the great action that much better
","Although I was very young at the time, I did enjoy the original Mission: Impossible film in 1996. The special effects were great, and the whole thing was tense as hell. Yes, there were zillions of holes in the plot as I've since found out, but it was a great action thriller with enough story to hold over for the action. But when I finally got around to catching Mission: Imossible 2 in 2000 after the buzz died down a little bit, I was less than impressed. They replaced all the story with extra action, and made the very little story that was left, absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>So now, we have Mission: Impossible 3, again with Tom Cruise, but headed by Alias and Lost creator J.J. Abrams, aka ABC's Jesus. I was a little intrigued by the trailers, which said absolutely nothing about the film, and was fairly hyped going into the film. But now, I feel a touch disappointed, but a little relieved that Abrams tried to fix the mess that John Woo made, profit worthy or not.<br/><br/>Without ruining anything, I will say that the film starts up tense, and doesn't let up whatsoever. Action abounds at every turn, and the break neck pace keeps up the whole way through. Cruise does his actioner best, and keeps it much more serious than it should be. Ving Rhames, as with the rest of the series, makes a great supporting character for Cruise. The rest of the supporting cast including Maggie Q, John Meyers, Billy Crudup, and the very, very little used Larry Fishbourne and Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg do excellent as well.<br/><br/>But yes, there are problems.<br/><br/>The story is almost non-existent, and like it's predecessors, is bullet-holed and ridiculous. As Cruise and Co. go around doing their missions, you never really get a sense of why or how they manage to pull any of them off. There is like 5 minutes of story, and then 20 of action. It goes around and around like this, until all that is left is action. Yes, it's tense, and really thrilling, but there's very little story to back any of it up. No, it's nowhere near as bad as M:I 2, one of the worst yet most profitable sequels in recent years, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Another bad item is the lack of anything for Michelle Monaghan or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to do. These are both talented actors (Hoffman coming fresh off his Oscar win in Capote), and they're given almost nothing to do. They get very little screen time, and a lot of the screen time they do get, they either are gagged or just not talking for one reason or another. Yes, having a packed cast does take away from a lot of things, but unfortunately, it ruins the overall effect of the film. Cruise cannot carry this baby on his own. And while Rhames helps a lot, players like Monaghan and Hoffman sit in the back row, not having anything to do. When they finally do, it's to attempt and further the plot, only to get sideswiped into even more action. They try their best, but unfortunately come off as next to useless in the whole scheme of things. Given a lot more to do, they could have been fabulous. But at least we know that Hoffman will not be portraying characters things like this anymore.<br/><br/>As a first time director, Abrams does a valiant effort to not just make this film out to be all thrilling action, with zero substance. There are many instances in which it may feel like an episode of Alias, but then there are many where it really does compare to the excellent original attempt by Brian De Palma. But where the movie succeeds is unfortunately in its action, and not in its plot. Major story elements are completely glossed over by the action that comes before and after it, and leaves no chance for the audience to actually grab a hold of what has happened. Abrams does a great job on his shows helping this problem, but cannot do a thing here, and it is totally unfortunate.<br/><br/>What started out as a tense intelligently flawed blockbuster, evolved into mindless action drivel, only to become a cross between both, with more action than plot. This Cruise franchise has been plagued since the start, and Mission: Impossible 3 does not change any of that. Yes, the film is enjoyable, but is definitely one that requires very little thinking. It is superior to Woo's sequel, but does not match anything that De Palma did. A lot less action, and more character driven material would have made this film an absolute astonishment.<br/><br/>But if it's action at every turn that you want, than look no further.<br/><br/>7/10."
"heathnothomo1177","8","2","4","5 May 2006"," a great start for the summer of 2006.
","if you're a fan of the previous ""Mission: Impossible"" films, I think you'll be pleased with this sequel. It has all the action and suspense of its predecessors and it further develops the character of Ethan Hunt and his fellow spies. It also features more of the clever spy gadgets that would make James Bond green with envy. Fans of ""Alias"" should also be pleased with this film. Writer-director J.J. Abrams brings a lot of the elements that made ""Alias"" great into ""Mission: Impossible III."" There's international intrigue, romance, conspiracy, and tense action. It all comes together to make a solid and entertaining summer action flick.<br/><br/>From the very opening scene ""Mission: Impossible III"" grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. It opens with an incredibly intense scene where Ethan is chained and helpless as Davian holds a gun to Julia's head. It's emotional, violent, and nail biting. Though it kind of spoils what happens later in the story, it hooks the audience and pulls them fully on board for the ride. The rest of the action in the film is first rate. The first big action scene features a rescue mission. There's a great gun battle and I was quite shocked to see that Keri ""Felicity"" Russell could kick butt and hold her own alongside Tom Cruise. Abrams is notable for creating strong female characters and he does so here yet again. The second major action piece is a tense mission inside the Vatican. It's funny, tense, and intriguing. Here again a strong female presence emerges with Maggie Q. I hadn't recalled seeing this actress before, but she was as beautiful as she was tough in this movie. Other action scenes include an explosive battle on a bridge, an escape from IMF headquarters, and a great car chase through Shanghai. Action fans will be well pleased.<br/><br/>The cast in this film is really strong. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. There's not much more you can say about him. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, makes a very impressive bad guy. Ving Rhames reprises his role from the previous films and he's in fine form. Laurence Fishburne doesn't have a very big role, but he's quite intimidating with the little screen time he has. It's the secondary characters that really help round out the film. As previously mentioned, Keri Russell and Maggie Q kick butt and are beautiful. Michelle Monaghan even gets a little action as Julia. Simon ""Shawn of the Dead"" Pegg really steals the show in a couple of brief scenes as Benji Dunn, the ""Q"" of IMF. He provides much of the humor in the movie.J.J. Abrams breathes new life into ""Mission: Impossible"" and proves that the franchise still has some life in it. If you liked the first two, you'll more than likely enjoy this. I personally thought it was better than ""M:I-2."""

","How surprised I was when I saw this! Even with the bad publicity Cruise has been getting lately, his performance makes you completely forget about it and sucks you right into the movie. The guy is a fantastic actor and a very dedicated and hard working one at that! The film is intense from start to finish and features great actors, directing, story and music.<br/><br/>Focusing on Ethan Hunt's personal life is a nice change, and it's good to see a different side of the character. I was also very pleased to see classic Mission Impossible elements show up in this movie, such as the very detailed 'facemaker' scene, and some classic musical cues showing up (in particular 'The Plot' when the team assembles for the first time).<br/><br/>This is an action packed movie with some thrilling and powerful elements thrown into the mix. This installment to the M:I series is quite possibly it's best, if not slightly second to the first. Keep an eye out for this film's well planned infiltration sequence at the Vatican!<br/><br/>I would love to see an M:I-4, but this time with a more dramatic and thriller type story as seen in Mission: Impossible 1.<br/><br/>Good job."

It gave me exactly that!<br/><br/>The film kicks off with a high tense opening sequence in which you immediately know what you're in for: excitement, excitement and more excitement. Ever wanted to see a helicopter chase through a windmill park? 'M:I 3' will give it too you, along with more mind blowing action sequences in which I got sweat in my hand palms. It keeps a very high pace going up until a few minutes before the end, in which I thought the film became a little too cheesy, but all in all: GREAT FUN!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames are wonderful again, whereas Philip Seymour Hoffman makes a nice and quite believable bad guy...

There is surprisingly no scene that is unnecessary or boring. If you live action movies and especially a classic like Mission Impossible, you have got to see it.

","Sure, it followed the normal action movie formula. But hey, that's what we go in expecting. But what was surprising was how well everything fit together from the pace to the plot to the characters. Usually an action movie lacks believable motivation, or in trying to be a clever action movie the pace becomes unbearably slow.<br/><br/>Somehow MI III got it all right. It struck the right balance in suspense, action, revenge, and even comedy. Even details like the film location enhanced the movie. Nothing was done for pure show or Cruise's ego. <br/><br/>Impressive...might be stretching it, but it's definitely one of the best action films I've seen in a long time."

","From the opening scene this film had me hooked. The action is there the FX (ILM no less) are awesome, but the thing that amps all that up is how engaging the characters are. Hunt's private side becomes exposed to us and this made me care a lot more about him, his girl and importantly, the story. The villain, Davian, is genuinely unsettling, casting a shadow of menace over the whole picture and I expected the unhappiest of endings.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams' directs the action with a lot of pace, but what's refreshing is what he chooses not to show at times. There's more of a sense of teamwork and infiltration in this that the previous sequel - thats a good thing. <br/><br/>Better than M:I:2, probably better than the original - I'm off to see it again tomorrow!"
"educallejero","8","0","0","18 June 2020"," The best of the trilogy
","With a frenetic pace more adequate for this genre without any really attention paid to characters personalities more than ""good or bad"", Abrams gives us an incredibly entertaining from start to finish without the clearly weaknesses the first two had.<br/><br/>The score is even better than the one from the sequel, the script also much better with its twists and turns and pace.<br/><br/>But at the same time, it uses all the same elements than the first two, but better. And that also brings the weaknesses, like the weak characters, the forced emotion that just do not really work, the generic third act and the repetition of things that are a mark of this particular IP (the freaking deus ex machina: mask and voice modulator, even if now explained, have to stop).<br/><br/>So yeah, it is much better, but it can't solve the problems of the franchise to elevate it into ""great"" territory for my taste."
"TheDreadedChampion2019","7","0","0","17 March 2019"," MI3
","One thing I will say about this one, it's probably the most intense and intimate Mission Film. You really begin to get a sense of who Ethan Hunt is and become invested in him as a character. JJ Abrams brings that emphasis on story and emotional investment to the table in this one. And like all of his films, it's got a nice visual flair, its energetic, entertaining, and a lot of fun. Even the way its shot, with all the close ups, it just feels more personal and intimate...in MI3 Ethan Hunt, engaged and retired from field work, is brought back onto the field to rescue a former protege of his and soon becomes embroiled in a personal conflict with an arms dealer played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Arguably the best villain of the series...Michelle Monaghan is a natural talent, pretty and showing vulnerability, and I fully bought her relationship with Ethan. Aaron Paul pops up as Ethan's brother in law, I was just left wanting more of his comedic relief after the few scenes he is in... Benji appears for the first time in the series, a little fatter and before his days as a field agent and Ethan's close friend...it's a solid movie. It is the first glimmer of what was to come with Ghost Protocol and beyond. But the seed of that idea began here, it just hadn't been fully formed. The filmmakers are slowly putting the pieces in place to get back to what Mission Impossible is supposed to be. The team effort is emphasized more, the musical motifs from the original series are revived, and Ethan Hunt as a character is clearly defined. I love the ending. Its not like the last two, its not any big stunt or action sequence, its action packed for sure, and very tense, but its all driven by character....Might be my least favorite overall, it doesn't stand out in the way some of the others do, its perfectly serviceable, and well executed, but it is fairly conventional with its script...But still good!"

","The Third mission impossible is an improvement upon the ""Not worth watching"" MI2, but it still suffers from plot issues. The story isn't nearly as compelling as the first, but is still more of a personal Mission Impossible.

","This mission has all the sensational action scenes, breakneck speed, nonstop high-tech stuff, great stunts, and a very disturbing villain played seriously by Philip Seymour Hoffman, but it's samey and a lot of what goes on is implausible. The film is like a travel brochure to hang the big sequences on and this is one of several false notes. Some of the escapes are very far fetched, and implausible in other parts. The audience will forget about the nefarious device and not care what the Rabbit's foot really is."

","The third instalment of the Mission: Impossible franchise took a while to get off the ground. Originally trusted to director David Fincher (which would have been fascinating to see), the Fight Club director opted out when another project caught his eye, so the reigns were passed to Joe Carnaghan, who had his supporting cast ready to go before a dispute with the studio resulted in his departure also. In stepped J.J. Abrams, who faced the difficult task of reviewing the previous movies' vastly different tones in order to settle on which Ethan Hunt he wanted to bring to the screen. Quite wisely, he went for a bit of both. This was the intuitive, opportunistic Hunt from Brian De Palma's well-staged original, rather than the trigger-happy super-agent from John Woo's effort. Yet he still retains an edge, and Abrams sets out his movie's darker tone from the get-go, as we start during the third act with Hunt in precarious situation with Philip Seymour Hoffman's big bad.<br/><br/>Hunt (Tom Cruise) has left the IMF in favour of a normal life with his bride-to-be Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He has kept the extent of his work for the government quiet and seems to be enjoying being a regular Joe, but his head is soon turned when fellow IMF agent John Musgrave (Billy Crudup) contacts him regarding his former protegee, Lindsay Farris (Keri Russell), who has gone missing in the field while investigating an arms dealer named Owen Davian (Hoffman). Hunt accepts the job and assembles a team (consisting of the returning Ving Rhames, as well as Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q) to track her down, but when the mission goes spectacularly wrong, the group are left to track down an item known as the 'Rabbit's Foot', a device capable of global catastrophe. With the head of the IMF (Laurence Fishburne) breathing down his neck and Davian proving himself to be a ruthless and cunning foe, Hunt and the rest of his troupe face their most difficult task yet.<br/><br/>He may have been third choice (although he was cherry-picked by Cruise himself), but the then up-and-coming Abrams proved to be the perfect director to steer the series back on course without upsetting the tone. He finds a perfect balance, delivering spectacular set-pieces that Cruise is, as always, keen to sink his teeth into, as well as re-establishing the team element and tasking them with missions that require a combined effort, and not just Cruise blowing away bad guys in slow-motion. De Palma's original may have been spectacular on occasion, but this third instalment is probably the best of this opening trilogy. There is also an uncomfortable atmosphere throughout, and this is mainly down to Hoffman's spectacular turn as Davian. He is a one-note big bad, and hardly physically intimidating, yet Hoffman's dead-eyed delivery oozes menace, and when he threatens the lives of those closest to our hero, we completely accept that he's capable of butchering the innocent in his pursuit for riches and power. It's hardly new territory for the action genre, but Abrams should be credited with reinvigorating a franchise still going strong 22 years after it introduced itself."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>I am resuming my reviews of the Mission: Impossible franchise, anticipating the release of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which comes out a few days from now. My thoughts on Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II are already written, and you can click on the titles to read my reviews for those movies. After a massive decline in quality from M:I-1 to M:I-2, this third installment picks the saga back up!<br/><br/>There are a lot of aspects improved based on the previous films. First of all, the action. This might be THE movie where the stunt work really achieved jaw-dropping levels. From Cruise's epic runs throughout the streets of Shangai (just a single take!) to the astonishingly filmed money shots, J.J. Abrams makes an impressive debut since this was his first feature film. He knows how to incorporate the actors with the visual effects and this time everything looks incredibly realistic and riveting. This movie has the best action of the first three films, by far.<br/><br/>Second of all, the characters. J.J. Abrams brings back the original Ethan Hunt, the one that is not a copycat of James Bond (looking at you M:I-2). Everything about this character's arc makes sense, and his relationship with Julia provides some nail-biting suspenseful moments in the third act, where Michelle Monaghan also shines. Tom Cruise obviously continues to be the star of the franchise, but finally, there is a decent villain ...<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers an exceptional performance as the bad guy. That's just what he is: a bad guy. His character does not get any development, but Hoffman picks up his depthless script and surprisingly makes it work. He is the best villain in the franchise so far, and he is connected to the most suspenseful scene in the movie. Ving Rhames returns as Luther, as well as the character's humorous personality. With so much action and tense moments, it is a breath of relief to be able to smile or even laugh with Rhames' lines.<br/><br/>Third and final, the pacing. The second film is an ultimate bore. This one, I even understand people who say that it has too much action and it all comes too fast ... Because it does. The frenetic pacing from the first movie is back, and it goes up a gear or two. There is not a single moment to rest between scenes, and that might be an issue for some, but for me, I needed it after the tedious M:I-2. Dull moments are nonexistent, and the excitement is always at high levels. That is what I call entertainment!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it does has some flaws regarding the plot. Besides being very predictable, its structure bothers me a little. J.J. Abrams decides to begin the film with a scene that I don't really understand why he chose to put it there. I don't want to go into spoilers, but there are a couple of questionable decisions regarding the storyline that just don't quite make sense to me.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the story itself is pretty generic. The villain is only amazing due to Hoffman's performance since the script gives zero development. The plot twists are evident by the end of the first act, so they lose their impact towards the end. However, the thing that kind of ruined a perfect ending (still a great ending though) is how they handle Michelle's character. I will just say that it becomes too nonsensical and extremely forced, and Julia is the reason behind it.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, Mission: Impossible III brings the saga back to life with the best action of the entire franchise, some fantastic additions to its cast and a super exciting and riveting pacing. Tom Cruise provides some epic stunts, Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best villain so far, and Ving Rhames continues to be awesome. However, the plot is very generic, predictable and its structure makes some supposedly suspenseful scenes lose its emotional impact. It's a hair below M:I-1 but miles and miles above the awful M:I-2, thanks to J.J. Abrams incredible directorial debut, which is filled with phenomenal camera work, jaw-dropping stunts and a remarkable use of visual effects."

","This is so much better than the second film in the series, but it is still the second worst in the entire series. The film did not do all that well at the box office and I can see why that is the case. While the acting is good and a lot of the visuals are good, the action still was not all that great. The introduction to Pegg's character is not all that great considering how much he is in the series after this point and how good he is later on. In here, he just feels kind of forced in. Although it is nice to see Luthor have a big role. But the villain was just not interesting at all and because he was not interesting, the story is just weak and I don't really know what else to say to it besides just that."

","I was hesitant to see it because of how bad Mission Impossible 2 was, but I think it more than makes up for the 2nd flop and I would even argue that it's better than the first. The action really is non-stop, and there aren't any cheesy love scenes slowing anything down. The bad guy doesn't change every five minutes either. The plot moves quickly but it doesn't lose the audience at all. You don't need to have seen either of the first two to understand what is going on (I can't remember the plot from either). Lots of guns, loud explosions, cool gadgets and fun locations. I can remember on more than one occasion where the audience clapped or reacted to the action. It does everything an action movie should do very well. I would highly advise anyone who likes action movies to go see it. Even if you think Tom Cruise is a little insane, MI:III is extremely enjoyable."
"CinematicInceptions","6","0","0","24 August 2016"," Tried to overdo it and got a standard product.
","This wasn't a horrible movie, but it embodies a lot of the qualities that I dislike in action movies. All genres have equal potential for unique strengths and weaknesses, but MI3 definitely fell prey to most of the pitfalls. It looks nice and the action sequences are good, but it lacks in its story. I don't know who story artists think they're kidding when they jack up the suspense and the stakes when we already know that the hero's going to win in the end. It is possible to maintain this archetype but still have suspense if you make the central conflict something that could go a lot of ways, but this was not the case here.<br/><br/>The Rabbit's Foot plot motivator was okay for the situation. In some ways it was disappointing that it never got explained; the conversations surrounding it would have been more engaging if we knew what it was. But then again, it would probably have been a waste of time to tell us what it was. Plus, Ethan's real goal was Julia rather than anything involving the Rabbit's Foot. Besides, we are naturally more interested in the conflict between Davian and Ethan. <br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a decent performance, but I thought Davian was a little bit forced as a villain. His taking pleasure in other people's pain is something that is used a lot for villains, but his cruelty is never backed up by anything or given any kind of motive. Our protagonist Ethan presents problems as well. As an action hero he doesn't really need a strong motive, but he gets one in his wife Julia. I think the filmmakers were trying to make him more likable by having him get married instead of being a serial womanizer like James Bond. But their relationship feels static; I never got the sense that they knew each other that personally or intimately. In the end, all Julia really turns out to be is another damsel in distress. I actually kind of liked how Musgrave and Brassell (Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne) were incorporated. They had personality, some of which was stereotyped but much of it felt organic. Ethan's team wasn't great, particularly Benji.<br/><br/>The spy action sequences were a bit of a letdown for me, but they won't be for everyone. If you like seeing spy gadgets in action, there is a lot of that featured. But I enjoy more of the strategy and outsmarting the system kind of spy scenes, which there weren't that many of here. The action set pieces are very big and explosive, evoking excitement rather than character tension like one on one fights do.<br/><br/>So you're definitely in for a cool Mission Impossible, but probably not the best one. If you didn't like either of the first two, this isn't that similar to either of them, but I would say it's more like 2 than 1. If you don't mind a weak story or aren't that critical of a viewer, you'll probably enjoy this enough to watch the whole thing. If you are critical, there's a lot of problems to pick out: overly dramatic dialogue, a shaky storyline, C- dialogue, mediocre acting from big stars, and rather predictable twists that can insult your intelligence. Overall Rating: 6.9/10."
"Mr-Fusion","6","0","0","5 August 2016"," Business as usual
","Though it's a step up from the last one, ""Mission Impossible III"" relies on deception and the series' trademarks the most out of these movies; to middling effect. Cruise is surrounded by able players and the story does bend over backward to strike at the heart of Ethan Hunt's domestic bliss, but plot doesn't really matter so much as teasing us with whatever crazy stunt Cruise will do next (indeed, the unthinkable heist is this franchise's bread and butter). But in the end, everything else takes a backseat to the impossible feats and breakneck speed (Abrams' coked-up camera-work and cutting seem well-suited for this sort of dizzying spectacle). One you regain your senses, it's not bad, but also not the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Although, this is the best that this particular writing team has ever done.

"josephisuzu","10","0","0","2 November 2015"," Best of the series
","A ferocious, relentless, sugared up, ruthless, and unhinged piece of magic. This ""thing"" (honestly don't know what else to call it) doesn't even start. It just *is*, punching and kicking and shooting and running until the credits roll and the audience proceeds to run to their nearest garbage bin. So unrefined and yet so controlled, Mission: Impossible III is the equivalent to a neon fever dream that Alien from Spring Breakers probably would've had. It exists in its own singular universe, dropping the audience in with such unforgiving anguish and lost hope that the viewer can't even take their eyes off the screen. Not that the film is humorless, far from it, but the stakes are higher and the mood is grimmer, leading to a much more affecting conclusion than its predecessor.<br/><br/>The set-pieces, while less classical than in MI and less brilliantly idiotic in MI 2, carry significant weight, pushing Cruise to both his physical and psychological limit. His performance is unwavering in its power, and the opening sequence is a perfect example of his layered skills as an actor. And of course, the rest of the cast fits like a glove into either their new or returning roles. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in particular, is a powerhouse of a villain, even with nonexistent back story.<br/><br/>JJ Abram's direction is dynamic and hot-blooded in a way that recalls the thrillers of Brian De Palma, although it's much more messy in structure and composition. His camera moves through space and people like it's physically pushing bystanders aside, only contributing to the fierce tension throughout. Along with Daniel Mindel's cinematography (who is also shooting SW: Episode 7) and the flavorful editing by Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey, Mission: Impossible III is aggressive and searing in its vitality."
"rcolgan","6","0","0","14 September 2015"," What is the Rabbits Foot?
","For the third outing of the Mission Impossible franchise, JJ Abrams was bought in to bring cruise back for a new mission. Considering that he had already been creating television shows done with a cinematic budget to a cinematic quality like Lost and Alias, it made sense that he take on the reigns of the multi million dollar franchise. But whilst he is able to keep the franchise action packed, his style is unable to flourish the same way that Palma or Woo were able to in the previous films.<br/><br/>Some time after the second film, Hunt has decided to retire from active duty and is now training IMF agents. He also has new fiancée, forgetting Thandie Newton from Mission Impossible II, who is gone without explanation, and is now with a nurse named Julia (Michelle Monaghan). It's a situation similar to True Lies, with Cruise living a double life and his wife being entirely unaware of his life as a secret agent that Hunt has decided to leave in his past to be with her. But just like any other film about a retired agent, it's not long before Hunt has received a new self destructing message with a new mission which he chooses to accept, leading him to assemble a new team to save one of the agents he trained in the past. <br/><br/>And just like every Mission Impossible film, his mission inevitably goes wrong. Thus Hunt is plunged back into the life of a spy, having to take down brutal arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), save his wife to be, and track down the mysterious rabbit's foot. What exactly this rabbit foot is, we're never really told. It's a Macguffin in a similar vein to the likes of the suitcase in Pulp Fiction. It could some kind of toxin. Or it could be a doomsday device. But whatever it is, we know it's bad, and that if the villain gets his hand on it there will be trouble. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide just how high the stakes will be this time around. <br/><br/>As usual, Cruise is great as Hunt. He still has the American action hero charm mixed with some great stunt and physical work, with one stand out scene where he's sprinting through Shanghai at breakneck speeds. But as great as he is, Hoffman really steals the film as the psychotic arms dealer Owen Davian, who is throughout the film one of the most intimidating villains in a PG-13 movie. At the midpoint when he says to Cruise """"Do you have a wife? A girlfriend? Because if you do, I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna hurt her."" We believe him, since he really seems willing to do anything to get what he wants. The only downside to his character is that he does not get enough screen time. The film even pushes him out of the way for a while, instead focusing on the overused traitor from within the organisation cliché we've already seen in both of the previous films in the franchise. You'd really think by now IMF would keep a closer check on their agents.<br/><br/>Abrams is able to shoot a confident action sequence, however he doesn't make the same mark on the franchise that his predecessors did. Few blockbuster films have come anywhere near the nail biting suspense that De Palma was capable of in the first Mission: Impossible and nobody's ever done it in quite the same way. And love it or loath it, no director can make an action sequence quite as over the top as Woo with his explosive 20 minute finale. But with Abrams his style is less distinct. It looks just like every other action movie, which isn't necessarily bad, but doesn't leave the same mark that the first two films had. <br/><br/>Beyond this there's a certain repetitiveness to the sequences. There's only so many time you can watch the same high speed chases and good guys shooting bad guys before it can become boring. And whilst the locations change, throughout the film all the action sequences end up feeling largely similar. Whilst other spy franchises at the time like Bond and Bourne were starting to experiment with darker and more realistic film-making, Mission Impossible remained stuck in the same generic action that's been see many times before. It still lives up to basic expectations, but it never tries to exceed those expectations either and is instead just a very ordinary action movie."
"charliep14","6","0","0","10 August 2015"," Good but fairly standard
","Perhaps the race to more incredible stunts, more world threatening menaces is influencing our opinion of this movie in 2015 ; 9 years after its release, but the movie lacks a certain punch and weight. It's perfectly enjoyable, well put together and a couple of cool scenes are sure to be found but overall, it feels very forgettable. Another gripe with the movie: outside of Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames, the cast is very 'faceless' and also highly forgettable. Even Hoffman, who could have been the greatest villain ever, was not very convincing. What is good about the movie is the classic Impossible Mission stuff : the masks, the music, the ""Tom Cruise running"" scene is almost ludicrous but still highly enjoyable. Watch it if you like the series, you won't be disappointed but don't go out of your way to find it."

While at a party he receives an off the books mission to rescue an agent Lindsey Farris who was surveying an arms dealer named Owen Davian.<br/><br/>Compared with ""M:I 2"", this is a much better film that returns to the roots of what the series is all about while making things more personal for our main protagonist. The director this time is J.J. Abrams and in his feature film debut he breaths life into the franchise again and pays respect to the source material; focusing more on the team cloak and dagger dynamic of the franchise, injected with high octane summer action. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is great as always and he gives a much more vulnerable and human performance as Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames once again comes back as Luther Stickell and he is given much more to do in this film than in the last one. The dialogue he shares with Tom Cruise gives you the sense that these two have been friends for a long time and I've always liked the banter about how marriage doesn't go with these agent's line of work. Michelle Monaghan is Ethan's wife and she does a good job of playing the innocent civilian unaware of her spouse's true line of work. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman easily gives his best performance as Owen Davian who is one of the best villains of the series. He plays the character as completely ruthless and he has one of the best lines that pushes our hero over the edge. Laurence Fishburne is great as Ethan's boss in the film and Simon Pegg has a small role as Benji Dunn who offers insight on the ""Rabbit's Foot"" and some drool humor.(Pegg would reprise the role in the next film as a field agent.)<br/><br/>Huge improvement over the previous film and a fun summer action film 9/10"

","Mission: Impossible 3 (2006): Dir: J.J. Abrams / Cast: Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan, Ving Rhames, Keri Russell: Easily the best of the series with a rousing opening sequence that exceeds anything done in the previous two films. Tom Cruise returns as agent Ethan Hunt who is engaged but he doesn't reveal the nature of his work. His mission is to capture an arms dealer and the beauty of the screenplay is how this both works and backfires throwing many surprise turns along the way including a knockout conclusion. Director J.J. Abrams succeeds in humanizing the material as oppose to the nonsense of part 2. Cruise is at his best here because Hunt faces personal dilemmas regarding his work and personal life. Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the film as the villain who has Hunt's fiancé kidnapped in a scene that doubles back on itself. Michelle Monaghan is featured as Hunt's fiancé who struggles to understand Hunt's distant behaviour, but she will ultimately rise to the occasion when the stakes are high. Other roles are flat although Ving Rhames returns as part of Hunt's team as well as Keri Russell whom Hunt trained. While this is an improvement over the first two films, it is still a routine action film. It just happens to be more intelligent and much better written than the junk that proceeded it.

","It seems like Tom Cruise's been running all his life, or at least all this decade: ""Mission Impossible II"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Minority Report"", ""Collateral"", ""War of the Worlds""And if that's not enough running, you should watch him in this film, the latest installment of the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise directed by J.J. Abrams where he plays the known agent Ethan Hunt and has to take care of another mission; he doesn't stop. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is the creator of TV's top series ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", but it seems his creativity ends up just about there. He's the guy who has made watching television a cinematographic experience these last few years, but a TV series is TV in the end. Of course we don't want to accept the difference, because it looks amazing. Well, ""Mission Impossible III"" also looks amazing; but it looks like TV.<br/><br/>However, that's not really an important thing, because the difference between television and cinema is getting smaller by the day. The issue is that this last 'mission' doesn't work as a whole picture. It has happened that franchises are ruined after the first filmI'm just thinking ""Mission Impossible II"" shouldn't have been made. Yes, John Woo directed it and the great Hans Zimmer put his own touch to the great Danny Elfman's iconic score.<br/><br/>Now the prominent Michael Giacchino has given a new energy to the score and it sounds greatAnd so what? I wrote that this is the latest installment because you never know if there's going to be another one; and the truth is they could do it any day if they do it like this. It has come to the point that any excuse worth enough to generate fabulous action scenes serves as what we commonly know as a 'plot'. And there goes the rest; by this I mean Abrams and his writers' intelligence. <br/><br/>The way I see it, this could have been a great mini-series of four chapters. It has four breathtaking action scenes and each one could have been the thrill of each one of the episodes. This is why movies run for two hours nowadays: because of the long eventful action scenes. We get those in television tooBut Cruise had to do it big time; on the big screen.<br/><br/>How can the guy pull ""Collateral"" and ""Minority Report"" and then this? The latter ones are also action movies, and he runs, but he delivers good performances, unlike here. It is quite embarrassing to watch him confront Philip Seymour Hoffman, to whom all the credit goes for creating one of the most memorable villains in recent years. There's not a sign of something coming from a cartoon in his performance, which he builds with admirable composure. Beside him, Cruise looks like the robot Keanu Reeves is so used to play.<br/><br/>I can't count the number of the underused actors found in the rest of the ensemble; you should watch it for yourselves. By the way, Ethan Hunt doesn't die, but you already knew that. I mean; what would ""Die Hard"" be with a dead Bruce Willis?"

The mission turns out sour, and Hunt's private life is now on the line as he must protect his wife against a very nasty terrorist (played respectively by Michelle Monaghan and Philip Seymour Hoffmann - I'm sure by now you guessed how such a great cast agreed to star in such an original project...)<br/><br/>This first feature film from TV wonder boy JJ Abrams is a train wreck. How could studios execs be stupid enough to give $150 million to a beginner? This guy knows TV for sure, but he probably didn't understand that with so much money you can film action scenes without awkward zooms and irritating shaky camera - these are common TV techniques to hide the cheap scenery and boost the editing, which a big budget feature doesn't need if handled correctly. You hated M:I-2's slow-motion and doves? You'll hate even more this TV episode badly tailored for the big screen.<br/><br/>So, where did the money go? The answer is simple: since the director has no clue on what makes a good action scene, he relies on the special effects, like any other Hollywood hack. We're talking about Mission Impossible, a franchise whose staples are intricate and bold thefts, with the team breaking in and out enemy strongholds unnoticed. Here, Abrams thought it would be smarter to shoot useless and god awfully expensive action scenes in exotic locations. Like in a bad 90's James Bond. So, when the hero is setting an aforementioned bold theft in a heavily guarded Chinese building, Abrams cuts to a lame, clichéd dialogue between his sidekicks waiting in the minivan! Once Tom Cruise re-appears on screen, a pathetic car chase ensues, while the poor spectator is asking himself ""why in HELL did they chose not to film the goddamn hold up???""<br/><br/>Because they were too lazy to write and shoot what is the heart and soul of the series. Because it would have been too great an effort for the so-called writers to write anything original. The movie is such a rip-off of ""True Lies"" it's not even funny. European break-in: CHECK. Hero forced to collaborate with enemy: CHECK. Bridge attacked by jet fighter: CHECK. Daughter/wife in distress: CHECK. The list goes on and on... And don't expect any teamwork: Tom Cruise IS the star, and he wants everyone to know that. No one can shine except him. They're not allowed to.<br/><br/>Bottom line: avoid it, unless you have a knack for bad movies."

The movie to me was still enjoyable, even with the sneaking into the Vatican, the swinging from one skyscraper to another. It wasn't completely outlandish.<br/><br/>I wish Owen Davian had been shown to be a little more evil. It would have helped with the audience desire to see Ethan Hunt beat him at his own game. Also Hunt's side kicks needed to be developed more and been more involved with the action.<br/><br/>And I can't believe how little Kerri Russell was in this film considering when it was in theaters, she was out promoting it like she was the top female lead.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I think it is worth watching if you are looking for an action film."

"jonny_nut","6","0","0","26 January 2007"," Admissibly interesting story
","I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this film. As a movie that was supposed to follow in the footsteps of the ""Mission Impossible"" legacy, I was expecting high stakes, thrilling action and captivating drama. Instead, I was subjected to an admissibly interesting story with a straightforward plot and fairly exciting but not exceptionally great special effects.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the villain Owen Davian was probably the most impressive, but unfortunately not nearly as central to the story as it could have been. I was hoping to see more of Laurence Fishburne as well, but unfortunately his contribution to the plot remained mostly off-screen. The team of Ving Rhames, Jonathon Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q are great in their supporting roles, but again, their characters seem to be there for the sole purpose of giving a little bit of depth and variety to a one-man show.<br/><br/>If you're a big Tom Cruise fan, you'll probably enjoy his portrayal of Ethan Hunt as much as you would any of his other typically average characters, but don't expect an award winning performances like those in the early nineties (Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire). All-in-all, not a complete failure but definitely far from a hit. I give it a 6/10 and recommend it for when there's nothing better to watch."

","""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: J.J. Abrams <br/><br/>Starring: Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan, Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, Keri Russell, & Simon Pegg <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for intense sequences of frenetic violence and menace, disturbing images and some sensuality) <br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" was a sketchy project from the beginningso much so that I was beginning to doubt whether or not the movie would ever be made. David Fincher was first set to direct, but had to drop out to produce ""Lords of Dogtown"" (not the best career move on Fincher's part, if I do say so myself). Joe Carnahan was then slated to direct, but left the project and J.J. Abrams came onboard. Abrams did some cutting of his ownwith Carrie-Anne Moss's character (yes, the entire character was tossed out and Moss, unfortunately, went with it). Kenneth Branagh was cast as the movie's villain, but, after a series of delays, left to direct ""As You Like It"". Oh, and let's do not forget the much-publicized role of Scarlett Johansson who left the project. Days after her departure, rumors begin to swirl that Johansson left because of Tom Cruise pressing Scientology on her. After Cruise damaged his credibility (and lost many of his fans) in 2005 over his obsession with the controversial religion (and his attack on Brooke Shields and Matt Lauer), this only hurt the already crippled movie. But, Johansson denied the rumors and was replaced by Keri Russell. ""Mission: Impossible III"" gained praise from most critics, but was a disappointment at the box-officenot a disaster, but a disappointment. But, the question is: will ""Mission: Impossible III"" disappoint people who actually see it? <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has settled into a typical lifetypical as far as IMF agents go, of course. He has turned to training agents rather than being one and has settled down with the woman of his dreams, Julia (Monaghan). The only problem is that she has no idea what he really does for a livingand, now, the kidnapping of a young agent, Lindsey Farris (Russell), is forcing him back into the business. When a mission to rescue her does not go as plan, Ethan and his gang of agents begin a mission to apprehend sadistic arms leader, Owen Davian (Hoffman). This mission goes perfectlyuntil a traitor leads to Davian's escape. Now, Davian knows who Ethan is and is willing to do anything for revenge. Usually, by the third installment in any given franchise, the plot line is getting rather thin. Surprisingly, ""Mission: Impossible III"" has got the best plot out of all three films. I've seen the two previous installments countless times and I could definitely recount so many of the action scenesyet I cannot, for the life of me, remember any major plot details. They just were not that memorable for me. But, ""Mission: Impossible III"" corrects this, giving us a coherent (though, simplistic) plot and blending it with plenty of action and computer-generated effects.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" suffers from one huge problem and it only shows its ugly head at the very end. Throughout the movie, Ethan Hunt is searching for something called ""The Rabbit's Foot"". We know that it is very important and that it must be very dangerous (as the film's villain wants it so desperately), but, really, what is it? The movie never tells us and even has a scene that shrugs off the notion of giving us an explanation completely. Now, some people say that this is just the filmmakers wanting to leave a little mystery and some may even go as far as to say that it is supposed to represent Ethan not knowing what he was truly chasing afterbecause that it is how it really is for secret agents, but those explanations give the movie far too much credit. My assumption would be that the writer just couldn't come up with something to explain the Rabbit's Foot so they simply decided to ignore it altogether. This is a good example of lazy film-making. Fortunately for the filmmakers, they paid their dues in other places.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" is a great action moviethe perfect movie to capture the audiences of the big-budget summer action movies (surprisingly enough, it didn't capture them, but most of that can be attributed to Cruise's fiasco from 2005). The action scenes are, of course, the highlight and there are plenty of them. It seems as though every ten minutes we are seeing another car explode or a plane crash. The pacing is brisk and done flawlessly. I never felt bored, but I also never felt like I was being rushed along either. The performances are good enoughno matter what Tom Cruise haters will say. Cruise is, and always has been, a competent leading man. Michelle Monaghan also does a nice job as the woman who finally won Ethan Hunt's heart for good. And who could forget Philip Seymour Hoffman? The winner of the Oscar for ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"" last year nails his role here, as well. Hoffman is constantly showing his versatility as an actor. I still remember him as the quirky Dusty from ""Twister""--good times, good times. I'll be honest, I had a blast with ""Mission: Impossible III"". Sure, it didn't explain one of its major plot points, but it just blew up another car a few seconds later to take our mind off of it.<br/><br/>Final Thought: It isn't the brightest crayon in the box and doesn't explain everything it should, but it is paced perfectly and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)"
"Antagonisten","5","0","0","8 January 2007"," Improvement on the second movie
","The first Mission Impossible-movie with Tom Cruise was a pleasant surprise for me when i first saw it. The mood of the original series was decently preserved while it was still a modern movie. The second movie directed by John Woo was in my opinion a complete disaster. Woo is one of my favorite action directors normally, but he failed miserably there. The action scenes were awful, the story pathetic and the whole movie felt like anything but Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>So, brand new start with installment number three. Or at least that was what i hoped for, something more along the lines of the first movie. And was it? Well, both yes and no. The emphasis is still much on action scenes, but at least it's not as overstated and pathetically choreographed as in Mission Impossible 2. The story is somewhat better better in the third movie, and the action scenes are much improved. Also the balance between smartness and action is better with at least a little more agent-style scenes. So while it was an improvement there was still much i didn't like.<br/><br/>First of all, the idea in Mission Impossible was always solving things with your brain, not with guns. There is too much focus on the guns in this movie. I had also expected a lot more from Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy, he's definitely one of my favorite actors. But his part here doesn't really let him come into his own, although he is by far the best actor in this movie. Tom Cruise is what he is and he works OK without being brilliant, much like always. Another thing that bothered me is the plot-holes that keep appearing. Without saying too much it soon becomes impossible to trust anyone and everyone seems to get a hold of secret information very easily. That is always something i feel is very annoying, when the very organization the hero works for seems to be structured by and for imbeciles.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great improvement on the second installment, but that doesn't make this a great movie. I had hoped it would be more along the lines of the first film but the action is still the main thing here. Also the ""smart"" parts that are more Mission Impossible-like are not very good here. Many of them are just too unbelievable, others downright silly. It's a pretty entertaining ride while it lasts, but it leaves a pretty dull impression when the show's over. I give it a 5/10."

Tom Cruise doesn't disappoint and Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a wonderful villain. You know the kind you hate from start to finish. The ending does leave you wanting more, but the possibility for another sequel was mentioned. This is definitely a great addition to the series.

","Even though his private life has recently overshadowed his professional life, Tom Cruise is back with a vengeance as superhuman spy Ethan Hunt for the third outing of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series. When the road to a film's production has as many potholes as this one, viewers tend to be highly skeptical of the final product. Instead of becoming a half-rate sequel, ""Mission: Impossible III"" takes the best strengths of the ""M:I"" series, the panache of the James Bond series, character and story suggestions from the Bourne series, and rolls them all into a non-stop action thrill ride with a surprisingly discernible plot line.<br/><br/>Ethan heads back into action when an IMF agent goes missing, all the while attempting to keep his true profession secret from his girlfriend. He comes face-to-face, in more ways than one, with a highly calculating and clever adversary played with style by the dependable Philip Seymour Hoffman. His scenes are brief, but the impressions they leave on the film are immense. Nonetheless this is still a Tom Cruise vehicle, as shaped through the eyes of TV's J.J. Abrams. He may be raking in the gold with ""Lost"", but his directing chops for this sort of material comes straight from ""Alias"".<br/><br/>There were six years between the second and third ""Mission: Impossible"" films, and the resulting production was well worth the wait. It's an amazingly fast-paced, tightly edited, espionage thriller that skates from one smart set piece to the next with a little bit of class and a little bit of charm."

I also enjoyed the shots of Tom Cruise's wife/girl friend in her green T, jeans, and dripping in grease and sweat. Yum! But a good movie needs script, character development, and an element of suspense. This picture is too shallow to offer any of that.<br/><br/>Suspense does not come from holding a hand-held camera and shaking it to create lets-pretend tension. It does not come from blowing things up all over Rome and China. No, it comes from involvement with characters and their situation. Why should the audience care if the bad guy shoots Cruise's wife in the head? Sure, we all care about murder; but we don't know the person at all. If the so-called Rabbit's Foot is really so darn important, why not send James Bond for it? <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is America's top box office actor, but his audience deserves better. When I was 14, Hollywood made pictures that introduced young guys into the grown-up world --- and we loved it and benefited from it. Today's Hollywood wants to drag us all into the world of comic books and video games. There have been no good movies for two years now."

","Agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his Impossible Missions Force (IMF) are back, this time trying to take down a ruthless arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who kidnaps Hunt's fiancé (Michelle Monaghan), in an attempt to use that against him.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible was a good film that actually made the viewer think although the action was only mediocre. Mission: Impossible 2 was a textbook example of style over substance. There was plenty of eye candy and action scenes but everything else was very weak. Mission: Impossible 3 combines the strengths of the first two and it pays off. This latest installment is the best in the series. It offers plenty of action, suspense and thrills. Sure, the film isn't entirely original and there are a few corny moments but it's still a solid action film especially in a decade that hasn't really had a lot to offer from this genre.<br/><br/>The screenplay was an improvement over the second one yet it still had a feeling of ""been there, done that"". The whole mask twist actually worked again despite the repetitiveness of it. One thing that didn't work was the twist with the second bad guy being a member of I.M.F. They have already used this idea and using it again made the ending kind of weak. Also, the character was really lame and not very effective. The majority of the dialog was good except for some stupid one-liners but this is really just nitpicking and it didn't subtract from the quality of the movie. I really like the way director J.J. Abrams handled the pacing and action sequences. He started the film off with a bang and he never really let it slow down. He created many wonderful and entertaining scenes like the bridge scene and the sequence at The Vatican.<br/><br/>The acting was good and it marked an improvement over the second one. Tom Cruise was very good as Ethan Hunt. To put it mildly, he has generated a lot of negative press though he is still a terrific actor. Phillip Seymour Hoffman created a scary villain. He was effective without going over the top and he was a good match for Tom Cruise's character. Michelle Monaghan couldn't have been more boring. Also, her scary resemblance to Katie Holmes was a bit distracting and she was clearly a miscast. Her bland performance didn't hurt the film too much though. Kerri Russell was also a miscast. I didn't really buy her as an agent although she didn't get a lot of screen time. Both Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers gave okay performances though they didn't get a lot of screen time and their characters weren't developed very well. Lastly, Billy Crudup gave a mediocre performance, nothing special at all. Overall, I recommend checking out Mission Impossible 3. Once in awhile, a good entertaining film that doesn't require too much thought is what a person needs and this one fit's the bill. 8/10"
"vwmw","6","0","0","27 November 2006"," More in the spirit than MI2, but still not quite there.
","In the spirit of the original television series - and in a large part, the first movie - the ideal Mission Impossible movie should be a combination of the clockwork precision of a perfectly planned Rube Goldberg machine with the ensemble panache of a Magnificent Seven movie. Each character should be compelling and yet together they should fit into a beautifully complex machine whose purpose will only be revealed when complete. <br/><br/>Does this movie measure up to such a standard? <br/><br/>Definitely more so than the grotesquely over-the-top solo Tom Cruise outing Mission Impossible II (which tried all too hard to change the franchise into what it was never intended to be - a modern Bond movie), but still sadly deficient of the goal. Oddly enough, modern thievery movies like Ocean's Eleven succeed precisely where modern M:I films fail, and I'll say why. Director J.J.Abrams should understand this point well, being the creator of Alias - a spy franchise that prominently features complex ""Rambaldi"" devices as part of their plot. Sadly, even his effort here seems mediocre at best. <br/><br/>An analogy should illustrate my point: Imagine the perfectly constructed antique clockwork that should be the ideal Mission Impossible film. Each piece of the plot, each character, each discovery - all these work together, reinforce each other in resonant harmony towards a greater goal that necessarily involves each component part. Now, in comparison MI:III stands like a collection of wind-up toys (being each momentarily dazzling - but more often than not superfluous - action-spy sequence) tossed in a bucket together (the overall plot), rattling against one another until one is finally tossed out of the bucket (the climax). The secondary characters (and they are oh-so secondary) largely unoriginal - with the possible exception of Maggie Q's spystress Zhen Lei - in their creation, ripped out of previous Mission Impossible films and episodes of Alias. Am I the only person that didn't constantly see flashes of Alias everywhere in this film - especially in the resident Simon Pegg's (Shaun of the Dead, great cameo) techno-geek Benji vs. Kevin Weisman's Marshall? To top it off, the secondary characters are sadly underdeveloped and underutilized in exchange for Tom Cruise screen time. They never have the screen time to pick up ""cool"" factors of their own as in a Magnificent Seven film (or Ocean's Eleven), let alone unique personalities, or even well-defined roles to explain their individual functions in the spy group. The team members' functions are never completely clear-cut in this film whereas in the original series and the first film, each team member had a very specific function - as a specific cog in the mission, if you will - that they played out to the letter towards the greater goal of the overall mission plan. More often than not, most of the ""missions"" of this film had little planning at all - shocking for a MI film - and seemed more to be frenetic collections of things going wrong (which may or may not reflect the mentality of its star). The so-called ""ensemble"" action sequences - while more so than in MI:II - are so focused upon Tom Cruise's acrobatics that they are less so ensemble and more so ""Tom Cruise-support"". The Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt & Katie Holmes look-alike fiancée romantic subplot is both unnecessary and without enough substance to be even deserving of the moniker 'subplot'. It seems that the film is filled with failed flashback attempts at emotional expression. However, you never really know any of the characters well enough to feel any emotion, and none are adequately developed so as to be compelling. For the most part, the acting of the leads is as flat, cold, and unastounding as the spy roles they portray. There is simply a lack of recognition as to what is important in a MI film. Finally, events simply happen in this film like a mediocre video game - there is no mystery revealed, no conspiring of events, no overall culmination of plot, no build-up to the climax. It is ironic that amidst all this spectacular action, there is simply no suspense - dramatic or otherwise. It is all a wash of ephemeral flashes in which little, if anything, has genuine significance. <br/><br/>It is little wonder that an antique clockwork is infinitely more valuable than the bucket of wind-up toys. <br/><br/>A side note - I often get Billy Crudup (Musgrave) confused with Firefly's Sean Maher - went through the entire film thinking how nice it was to some of the Firefly cast getting new work. Another side note: incidentally, Maggie Q (or Maggie Quigley) is actually not Chinese at all in any part, but half Vietnamese and half Polish/Irish American, raised in Hawaii and having learned Cantonese in Hong Kong through modeling/acting roles there (some with Jackie Chan)."

","MI3 is another in the MI franchise that has many components of the previous MIs. Cruise does what he does best by running and jumping and smashing everything around him in an effort to save the girl and catch the bad guy. Cruise gets married and turns into an instructor but is drawn into a mission to save one of his trainees that got on over her head. Does he save here and get away? Cruise's wife knows nothing about his real job, and gets sucked into the story. Some good special effects and nice camera work with the same old dialog and menacing henchmen.

","SO glad I only borrowed the disc from my roommate, who had rented it. It's a shame because I really enjoyed MI2. Cruise is wooden and has that nutty glint in his eye most of the time. The premise, even as predictable as it was, would have been enjoyable had they taken the time to at least try and get the audience even a tiny bit invested in the characters. I love action movies, but this one is all fluff (explosions, fast driving etc.) and no heart. The movie moves SO quickly that you don't get a feel for the characters. I can suspend my disbelief in the silly things they expect a viewer to believe with regard to technology, but if I don't give a hoot about the characters and the story has been told a thousand times before (and better) why should I care about FX?"

Ethan Hunt is fighting a terrorist while also trying to save his girlfriend's life from the terrorist. He does everything he can to make sure that his girlfriend doesn't know what the truth is about his job. This movie is a real thrill ride from the beginning to the end, every moment keeps you in suspense. The story has you rivited from one moment to the next which is what the series is all about. Tom Cruise also does some totally amazing stunts in this one that really gives the movie a good steady push.If you are a fan of the series, this is definitely one to have in your collection.

","The third installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series is the first one I have actually seen. What drew my attention to this film was the name on the director's chair: J.J. Abrams. He is the man behind TV series ""Lost"", which creates enormous suspense, unseen on TV for a long time. What Abrams manages here is to give the movie a dark and uncompromising touch. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great in the scenes he's on, but he has too less screen time. Michelle Monaghan (or her role, this remains to be seen) is cute, but has no charisma at all (see: Katie Holmes, can that be a coincidence?) and Tom Cruise once again proves that he can't act (ok, I know that there've been some rare exceptions in the past). But being an action-flick, this doesn't really hurt the movie badly. Although ""Mission: Impossible III"" loses a little bit in the last third, the overall result for this in the action movie summer 2006 is slightly positive."

The movie also appeared to take place in our time period, yet there were several high tech devices that couldn't have possibly have been real.

","One might picture Ethan Hunt as the American version of James Bond, and they would probably be on the mark. We Americans always have to one-up anybody who tries to top us, of course. If the USSR has bigger missiles with higher yields of plutonium, then by God we'd better get some bigger ones ourselves! And if Ian Fleming's James Bond can out-maneuver the world's bad-guys every time, then by God we'd better find a hero of our own who can too! So The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) was created to the excitement of action film fans around the West. With it we got Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, VANILLA SKY), a kick-butt-and-take-no-names kinda guy who's out to save the world.<br/><br/>With the previous two Mission Impossible flicks, the focus was always on the action just for the sake of action. It was entertaining, but lacked the depth that we'd like to see from characters on occasion. So it is notable to mention that we get much more from Ethan Hunt in MI: III thanks to a love interest named Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY). That we have Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the bad guy, Owen Davian) also pumps up the character interactions to new and higher levels.<br/><br/>The story surrounds Ethan's retirement as an active member from the IMF. He's an instructor now who's forced back into service when he learns that his star pupil, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell, WE WERE SOLDIERS), has gone missing on a mission. She was tracking down the deadly Mr. Owen Davian (Hoffman). Back with his cadre of IMF members (including Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q) they locate Lindsey and pull her from the clutches of the evil doers, only to have her die in Ethan's arms. Now out for vengeance as much as to find Davian, Ethan and his folk track down the bad guy and stumble upon something called ""The Rabbit's Foot,"" a deadly item that is never fully explained (gotta give the writers/director credit here, as this wasn't what the movie was about, so the focus didn't need to be on another world-destroying virus or whatever it might've been). And when Davian kidnaps Ethan's girl Julia, Ethan must do double-duty as an agent and a man protecting the woman he loves (and recently, secretly, married).<br/><br/>Full of eye-popping stunts, shot on multiple continents, and loaded with great cars, boats, and beautiful people, MI: III has everything that the previous two Impossible films had. Except, as stated, this time we see more of Ethan's humanity. He's a husband now, a man in love who DOESN'T lose the wife just so, in the next film, he can meet the next Mission Impossible girl (i.e., Bond girl). So we have a departure from the norm, which was pretty refreshing. Not only does the audience get to see the action they're so accustomed to, they also get this bonus.<br/><br/>But one has to wonder if Ethan's wife might meet a deadly end if another Impossible movie is made. We can only hope that they won't fall into cliché-land. Let us pray!"

","If you edit out the sappy, feel good moments, you would have a movie that was a lot less annoying. Two scenes stood out the most for me: the corny wedding scene ripped off from Independence Day, and the ultra corny happy ending.

The more I recap this movie in my mind, the more I want to take my vote down another point. =)<br/><br/>The last action scene of the movie was the worst. Ethan's wife shocks him to death to save him from an implant in his brain, kills a couple of villains (her character works in the medical field, but for 60 seconds she takes out a couple of professional killers like she's Jason Bourne) then performs CPR on Ethan to the point of giving up, when he suddenly pops up off the floor. Didn't see that one coming. I have admit Phillip Seymore Hoffman's performance makes this movie watchable. I also enjoyed Simon Peggs small performance."
"oneloveall","6","0","0","5 November 2006"," A few wise choices elevates the mediocre franchise
","Clearly overstepping the predictable boundaries of previous installments, though not altogether triumphing, MI3 nonetheless turns out to be the most entertaining of the three for many reasons, though primarily for the casting of Phillip Hoffman as the villain, and the fluid, engaging direction by JJ Abrams. Essentially telling the same story for the third time, the less exciting original and ridiculously over the top sequel finally meets it's equilibrium in this third installation. Mainly the credit goes to Mr. Abrams for finally getting the tone right for the majority of the film. Displaying remarkable competence, Abrams few (though popular) television credentials still could not have predicted how well this director (and dabbler in all other departments) rose to the occasion for his massive big screen debut. Starting in atypical (though slowly becoming typical) fashion with the climax, the direction manages to stay involved throughout the briskly paced film, almost, but not quite, up until the end. It is only in those final minutes that the film resorts to archetypal fluff that will likely leave a bad taste in viewer's mouths who were appreciating the fresh pace. What really puts the icing on this action packed wallop however, is Hoffman's commanding take on what could only be characterized as a generic bad guy. In just about any other actors hands, this role would be left out to fester in the sun for the stereotypical writing that it is, but in Hoffman's interpretation, somehow the most generic of roles becomes a subtle revelation of classic Hollywood typecasts. Of course, the stunts are what fans want, and stunts they get..While nowhere in the league of the ludicrous stylings of MI2, the action here still manages to be as over the top as ever, Abrams merely opted to photograph and choreograph in a much more realistic fashion. Still nothing to rave about, MI3 does wrap up this trilogy with it's most engaging episode to date."

","After watching 25th Hour, Boogie Nights, Red Dragon, Capote, etc. it was clear to me that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was an actor worth watching no matter what movie he is in. Than when I found out he was going to be a villain in a Tom Cruise movie, I could only shake my head. Finally I put it on in the video store and was quite surprised.<br/><br/>I am actually not even a fan of the first Mission Impossible and did not even bother with the second one but I watched this one,just to see how Hoffman's chemistry was going to be with Cruise. For you Hoffman fans, he was good. Not Capote good but good. He seemed to play a different type of villain, not a typical one that you would see in other action movies. Even Cruise did not annoy me as much with his overacting. The only other movie I like from Cruise is Collateral (mainly because of Fox). Anyways, Cruise and Hoffman were great together.<br/><br/>The storyline was actually pretty well written and the special effects were good too. The main good attribute about this film was the fact it kept me in the storyline the whole movie. The two hours fly by. Probably one of the better thrillers I saw this year.<br/><br/>Overall I give the directing a 7, acting a 8, writing a 8, music a 6, and special effects a 8. Overall rating would be a 7.5.

It's standard fare all gussied up with clever stunts and computer animation.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise isn't my idea of an action hero. He's too short and not rugged enough. He was terrific as the creepy hit-man in ""Collateral,"" but he doesn't project as the larger than life character necessary for this type of film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the evil arms dealer, which is another stretch. Ving Rhames and Laurence Fishburne play minor parts in what amounts to casting overkill.<br/><br/>MI3 is decent entertainment and not the worst way to spend an evening, but if you're expecting to see acting that's above the cartoon character level, you'll be disappointed."

","Ethan(Tom Cruise, who puts in a demandingly physical performance)is retired from field work, engaged, and happy until he's called upon to rescue an operative he trained(Keri Russell)from an evil black market ""deliverer"", Owen Davian(Philip Seymour Hoffman, who makes a great villain within the screen time he's given). When that mission ends tragically, Ethan and his MI task force(consisting of one-two-three punch of Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, & Maggie Q)will join to try and stop Davian's selling of weaponry and other dangerous war toys to varying countries. Davian is a national threat to everyone and must be stopped. What Ethan doesn't know, however, is that someone within his own organization is partnering with Davian. What's even worse is that Ethan's beloved wife Julia(the delightful Michelle Monaghan)is in grave danger(as evident, it seems, in the opening harrowing sequence).<br/><br/>With seemingly insurmountable odds(the deck is indeed stacked), how will Ethan ever be able to not only Davian, but uncover a high-ranking suit in his own organization? And, is there any hope for Julia? The mysterious weapon Davian has stolen from him by Ethan and the gang is a suitcase housing some sort of nuclear weapon nicknamed the ""Rabbit's Foot."" This could've easily been titled, ""Run Tom Run"" because Cruise is constantly moving and film briskly follows him. JJ Abrams creates an energy in MI:III very akin to his ""Alias"" series where you never know who to trust and the camera never stops moving. The film feels a lot like ""Bourne Supremacy"" and is almost as fun. It has one of those endings, though, that doesn't quite match other inspiring action set-pieces such as the remarkable ""attack on the bridge"" sequence where Ethan and his crew are being shot at by a jet plane's missiles not to mention helicopter soldiers' machine guns. Also, the Shanghai sequence where Ethan uses a fulcrum to swing himself from one building to another and then parachuting from that building almost being hit by several vehicles is also a masterful highlight. The ending just seems rather uninspired next to those sequences.<br/><br/>This film, I'd have to say, is the most entertaining and energetic of the series. The cast is much more lively and the pacing which darts after the characters is almost exhausting."

","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III **** Improving sequel is taken by a different approach from director- co-writer J.J. Abrams and returning producer-star Tom Cruise and partner Paula Wagner. The story takes on more of 'The Bourne Identity' like, where we have Cruise's Ethan Hunt setting off on a rescue mission for the bulk of the story, and secret mission duties taking second priority. It is to say that this direction right away marks unchartered territory for the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise, making this movie potentially enjoyable as something slightly different. There are break points within the CIA, as some of its affiliated characters aren't whom they appear to be, and Ethan Hunt seeming more emotionally distressed than coolly confident. After rescuing a fellow CIA agent who had been held captive by an evil arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman, sensationally sinister), our crack secret agent has to call on his team of agents to rescue Hoffman's next victim from a dreadful fate. After weighing out the comparisons, I found this sequel to be remarkably satisfying."

"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","0","0","17 October 2006"," All Quiet on the M-I-Action Front, but...
","Actually, that is not true at all. The ACTION is a superb extravaganza of adrenaline-pumping, breakneck-speed shake-cam vigour  a shamelessly elaborate model kit assimilated from other movies to provide non-stop thrills en masse. But the story behind the action is the same old riff: when super-sadistic über-villain (Philip Seymour Hoffman) kidnaps someone close to our hero Ethan Hunt (the Cruise), he is forced out of his peaceful retirement to turn back to his violent agent ways... one last time. <br/><br/>This super-villain is international information- and arms dealer Owen Davain and this 'close someone' is none other than Ethan's fiancée Julia (played by next big thing: Michelle Monaghan). M-I-3 thus sees its usually assured agent centre Hunt in a rare vulnerable and human mode which we got a taste of in Woo's M-I-2 when, er, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED to Thandie Newton. Monaghan is sweeter, more innocent, a nurse, and thereby more effective in the damsel-in-distress position. What is more is that she is blissfully ignorant of Ethan's job, which he actively keeps a secret to her. The film goes to great lengths to instill the 'promising family' image in our love couple with kisses and romantic glances but with the sense of impending doom.<br/><br/>Corny love story aside, the real good news is that director J.J. Abrams (of ""Lost"" creation) has inexplicably relegated the would-be-ridiculous IMF-trained agent vs. fat guy conflict to an ultimate showdown status. Perhaps this success can best be attributed to Hoffman who effortlessly interweaves his character with a most quiet, calculating lethality. Aside from the Hoff, this installment also boasts of a wide-ranging variety of eccentric supporting actors such as Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, Keri Russell, Billy Crudup, Simon Pegg, Laurence Fishburne and the mandatory no-nonsense fellow IMF-agent Ving Rhames  nearly all of which are fun to watch, even though a few of the women tip over into clichéd ""tough-chick"" territory.<br/><br/>But these characters are a mere window-dressing for a sandbox of action with acrobatic narrative à la Abrams who opens the film with the last climactic scene and interjects introspective flashbacks to keep us on our toes, Lost-style. The script offers new imaginative ways to off people, the most prominent of which being an internally detonating explosive device. Another being a nifty little patch that can suck the life out of you. Undoubtedly, gadget-junkies will cream their pants over the relentless stimulation of high-tech gadgets, weapons and explosions. All of this regrettably elicits more raised eyebrows rather than applause but it keeps up the fast, crisp pace for nearly two hours.<br/><br/>Lastly, what of the Cruise? He plays Ethan with more fierce intensity than ever and his perpetually peppy-looking expression is positively glowing with emotion. Creepy? Yes. Effective? Yes.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible III is the very essence of a manipulative film because it dishes out so much action that it leaves no time at all to reflect on the quality of thw whole thing. The primarily shortcomings are appropriately disguised in a fast-paced entertaining little thing but dissect it, even a little, and it mostly falls apart. There is infinitely more substance than in the second Woo-installment but is it good substance? Not quite. I am therefore completely torn between the grade 6 and 7 here, so imagine it as 6.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","""There is a point where bold becomes stupid."" Ving Rhames's character Luthor speaks these words and couldn't be more right. Just by looking at the evolution of the Mission Impossible series, one can see a bold example of cerebral storytelling shot by virtuoso Brian De Palma and a cold, mechanical showing, of a really stupid haircut, filmed by John Woo, who still hasn't matched the brilliance of his final Hong Kong piece Hard Boiled stateside. Mission Impossible III definitely could have fallen in either campmy thoughts leaned towards stupid however, thanks, I'm sure in no small part to J.J. Abrams, we are given an enjoyable piece of popcorn action infused with just the right amount of heart.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film incarnation, which had multiple characters backseat-bound to the intricate story, and the second, a vanity project with everything on the periphery of Tom Cruise as an expendable device, we are now given a look into what makes the characters who they are and allow us to have an emotional tie to them, while still being treated with some high-powered eye-candy. There is a definite comparison to Abrams's TV show ""Lost"" as the story is shot with a few flashbacks to help show the audience exposition. We aren't treated like babies and fed with an update on where the characters have been at the beginning. Instead we are thrown right into the struggle before being jarred into the past to see how we arrived at that point. Abrams seems a master at character development in as few words as possible. He needs only one sentence to explain the past life of Michelle Monaghan's Jules at an early engagement party scene. We don't even need to be told what she does for a living because Ethan will visit her at the hospital. Is she a doctor or nurse? It doesn't matter, she helps people and that itself adds to her character.<br/><br/>Superb acting is shown along with the elaborate, non-stop action. Besides Cruise, who does all he is asked, everyone is given a secondary role that they run with. No one seems on the fringe and all are integral to the plot. Monaghan does a good job of being the love interest who is not frail and defenselessknown by the basejumping she was doing when she met Hunt, this fearlessness helps the audience accept what her character is asked to do towards the endand builds upon her resume after a nice turn in last year's grossly overlooked Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang; Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Rhames play the action heroes to perfection, exuding kidlike glee upon accomplishing an impossible task; Billy Crupup gives a nice understated performance as Ethan's contact at the agency; and Laurence Fishburne infuses some welcome straightfaced sarcasm. Not surprisingly, Philip Seymour Hoffman is also fantastic as the villain, adding credibility to a film that needed it after the debacle that was MI:II. The best, however, is scenestealing Simon Pegg, who is so funny he reminded me of how much I loved Shaun of the Dead and am anticipating the forthcoming Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible III delivers on the action as promised, but also shows heart. Everything is done for love and that really does help us follow the journey and feel for these people as they try to juggle saving the world along with saving their home."
"rparham","7","0","0","21 July 2006"," Accepting this Mission is fun
","To find a sequel that is the equal, or even superior, to the original is almost unheard of in movies. A second sequel that is not a precipitous drop in quality from the first two is a near impossibility (although summer 2006 has already bucked that curve once with X-Men: The Last Stand). So imagine the surprise when Mission: Impossible III proves to be the strongest entry in that series to date. By no means any masterpiece, complete with it's share of flaws, M:I III nonetheless proves an enjoyable action romp for it's two hour running time.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has left field duty in the IMF to train incoming recruits and is preparing to marry Julia (Michelle Monaghan) when an agent he trained, Farris (Keri Russell), is kidnapped and tortured while trailing a black-market arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Hunt leads the rescue mission, complete with fellow returning team member Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames), and the outcome of that operation leads to a plan to kidnap Davian himself before he can complete his next major arms transaction, involving something called the Rabbit's Foot.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III is not the most original of concoctions. The film at times plays like a mixture of the first two films, hitting similar beats in both (double-crossing, agents on the run from their own agency, outrageous action set-pieces), but director J.J. Abrams, executive producer of television's current mega-hit Lost, manages to assemble everything in an entertaining package. For one, the film scales back the over-the-top nature of M:I 2, which was a John Woo super-action fantasy, bringing down the number of times the audience is liable to stare wild-eyed at the film with incredulity. He and screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman also do a good job of managing to integrate the team-based mentality of the original series that was somewhat missing from both the first and second films. For the first time, the secondary players, especially Rhames, feel like they have more than just walk on roles. Sure, the film won't win any awards for character development, but at least the rest of the IMF squad proves to be more than background window dressing for once.<br/><br/>Fans of the original series may still be a little disappointed that M:I III is a bit more of an action movie than the original series ever was. Mission: Impossible always was a guessing game, twisting labyrinthine plots to confound an opponent to eventually steal something or obtain information. Here, it's more about suiting up with a whole lot of guns and fighting your way clear of the bad guys. Even so, M: I III emulates the original series better than either of the first two films, and when it does go into full action-film mode, it delivers entertaining action. The set-pieces are more involving than most in an action film for some time, and you can find yourself getting caught up in the events on screen more often than not. Some of that is due to the fact that M:I III has a bit more depth to it than the first two films. Ethan Hunt is still a bit of a cipher, there isn't a tremendous amount to him, but his relationship with Julia humanizes him a bit more than in previous films. Their relationship is a few notches below convincing; they have some nice scenes together, but there isn't enough screen time for it to get us quite as attached to them as the film would like, but there is more to it than Ethan and Nyah's affair in M:I 2, which for a high-octane summer blockbuster is surprising.<br/><br/>One of M:I III's strongest assets is Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of Davian. Even with limited screen time, Hoffman manages to create a despicable villain you are thoroughly disgusted with. He gives Davian such an air of malicious self-centeredness (he arranges for the deaths of untold hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions, yet he is outraged by Hunt's persecution of him) that you can't wait to see his come-uppance. The rest of the cast is capable, and Cruise is strong as usual. His personal life has turned audiences away from him to some degree, yet if you can ignore the baggage he brings, he still a more than capable performer. Ving Rhames is given the most to do in any of the Mission: Impossible films to date, and his scenes with Cruise where they have the appearance of a friendship occasionally makes you wish the Mission: Impossible films were a little more consistent and had managed to develop this relationship in previous films. Here it feels, perhaps not tacked on, but a bit out of left field.<br/><br/>M:I III does manage to fall into the trap of many modern films in the last several years in that it must involve a ""twist"" to it's plot. Surprise twists are not a bad thing, but they have become such a stock element in recent years as to become expected and you end up spending your time searching out the film for clues as to what the twist will be, and usually the filmmakers telegraph it far in advance. Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman are a little better at managing this aspect than other movies, but even so, it would occasionally be nice to see a film play straight with it's audience, or at least cover it's tracks a little better.<br/><br/>Still, all things being even, M:I III is an enjoyable entertainment that does it's job of providing appropriate excitement for it's running length and not leaving too much disappointment in it's wake. It won't take the world by storm, but not every film has to. If the filmmakers could manage to make another entry as entertaining as this one, an M:I IV wouldn't be a bad prospect."

","I loved the old Mission Impossible TV series, and was so disappointed in the first two movies that I probably would not have seen this one if my partner hadn't wanted to go. Action movies are okay, but I prefer them to have plot and humor (True Lies, The Rock, etc).<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this movie is the first 5 minutes. Before the opening credits, we see Ethan handcuffed to a chair while the bad guy (played wonderfully by Philip Seymour Hoffman) threatens to kill a woman who clearly matters to Ethan. He gets to 10 and shoots her in the head. Okay, now we can jump back in time and tell the story.<br/><br/>I found myself thinking repeatedly throughout the movie that I'd be a lot more engaged if I didn't know that we were working toward that scene. We know Ethan's not going to drop Davian out of the plane -- he has to survive for that later scene. There's no suspense when Ethan tries to get to Julia before she's kidnapped -- we *know* they're going to succeed in picking her up.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of big action sequences, by all means go to see this film. But if you like your action to come with actual character development, intelligence, and a bit of real suspense, don't bother."

","I saw 'MI:3' on Saturday night. On Sunday morning I had to ask my wife what movie we'd seen. Maybe I'm getting old and the grey cells are fading fast. Or maybe 'MI:3' simply has all the nutritional value of a drive-thru Big Mac.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams can do the whole government conspiracy/black-ops thing in his sleep. He created 'Alias' after all, which is really just a modern day Mission Impossible anyway, with the same globe trotting story lines, double agents and cunning disguises that Peter Graves used to contend with. He also created 'Lost', which simply transplants the complexities of cold-war political chicanery to a tropical island. J.J. Abrams is the reigning King of the super-spy genre.<br/><br/>So it comes as no surprise that 'MI:3' is a deft mix of all the very best genre clichés culled from John Le Carre, James Bond, and, of course, the original TV series. Personally, however, I got the distinct impression that I'd seen it all before. The fact that the cause of all this drama, the preposterously named 'Rabbit's Foot', is never explained, is a frustrating example of a modern Hitchcockian 'mcguffin' if ever there was one. Most of the characters are poorly written, possessing motivation that stretches even the thread-thin plausibility of the genre, with Billy Crudupp in particular, being unable to explain why he's doing what he's doing.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm asking too much to expect any degree of logic in a movie such as this. But when I see government agents blowing up a bridge packed with civilian witnesses I can't help but role my eyes in disbelief. Are we really expected to believe that those people aren't filming the whole thing on their cell-phones and sending the pictures to CNN before the last helicopter has disappeared over the horizon? <br/><br/>The fluff is, without a doubt, crafted with great expertise. Everything looks beautiful, the CGI is top-notch, and a certain level of suspense is maintained. It's enjoyable and the two hours fly by effortlessly. But in all honesty, it's as light as air and instantly forgettable."

","Mission 3 follows the old format: well planned and executed missions, impersonations and lots of, sometimes faked, foreign locations. There are many plot twists and double crossing treacheries in the story, keeping the audience in suspense for much of the film. Tom Cruise is tiring and even pathetic at times even though he can still carry a big film like this. The girlfriends of his romantic interest says at one point that she haven't been able to find the perfect man until now. I am sure that is how he sees himself. The romantic interest looks very much like Katie Holmes. Since he is also the Executive Producer I am sure he chose her for that quality. The technical errors in this are a few too many for me to enjoy myself. There are tracking dots with accuracy in the inches range (where is the battery?). There are cell phones that go in and out of coverage in opportune (for the plot writers) moments and voice emulators that need 30 seconds to compile a whole persona.

I think that the casting was very good for this movie. It seems that Ethan Hunt genuinely cares for his ""wife"" and his wife cares for him. One thing that took off 2 stars (out of 10) was the explosive charge that the enemies put in his head. I thought that this was a definite blunder.

","Better than the 2nd, that's for sure (and not really hard) but it doesn't stand out as the ""best action movie in years"" and here is why (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!) <br/><br/>1) These spies were the most stupid ""secret agents"" EVER. What were they thinking yelling each other's TRUE identities all over the place?! The agent they wanted to save in the beginning screamed ""Ethan!"" more than once, then Ethan followed by yelling ""Declan!"" at his driver, ""Luther"" was yelled at one point and Luther himself yelled ""ETHAN"" several times during their interrogation of Davian in the helicopter, which ended with Davian calling him ""Ethan"" while suspenseful music played - *Shock* GASP, how did he EVER find out that Ethan was Ethan when everybody was calling him that all the time? Some twist. I shudder to think of this man's ability as a man who has ears...and has no scruples to USE them. How frightening.<br/><br/>2) The Rabbit's foot issue: Not only did we never find out what the heck it is supposed to be or what it would do at all, but we never saw HOW the hell he got it! After they made such a big deal out of this mission to be so tough and dangerous to pull off that it would make the Langley coup (from the first mission) look like a walk in the park, this was a huge let-down. I love the action scenes going to that though, but it just wasn't enough to satisfy expectations towards a SPY movie that promised to be more ""story"" (therefor: suspense!!) oriented than action-paced. Mission: NOT accomplished. Sorry.<br/><br/>3) The ""romance"" between Ethan and Julia fell flat on me. It reminded me of the Holmes-Cruise one (not only because Michelle remarkably resembles Katie) but they even copied some real-life issue: How they came together remains a mystery.(And don't give me that ""Lake Wanaka or whatever"" that was just a place to run into each other, like bumping into a guy after leaving the bathroom in a theme park. It's not enough to build a relationship on it) It just didn't do it for me and I found their scenes utterly boring and slow. The wedding as an answer to her question ""Is this real?"" was a little 'wtf', that is not even possible at such a speed. No license, no mention to anyone but that priest (who was conveniently at the place at night! What, did somebody need the ""last rite""?!, how wonderful for him to switch from sad to happy event in one single night, huh?!) However, this left a bitter taste in my mouth. I know it was supposed to be romantic and sweet but to me it just looked ridiculous and out of place.<br/><br/>4) The shot-in-the-head scene of a certain person. Now I don't know about you guys, but I always thought, that when a bullet enters a human head, it would cause some kind of wound. This person looked like just having lost consciousness (or was so bored by the toy gun ""threat"" that she just fell asleep in relief once the ""loud sound"" gave her the cue. Cheap cope-out and that in a 150 million dollar budget. *sigh* <br/><br/>5) The CPR scene was executed simply laughable. We are supposed to believe that this woman is a nurse? Then shouldn't she know that it's not possible to tickle a person back into life?! The ""pressure"" she used on his chest was that of a cat jumping in somebody's lap. I know that you can't really do REAL CPR on a person who is still alive, but if ""Emergency Room"" and co. can pull the pretending off believable enough, one would think that a BIG BUDGET Hollywood MOVIE would be able to do that, too. Gosh, I've seen ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" doing better CPR than this person who was sold to us as some nurse and they didn't have the budget these guys had. It would have been enough for a High School play, but as a scene here: It blew.<br/><br/>As an action film: it was okay and had some really nice stunt work to enjoy watching. For Cruise fans, who are mostly interested in watching him doing stunts and looking young, this is definitely worth watching. But for people who watch it for the story, it's disappointing.<br/><br/>The only thing that made it better than the 2nd was, that Ethan Hunt wasn't the invincible ""James Bond meets The Matrix"" than the John Woo crap-fest from 2000 had been, but it still remains some ""Action: with no story"" that the former big screen Mission Impossibles have been."

And I must say, the heroine angle was ludicrous! I mean I can understand the need to be different from Bond and therefore the need for Hunt to actually commit to a woman, but Monaghan is too saccharine sweet and Jamie Lee Curtis did a better job of playing the dumb wife of a double agent in True Lies. Maggie Q - ah - she has something to DO in the movie! Overall, it's cool to watch if you have nothing to kill your time.

","If you like action then you will like this, but if you appreciate any sort of plot then you might just have a hollow laugh.<br/><br/>In the same vein as the '24' series, Cruise has a ludicrously small amount of time in which to achieve more than one impossible task. He is indestructible.<br/><br/>However it is not clear why he does any of these things. We know there is something very dangerous 'a Rabbit's Foot' and an ultra baddie to be dealt with, but at the end of the film we still do not know much more about these things - and find at the end that we don't really care either. Anyway - he was never going to fail was he? So we have just a sequence of actions that do nothing much to stir the blood as we are given no connection to the characters or their reasons. This is less than a Bond film and might as well be a Superman or Batman one. But I remember the original Mission Impossible TV series to be far more believable, the tension to be greater, the gadgets and action to be far more ingenuous and less reliant on guns. Maybe this is just the imperfection of memory, but at least that is how I would like Mission Impossible to be.<br/><br/>On a particular point I object to its use of Shanghai as pure backdrop. In fact Cruise's fall from the high building is truly impossible as the building is in LuJiaZhui in PuDong, east of the HuangPu that divides the city, but he hits the ground in PuXi (Yan'An Road?), west of the river. But that is detail, and maybe we shouldn't be worried about such petty detail in a film that suspends belief everywhere else.<br/><br/>So at the end - there is no point at all to watch this movie. It is purely cinematic wallpaper, eye candy for grown infants."

","First let me say I have not seen either ""Lost"" or ""Alias."" I've caught maybe a total of five minutes of both shows on the telly. However, that doesn't mean I am not a fan of J.J. Abrams. ""Joy Ride"" (2001), which he co-wrote, is one of my favorite actions films. It's just a lot of fun.<br/><br/>And that's what seems to be lacking in ""Mission: Impossible III."" True, the story isn't as cryptic as Brian De Palma's first film in this series, but that really doesn't mean anything to this film. The story apparently just serves as a means to get from one explosion to another. In fact, you could switch the special effects action sequences around and it would not matter a whit.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Tom Cruise's irritating behavior played a part in how people viewed this film. But Ethan Hunt's just not an interesting person anymore. As a plus, this film does have some stellar supporting players. Philip Seymour Hoffman relishes his role as the despicable Owen Davian. Too bad Abrams didn't see fit to give him more screen time and also provide Owen more time with Ethan. If you really want to see what a poor actor Cruise is, watch Ethan's scenes with Owen. Hoffman makes it look so easy. He acts circles around Cruise and you're awfully tempted to root for Owen against an incredibly dull and tepid Ethan.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan is, in my opinion, a wonderful actress. But she's truly just window dressing here, a reason for Cruise to get all intense. You want to see what Monaghan really can do? Watch her in ""Winter Solstice"" (2004) or, better yet, in last year's ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.""<br/><br/>There is a good cast - too good, in fact, for this film - peppered throughout - Ving Rhames, Keri Russell, a very sexy Maggie Q, Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Simon Pegg and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. But their roles are relegated to less than minor and they're given little or nothing to work with. This is a Tom Cruise picture - make no mistake about that. Of course, if Cruise were smart, he would've allowed the other, more talented, actors to play bigger roles. <br/><br/>The film's biggest disappointment is that the action sequences have no zip. They're simply one loud explosion after another. There's no fun in them, nothing crazily giddy about them. And they're not inventive. Watch what Shane Black did with ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" and you realize how much fun action sequences can be. But Abrams lacks Black's cleverness and wit. There's nothing cheeky here; everything is handled too seriously. Someone forgot they were making a summer action film.<br/><br/>I don't doubt Abrams' talent. I now just wonder how impressive this film would've been under Joe Carnahan's guidance."

","Yes, Mission: Impossible III may seem like repeat of previous plots, gadgets and effects, nevertheless, it is entertaining as any successful Hollywood action movie. It is quite a decent production that gives you your money's worth, including location filming abroad in Rome, Italy, and Shanghai, China. The ensemble supporting cast attracted me to see it on ""The Da Vinci Code"" opening Friday. There's Philip Seymour Hoffman (from 'Capote' to big screen villain), Laurence Fishburne (current success with 'Akeelah and the Bee'), Billy Crudup (not being seen lately), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (another clean-cut looking role fresh from 'Match Point') and Maggie Q (from her Hong Kong fame), and Ving Rhames encore and maestro Lalo Schifrin's staple MI theme. I was satisfied with (TV series 'Lost and 'Alias' fame) writer-director J.J. Abrams' first commercial feature fare with superstar Tom Cruise leading both in acting and producing. The score from Michael Giacchino ('The Family Stone') provided the right tempo to the plot stages.<br/><br/>The repeat of elements from previous installments rather enhanced the enjoyment of the segments presented here in M:I-3. Maggie Q likened to Kristin Scott Thomas' role in M:I-1, with collaborating operations behind the scenes nearby directing her moves; the donning of facial mask (M:I-2) gave it more fun and tension here with mirror double effect. The Rome street scene between Rhys Meyers and Cruise feigning in Italian arguing amidst traffic somehow brought smiles of brief flashes of Dan Brown's ""Angels and Demons"" and touches of the mini-Coopers in ""The Italian Job."" The 'fulcrum pendulum' scene sort of reminds me of Brosnan's last 007 outing. The premise of Ethan Hunt trying not to let his fiancée know of his true identity/profession almost brings to mind how Schwarzenegger did very well with Jamie Lee Curtis in James Cameron's fun and adventurous ""True Lies"" circa 1994. In summary, M:I-3 fits the bill of an exciting action flick without high expectations of anything more than that."

","It was C Day at my local Cinemax, which means any screening on that day, costed 2, so I saw Mission Impossible 3. I have to say I was somewhat impressed. Not only does it feel like those good old 80's/90's action movies and it also looks very similar to the TV show. However, there are a few flaws that rank the movie as nothing more then an OK action movie. Mission Impossible 3 stars Tom Cruise once again has Ethan Hunt return from retirement after one of his partners has been kidnapped by a ruthless Black Market dealer. Ving Rhames returns once again and Maggie Q debuts on this big action movie. The score is impressive, though I left the room before I heard Kayne West's song(never liked him). Tom Cruise himself features as a team player and the team element was rigth on the money(something that lacked in MI2, which reduced the saga into a very poor man's version of James Bond). What's wrong about the movie? Michelle Monaghan and Philip Seymor Hoffman are terribly miscast, for example. Monaghan has an expression and eyes that look completely dead(also the same look throughout the entire movie), devoid of any human emotions and tends to overact, you will actually get a chuckle from her expressions in the movie(was Rachel McAdams too busy). Oscar winner Hoffman does no better as a villain in role which could have been played by anyone. While a story is simple and straightforward, it lacks originality, feeling a lot like a rehash of M:I's story and True Lies. You'll see the plot twists coming a mile away if you know any of these movies. Also some stunts are impossible to do, seems like they were taking cues from The Transporter. Said stunts like some of the shooting scenes and helicopter chase are confusing and are rather enerving. It's one of the better action movies to come out in recent times, definitely better then the bore fest known as Mr and Mrs Smith, the ridiculous xXx 2: State of the Union and the horrible Alone in the Dark."

","Overall, the film was enjoyable, because the action sequences are well exectued and pulse-pounding (as expected), but when the story gets down to, well, the story the film falters.<br/><br/>A few comments: The characters deserved more development. For example, it was very difficult for me to care about Hunt's wife, Julia, because she has so little screen time. Julia is supposed to be a normal, likable ""girl-next-door"" type, but she's so average that she becomes bland and ultimately succumbs to being nothing but Cruise arm-candy.<br/><br/>Normally, I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He's a talented actor, but the script gives him very little to work with, except when he's threatening Ethan Hunt, but even then even Hoffman seems to struggle, because there's very little in the plot that might motivate him. It's too bad really, because given the right script Hoffman is always great.<br/><br/>Lastly, it's a shame that the plot was so overly simplified. The whole point of the Mission Impossible franchise is that the plot is supposed to be rich with twists and turns of espionage, but this version of the film dumbs it down so much that we don't even know what the rabbit's foot is! Sure, the first Mission Impossible had a plot that was IMPOSSIBLE to understand, but really, people don't just want thrill rides when they see a movie--they need some substance to back up all that style, and definitely more than the TOM CRUISE PERSONA to keep the film afloat.<br/><br/>See it if you've got nothing better to do, but otherwise wait till DVD."

I saw MI:II because John Woo (Hard Boiled, anyone?) directed it. It was another tolerable action flick with better, Woo-ed up moves. I saw MI:III, despite the star going insane, because JJ Abrams (ALIAS back when it was good, LOST) directed it. And?<br/><br/>MI:III is ALIAS-back-when-it-was-good The Movie. Alias started out as a great show, an intelligent serial thriller whose influence is felt on all dramas to this day, and then...then the intelligence just vanished the INSTANT JJ Abrams left to create LOST. Like the show, MI:III has Greg Grunberg in a cameo, focuses more on the spy's fake cover story, gives the spy a fiancé' to start out with so there's something at stake, uses the phrase ""wheels up,"" satellite picture technology of the same caliber as in Alias, the foreign languages to compliment the disguises, and even has Keri Russell from Abram's first (and only bad) work ""Felicity."" Heck, it even starts in Media Res like half the Alias episodes. I mean, it's like Abrams wrote out an Alias movie but couldn't get it financed, so he just switched the character names when he got offered directorship of this franchise.<br/><br/>This is a good thing, because like I said, Alias-back-then was awesome. MI:III is less awesome because it's all been done before, but still a functional plot skeleton for the action scenes. The fact that the whole perfect-masks from MI:II has been reused is a bad thing, because it's a bad gimmick, but at least here the gimmick is better justified because the team has to pull a whole mission to get the mask data before they can use it. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the fact that there are team missions instead of solo ops makes it closer to the Mission Impossible show than the first two movies, although it's far closer still to the Alias show.<br/><br/>And that's what it's all about, isn't it? There's only Sex and Violence in this world, sexy violence and violent, violent sex, so why not enjoy them? Helicopters explode like it's their purpose in life, punches get traded for kicks, a few jet-launched missiles juggle cars. It moves fast, little wasted time. That said, JJ Abrams can do better in terms of story and characters, I've seen it. MI:III is entertaining enough if you don't demand a Fight Club-level plot from your movies.<br/><br/>And as a kung fu-film fan, I don't."

Nice directing it had but everything else was something like ""blow up the theater and audience to blind their eyes"".<br/><br/>Comparing to first one, Brian De Palma directing, third one got lot closer to that like you probably guessed.<br/><br/>My opinion is that M:I:III is not truly M:I at all. It's interesting, OK directing, OK acting.. but not M:I. Nice to watch, but sad there still isn't that original surprise feeling. I think same thing was with the first one, though better but He would never leave his men behind for money.<br/><br/>The movie itself is good and interesting. For M:I fans it's like seeing to the future of Ethan Hunt. Nobody lives forever, right? Still I didn't quite get any character out of Mister Hunt, Tom Cruise -smile was there yes (god bless not more than that) but couldn't get any picture of it.<br/><br/>Action, OK/good directing, basic plot or less, nice acting, enjoyable. Can't really say more of this. Didn't make me sick, worth of watching. 7/10. If you liked first one this is probably forth of spending time few hours."

","Mission Impossible 3 is a nice way to start off your summer movie going.Though it is over the top and unbelievable it's extremely fun and absolutely action packed.Tom Cruise,Laurence Fishourne,and Philip Seymore Hoffman all give great performances as does Keri Russell.The stunts are wacky and at some times cheesy but enough to keep you entertained.The storyline is actually easy to follow unlike the first two and is far better in acting,action,and dialog.More of a popcorn flick for most but action fans will definitely enjoy MI3.This is a lot like the first two so if you liked them and you liked stuff like Transporter 1 and 2,XXX,XXX:2,James Bond,or anything with secret agents equipped with neat gadgets and a bunch of guns than your mission is to see this film."

","I liked the movie but that's probably because I'm easily pleased. <br/><br/>But anyway, could anyone tell me what kind of drone that was? I get the feeling that they simply came up with their own and modeled it after the Predator B, or the Global Hawk. I saw a few major similarities between the one in the movie and the two I just mentioned. <br/><br/>The similarities I found were: 1. The movie drone, the Predator and the Global Hawk all have very long wing spans. 2. The movie drone, the Predator B (not A) and the Global Hawk all have 2 upward, diagonal tail fins. 3. The movie drone and the Global Hawk have jet engines. 4. The movie drone looked like it had the ""bulb"" nose (where the cockpit would normally be) and the Predator B also has a ""bulb"" nose. (The Global Hawk has more of a swan like shaped front).<br/><br/>One major difference I saw was that I thought I saw a frame where they changed the drones flight pattern by using something that looked like a PDA. The Predator is flown via a Ground Control Station. I don't know what tool they use to fly the Global Hawk but I assume it's similar to the Predator's GCS, although it is completely autonomous. So the PDA idea may be feasible, I guess.<br/><br/>What do you guys think?"

","Fun and fast paced, MI3 is the most enjoyable film in the series. The movie is visually stimulating, well edited, beautifully photographed and has a constant succession of explosions, chases and gunfights. It's very impressive and like a Bond film on steroids. You will be entertained if you can block out the ridiculous and implausible aspects of the plot.<br/><br/>Tom(Ethan Hunt) has retired from active service and spends his time training new agents. During his engagement party he is recruited to rescue a former protégé held hostage in Berlin. The Dr. Evil character (Philip Seymour Hoffman)is working with terrorists and trying to destroy the world. We never find out how. There are plot twists and misunderstandings and Hunt is mistakenly thought to be one of the bad guys and has to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>Action movies like MI3 operate in their own parallel universe where Cruise's character can seem almost like a superhero. Hunt's agency, the preposterously named Impossible Mission Force (IMF) is impressively, high-tech and is able to find its quarry, quickly and efficiently. The baddies are evil, sadistic and cartoonish. The IMF seems to exist to stage heists and capture super criminals. The team is less geeky this time out. In some ways I was reminded of Team America: World Police. A very enjoyable movie."

","What a funny film. For one thing, when you've got Ving Rhames asking Tom Cruise, ""so did you sleep with your little sister,"" one can't help but like the filmmakers are playing some weird games with the whole Cruise/Holmes unpleasantness (for the record, Cruise never answers the question). There are a whole host of problems with this film, most of which revolve around the notion that Cruise is primarily motivated by these two women whom we hardly ever see on screen, and in the case of the more clearly romantic relationship, what we do see inspires little more than a feeling that it'd be better if we got back to the action.<br/><br/>And yet maybe the ""motivation"" bit worked as well as it was supposed to, because after some long stretches of boredom in the first half, I found myself a bit more caught up the closer we got to the end. I don't really know if that was because of the story, or just because the setpieces were more exciting. What I did find fascinating was that someone thought you could actually wring some suspense from ""will Tom Cruise be successfully resuscitated?"" I mean, seriously guys? Of course, one can always hope to be proved wrong!"

","Very disappointing. The action scenes (90% of the movie) were so exaggerated that I couldn't suspend enough disbelieve to enjoy them.<br/><br/>As in previous MI films, I left the theater trying to figure out the plot. The people you thought were bad guys all the way through the film are suddenly good guys at the end without clear explanation. And the major plot element (the rabbit's foot) was never explained.<br/><br/>It looked like when they got into post-production they realized they had only bad takes of some vital scenes, so they just left them out! I wish I'd stayed home and read a book.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed this film for more moments than either MI 1 or MI 2. Tom Cruise's character was more human and realistic (except for the impossible stunts) than in the first two films."

","Ethan Hunt has finally settled down with his soon to be married girlfriend. When he is told that his former trainee is in trouble he decides to go on a rescue mission to help save her. Unfortunately she dies during the rescue and Hunt is on the ""hunt"" for the man responsible for her death, which leads him into a tangled web of deceit and a dangerous weapon known as the RABBITS FOOT.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is the creative mind behind such hits as Alias and Lost. Both of which have a massive cult following. Now Abrams takes his stab at the big screen with the third installment in the spy franchise Mission:Impossible. Abrams take on the franchise is leaps and bounds over what Woo offered, but falls short of De Palma's original. Abrams goes heavy on the action and lite on the spy. <br/><br/>Some may think that Woo destroyed the series, I don't think this is true, but nevertheless, Abrams is trying to revive it by kicking it into overdrive. While watching MI:III, I kept asking myself, is this suppose to be a spy flick? Every single movie in this series differs from the other, even if Abrams does take notes from both. Mission Impossible is a good way to start the summer blockbuster movies, but one would of expecting a little bit more from it's hype.<br/><br/>First of all, it does have a lot of action. This is a perfect example for edge of your seat entertainment. The action never lets up, and it's actually enjoyable to watch. The bridge scene was impressive, but you can tell right away that the entire scene plays like an episode out of Alias. For some reason Abrams always must have the transportation vehicle get attacked for the person inside of it. Can we get another way of getting this person Abrams?<br/><br/>Cruise manages to keep his cool in this movie, I was surprised that he didn't start killing people in the name of Scientology. With the help of the supporting actors, the cast makes MI:III somewhat believable, but what's with the lack of Hoffman? Abrams, you have a good actor in your back pocket, he gives you a great performance, as usual in Hoffman's case, but you use him for 15 to 20 minutes. The film also under uses Fishburn and Pegg, who is the comedic relief. <br/><br/>What's the Rabbits foot? We're never told, or seem to care either. PLot twists, yes, but why? The film would have made more sense if it just stuck with it's basic course, does every film need to throw in a twist to shock the viewer? A bomb inserted in the head? Even if it was written before Alias, we see used in Alias before, so we basically know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>Abrams does showcase some talent, and he can only improve. With more concentration on his characters then he can surly become one of the heavy hitters in Hollywood. Abrams has a keen eye for action and pulls out all the stops here. MI:III is a good start for action movies, it sets the bar for others to follow. If you're able to leave your brain at the door and sit through some bad dialogue, such as Humpty Dumpty Sat On A Wall...then enjoy a great action movie."

","Saw MI -III today. Well that's 2 hours of my life gone forever. The first and second had a modicum of charm but this, oh god this.. Much has been made of the emotional quotient TC to his friends, Tom Cruise to me, shows in this film. Whoopee do!! It gives him a reason to get teary eyed every couple of minutes. Reminds me of William Hurt in that film about newscasters who could cry on demand.... And so it goes with Tom. He plays cocky too well but give him emotional? His wife in this looks identical to his real one, sans the pregnancy pillow/bump that was used. I had to wait till the credits to find out it wasn't her. <br/><br/>PSH or as I like to call him Phil Seymour Hoffman is a different matter. My god this guy gives gravitas and power. Even though it's popcorn he's a magical brooding presence. A Donald Sutherland or Christopher Plummer (two overused and underrated magicians) of the future. <br/><br/>Story is basically baddie wants to get some Asterix like potion to sell to some other bad guys and tom/ethan's got to save the world.Does he? I won't spoil that for you.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams directed this and it shows. TMA.(Or as Ken Levine would say TOO MANY AIRDUCTS!) As a big screen blockbuster at times it has a claustrophobic, televisual feel to it. And the editing. Around the World in eighty days did it more elegantly. We don't need to see the passport check in but come on...<br/><br/>The publicity extravaganza @ this has been intense and I can see why; if you make enough noise, they will come. But only once.

"benturkalj","6","0","0","18 May 2006"," Reasonable effort, but still forgettable
","Mission Impossible three offers a reasonable number of thrills, some great acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman as usual, a lot of ridiculous running sequences from Tom Cruise, and is fairly fun.<br/><br/>Plotwise, it follows the same conventions pretty much of the second flick: There's an issue with something in the wrong Hands, and a team has to save the day. It offers a fairly decent amount of cool stunts, with some clear references to 'True Lies' and 'Speed'. Strangely though, it was not really the action sequences that I enjoyed the most in this film: any part with Hoffman in it was simply awesome to watch. I really think he carried the movie with his abiities to play a cold blooded killer, though it was a real shame that we didn't see more of it.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film is mostly let down by a ridiculous love story angle, and way too many scenes involving Tom Cruise running like a maniac, but it was still decent entertainment.<br/><br/>I still put this on a par with the second film, and the original definitely wins out over this one because it's sense of suspense. See it for fun, but don't expect too much."

","The plot could not have been any more generic. At times it's not even remotely plausible/logical. The story ""twists"" are mostly excuses for having Tom Cruise running and jumping in different locales. Indeed, as if the movie mocks itself for being nothing more than a showcase of a series of action sequences, the audience is deliberately not told what the all-important canister that has caused so many lives and so much anxiety is actually for -- even right at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>But hey, it's still a very entertaining movie. The whole movie is filled with action. It feels much shorter than its actual running time.<br/><br/>Yes it's true that the movie doesn't bring much new to the table. By today's lofty standard, the movie cannot be considered as slick. But to me, the counteracting factor is Tom Cruise's give-all performance. At least on screen, he worked harder in this movie than in any other movies. There are a couple of scenes where Tom Cruise is even doing some Jackie Chan-style stunts.<br/><br/>Well, just keep your eyes open but switch off your brain. What's on the screen would likely keep you entertained."
"MrSharma","7","0","0","17 May 2006"," Explosive...maybe too much so
","Over the previous decade we have seen the emergence of the ""Mission Impossible"" Franchise - kept alive by Tom Cruise's charisma more than anything else. With any public consent he may have had previously, it's pretty much non-existent now, so if people are going to see this film than they're most likely going to gain something, or see some form of merit. For most people, Tom Cruise just doesn't do it anymore.<br/><br/>That being said, JJ Abrams (Hollywood's IT boy at the moment, although a clearly and unashamedly commercially driven one at that) brings something new to this franchise - instead of intelligence, we are faced with explosions. I think the nature of this movie is summed up very easily by one of the first action sequences we see in the movie, where IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is sent to find and re-obtain a captured agent, conveniently being held hostage in some military facility. In the first film, de Palma would have given us ten minutes of planning, of figuring out the strategic weaknesses of the facility, and would have presented the use of stealth in obtaining the package. Instead, Abrams just catapaults us into explosions, as Ethan's crew literally bomb the facility as Ethan runs in and gets the girl.<br/><br/>And that's exactly the problem -- the whole movie is literally non-stop action. There is not enough room to breathe. After an action scene, most people would like at least ten minutes of discussion, or some form of drama, rather than a lead-on to the next action scene. Thus, it doesn't seem that we're really involved in the story. That being said, the scenes themselves are quite breathtaking. Unbelievable, yes, but breathtaking. Personally, I don't like the direction this franchise is heading, but for those morons who don't feel the necessity to be respected during a movie, then this is probably for you.<br/><br/>Marketing pitches from Cruise and Abrams that this movie is in any way a presentation of a love story is an absolute joke, and all scenes that were attempted at conveying some drama were cheesy, unrealistic, completely over-directed and unintentionally funny to the audience. Cheesy dialogue and editing made the attempted drama more humorous than intended.<br/><br/>The throw in of a twist at the end seemed to fulfill no purpose other than for Abrams to convey some form of intelligence, which is rare, considering that the 2 hours prior to the twist attempts no intelligence whatsoever.<br/><br/>Some extra cast members fulfill no real purpose, and at the end of the experience we're left thinking what we really got out of watching this movie. However, it's an explosive ride, and one worth taking, but don't expect this to really last long -- think Bad Boys 2. This is not so much a cohesive film as it is a bunch of well choreographed action scenes with no real (or realistically engaging) plot - hence, the film will die quickly, as people can get over action scenes but will never got over a really engaging story that will question them following the experience of watching the movie. Of course, that's not what the film was going for, but its disappointing nonetheless to see that intelligence is overshadowed for commercial incentives - a concept, I feel, very VERY representative of the entire film industry at the moment.<br/><br/>Cruise doesn't bring any real depth to the film, although Hoffman as the bad guy is pretty cool. Considering he was really the only capable actor in the film (Cruise was, once upon a time, a star, but now has re-hashed the exact same thing in Minority Report, War of the Worlds, and this), Hoffman should have been shown more. He seems like an engaging character, and not enough was shown of him.<br/><br/>All in all, for what it was going for, MI3 does decently. It will never live on, but will make a lot of money immediately. The film proves Cruise has finally found his penache (something non-existent for any really talented actor), but you'll get over it quickly -- attempts at drama were laughable, and I hope this film isn't a representation of the way this franchise is heading."
"MrGKB","6","0","0","16 May 2006"," Forgettable bang-bang should spell end of the franchise...
","...or at least we may all hope so.<br/><br/>This one ended up being the second half of an unplanned double feature, the first half being ""Poseidon."" I'm almost sorry to say that ""Poseidon"" was the more entertaining of the two, despite the opposite opinions of IMDb voters, who seem to exhibit typical IMDb reactions to the film, i.e. the older they are, the less they liked it. That's true of ""Poseidon"" as well, of course, but the situation seems more attenuated with ""MI-3."" Regardless, I'm hoping that this will mark the end of the franchise, which was never all that much shakes in the first place, despite the star wattage of Tom Cruise and Co. The TV show, though popular, never pretended to be anything more than clever fantasy (I've always loved those fake faces they'd use, as if no one could tell the difference), and the films made no serious attempt to alter the situation. They didn't label things ""Impossible"" for nothing.<br/><br/>As I said, this was the second half of an impromptu double feature, and it failed to keep my interest successfully. Perhaps I'd already been brainwiped by ""Poseidon,"" but I think it had more to do with the seen-it-all-before plot. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a nice turn as a coldblooded dirtbag, but it's no real stretch for him, and Cruise is...well, Cruise. I liked him better in ""War of the Worlds,"" and he didn't do much of anything he hasn't done before in that, either. His love interest (Keri Russell) is a virtual cipher, and his obligatory supporting castmates (Ving Rhames, Lawrence Fishburne--looking very bloated, Billy Crudup, and others, particularly a mostly superfluous Simon Pegg) all do the MI thing with competence, but none of it adds up to much more than an excuse for elaborate, unbelievable stunts. I found myself nodding off at several points in the film, which is not a good sign.<br/><br/>If I'd seen this one first, I might have enjoyed it more, but alas, ""Poseidon"" drained me of most of my thriller endurance. I'll give it another shot on DVD (maybe), but I can't recommend ""Mission Impossible 3"" to any but the usual assortment of popcorn movie junkies. It's shot well, it's staged well, and it wears its budget with pride, but ""MI-3"" is just as instantaneously forgettable as ""Poseidon,"" and lacks the geek factor of watching a large ocean liner capsize and slowly sink, killing hundreds of people. Sorry, Tom, but you've been upstaged by a boat."

","The smartest decision made in Hollywood in recent years (by Cruise?) has been the constant redefinition of Mission: Impossible as a series (lets not call it a franchise - an uglier term than which I don't know). First de Palma, then Woo, and now, improbably, Abrams. They almost seem to represent the three essences - mind, body, and spirit, in that order.<br/><br/>With de Palma, it was all coolly cerebral game playing, a blockbuster that made you work hard to untangle the plot and dispatched likable minor characters with the icy demeanour of a sniper. It had lengthy tracking shots, a camera that passed through walls, and three big set pieces that unspooled with clockwork precision.<br/><br/>With Woo, it was sensual - never mind the plot, feel the heat of the explosions, hear the growl of the engines, watch some of the most impossibly beautiful destruction ever filmed unfold like a painting in motion. The epic female vocals reinforced the point.<br/><br/>With Abrams, it's all about the emotions. He could no more treat his characters with De Palma's olympian disdain then he could slave them to Woo's visual flair. These characters bleed when they get hurt.<br/><br/>When, in the best action sequence of the film, a bridge comes under attack, the viewer isn't simply swept up in the excitement - in the back of the mind lingers the understanding that the balance of power is changing, that a character who was formerly safe is about to become a target - and that we've been told what will happen to her long in advance. An early sacrifice ensures that we're not certain that any character is safe - any of them could go, at any time. For once, we care enough for this to matter.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best screen villain I've seen in a long time - he feels genuinely threatening; simply by uttering the hero's name he changes the entire tenor of the film, makes it queasy with unease.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan is great in what seems to be a small part; she gets to be the action girl at the end, which may feel a little unlikely but suits the film entirely (and it's nice to see Tom Cruise step aside a little to let his co-stars shine in moments like this - the unspeakably cool Maggie Q benefits in particular).<br/><br/>Other wonderful bits include Simon Pegg's scary-funny monologue, and Cruise's fake enthusiasm for traffic at the beginning - 'it's like a living organism!' He comes across like a real human being for the first time in a long time.<br/><br/>This has been the most under-rated, underestimated series in modern American cinema - by turns smart, overwhelming and now moving. The action film has long been a tired genre, but these three films have helped to wake it up just a little."

","Although I'd consider myself a minor fan of the jolt-action genre, the Mission: Impossible series have always had some sort of affect on me. I'll admit that the second part was not that great, I had to watch the third since JJ Abrams was the director. Being a typical 'Lost' fan, I was actually quite impressed with Mission: Impossible III.<br/><br/>Paying homage to the genius that is 'Lost,' JJ Abrams found a way to not only team up with his 'Alias' partner to write the screenplay, but also throw constant action in our face that not only had us on the edge of our seats but intricately wove together a more deep encounter that made me always wonder: What next! Mission: Impossible III explores the never ending work of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) who now has to face a much more villainous weapons provider super-creepy antagonist (Seymour Hoffman). Althuogh this time around, Ethan has to protect his identity not only from the whole world but also from the closest thing to him: his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I was expecting yet another eye-candy, in-your-face, ""edge of the seat"" thriller, but what I got was a roller-coaster ride that just seemed to never slow down! Tom Cruise delivers an actually very good performance, as a daring super-spy who undergoes an impossible task, risking not only his and his partners' lives, but also his fiancé's. Almost each scene in the movie jets out a nerve wracking frenzy, this isn't your typical car exploding, plane chasing, run for your life movie, and though all of those things are present, Abrams finds a way to have multiple things happening in one scene. When Ethan and his team attempts to escape the chasing plane at the beginning of the movie, the hostage (Russell) screams in agony while an explosive chip is implanted in her head, and as the plane is crashing into this never-ending thrill ride, we see that there is humanity in the characters.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty complex and you have to pay close attention to follow through. Even with Cruise's inability to follow his mission due to personal problems, we see the drive in his character and the undertone of trust that occurs throughout.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely a 'pop-corn' flick, but I'd say it's much more than that. I'd say to some extent, M:I3 is an extremely fun, complex, beautifully directed movie.<br/><br/>Kudos Abrams!"

It was a pretty unusual scene to leave as is.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup & Phillip Seymour Hoffman from ""Almost Famous,"" re-join as powerhouse actors in this movie. As typical of this genre, there are good guys vs the ""bad guys."" Hoffman WAS the bad guy. Real bad, hope I never see that kinda bad, bad.

I've IMDb'd it, & it was Simon Pegg - star of Shaun Of The Dead. Oh! Now I remember! This is a powerhouse cast of actors. Not a bad seed in the lot. Ving Rhames and Laurence Fishburne have longer lists of credits than Cruise! Maggie Q as 'Zen' was notable, she held her own in a testosterone filled cast lineup. Hope to see her in more movies.<br/><br/>Don't know what all the fuss is about Tom Cruise, and this being a sinking ship year for him. Last year's offering, ""The War Of The Worlds,"" was a terrible movie. Terrible script. Terrible everything. Don't base your opinion of this Cruise movie from his last one. Mission Impossible III is very, very good. Cruise does an excellent job as lead actor in it.<br/><br/>My only critique of him, is his trademark way of showing intense emotion. By whispering. A. La. William. Shatner. But he does that in every movie. <br/><br/>This movie isn't a dud. I was surprised that it was so good. Go see this movie! The theatre I saw it in had all age demographics sitting there to watch it. There wasn't the usual rude people in there. You know. The ones that gather to: yak about knitting, gossip, answer their business cell phones, or giggle because THAT boy (or girl) was over there. Nor were there any seat kickers. I'm sure the gross ones were there. Their shoes experience: sidewalk spit, dog pooh or gardening manure every week. The same ones that hang them over the seats in front of them. But there was so much action on screen, they didn't keep them up for long. The sign of a good movie.<br/><br/>For the record, I do have adhd. I wasn't cured, but have better days than others. Some things are capable of holding my attention. This movie is one of them. It's action packed, did I mention that?! Don't compare this movie to War Of The Worlds. Nor the idiotic media that have nothing better to do than be legal or illegal Peeping (on) Toms. Remember, those celebrity magazines are made up crap to make money.

The Woman Ethan loves in peril and he needs to save. If possible story wise, this movie would had made a better 2 and 2 would have made a better 3. The geographical locations and the operations at each place greatly aided in keeping the movie interesting.<br/><br/>Cruise was Cruise so you know what you get there. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great bad guy, but they did not let him flesh out the badness. His character was a little too matter of fact. As he is, he still was the best bad guy of the series. He did a lot with the little he had. Keri Russell was believable as an action character and with the characters' relationship set-up with Ethan, they could have done more with Keri Russell's character in terms of adding action/story. Michelle Monaghan did well and performed probably the most impossible stunt in the movie by trusting her man at times when it was obvious that everything about him was a lie.

","There's no doubt there are no limits for the imagination. As time goes by we see very well elaborated scripts making whole audiences take deep breaths in movie theatres. Actors have been paid millions to take part in great stories and very high budget productions. Seeing monsters, outer space battles, highly advanced weapons and fast and complex car pursuits is very common nowadays. <br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III is one of these works. Tom Cruise and his crew (for he is one of the producers)get involved in this that is probably one of the best (when it comes to special effects at least) movies of 2006. It's about two hours of the finest action scenes and we just don't realise such a long time runs outside the cinema. ""Mission: impossible"" is your attempt to take your eyes off the screen such are fights, shots, running and explosions that illustrate the film. Really, a high recommended option for the whole family."

","Review Massive Spoiler Alert, do not read if you don't want to know what happens!<br/><br/>It starts with a flash-forward in the middle of the action. Ethan cries out in pain and the villain tells him that he has just been implanted an explosive charge in his head. Our hero is bound and helpless pleading for his wife (sitting opposite of him, bound and gagged and with a gun to her head) not to be shot, while the one holding the gun keeps asking him about a ""rabbit's foot"" and threatens to shoot at the count of 10. The numbers are counted and our hero gets more and more desperate as the villain seems not willing to negotiate as our hero insists on having delivered the ""rabbit's foot"" already and asks if the villain wanted something else. The villain is not happy, counts up to 10..... and we go into...<br/><br/>Flashback to the party at Ethans home where he celebrates his engagement to his girlfriend (Julia) with some friends, until an old friend from his former life as active IMF agent calls him out to meet with him. He tells him about a trainee of Ethans being kidnapped during fieldwork and asks him to rescue her. Ethan is hesitant at first but eventually commits himself to the job, he gets a team at his side and they discover where the trainee is being held captive, succeed in rescuing her and try to bring her home. It turns out that the trainee has an explosive charge in her head and before they can discharge it, it goes off and kills the trainee on the helicopter home.<br/><br/>This puts Ethan in the game as he is more than eager to get back at the guy that killed his favorite trainee. Unfortunaly is the villain smarter than him (or has just better friends!) and kidnaps Ethans wife to force him to bring the ""Rabbit's foot"" along in order to save her life. <br/><br/>We never get to see the heist scene (They could have dropped another very cheesy- other scene and put that in instead) but there is lots of action to make up for it and really liked it. <br/><br/>Just for clarification: The plot is, someone in the IMF plays wrong and wants a war between Middle East and the US, so to get that he wants to give the US a reason to attack them. How to do that? Right, provide a weapon of massive destruction and hush about the origin. So, Davian is hired to sell that stuff, Ethan is forced to play along and deliver the goods to Davian and the inside mole kills both and gets rich. Right?! Well...find out for yourself. It's a fun ride, that's for sure."

I mean you shouldn't have that, why? because it is a waste of time. We are talking about action movie and not drama.

Except Mr. Tom Cruise himself, the rest have pathetic acting skills especially the Chinese character. I mean no harm but myself is Chinese and why she speaks English not mandarin? Let Ethan and the rest of the team talk to her with mandarin. Isn't that more fun? (I thought spy can understand and speak many languages. MI3 spies can speak Italian and some European languages and it is so strange that they can't speak Mandarin which is widely spoken around the world, i think it the second beside English, this story is weak from this point of view) I still enjoy the first installment from Mr. Brian DePalma.

"BZ_Dude","7","0","0","14 May 2006"," Fuses the good things from the first two and leaves out the bad....mostly.
","Just finished watching this movie and I feel bittersweet about it.<br/><br/>I (unlike many people) actually enjoyed the first Mission. I liked the complicated plot twists, the subtle but stylish aura and the teamwork involved in executing the assignment. I (like most people) hated the second Mission because they threw out all of what made the first one good and left me with over-the-top, gratuitous action. So I entered the third Mission, hoping for something better than the second but did not have my hopes up.<br/><br/>I must tell you, I was very satisfied while I watched this. The filmmakers did the right thing by taking what was good from the two previous Missions, and fused them together to established a nice, healthy balance in this third installment. There was the plot twists and turns and the double-crossings as you might expect, but not done in an overly complicated matter. It was paced nicely such that most people can catch on and follow. It once again brought back the team element of the first and the stylish execution of the missions that we were accustomed to. And it complimented this with a healthy dose of action that was typical of movies of this nature but without getting too ridiculous. Add in a nice mix of the exotic settings of Europe and Asia, scattered injections of humor, slick directing and quality acting, and you have a pleasantly entertaining movie that would satisfy both the mindless and the intellectual. These good elements co-existed in the movie. It was doing very well...<br/><br/>*** SPOILER WARNING ***<br/><br/>...then they shredded that balance in the final act. The movie completely goes off track with a final scene that was straight out of left field and totally out of place for the context of this movie. I shall vent my frustration of what exactly it is that I was disappointed with in the forums. But what was holding together as a solid entertaining action film was somewhat ruined by this inclusion.<br/><br/>*** END OF SPOILER ***<br/><br/>But when all said and done, the movie gets a 7 out of 10 from me as most of the movie was satisfying. It is a weak 7 due to what I mention in my ""SPOILER"". But I feel overall that they've steered the franchise in the right direction. Hopefully, they will improve on what they did in this one for the next Mission."
"brainofj72","6","0","0","14 May 2006"," A Two-Hour Episode of Alias
","Brian De Palma's 1996 screen adaptation of the television series Mission: Impossible was pretty much perfect, in my opinion. It was a tense, intriguing action thriller that struck an impeccable balance of taut, gritty suspense and campy fun. Then, in 2000, John Woo came along and gave us a ridiculous action sequel riddled with pointless slow motion and excessive style. When I heard J.J. Abrams was going to be at the helm of the third installment, I felt a mix of curiosity, optimism, and skepticism. On the one hand, I figured he would at least get rid of that horrible slow motion action rubbish, but on the other hand, I was afraid he would forget the fun and give us a film that was too realistic and gritty. And I always doubt the ability of TV directors to make the jump to cinema. Then, as I expected, Abrams began talking about how he wanted to ""humanize"" the characters. Uh oh.<br/><br/>Then I heard Philip Seymour Hoffman was going to be portraying the villain. I didn't care about the rest anymore  that got me VERY excited.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I have to say that it was exactly what I expected.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Owen Davian (Hoffman), a mysterious guy with a lot of money  they never really tell us just who exactly he is. Hunt is now engaged to be married (and might I add that I found it weird that the actress portraying his fiancé bears a strange resemblance to Katie Holmes)  Abrams plot device to humanize him, of course  but IMF wants him back to rescue an agent captured by Davian. Hunt gets sucked back into the fray as Davian kidnaps his fiancé and implants an explosive charge in his head (yep, you heard me).<br/><br/>First off, the cast is fantastic. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Jonathon Rhys Meyers, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Simon Pegg  wonderful! And they all give good performances, especially Hoffman, who is every bit as cold and menacing as you would expect. He never fails to impress me.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, Abrams really doesn't deliver. As I feared, Mission: Impossible III doesn't feel like a Mission: Impossible movie, but a long episode of ""Alias"". Abrams doesn't seem to know how to use a tripod or keep the camera further than two inches away from the actors' mugs. Despite how bad it was, at least Mission: Impossible II felt like a movie. What destroys the cinematic atmosphere even further is the hiring of Michael Giacchino to compose the score. Lalo Schifrin's classic theme isn't utilized nearly enough, and all of the music inevitably sounds like it's straight out of ""Alias"". I just wasn't feeling it.<br/><br/>Expectedly, Abrams uses a load of pointless and clichéd plot twists (which I won't go into for the sake of spoilers), but where he really fails is in the film's action. At first I thought Abrams was going for a gritty, realistic, and brutal approach, but then he throws in some superhuman jumping moments and whatnot, so then I became confused. Is this supposed to be realistic action or suspend-my-disbelief-and-have-fun action? It becomes this awkward limbo between the two, and it never really clicks.<br/><br/>And then there is his attempt to ""humanize"" the characters. I have no problem with this concept, but Mission: Impossible III is simply the wrong vehicle to convey it. This is supposed to be an action thriller, not a soap opera. Again, Mission: Impossible III feels like ""Alias"" in this respect.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission: Impossible III is a reasonably enjoyable way to kill two hours, but you could just watch the first two episodes of ""Alias"" and get the same effect. I hope the next installment can get the series back to its roots. Bring back De Palma!"
"gregsrants","7","0","0","14 May 2006"," Best of the three
","I can't remember any film in recent history that has had more people 'attached' to a project than Mission Impossible III. Going back as far as 2004, there have been directors (Joe Carnahan and David Fincher) actors (Kenneth Branagh, Ricky Gervais) and actresses (Carrie Ann Moss, Thandie Newton and Scarlett Johansson) that were all slated to be involved with the project that had to pull out due to either creative differences (good-bye Caranahan) or due to scheduling conflicts as the films production continued to be pushed back what seemed like an eternity.<br/><br/>The only things that remained certain was that the movie was going to eventually get made and that couch-jumping Tom Cruise would again reprise his role of IMF agent, Ethan Hunt for the third time.<br/><br/>This time 'round, director J.J. Abrams (no, not the same JJ from Good Times) was behind the camera taking over the reins of a franchise that saw two big name helmers, Brian De Palma and John Woo, bring their vision to the screen in the past 10 years.<br/><br/>J.J.'s theatrical directing experience sat at an overall count of zero. Abrams had impressed Cruise with his creation and direction of the television shows Alias and Lost, but the difference between a one-hour pilot and a $150 million dollar budgeted event film is night and day no matter how you cut it, so Abrams was a little over his head.<br/><br/>But you wouldn't know it.<br/><br/>Abrams works the camera like a seasoned pro and stages the action sequences as good as Michael Bay (I could write, 'as bad as Michael Bay', but I think you get my point). When the show gets a-rockin', Abrams keeps a good pace and by the end of the film, his direction outshines that of the series predecessors.<br/><br/>Before I get too far ahead of myself, let's get back to the basics. Mission Impossible III has Ethan Hunt going up against his most diabolical villain to date, Owen Davien played fiendishly by Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Davien is in search of a weapon known as the 'Rabbit's Foot' and uses Hunt's unsuspecting wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) as leverage to get Ethan to acquire the Rabbit's Foot for his malicious intentions.<br/><br/>In order to pull off the impossible, Ethan assembles his team which again includes Luthur, played a third time by Ving Rhames. Together, the team must simply evade authorities, fight against superior firepower, jump from building to building and basically do a bunch of stunts that would have Superman himself saying 'Too dangerous'.<br/><br/>And while they dodge bullets, planes and rockets (Oh My!), there are IMF brass that are either for or against the operation which leaves us wondering who is pulling the strings and what double cross will come on the heels of the double cross that just occurred.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible III does all the summer blockbuster things right. It blows things up. It has an unequivocal movie star in the lead, and it has a villain that is downright one of the best since Sean Connery was a British Secret Agent. But maybe most amazingly is that MI:III has us forget the Cruise that we have seen on every tabloid cover, every entertainment news program and every website blog since War of the Worlds premiered a year ago. By beginning the film with a high tension moment between Davien and Hunt, we immediately are engrossed in both the ruthlessness of the baddie and the plight of the victims that we immediately leave our preconceived notions at the lobby doors.<br/><br/>Then, over the next two hours, we get suckered into following along the characters with great interest as our eardrums are attacked by surround sound explosions.<br/><br/>There are two things that would have taken MI:III into the annals of incredible action flick instead of just a very good one. First, they could have rooted the action sequences more in the realm of reality. Like the first two installments, Ethan is a one man wrecking crew that can jump from building to building and shoot people while sliding off high rise window tops. Couple this with the trademark masking and impersonating of characters which comes across like a bad Halloween joke and you get more James Bond than you do Die Hard.<br/><br/>The second complaint is more personal. It is that Hoffman didn't get more screen time. As Davien, Hoffman gives a performance that was as fun to watch as Travolta was in Face/Off. He is cut throat and believable without a likable bone in his body. His confidence in his schemes are his strengths and part of me actually wanted him to win (or at least survive so that we can see him again in MI:IV).<br/><br/>Mission Impossible III has countless subplots that have all been done before. There is the unsuspecting new wife who learns of her husbands real identify only after being sucked into the plans of the evil geniuses (True Lies). There are the bosses at IMF that fight amongst each other never revealing until the last moment which one is actually on the side of our hero (just about every action film since 1980) and there is an agent that is kidnapped and requires her mentor to come to the rescue. But for all the familiarity, there is still fun to be had, and rarely does a third film ever make you not turn your nose up at option of a fourth.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

It's a bit like a mix of the previous instalments - smart enough with lots of good action. Some of the writing is particularly sparkling with freshness. Abrams creates moments of tension that are so involving that you can feel your butt-cheeks tightening up on your seat.<br/><br/>Love him or hate him, Tom Cruise does his usual best as Ethan Hunt with good old reliable Ving Rhames as his ever-cool intel guy. Hoffman was understatedly excellent in his role as the villain, whilst Crudup and Fishburne did their thing, although there was some lack of character.<br/><br/>Some influences from Lost are apparent, not least the music (which is neither surprising nor a bad thing). There is the traditional M:I twist involved which is a bit confusing, but if you think hard enough you should be able to get it. Special effects were excellent, especially with a certain item that occurs in each of the movies.<br/><br/>The ending was...well it's JJ Abrams and co., and when you watch Lost there are more questions than answers.

","J.J. Abrahams is a hell of a filmmaker. It is his contribution to this project that makes it semi bearable. Sadly enough, the film needed some more careful trimming in order to make it as enjoyable as some of the ""Alias"" episodes that Abrahams wrote and directed. Instead we are given an overlong and pretentious plot that can barely sustain itself with overblown action scenes that call too much attention to themselves, has some very talented supporting actors in roles that demand nothing from them except sitting behind a wheel or standing around with vacant looks that pretty much reflect the audience's reactions to this boring film.<br/><br/>Why is it that we are expected to like remakes that are uninteresting, tired, and poorly executed?

","Technically, MI3 is well done. That doesn't cut it. The story is just about characters following MacGuffins all over the place that serve no purpose. MI3's concept is simple: Alias meets 24, but in two hours. Ethan Hunt becomes Jack Bauer along with personal problems about being a spy in love. The whole thing feels too manipulative. You know what's going to happen next since the opening scene ends. It has no suspense. Just things blowing up with a nice scene or two. This comes from a guy who liked Mission Impossible and MI2.<br/><br/>The quality of MI3 is probably at the same level of The Island. It can be enjoyed, but you have to give your share for that to work out. The main problem of the movie is the intense focus it has on Tom Cruise's profile. Other characters don't get enough screen time and lack in development for that reason. A movie with this kind of action would have been great with stronger characters you could actually care for. <br/><br/>There was one bright point in the movie though: the tech guy at headquarters was played by no other than Shaun himself: Simon Pegg - his lines were golden and I wish he'd been in the leading role.<br/><br/>So, it's worth seeing if you like Tom Cruise's face and good action. The story is a mess, the characters one-dimensional and the twists are just annoying."

I found myself clenched through most of the movie, and only during the rare ""relationship"" scenes did I realize that I had been holding my breath.<br/><br/>Things really heat up when Ethan crosses a sadistic villain (with a chilling performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman), who kidnaps Ethan's wife.

Philip S. Huffman almost steals the show, as the lizard-eyed villain, playing his part very believably. Laurence Fishburn delivers the goods as usual, playing the mysterious head of the agency.

Although still not based in the real world, you at least feel more tension and suspense and could go ""sure, they might be able to do that"". Except, that is, until the final reel. Then it's back to over-the-top action. But by then, you're hooked. The previews definitely did not do this film justice and could help explain the lackluster box office (Katie, Scientology, and Couches aside, Cruise does a great job being the hyper-hero). <br/><br/>The digital projection was DLP, and it looked and felt like I was watching a big screen TV. Here were the problems.<br/><br/>1.The light guns were not properly aligned. This was obvious when there was white text on the screen. The top of the letters had a red outline, and the bottom of letters had a blue outline. <br/><br/>2.Gradation of dark areas of the screen were very shallow. Example, the dark hair of Tom had no detail, no subtle highlights reflecting from nearby light sources. The hair was just a black blob with no definition. I went to a second showing of the film presented in traditional 35mm. The film image of the same shot of Tom's hair had much more detail and definition.<br/><br/>3.Colours were not true. The lips on actors were a purple-ish pink instead of pink-ish red. <br/><br/>As for resolution, the digital image seemed about the same, but the projected image from video looks obviously different than film.<br/><br/>If a local theatre advertises that a film is being shown as digital projection, avoid it if at all possible. Video projection in theatres should be welcomed to screen features that were shot on video. This opens up the field to 1000s of more lower budget independent films that can be as good or better than Hollywood flicks. But if it's film, see the film.<br/><br/>Movie: 7 out of 10. <br/><br/>Digital image: 4 out of 10"

His wife in this 3rd part is very look alike Katty. For that, I felt a little disappointed.

"ikanboy","6","4","12","7 May 2006"," Mission implausible III
","Lots of action, little sense! Good summer flick for those wanting to watch a ""24"" mentality movie with the usual ""too fast and jerky to enjoy"" action scenes. As usual: suspend all disbelief who enter here. <br/><br/>Intrepid super IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is called back from his ""training only"" life to rescue erstwhile trainee of his, who is the mandatory female ""who kicks butt as good as the men"" agent. In order to do so he has to leave his ""out of the loop"" fiancée ( a Doctor, of course! All agents wives have to be Doctors!), and hurry to Germany to extradite the agent. <br/><br/>The action scene that follows is the usual herky jerky, MTV slamma jamma, ""wha's happenin here"" rush that I couldn't wait to be over, so we could get on with the story involving Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has some wonderful lines as the ultimate Bond type baddie, but whose presence is sadly under used.<br/><br/>There is a scene on a long causeway (Chesapeake?), cloned from ""True Lies"" in which Hoffman is rescued, with resources only available to the US military, and as far as we can tell the newspapers don't pick up on this - and if they do what the hell is the explanation going to be? ""Eh, well there were these terrorists on the bridge and we had to blow up half the D.C. commuters, and, no we don't know why we used a drone to over kill them, but trust us the US Govt. stopped a major threat to our country!""<br/><br/>Then it's off to China to run rampant in the streets of the largest police state in the World with nary a sign of any police or military. Wow, a real sleeping giant!<br/><br/>Hoffman, when we get to see him, is great. Cruise gets to sprint a lot. Soon enough he will be ambling along like Mike Douglas and Harrison Ford, so make hay.....I don't see this as a blockbuster, but it will do well enough with the summer crowd. Until Poseidon comes along, which, if it's done right, will at least have some: ""who is going to die, and who isn't,"" tension.<br/><br/>Finally I know this is picky, but why does the hero always rush to rescue the damsel in distress, when he's miles away, and yet he never thinks to call ahead and have security on scene, or police, do it? I know, no dramatic tension!"
"tex_a_2000","6","4","12","6 May 2006"," What do people use to rate pictures these days?
","OK, now lets start from the beginning. I watched this movie at its opening last night, and got a little less than what i initially bargained for. I knew that the picture had many conflicts on the set (especially with actor/director Tom Cruise), but I never thought that it would have been what i saw last night.First let me say that the movie in itself wasn't a bad flick, it's just that the title alone being ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE"" has certain connotations that MI3 was unable to represent or even remotely capture...meaning that there weren't any action packed and breathtaking climaxes that would make you sit and wonder in uttermost amazement how the hell this man was able to accomplish such a feat. After MI2 there were certain scenes that were virtually unforgettable (such as Tom Cruise hanging from the ice in the beginning and the motorcycle fight near the end etc) however in this movie after watching it i have now recollection of any outstanding scenes that would be worthy of making a note to self or to use as the bar for future motion flicks.<br/><br/>The movie left you during the course of its duration trying desperately to fit together pieces of a puzzle...for example, what the hell was the rabbit foot? (note that the whole picture was virtually revolving around this so called ""rabbit foot"". Only near the end was it clear what it was, and even then it really isn't that clear as i still have no idea to the magnitude of destruction this ""rabbit foot"" was capable of. When Tom Cruise went for the rabbit foot he went into a ""high security building"", and just came out through a window...his team spent more time getting him to the building than helping him acquire this ""rabbit foot"". From looking at the flick it seems as though he just walked in, found it in a bag by the window and jumped out the nearest window.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were definitely below par, and the camera's angles weren't as articulate as one would expect for a flick of this sensationalized magnitude. The sound sucked in terms of the hype on certain scenes, but then again maybe that was due to the fact of there hardly being any notable scenes to begin with. Mission impossible is also known for the theme sound being played during the movie in times where something which is seemingly impossible or brilliant is about to occur. In this flick we heard the music to scenes tantamount to a man running away, sigh very disappointing indeed.<br/><br/>The overall plot was OK but very predictable and trite. If you're one who can analyse a movie instead of pandering to the hype and the actor, you will realise that there is much work that was left unresolved in the case of MI3.<br/><br/>Tom acted well and so did the cast although time wasn't really spent developing the characters seen throughout the movie...i could go on for ever, but to make a long story short i say this...if i had to choose between watching MI3 or watching 3 MI3 TV EPISODES I'D GLADLY CHOOSE THE LATTER.<br/><br/>i rate this movie a 6"

","I have watched every trailer video clip before the actual movie comes out.The experience of waiting for the releasing date was agonising and painful. Finally the date has come ,somehow the the screen is shockingly empty less than 10 person in a 200-seats screen for the first day. Th start sequence is a bit confusing , the reverse order of a story-telling format is unusual for a gadget-spy-action film.Unlike most the James bond films the start sequence starts with a futuristic gadget using combat scene which is always a good way to get everyone's attention and blow their mind off. This one starts with a interrogation which consist with the time frame of midsection of the story.The decision of the major villain comes out first really kills the curiosity and wondering of the viewers.<br/><br/>Yes, I know it is a spy-action but the shooting angle and style of the film is not very film cautiously designed and perhaps too perfectly done to a point of unrealistic.None of the combat scenes in the film is flashy enough and all of them have failed to impress me and blown my mind off,specially the last combat scene that took place in the hospital.It's either because the director lacks of innovations in new ideas of presenting the combat or perhaps everything been done already.I refuse to believe the 2nd reason is why the combat scenes are such a major letdown.<br/><br/>The biggest mood-killer is the combination a love drama and a action film.Too much time used on describing the relation changes of the two couple.Why would someone want to watch what a spy live a normal life is like?The deliberated attend of bring up the conflicts of two identities over a character has hardly generated any interests from the viewers. Disappointments:<br/><br/>The 2nd biggest disappointment is the ending.Come on! Smiling and happily walking away???!!!What was that?A ending shares varies resemblances of a sitcom ending from the 70's.That was a truly appalling ending.What a cliché.However the ending is nothing compare to the outrageously simple storyline and predictable characters. Thw plot is just too predictable to be attractive to anyone."

","Like its previous 2 incarnations Mission Impossible 3 is a by the numbers actioner which adds little to the genre. There is the requisite amount of explosions and gadgetry, an easy to follow plot and all outcomes can be predicted with absolute certainty.<br/><br/>Having heard Abrahms was directing I had expected perhaps a little more character driven story development, and to be fair MI3 does posses more heart than the previous 2, however it is, sadly - no match for the likes of The Bourne Supremacy. <br/><br/>Many people are praising Hoffmans performance and he does give us a stone cold killer. Ironically this is the films weakest point. So cold is Hoffman that his character is uninteresting - and indeed the editor seems to have realised this, Hoffamn gets about 8 lines and only a few short scenes. This, added to a ""Mcguffin"" which no-one has put the slightest thought into, bring the film down many notches. A shame really."
"jerrythres05","5","3","9","6 May 2006"," Mission Impossible : Failed to impress
","The few reason why this movie would be a hit is because it has Tom Cruise and Rhames, for the fact its released in the summer, and the publicity started from around March or February making it look like the best sequel ever. The movie is very disappointing. I have to admit there are a few action sequences and cool gadgets used in the movie. Other than that the story was not impressive and 70 - 80 percent of the scenes are predictable. The soundtrack (aka Background score) was horrible. They did not even use the proper theme from Limp Bizkit or Moby. Cruise has acting is impressive to some point. In the previous Mission Impossibles there was a cool fight scene in the end between the villain and Cruise, but in this one, the fight scene is very very disappointing. This movie contains few small comedy bits. I would rather watch the first Mission Impossible than to go to the theatres for this one. There must have been a lot of effort put into this movie, but there are soo many mistakes and some scenes don't concur with reality. There are a lot of mistakes in the scenes shot in Vatican City. I went to watch the movie with high hopes but came out disappointed. Most of the best scenes and shots of the movie are in the trailers."
"eyebrow2002","1","3","9","5 May 2006"," A huge let down considering how good the first two were
","I have just been to see it and I'm fuming, spitting bile here it was that awful.<br/><br/>I should have known it really, all the signs were there. The studio wouldn't give the previews out on time so a lot of the 5* reviews were done without seeing the film. All the interviews were people going on about the 'story' which usually means there isn't one. Plus they were hammering on about how many stars were in it<br/><br/>{Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Lawrence Fishburne, Ving Rhames, Michelle Mohegan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers (big with the Irish), Simon Pegg (big with the English), Maggie Q (absolutely huge in china)} <br/><br/>Usually there's loads of unknowns (think of the last two films) but they made a point of boasting about star power with this one and studio's only usually do that to distract you from a terrible film.<br/><br/>Anyway problems with it: [*]special effects for effects sake, this sounds stupid but they just kept blowing stuff up too much. in the first rescue you didn't know what was getting blew up. trust me it's idiotic and bored me [*]the bird in it is a moose, she looks like cruise's bird Katie Holmes(and she's a moose with a bog eye). the bird in it looks too ordinary. she's not 'hollywood fit' so you're not bothered about her [*]daft ending, the last two films had amazing final sequences but they sacked it off in this one [*]lame story, this was the biggest problem. The story is essentially the same as the first film...no scratch that IT IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST FILM! but it's not even well done, the first film did it much better. the only difference is they've added some little side plots that have been blatantly grafted off TV series. The plot from 24 series 2 and 5 is thrown in there. They don't develop characters well, you're not fussed one way another if anyone dies (EVEN THE BAD GUY, WTF IS THAT?!?!) and you walk out thinking where's the rest? [*]They wrapped everything up all nice and neat in a bun at the end but it was oversimplified and just a carbon copy of the end of the first film. [*]The bad guy Phillip Seymour-Hoffman was almost a cameo, he made some threats then got killed.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","2","5","2 November 2006"," Quite frankly I don't see how this movie is any better than ""Mission: Impossible II"".
","People complained about ""Mission: Impossible II"" how incredibly simple the story was (and of course I agree on that) but in my opinion the story of ""Mission: Impossible III"" is even simpler and weaker. ""Mission: Impossible III"" doesn't even tell its story by its actors, or script but rather with the one big action sequences after the other. All style but no substance. <br/><br/>I'm probably the only person on the planet who fully understood an enjoyed ""Mission:Impossible"" and I also enjoyed watching ""Mission:Impossible II"", mainly thanks to its wonderful directed action. I expected a lot from ""Mission: Impossible III"", especially when it started to receive positive and even raving reviews in the media. In the end the movie didn't deliver. The action is great but the build up of it all and the story- and storytelling is too lacking to make this an enjoyable must-see action spectacle.<br/><br/>This movie really is basically the one big action sequences after the other. The movie doesn't allow us to catch our breath for a moment and before you fully can process what happened you're already in the middle of the next big fast action sequence. I'm sure this was all perfectly good and impressive to see on the big screen but on the small screen it's not good enough to compensate for the movie its story and other flawed elements. It's too paced and too lacking in development or depth. The movie jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. We're in Germany and before we know it in America then China and back again, etcetera. It also sort of makes you wonder why the movie had to be set at locations spread all over the world. It doesn't really add anything to the movie its story or atmosphere. It rather seems like a waste of money and it also doesn't always make the movie flow well.<br/><br/>In the movie the story really plays no part in the movie. The movie is lacking proper development and the few story-elements that are present in the movie are far from well executed.<br/><br/>When watching this movie it becomes that director J.J. Abrams only has experience with work for TV. He tells this movie as a TV series episode, meaning that everything happens quick without giving it ever much depth or time to think. Basically everything that happens in this movie and in the story is build up in 5 minutes and ended in that same 5 minutes again. This unfortunately also is the case in the disappointing finale. This is the sort of build up used for television series but for movies it just doesn't work well. I'm afraid that J.J. Abrams will always keep directing movies like that and as long as this remains the case, I'll probably not become a fan of him.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise hater, on the contrary. In my opinion he is the biggest and best action hero star of the moment. What other actor makes such great action movies and delivers an Oscar worthy performance as well? He plays the role of Ethan Hunt for the third time in this movie and in this one he is the most emotional and humane on, since he is attacked on his personal feelings. This also was already the case in ""Mission: Impossible"" but in this movie even more. It does provide the movie with some depth but this isn't always handled well. It makes some of the sequences feel out of place and in contrast with the rest of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays an excellent villain role mainly because well, he is such a great actor. He absolutely steals the show in most of the sequences that he is in. His character is however lacking a proper background and motivations, which makes his character feel flat and far from interesting. The rest of the movie seems pretty weirdly cast with roles for Billy Crudup, Simon Pegg and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, not the mostly likely actors to appear in a big action movie (same goes for Philip Seymour Hoffman by the way) but they all fit their roles well and are an enrichment for the movie. Laurence Fishburne is also quite good in his role. Ving Rhames reprises his role of Luther Stickell for the third time and this time is most definitely the least interesting one.<br/><br/>Of course the big and well made action sequences are reasons why this movie is still better than your average action-flick. The big budget for the movie is obvious and spend on lots of big explosions, gun fights and chase sequences. The action movie lovers will not complain. The special effects are also good but nothing Oscar worthy. They certainly don't look like 'an $150,000,000-movie' worthy.<br/><br/>The camera-work was good. I was quite fond of the shaky cam effects and they made the action sequences look even more spectacular. The musical score from new upcoming composer Michael Giacchino was also truly great. With this movie he proofs that he can handle big movies as well and just as good as the can handle popular games and television work. Hopefully he'll get the chance to do more projects like this one in the near future. An Oscar before 2010 for him?<br/><br/>Conclusion; If this was a TV-series episode it would had been one of the best ever but as a movie it simple falls short, mostly of some of the basic things.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"TxMike","Null","2","5","2 November 2006"," Another thrilling impossible mission movie.
","I am old enough that I was a fan of the old ""Mission Impossible"" TV series. And, while the movies are decidedly different in tone and style, the same ""impossible"" missions challenge the team. Someone once said that it wasn't believable, that the team could undertake all those seemingly impossible missions and still survive. My response was, and still is, ""They only film the ones where the team succeeds. The ones where they get killed are not told."" That's because it is all fiction anyway.<br/><br/>This installment -- MI:3 -- has several impossible missions. The movie actually starts near the end, with Ethan (Cruise) tied up and the bad guys, led by Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are threatening to shoot his also tied up fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan) unless he tells them where the mysterious ""rabbit's foot"" is. We pick that scene up again at the end, but most of the movie is told in flashback form.<br/><br/>The movie has a somewhat low rating, maybe because of the bad publicity its star has had over his romance with Katie Holmes, jumping on Oprah's couch and things like that. But it in fact is an exciting, well-crafted movie which held my interest for its 2 hours running time.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. Cute Kerri Russell as an IMF operative gets killed off early. Ethan leads a rescue, in Germany, which is successful, but she dies seconds before they can electrically disarm a small explosive device implanted into her head via her nasal passage by the bad guys. At the end of the movie, right after Ethan rescues his fiancée, he has a similar device in his head, he uses an electrical shock to neutralize it, his fiancée, a nurse, manages to bring him back from death using CPR.<br/><br/>One mission is the capture the bad guy, Davian, when they find from a secret email that he will be in Vatican City for an event. Ethan puts on a molded Davian mask and they kidnap him, only to be ambushed later on a bridge back in the US. Part of the drama is trying to figure out which IMF insider is working with Davian.<br/><br/>There is another mission in China where the mysterious ""rabbit's foot"" is retrieved. But an actual synopsis of the movie is not that important. It is simply a modern thriller, very well done."

I can proudly announce that the entire cast acts their butts off in this flick and they do it well, but Philip Seymour Hoffman really stole the show. He was bad @$$ with a capitol A, and I never thought I'd say this, but he was kinda sexy too. It's so refreshing to have a villain that does what he says he's going to do and doesn't monologue the hero to death.

"asalem182","10","2","5","20 May 2006"," Welcome Back Mr. Hunt, You've Been Gone for Too Long.
","The last couple of years weren't very kind to Mr. Cruise. He went crazy on talk shows, War of the Worlds had a lukewarm reception, and for almost 2 years, he couldn't get the latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise off the ground. Fortunately, with MI3, he finally seems to be back on track.<br/><br/>IMF member Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is almost retired. He's engaged to beautiful nurse Julia (Michelle Monaghan). But when Hunt knows that international arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is about to kill his protégé Lindsey (Keri Russell), Hunt has to reunite with his team to save Lindsey.<br/><br/>The first 2 films of the franchise couldn't be more different. Mission Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, was an intelligent thriller, with a confusing plot, and it didn't have enough action. On the other hand, MI2, directed by John Woo, was an action-driven film, and its plot was silly. MI3 follows in the footsteps of MI2, but with better action, better acting, and a better story.<br/><br/>The action in the film is an action fan's wet dream. Almost every gimmick in the book is there; Shootouts, check. Car chases, check. Chopper chases, check. The bridge scene in particular made me drop my jaw in awe. It was better than any action scene since Return of the King. The Vatican operation, very reminiscent of the Prague operation in the first film, was also stunning. Director J.J Abrams (the man behind hit series Lost) did an amazing job. The action sequences are well orchestrated, well edited, and unlike many recent action films, you could always tell what's going on. And all the money is up on the screen. In fact, I'm surprised the film only cost 150 million to make.<br/><br/>While the story isn't as good as the first part, it's far better than the paper-thin story of the sequel. The best thing about it was the comeback of the IMF team, who were totally absent in the sequel. The domestic angle gave more humanity to the character of Ethan Hunt. And I was also glad that double-crossing was back in full force this time around.<br/><br/>Hoffman gave the best performance. There is a very thin line between being a great villain and being over the top. But because Hoffman knew exactly what he was doing, he never crossed it. Cruise was very good as Hunt, and Simon Pegg was great as the comic relief.<br/><br/>Of course, the film wasn't flawless. The last 20 minutes are very cheesy, the ending is somewhat anti-climactic, and Hoffman was criminally underused. But everything else was so good that it atones for all these sins.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend seeing MI3. Bring on part 4."

Mission Impossible I had ""memorable"" moments and thus it will always be the best in my opinion.<br/><br/>This effort is much like ""Mission Impossible II"" except a little better. So if you enjoyed ""Mission Impossible II"" then you have no reason not to actually like this.<br/><br/>Having said that this film sux and I wouldn't show it in a prison.<br/><br/>Although I would show it to fans of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>HAVING SAID THIS. If he makes a fourth I'm like totally there dude! What can I say I'm for ever curious as to how they do their car chase, their massive explosion and the final show down."

","Best Hollywood Flick i've seen for a long time, except Capote which also was a whole lot of fun. P.Seymour Hoffmann is an awesome actor. I first saw him in the excellent movie 'Dead Poet Society' and he's getting better and better in every movie. In 25th hour i was glad to see him back to the big screen. Cruise is good as expected, that means good as one can be as an action character. The other characters are fitting in also well, thanks to a good and mostly logical script.<br/><br/>The action is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The plot developed so fast that i missed some details, some unanswered questions remained, but were whirled away by another turn in the script. There are a lot of turning points, which were a lot more surprising then in the previous M:I flicks. The first and second M:I movies are by all means worse than the third one.<br/><br/>I watched it as cam-rip of the net, because the movie-industry is behind technical possibilities for greedy reasons as usual. E.g. like Television net income passed Hollywood in the middle of the last century.<br/><br/>Talking of political correctness, i think i witnessed some of it in the movie when the bad boy said that the US will do what it can best, (declare war) Clean Up, Democracy, blah blah.<br/><br/>I will definitely go to cinemas to watch it with my girlfriend. She might like it also for the romantic moments which were very enjoyable for an action movie. There's no typical Hollywood stickiness.<br/><br/>I can't wait to watch it on a big cinema-scope screen. Well done Hollywood."
"mars4muse","10","2","5","11 May 2006"," Tense and exciting entry!
","Forget about all of the media's character assassination of Tom Cruise and just go see this film. My wife and I were extremely entertained and, compared to most contemporary films which assault the senses with little substance, this was a breath of fresh air. And it offered much more than stunts and explosions ad nauseum; i.e. it had some real plot twists and even a measure of drama and romance, something usually lacking in most action/adventure films. Tom Cruise' acting was at it's best, and he breathed life into a script somewhat superseded by action sequences. And he gave vitality to Ethan's character by exacting a sort of believable urgency and a true to life or death human response to ""impossible"" odds. This was especially in the case of......well.....don't want to give any spoilers. :>) We were equally impressed with the supporting cast and thought Ving Rhames' Luther character and his interaction with Ethan added some comedy relief and lightheartedness to help ease some of the tension, something I always appreciate in this kind of film. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Davian was about as cold blooded and diabolical as one could conjure up; certainly a formidable adversary.<br/><br/>And, needless to say, it is obvious that much imagination and thought went into the conception and shooting of the action sequences (big bucks notwithstanding). I also appreciated the fact that the whole movie was not shot with the ""shakey"" camera concept; only those parts where that effect helped to lure the viewer into the pandemonium and tension of certain scenes.<br/><br/>I won't waste the reader's time giving a synopsis or analytical/academic plot review as I am probably not ""qualified"" in any case (whatever that criteria is). Suffice it to say, if you enjoy a real adrenalin rush, some ""edge of your seat"" suspense and action, along with a few great surprises, don't hesitate to see this in the theater rather than waiting for the DVD release (which is the ONLY way to view/hear/experience a movie of this caliber anyway). <br/><br/>P.S. A message to the ""Newz"" media & ""critics"" of Tom Cruise: QUIT WASTING THE PUBLIC'S TIME AND INSULTING THEIR INTELLIGENCE WITH YOUR MINDLESS HARPING ON TOM CRUISE LIKE A BUNCH OF YAPPING CUR DOGS BARKING AT THE POSTMAN!!"

","I am 17, and although Mission Impossible 3 was enjoyable on the most part, there were other parts that were uneven. The film itself is overlong and does drag in a number of long scenes, but it is also explosive and well performed. I don't care for Tom Cruise that much, (he is slightly overrated) but I found his portrayal of Ethan Hunt quite likable. Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is superb as the villain, there are some times when he is very sinister, and he made the most of it. Other than the two leads, both of which added a lot to the movie, the remainder of the characters sadly seemed cardboard, but I don't think the uneven script and sometimes confusing plot helped that much. still, it does have jaw-dropping special effects, and some detailed direction.

Second of all julia is not a doctor shes a nurse. Plus the movie was terrible, just another ego inflater from a Hollywood has-been. There was a lot of stuff in the movie that was plain boring, its supposed to be an action movie, so wheres the action, no one who goes to see the movie wants to see ethan hunt making gaga, kissing girls, and saying wedding vows. It had many chances to save itself and never pulled it off, there was an entire action sequence that was left out in favor of at least half an hour of bore. Also the acting was sub par at best, Phil.S.Hoffman can act, but seemed extremely out of place in this movie, while all the other actors spent their time trying to hard to be on his level and be serious, and hence their acting seemed forced and disconnected. It just didn't work, it tried way too hard to be good, and turned out terrible. I wouldn't even recommend this to rent, just horrible. Don't see it. I saw it for free at an advanced screening, thats the only reason I went, it wasn't even worth the time taken to watch it, and don't listen to the reviewer above me, he/shes lying, they haven't even watched it i bet."

It was a serious struggle to sit through this painfully formulaic (or should I say methodic) waste of money and resources. I rolled my eyes so many times I could barely stand at the end.

","Mission: Impossible fans have been waiting for this. Action fans have been waiting for this. Heck, after last summer's dismal lineup of films, everyone has been waiting for this. I have good news and bad news. Bad news: The film does not deliver. It's really nothing more than a cookie-cut action film; a bunch of guys running around with guns doing crazy stunts. The story itself is reasonably dry and the special effects are clean but don't draw any positive attention to themselves or advance the plot much. The tension in the film is set by shaky camera work (intentional, yes, but a very cheap way to build tension). The editing is a strong point in the film and the acting is right on the money (you can't go wrong with Hoffman and Cruise). Now, the good news: We still have a whole summer of highly-anticipated films ahead of us. At least one of them shouldn't disappoint us."
"gregeichelberger","4","2","6","31 July 2012"," Impossible III: Great villain, mediocre sequel
","Originally published on May 2, 2006.<br/><br/>While Scientologist Tom Cruise forced his young wife, Katie Holmes, to undergo a ""silent birth"" recently, he nevertheless subjects the audience of his newest film to an ear-shattering series of explosions, gunshots, car crashes, whining jet engines, violent arguments and bloodcurdling screams. That's not to say ""Mission: Impossible III"" is a bad movie – just a little loud, that's all.<br/><br/>What puts this one a little above the average action/adventure, however, is the inclusion of a bona fide actor (like Cruise used to be), Philip Seymour Hoffman, fresh off his Oscar win for ""Capote."" <br/><br/>I've appreciated his work long before that, though, especially in ""Flawless,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Almost Famous,"" ""Empire Falls"" and ""Cold Mountain,"" among others. In fact, he was even good in the Ben Stiller/Jennifer Aniston bomb, ""Along Comes Polly.""<br/><br/>As the bad guy, Owen Davian, Hoffman brings a fresh new dimension to the typical movie villain, who appears, menaces and then gets killed. Here, he's an international weapons dealer, who (despite little backstory and questionable motivation) squeezes out every minute of screen time and makes you wish Cruise wouldn't hog so much of it.<br/><br/>He is suitably evil (telling Hunt how he will hunt down his wife, torture her and kill her in front of him), but with a boyish, pudgy charm that makes us relate - somewhat - to him. It's a terrific performance in an average motion picture.<br/><br/>The plot has covert IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) about to be married to a nurse, Julia (Michelle Monaghan, ""North Country,"" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""). No longer active in operations, he is now an instructor for new recruits, but you know this status won't last forever.<br/><br/>Julia doesn't know, of course, about his real job, believing him to be employed by the Virginia Dept. of Transportation, but this ruse is soon shattered when a young agent Hawk trained, Lindsey (Keri ""Felicity"" Russell) is kidnapped by Davian's organization. <br/><br/>These guys are attempting to sell some kind of biohazard device, called the ""rabbit's foot,"" to an unnamed Mideast power.<br/><br/>Hawk is sent in to rescue her, along with his team, Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames, ""Mission: Impossible""), Zhen (Maggie Q) and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, ""Match Point""), but a device detonates inside her head (don't ask), killing her.<br/><br/>The group then travels to the Vatican and kidnaps Davian, only to lose him when a most unlikely twist takes place. Friends who Ethan thought would support him do not, and those he assumed would betray him aid his cause. <br/><br/>It's all very confusing, but still entertaining in a lowbrow kind of way.<br/><br/>Now free, and really ticked off at Ethan (because he dangled him outside of an airplane, he's funny that way, I suppose), Davian arranges the kidnapping of Julia, which forces the inevitable showdown between the two combatants. <br/><br/>Ably directed by J.J. Abrams (behind many ""Lost"" and ""Alias"" episodes), ""MI3"" is non-stop in its intensity, and is thrilling enough to keep what's left of Cruise's fan base in their seats."

","I was a big fan of the TV series, I liked MI-1, and I liked MI-2 even better, so I was really looking forward to MI-3.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot was typical MI, which is OK with me, and the acting was as would be expected from the experienced and known cast. Nothing notable on either count.<br/><br/>The special effects... well, what can be said anymore of what the movie gurus are able to do to get our attention and impress us with their skills and application of technology.<br/><br/>What really got to me, though, was the actual presentation, filming, and editing. It seems that every action shot; i.e., scenes involving car chases, crashes, shoot-outs, and fights, lasted a second or two, and the camera was within a few inches of the action. Most of the time I couldn't tell what was really happening as from an observer's point of view - everything was right up to my face and the segments too short lasting.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is done in purpose - since it is almost impossible to detect continuity, attention to these details (continuity) is not necessary. MI-3 is just another of the movies I have seen recently that suffers from these maladies, and I hope that Hollywood steps back a bit, slows down, and allows us to enjoy (and actually be able to watch) what transpires instead of blasting away close up after close up."

","It's already the third part of the spy adventure that kept me glued to the screen and rooting for the luckiest team in the movie history. At this point I need to say right away that the coolness of this part is not worse but even better than the second installment, but how so?<br/><br/>The intensity of the scenes hits you hard at the mere start, the action flows like a mountain river grabbing everything and everyone with it. The previously annoying long explanatory talks have been removed as like creators have learned their mistakes. And after all of that we can see the growth of the operating scale once again, with it the complexity receives a solid boost. The weird part is that at some point movie thinks that it has provided you with more action that you can possibly take and just teases with some juicy parts without actually giving a taste of delicious pulp.<br/><br/>Another amazing side of these flicks is the cast. You can never forget the fact that Tom Cruise always comes up with new ways to excite you, even with a simple running that you would see a lot. I mean A LOT. However, right here I have discovered a pearl of an actor - Philip Seymour Hoffman. His performance delivered the feeling of genuine fear and the understanding that the man can do anything without any restrictions.<br/><br/>Throwing the self-destructing tape away I would say that this chapter of the story doesn't let you down, it brings exactly the right amount of adrenaline to enjoy and not blow yourself up."

Notable additions to the cast are Laurence Fishburne and Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>The action sequences are electrifying and never let up.

He brings a real mystery to the character and shows why he is one of the world's most versatile actors. The story also has some good twists and turns.<br/><br/>However, there were also many areas in which the movie left a lot to be desired. For one thing, Hoffman is woefully underused. He doesn't get nearly as much screen-time for his character to be well-developed and is barely in the action.<br/><br/>As I said, the story has good twists, but the payoff is rather unsatisfying as they never even explain what the Rabbit's Foot is.

","Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in the hugely underrated third Mission: Impossible movie. This is one of the best action movies I have seen a long time, and it's hard for me to believe that it doesn't even reach a 7.0 rating on IMDb..the only reason I can think of for this is that it was released at a time when Tom Cruise was unpopular, to say the least.<br/><br/>Having retired from field work, Ethan Hunt is trying to live a normal life with his sweetheart. But when one of his best trainees is captured during active duty, he agrees to attempt the rescue, and comes into contact with a ruthless, brutal, sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davien, who soon forms a personal vendetta with Hunt. He tracks Ethan down to hurt him in the best way he knows how: by hurting the person Ethan loves best. <br/><br/>Davien gives Ethan 48 hours to recover a mysterious and powerful object code named the 'Rabbit's Foot', and states that if he does not recover it, his wife will die. Falsely accused and wanted back in the United States, he rushes to the Far East in a desperate attempt to save his wife.<br/><br/>M:I:III included the by-now-expected array of guns, gadgets, explosions, and fistfights, but what stuck with me afterwards, was the tense, suspenseful drive of the film, and the spectacular acting. Starting with the ominous, terrifying foreshadowing scene of our hero being helplessly tortured both mentally and physically, this film grabbed me and never let go. Tom Cruise went above and beyond my (high) expectations, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant, and half a dozen new arrivals not only pulled their weight, but excelled.<br/><br/>Highly recommended...enjoy!"

","The first Mission: Impossible was pretty enjoyable in my opinion, not great I thought but good entertaining action thriller worth more than one screening. I've never seen the TV-show so the plot was very different. I liked the first movie my but my reaction to John Woo's sequel was not quite so well. Number two was so crappy in every way apart for the entertaining action. There was almost no plot just a slap in the face of everyone who thought the first one had an interesting story. Action movies seldom have amazing stories and MI2 was to stupid even for an action movie. It is interesting how with Mission: Impossible 3 they managed to take a bit from both previous movies and make the best one yet. The plot in the first movie was pretty complex, maybe a bit too much and the plot in number two was to simple. This manages to place itself in the middle. No award winning writing but perfectly enough for this kind of movie. Tom Cruise is great and his character has some depth and development in this. Ethan Hunt feels more like a human than a superhero this time. This film contains quite a few characters of importance to the plot. There are several big names in this. Fishburne and Pegg are great additions. Michelle Monaghan actually has a character unlike the female in the second movie who seemed to be there only to be eye candy. The villain this time Philip Seymour Hoffman is a major improvement and by far the best bad guy in the series. It's not his scheme but the performance that makes his character intimidating. With his cool voice and serious appearance unlike the ridiculous villain in the previous movie. The action scenes have been toned down in this but in no way making them less entertaining quite the opposite actually. John Woo does cool action but this is much more satisfying. MI3 does feel like a step towards 007 kind of spy movie. No problem in that for me at least.<br/><br/>Final summary Mission: Impossible 3 is a greatly entertaining but mindless action pleasure. Style over substance definitely but a good one of those."
"The_Film_Cricket","3","1","2","28 March 2011"," Mission Accomplished
","In one sense, the Mission: Impossible movies have something in common with the Austin Powers movies. They aren't perfect, they contain more cons than pros but, darn it, I would never think of missing one.<br/><br/>I remember I walked out of the first movie feeling pleasantly satisfied until I thought back over Brian DePalma's bucket of red herrings to realize that the movie, for all it's pretzel plot twists, really didn't add up to much. The second film just left me cold. This was more John Woo than Mission Impossible. Here was a rip-snorting action movie with the kinds of stunts and actions scenes I could see in a dozen other movies done much better. I felt, in a way, that the movie was way too much Woo and not enough ""Wow!"" But as I said, I may have had these problems but I would never have missed them, for what they were they were just plain fun.<br/><br/>So with that, I did not proceed into Mission: Impossible III with too much expectation. That's good because surprisingly I found a movie more robust and satisfying than the previous two, a movie that has a great villain and a great sense of danger that evokes the qualities of the best of the James Bond pictures.<br/><br/>Cruise's Ethan Hunt finds a better motivation this time. In his previous adventures he found himself chasing computer files and viruses but this time he is trying to uncover a mysterious ""Rabbit's Foot"" to save the woman he loves. What's the ""Rabbit's Foot""? Well, the movie provides us with a theory for that question but no real answer. This is what Alfred Hitchcock referred to as The McGuffin, a movie term for an object that motivates the characters and advances the story, but has little other relevance to the story itself. As the movie is closing, Ethan is still asking that question.<br/><br/>The point in chasing this ""Rabbit's Foot"" is that it is the key to saving Ethan's new bride from the hands of the slimy Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The movie opens with a flash-forward scene than reverses back so that we know from the start what will be at stake and the horror of that scene makes it clear that this movie isn't going to be easy on poor Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>The key to the movie is Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who just won an Oscar for playing Truman Capote) who infuses Davian with a kind of cold dread. He doesn't speak much but when he does there is a seriousness in his voice that is note perfect. If we didn't believe him as the villain than the rest of the movie wouldn't work.<br/><br/>It also helps that the stunt work is set up so that it doesn't feel like just clotheslines for the story. There are two spectacular set pieces here that are pitch perfect, one involves a leap from one high-rise to the next resulting in Cruise hanging upside down with a semi advancing on him. Another involves an explosion on the Chesapeake Bay bridge.<br/><br/>All in all there is a deep sense of satisfaction in this third entry because I think the series has found it's tone. Director JJ Abrams doesn't weigh the movie down with too much plot but just provides the dread factor and a great motivation. The movie isn't perfect but it's far and away the best film in this series and one of the most exciting action films I seen in a while. So at long last I can finally say Mission: Accomplished.<br/><br/>*** (of four)"

","Mission Impossible 3 is not only,much better then the barely above average,Mission Impossible 2,but it also manages to give a an excellent action film,like Mission Impossible,a worthy sequel. The action sequences are truly a sight to behold. It's honestly been a long time coming,since I have been absolutely floored,by the action sequences. The ingenious,emotional beginning,completely sets the stage for the entire movie,because it makes you wonder,why they are showing part of the finale at the beginning. What really surprised me was the pure emotion,in Mission Impossible 3. The mind games between ,Ethan and Davian ,are very suspenseful,and creates a ton of suspense. We are back to the Ethan we fell in love with in the 1st one. He's not superman anymore,he's not doing any fancy kicks in mid air,or causing chaos with his motorcycle. This Ethan were able to root for,and it's rare in an action film these days,that you care so much about the two central characters. At the time Tom was in a lot of hot water,for his outbursts on drugs and Scientology,along with his couch jumping antics. I personally don't see how that should have affected the box office results.<br/><br/>Tom's charisma can never be denied in my opinion. Whether you like him or not,he attracts movie Goers. It's just a perfectly well made action film,that should please Action lovers all around the world.<br/><br/>Performances. Say what you want about Tom Cruise,but i'm a guy,and even I can proudly say, he is one of my favorite actors. This Ethan is a changed man. We see he Doesen't wanna do what he does anymore,he is through. He's a family man,who loves his wife dearly. It was a great change of pace for Tom,and he pulled it off beautifully,with his charisma. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as the villain. He is brutally cold,and I couldn't take my eyes off of him,when he was on screen. His scenes with Tom were absolutely chilling. Michelle Monaghan is a gorgeous sight to look at,and manages to be a much better option,then Thandie Newton,even though I enjoyed her. She felt more real with Tom,I believed in there love,and most importantly,I rooted for them at the end. Michelle is able to pull off her role,with believability,and conviction. Ving Rhames&Jonathan Rhys Meyers&Maggie Q make a terrific MI crew,for Tom. They all had excellent chemistry together,and I thoroughly enjoyed there performances. Simon Pegg adds some great comic relief,as Benji. Billy Crudup has the most mysterious role. He played it low key,and gave a decent show. Laurence Fishburne is class as always,and managed to inject charisma into his role. Keri Russell does fine,with the screen time she has.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Mission Impossible 3,is the real sequel if you ask me. It's action packed,with a lot of great emotion,and suspense. Check this one out with confidence,and have a rollicking good time!.<br/><br/>8/10"

A first-rate cast of actors, brilliantly paced, stunning and totally over-the-top action scenes that never cross the line of being completely unbelievable for some reason. A roller-coaster ride of thrills.<br/><br/>The only drawback for me is that some of the plot twists you can see coming very early on in the movie. I remember filing away certain lines of dialogue that seemed a little bit unexplained, knowing that they would unlock a twist that would come later.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie is evident with the crew that have been put together to assemble it. Everything from the camera-work, to the direction, to the editing etc is impeccable. Likewise is the quality of the actors: Michelle Monaghan, Ving Rhames, Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne. With this sort of cast, you can't really go wrong.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely worth watching if you are looking for something not too intellectual."
"clivey6","4","1","2","9 September 2008"," Lost me from 'hello'
","Not much to see here. It opens with Cruise strapped to a chair for info, about to watch his generic wife be shot dead, and reacting like he's Joel trying to bargain over the phone with Guido the killer pimp in Risky Business. It's like, why would I want to suspend my disbelief over Cruise's shaky acting so I can believe some poor woman is about to get offed? <br/><br/>15 mins in I was ready to switch off. I don't believe in the Tom Cruise persona any more, it worked for the 1980s and 90s but those days are long gone and he's doing the same thing, it rings a bit hollow. He doesn't seem to have a real relationship much with anyone in this, save the Ving Rhames guy from before. They're all just actors brought in.<br/><br/>It picks up a bit with two good set pieces in succession including a bridge out Florida scene , but it's all so horribly generic. They try to make it like ""24"" but it doesn't quite work, it reminded me of that ho hum Sean Connery film Entrapment where they go off to foreign climes to try some heist you don't honestly believe in though it looks quite nice.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Cruise expand his range, play a neurotic husband being cheated on, or a pompous professorial nervy type. He just can't do that earnest, young buck schtick any more and still be interesting."
"vip_ebriega","7","1","2","3 July 2008"," Accomplished!
","My Take: A vast improvement from its immediate predecessor and much closer to the espionage style of the original TV series. <br/><br/>In the case of summer movie entertainment, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III (M:I:III) goes over the way, with special effects and action scenes abound. What more could you ask for in a summer movie? A little more substance could have helped, but it's no use crying over spilled milk. M:I:III is a nimble, action-packed follow-up worthy as a part of the now famous series adapted from the famous TV series. It's packed with all the sort of enjoyable moments. Whether it has Tom Cruise sliding down a building, dodging missiles or dangling on a cliffhanger, the film wants us to slide, dodge and dangle right along with them. <br/><br/>Sequels are usually a bum rap, maybe because they simply rehash the elements of its predecessor/s, only striving to be bigger and louder. M:I:III is no exception, as it tries to top everything the first film and the second, and in the case of special effects, it might just succeed. While above-par from the second, it still lacks the sophistication and class of the original, which I really liked. But while not successfully topping the first film, M:I:III succeeds in revitalizing the franchise, thanks basically to director J.J. Abrams (of TV's ALIAS). He's exceptionally great at directing action scenes, as well as photography and rapid-fast yet stylish editing. But Abrams is also an expertise on character focus and adds style to the story. There are big sequences here, but they are never out-staged by the substance, or vice versa. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, the famed IMF agent who finds himself in a heap of trouble when trying to save his fiancée (Michelle Monahan), who gets in the hands of evil arms dealer Owen Davian (slimy Phillip Seymour Hoffman), whom Hunt buries a grudge when his colleague (Keri Russel in a bit cameo role) is kidnapped and killed by Davian. Hunt re-teams with old amigo Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), including some new teammates, including a scene-stealing Maggie Q who gives a new meaning to the term 'tough cookie'. Co-stars are rather overshadowed by a much higher-profile actors as Cruise and Hoffman, who really steal the show in a terrific and heart-pounding Mano-a-Mano. Hoffman may be the best villain in the series so far. Tough, sly and cunning, he's the guy you'd want to get rid of, which is a always a plus to any big-screen villain. <br/><br/>While it's a cut below the superior first film, M:I:III is a solid follow-up, and a worthy popcorn summer movie. The plot goes borderline implausible, almost as much as the unbelievable stunts. Purists of Bruce Gellar's famous TV series may think Hollywood has gone over-the-top in adapting the series on screen, but there's no denying of the thrills-to-the-max cunningness of this enjoyable summer movie. Check your brains at the door, and grab your seat as hard as you can. 1... 2... 3... Execute!<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"he_who_leads","6","1","2","24 June 2007"," An Extended Episode of Alias
","Where I stand on MI. Mission Impossible 1: Very cool. MI2: Stop switching faces! Ethan and Thandie Newton should go on mushy double date with Anakin and Amidala.<br/><br/>Where I stand on JJ Abrams. Alias: Often good but unbelievable, I'm more a '24' fan. Lost: Often great but I've stopped watching it. <br/><br/>Put them together and you have Mission Impossible 3<br/><br/>Abrams is a competent and experienced entertainer used to this sort of material: twists, guns, spies, gadgets, villains, devices that could destroy the world, secrets, lies etc. He constantly keeps things moving and interesting. On the other hand, focusing mainly on Alias here, his stuff is sometimes hard to swallow even for action TV. To me, Abrams is kind of old-school in the way he often skips over plausibility to set up the action or drama spectacle he really wants to focus on. Characters endure extreme conditions and combat and come out with barely a scratch on them, they globe-trot everywhere at a moment's notice and only run into realistic obstacles if it is convenient to the story. On Alias, haven't you noticed that Sydney (Jennifer Garner) has to change into 1001 different costumes to remain undercover, while Vaughn pretty much only changes his accent? Maybe I sound kind of stuffy here but this stuff irritates me.<br/><br/>In MI3, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now engaged to Julie (Michelle Monaghan, lovely) when he is pulled back into the line of fire to retrieve his former pupil Agent Farris (Keri Russel, who looks cool with a gun) from mean arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing standard bad guy). The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse game with Davian, who wants to gain access to a nasty weapon and hit Hunt where it hurts. <br/><br/>MI3 feels like an extended episode of Alias. It does not feel cohesive but quite episodic (gee, wonder why?) sort of split into 3 sections characterised by a major action sequence. The action is sometimes pretty great, but generally not spectacular. Nothing to match the tension of the first movie's famous CIA infiltration. The cast is fine, and Tom Cruise has a really cool run, nice high knees and fluid arm action. Head looking straight ahead... There is some more swapping faces stuff that doesn't seem as annoying as it was in MI2. Overall, the story is pretty basic stuff. <br/><br/>BTW ever since 'Match Point' I've always thought Jonathan Rhys Meyer, playing one of Hunt's team here, would make a really good James Bond. He's dark, handsome, from Ireland (like Brosnan), is only 30 y.o. and does dangerous and confident well. Not that I want Daniel Craig (see my Casino Royale review) replaced but maybe in the future?"

","Or most of it. Don't get confused by the word ""spoil"" in the summary line. I won't tell you anything about the movie that will spoil it for you.<br/><br/>The movie begins pretty good, you have the team element in it, as you had in the TV series, you also can see a/the private life of Ethan Hunt (Cruise). The pace is good and although I haven't yet watched the TV show ""Alias"", I was told that there a lot of parallels ...<br/><br/>Very early in the film you get sucked into it, just because JJ Abrams is good at making you believe in his ""world"" (or let's say in his vision). That's not a reality based world, with all the gadgets and stuff, but you're drawn to it. The great actors are a part of that. Most of them are very good ... there's one character I don't like, but I won't tell you which one that is ... if you see the movie, you might feel the same ... or maybe not ... Doesn't matter ... what matters is, what you think about the ending ... and for it was too much and to tell you the truth it (almost completely) ruined a good movie for me ..."
"brian_r_wright","6","1","2","28 March 2007"," Finally 50% as interesting as the TV series
","For early baby boomers Mission Impossible was about agents working for a Free World governmentoursagainst fascist and communist dictators sometimes seemingly against the Soviets or the Chinese themselves. Every week, James Phelps and his suave, multifaceted crew executed a meticulous plot of deception.<br/><br/>The TV Mission pace was glacial compared to today's Mission movies is glacial, but then the actions of the TV characters were actually believable.<br/><br/>With all due accolades to the director and effects specialists, I just don't think even the best real agent EVER swings between 60-story-tall skyscrapers tethered to a 200-ft. cable, shoots six or seven guards presumably through the heart with a pistol as he is sliding at full speed down a 45-degree glass building roof, penetrates the roof and lands next to the canister he's seeking, picks it up, blows a hole in the wall, jumps out and parachutes to the street below at night, in FIVE MINUTES.<br/><br/>Well, okay, maybe it was 10-15 minutes in the movie.<br/><br/>My point is in the headlong surge to make their super agents super, writers and directors of action movies are creating characters nobody relates to. By comparison, the Sean Connery James Bond in From Russia with Love or in Dr. Noback in the early 1960shad superior abilities that stayed within the bounds of reason. Thus, Bond was someone you could emulate.<br/><br/>How are you going to look up to Spider Man or Batman or Ethan Hunt? I still like this move better than the first two because it does do some character building. Ethan has just married a beautiful young bride (Michelle Monaghan) and wants to get out of the business. The Agency contacts him with ""one last job because he's so good"" to rescue a beautiful agent (Keri Russell) from the evil Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Etc., etc.<br/><br/>Right, the base plot has been done a million times. But J.J. Abrams, celebrated director/producer of Alias and Lost, makes all things fresh again.<br/><br/>Watching this movie is pure adrenalin. Learning that Cruise does most of his own stuntsincluding a particularly scary one where a gasoline truck locks its brakes and jack-knives with the trailer tires passing on either side of himadds to the excitement.<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2007"

","I suppose (continuing on the whole humorless pun thing) it's not 'Mission: Interesting III' or 'Mission: Exciting III' or even 'Mission: Enjoyable III'. No, it's 'Mission: Impossible III', a film - like its predecessors - with enough star power to sink 'Titanic' and a budget greater than that of the GDP of most second-world nations.<br/><br/>And it's not really interesting. Or enjoyable. It's like a less interesting version of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Eraser', or a Steven Seagal film without Steven Seagal. We have a WMD (I suppose it's a WMD...it could be a very flash martini shaker for all I we're told...), a kidnapped fiancé (the staple of a few Jean-Claude van Damme films funnily enough, apart from the, '...they killed his family...now he's OUT FOR REVENGE!!!' which is the staple of all the other JCVD films...), crooks in the agency (wasn't that in 'xXx: State of the Union'?) and all sort of useless, boring action scenes and gloss special effect that are...amazingly...used as FILLER between the even more useless, uninteresting character building scenes. And the worse part is, after plodding along for all this amount of time, it seems as if the directed check his watch and though, ""Ooh, better rap this up!"" and thought up some gimmicky way of ending it all (and THANK GOD it's not longer than two hours like 'M:I 2').<br/><br/>Overall: A B-grade script (Seagal would probably jump at it, actually), A-grade 'talent' (Oxymoron #1,156) and some of the most boring, 'seen-it-a-hundred-times-before' action sequences ever filmed.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an engaging, exciting and CLEVER (as CLEVER as action/thrillers are in this day and age) piece of entertainment, forget this - and rent Keifer Sutherland's '24'.

","This movie is easily the best of the 3 so far..<br/><br/>Not only is their non-stop, fluid action throughout the movie, but the story line and the way the film is made is much better due to the directing of J.J. Abrams.<br/><br/>We get to see how a top secret agent like Ethan Hunt attempts to stop the villains while protecting the ones he loves. There are some interesting new characters(Zhen, Declan, Brassel and Musgrave) as well as on old favourite in Luther (Ving Rhames). Also a MacGuffin is used to keep the audience guessing after the movie to what the function of the ""Rabbit's Foot"" really is.<br/><br/>To sum up, a great action movie with a interesting storyline."
"view_and_review","6","1","2","9 February 2007"," MI:3 in between the first and the second
","Although better than Mission Impossible 2, I still wasn't too impressed with Mission Impossible 3. We got to see all of the usual Mission Impossible stuff: explosions, gadgets, and close calls. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all three, but this is our third go around. After seeing a very good Mission Impossible and a very bad Mission Impossible 2, they could only go up. Sure it was an improvement, but I was still bored with it. Find the bad guy, rescue the girl, and save the world. I guess this time was even more serious because the girl was his wife. The formula for all action movies is the same, it's just that some action movies are better at presenting an overdone story than others."
"elmerfusco","2","1","2","6 February 2007"," only the first Mission was OK
","This is NOT ""Mission Impossible!"" The original show was not just action, sickening violence and blowing things up. It had an ensemble cast and plots of suspense and clever ways of tricking the enemy. This movie was a total waste of time to watch. The television show would never have lasted more than a season with such poor writing. The only good thing about MI 2 and III is the theme song. It goes downhill from there. This is nothing but a vehicle to showcase Cruise. Please spare us and don't make another. They should have stopped with the first one, which was enjoyable. If you want to make your own action/spy movies Tom, don't misuse the ""Mission Impossible"" name!"

","Over hyped at the least. Pretty boy Tom Cruise leaps tall buildings with a single bound...uh-o, strike that. Cruise returns, as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, to move the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE franchise even further. Hunt will swing, slide, roll, leap and levitate if he has to in order to save his charming bride(Michelle Monaghan)and the rest of the world from an evil arms dealer Owen Davian(Philip Seymour Hoffman). The evil arms lord promises Hunt that he will put a bullet through his fair damsel's head, if he doesn't retrieve a mysterious ""white rabbit"" device, that is akin to a ""dooms day"" trigger with the ability to destroy everything. The action takes Hunt to Rome, China and Shanghai. Ving Rhames returns to the IMF team and new comers join Hunt's team: Billy Crudup, Keri Russell, Johathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q. Cruise forgoes any real acting opting to doing most of his own stunts. The finale is romantic and sappy. I was more impressed with Hoffman and Meyers. But IMF fans can rejoice."

","This film is about Ethan Hunt, with a help of some friends, who has to retrieve the ""Rabbit's Foot"" in order to save his newly wed wife.<br/><br/>I have not seen the TV show for the films nor have I seen the first two films of the franchise. I must say, I thought I would just get a big budget action flick that I would remember. That's one reason I liked it. This film surprised me! This is one of the best films of the year!<br/><br/>Yeah, it promises the action and it has plenty of it. It also has the story and the acting. Tom Cruise and other supporting actors/actresses, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, has great performances.<br/><br/>Just like the 007 films, this film is a spy movie with great gadgets and all the things you ever want in an action movie. It's better than the recent Casino Royale, in my opinion. This film offers more action and thrills but the two films are tied with the acting and story.<br/><br/>This film had a disappointing box office. It didn't made as much as people thought it would did and this film deserves to be seen, even though people hate Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>This film is very enjoyable and runs smoothly. From a fan of J.J. Abrams, I loved this movie. This film has action, great acting, and emotion. This popcorn flick is one of the best films of the year!"
"timparis","4","1","2","20 December 2006"," How can a film with so many explosions be so boring?
","I bought this with anticipation that MI3 could not be as weak as MI2, but reaching for the remote to fast forward for the fifth time, I realised that this was not to be.<br/><br/>The film is as flat as a pancake, with no dimension to the plot, and the lead actor is the worst one on screen. I cannot buy into the blind Cruise worship, and love everything he does. It appears that there is only one dimension to his capabilities, and stretched far (for instance Minority Report) he is almost acceptable, but in this case Cruise's already thin acting is almost imperceptible. Humanising an emotionally remote individual was done brilliantly in the Bourne movies, but in MI3 this was done with a paint by numbers sequence of scenes, by an actor who is hopeless at acting with emotion. Putting him up against Philip Seymour Hoffman was a bad idea, as despite a criminally underwritten part, he shows what a great actor can do with any material.<br/><br/>As far as plot is concerned, I have to conclude that the writers forgot to watch any of the original MI1 or the TV series, because it simply bears no resemblance to the origins, or for that matter pays tribute. There are no 'Oh that's clever' bits, so typical of the original shows, and it's so removed I would personally rename this film 'Big Explosions Movie with Tom Cruise Running in a Funny Way' (for funny way, see Shanghai climax scene), as this is all this film is.<br/><br/>There are good points, however, and these are that it looks fabulous, and sounds great too (and that red dress...), but there are so many explosions where there should have been plot, that it becomes dull.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe? That Paramount didn't begin releasing the DVD's of the original shows until this movie had been put on DVD."
"achan0804-1","6","1","2","16 December 2006"," Orgy of stunts and special effects
","This movie is for viewers who like stunts and special effects. Theses are a bit overwhelming and bury the story. I also did not understand what the Vatican is doing in the story of international terrorism ? I have seen the first Mission Impossible which in my opinion was better. Less sensational but the story was more understandable. The director did a good job if this was indeed his first big feature movie. The cast is good and Tom Cruise is his usual self. This movie falls in the category of Da Vinci code where you have to view the movie a couple of times to comprehend the sense of it. In short a movie worthwhile watching!"
"dromasca","7","1","2","9 December 2006"," one of the good action films of the year
","In a year that was not blessed with many good action films (I have yet to see the new James Bond though) MI3 succeeds to catch the eye and offers two good hours of reasonable popular entertainment. The director J.J.Abrams is at his first big studios movie, his record just includes a few episodes in the TV series 'Alias' but the directing hand is sure and there are no major flaws. The story is rather standard in the genre, it does involve some hi-tech gadgets, it takes us in more than one continent, and includes a car chase on a oversea bridge as requires, there is also some romantic and emotional component, which fits well in the story and makes us care about the characters. Tom Cruise seems to enjoy the role, and is that the series are not at their end."

","I saw this movie recently at home on a rented DVD. I must say, I regretted...<br/><br/>... not having seen it on the movie theater.<br/><br/>The action is superb and the story line is very gripping. The portrayal of technology usage by the agents is excellent & believable. The acting is pretty good too. The movie keeps you on your toes with the excitement throughout, and the suspense... that is awesome as well.<br/><br/>What I specially liked about this movie is that it is fast paced. The scene where the suspense is broken is a quick 2 minute scene, which is very well done.<br/><br/>I would rate this higher than MI-2.

Cruise was very good; more convincing and natural in his role as Ethan Hunt than in the first 2 movies.<br/><br/>Story line had a very good flow and the entire cast showed some good acting skills. The action scenes are superb and the fights are not overdone, like in MI-2 (e.g Cruise's kung foo kind of kicks in situation when good old street tactics would have done the job)- you'll be delighted to find that MI-3 fights are just right.<br/><br/>All in all it's one of these rare action movies that gives you a positive exciting feeling.

","I wasn't really into seeing the third Mission Impossible, because the first two in my opinion were just a mirror for Tom Cruise to look into and admire himself, but my boyfriend really wanted to see it and we rented it, I figured that I should just give it a chance. Actually, I'd have to say honestly that I actually liked Mission Impossible 3 the best out of the series, it had a real story and believable stunts.<br/><br/>This time Ethan has a serious girlfriend turned wife, but he must keep his identity a secret from her, which obviously isn't that easy. But he wants to retire and live a normal life, but in his last mission he meets Owan, a politician who wants a ""rabbit foot"", not that kind of a rabbit foot, looks more like a bomb. When Ethan kidnaps him and almost kills him, Owan manages an escape and wants revenge and will make sure that Ethan's wife's last words will be his name.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it was an interesting turn to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a villain, I have to admit that he was a good one. Still, I felt that the story could've been more, but like I said, this felt like a huge improvement from the first two, not to mention that Tom Cruise had a lot to make up for post jumping on couch to, well, you get the idea. But I would recommend the third Mission Impossible for a fun action flick.<br/><br/>7/10"
"james_corck3","8","1","2","10 October 2006"," Third parts are good...sometimes
","Tom Cruise rocks. Yeah, he does, why don't admit it? He made this series of movies what is now, a lot of fun to watch. Just look at the action packed in less than two hours and you will understand that, sometimes, third pats are good.<br/><br/>Why? First reason, a great director trained in TV series media like Lost who is expert in character construction and flashbacks. Second reason, a squirmy loath able villain with the face of Seymour Hoffman (far far away from his Dusyt in Twister) and the mannerisms of Blofeld. Third reason, The Cruiser.<br/><br/>Because Tom is the star of the movie. He saves the day, he fights three guys in an elevator with handcuffs! He runs more than a Cheetah with steroids! And knows how to take a human soul in the middle of all those awesome (awesome=noisy) action sequences (take into account the windmill chopper chase).

","M:I 2 was, frankly, crap, so I had difficulty finding friends who were willing to pay the price of a ticket to see this one with me. But I suspected that, after the disappointment that was the first sequel, they wouldn't have bothered making another one unless they had a really good idea for it. Boy was I right! <br/><br/>I am a seasoned cinemagoer, and I love action films, so I've seen my share of them and then some. You'd think I would be ready to handle more or less anything a screen could throw at me...<br/><br/>As I came out of the cinema from seeing this, with my mouth just gawping with awe, a friend in the group asked me for the phone number of another friend who wasn't there. And as I fumbled with the keys of my cellphone trying to find it for her, I realized why it was being so difficult: My hands were trembling. In fact, my whole body was feeling weak and shaky from all the pent-up tension. No other movie, ever, has done that to me.<br/><br/>There is an old adage in movies that says that, to make a good one, you start with an earthquake and go upwards from there. Well, it may be a joke, but M:I 3 achieves almost exactly that. It is a smorgasbord of non-stop action, a roaring juggernaut which just never gives you a break to get your breath back. Every time you think it has reached a point where things will have to slow down, something happens and you're gripping the arms of your chair once again. Such is the abundance and quality of the action scenes, that at one crucial point of the adventure, the movie is so daring as to momentarily stop following Hunt's quest altogether (!), probably because what is happening at that time would look tame in comparison with with what comes before and after... And it's not just the action per se, you understand. All those scenes would mean nothing to the viewer if they weren't backed up by a gripping and twisty story, which this time includes such a personal element to it that it is almost impossible not to openly cheer for Ethan Hunt when he gets something sorted, or squirm in anguish when he seems to reach a dead end.<br/><br/>I have always considered Die Hard to be the best action film ever made, but now I see this as the only contender strong enough to instill some doubts in that conviction. That's how good it is."

If you think about it, he's once again trying to save his girl from the bad guy against impossible odds.<br/><br/>The Bond series is also plagued with the same malaise, and those guys hope to save the movie by getting box-office stars like Halle Berry to bail it out. They still manage to produce fare that has a little more takeaway than this MI movie series. Only the first MI movie passed muster in my book. But then, I also thought Matrix shouldn't have been a series, and they should've stopped with the first. =shrug= I wish American studios start making movies from good original scripts soon, rather than rely on formula and diving down memory lane to relive past glories.

","Gone are the days of MI, where Tom Cruise was going to hang himself upside down to steal an obscured spy list. Gone are the days when Tom Cruise was going to present a high flying action thriller. MI:III is just disappointing. The good thing is that there may not be anymore MI movies, because if the trend it is to be believed it just gets worse every time. True MI: III may be just better than its predecessor, but still its disappointing. I mean can you believe that the director affords a 3 minute sequence where Ethan Hunt simply stares at his fiancée/wife telling her to trust him. The action is still pretty much same as its predecessor. Full of unbelievable stunts, but the one single one with Agent Hunt falling from the roof is just getting boring right now.<br/><br/>In this sequel we actually get to see how IMF agents make the masks to conceal their identities and go undercover, and although Ethan Hunt may have met his greatest adversary in Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffmann), it still leaves much to be desired. Michelle Monaghan is just superb as Tom Cruise's love interest. Keri Russel also turns out to be decent as Hunt's apprentice, and fellow IMF agent. Ving Rhames as usual is superb in his small part. His witty replies keep the humor rolling. Laurence Fishbourne is also superb in his small role as The head of IMF. Jonathan Rhys Myer is also impressive in his small role, along with Rhames he keeps the humor rolling. Maggie Q does a small cameo as the elusive sexy IMF agent seducing Davian. But overall it leaves a lot to be desired. Screenplay is satisfactory but you don't come to watch a MI movie to be impressed with dialogs.<br/><br/>A very disappointing 6/10..."

","The third in the franchise of MI films has been as much about Cruise and Holmes, Scientology, than it has about Ethan Hunt's latest escapade. Cruise has had much publicity, mostly bad, in the build up but after all is said and done, MI3 ends up being a rip roaring blockbuster. It's back to being a Mission Impossible film, it's got the team, the gadgets, the espionage. It has an MI feel lacking, especially in the second instalment. JJ Abram's in his big screen directorial debut does a great job. This is slam bang, thank you mam! Forget the plot, it doesn't matter, but there's enough twists and turns to keep in theme.<br/><br/>The film is just great fun. The plot doesn't get too convoluted, like the first film, and it's not bogged down with lameness like the second. It's just a simple plot, keeping within the elements that work in this sort of film. While Abram's stylish direction, is flashy without feeling hollow and too Hollywood blockbuster. He keeps a nice quick pace to the proceedings and cranks up the action when he needs to. Cruise is excellent in action hero mode once again, and of course does his dues with the stunt work as well. What's great though is this isn't all about the Cruise, it's about his team too. He needs the team this time round and it's very much a team movie. John Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Larry Fishbourne, Billy Crudup all do their bit here with good support, while the gorgeous Michelle Monaghan is effervescent. It's Simon Pegg though who stands out, managing to steal all his scenes.<br/><br/>This is just good fun all round, and certainly better than the second film. However I feel that the first film has more standout moments and the opening 40 minutes in Prague were excellent, unsurpassed in the trilogy of MI films. Still in terms of action films, MI3 is a good simplistic ride. ***"

","The latest of the Mission: Impossible film series (very, very loosely related to the '60s TV show), which has restored the title's credibility.<br/><br/>After a terrible Mission: Impossible 2 and years in development, JJ Abrams' writing and direction have delivered, along with Tom Cruise, a great slice of movie greatness. A fairly easy-to-follow, yet still sufficiently ""spy-complex"", plot is good with a deadly villain and (as usual) superhuman Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>From the start with one of cinema's greatest opening sequences, it's clear that this film isn't going to take the easy route. Especially when a new girl gets her brain fried by Cruise and a defibrilator. Then there's the jaw-dropping set pieces like sliding down a massive building. Well done Tom, maybe there is something to this Scientology stuff...<br/><br/>At the moment, you're wondering why I've given it 9 not 10. Well, for one thing, I spent two hours watching a film that pretty much centred around ""the Rabbit's Foot"", and by the time I get to the end, I'm still as clueless as I was at the start as to what on Earth the Foot is (except it's a ""biohazard""). Then there's Ethan's superhuman abilities to run through armies of gunfire and escape with a small cut. Then there's the overly sweet ending where Hunt and wife are fine and perfectly in love and seem to have gotten over near-death. But all in all, the mission impossible of recovering the franchise after the dreaful M:I-2 has been completed."

","The third and hopefully final ""Mission Impossible"" is so unoriginal and so uneven that it's more like ""Mission To Not Be Nauseous: Impossible."" Even the trademark James Bondian moments are borderline dull. JJ proves himself to be a spastic, hack director who can't leave the camera alone. I was nearly nauseated by the early constant camera cuts. Did anyone else notice the annoying cuts and useless zooms during the house party scene? No character was on screen for more then three seconds before JJ cut to something else. (Even shots of the dog). Oh, and the dialogue is stiffly Shatnerian.<br/><br/>Viewed only in the context of the big, stupid FX film that it is, the movie has its moments.

In fact, nearly every moment meant to punch you in the gut and take your breath away, kicks you in the shin and leaves you annoyed instead. The viewer should be on the edge of the seat, but the viewer is too annoyed to do so.<br/><br/>The sour performances of the talented thespians casted for this movie are equally grimace- inspiring, and smell of the same Abrams contamination.<br/><br/>Hoffman and Cruise were clearly able to use their star-power to rise above Abrams's incompetence in their shared scenes, but any moment with any lesser characters are completely dominated by general ho-hummery.<br/><br/>It's the weakest of the series despite all of the potential it held.

I'm glad it didn't have too much of that mask thing--MI2 was way overdone with that, and it made it kind of corny, though not to say with this one.

Anyways, I was on the edge of my seat all the time, and there were funny parts, too. There were shocks and surprises, but that's good too.

","Super secret agent Ethan Hunt is tasked with locating and apprehending Owen Davian, a notorious illegal arms dealer, and when the mission goes awry Hunt finds that his personal life and the life of the rest of the world hang in the balance.<br/><br/>With this film Tom Cruise has finally outdone himself. His superstar status has finally given him an ego to think that no matter what he stars in will draw good crowds and an overall likable, though not fully serious movie. Whoops. Mission most definitely not accomplished.<br/><br/>The first ""Mission: Impossible"" was a great action movie because it was all about the suspense and action built into a good plot. ""Mission: Impossible II"" was a great action movie also. It was more about the action then suspense, but with John Woo at the helm it was stylish and hugely entertaining movie. It had some terrible scenes, most notably the playing out of the romantic link between Ethan Hunt and Nyah, but those were all secondary to the all-out action and pulsing thrills provided by the rest of the movie. Both ""M:I"" and ""M:I II"" had great stylish directions by top of the line directors and they took themselves for what they were: action movies.<br/><br/>With ""M:I III"" we are treated to a ""The Bourne Supremacy"" ripoff visual style that has no place in a silly summer blockbuster. The Bourne film was a more serious movie from good and in-depth source material that used the edgy camera style to show the protagonists inner struggle with himself. It served for a more gritty and realistic presentation of the action. If this was the first entry in this franchise than that would have been OK, but it's not, it is the third. The third movie in an action franchise that is about thrills and action, not a characters inner struggle with himself. The gritty and shaky tone along with the hugely unnecessary drama are painfully out of place here. There are stellar production values and some decent pyrotechnics, but the overall tone spoils pretty much all the fun that you had with those very things in the first two films.<br/><br/>Also, what comes as a huge surprise and disappointment is the big down playing of the hero - Ethan Hunt. In one scene when he breaks into a high tech lab we see none of what he does inside to get what he is looking for. Instead, in a truly ridiculous directorial move, we stay outside with secondary characters one of whom is reciting a nonsense prayer that she used to as a kid. Does this fit? If you watch the film, it actually does, but is it more entertaining than the heroics of the lead character that are being omitted - definitely not. This same thing happens in the conclusion of the film when the hero is omitted from the final action climax in another stupid directorial/story move. In fact the whole movie omits that terrifically exciting climax that the first two movies had. No spectacular set pieces just a mundane fight through which our hero literally sleeps. Oh and more ""drama"" is also served at the end.<br/><br/>Basically, everything that made the first two enjoyable is gone and everything that brought down the second one in a few scenes has been increased to absurd proportions. Such a waste of good talent and potential. 2/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence and intense action"

Maybe, each time they were stuck, they chose to kill some instead of searching new solutions and thinking more, however, it was not easy to explain it to him..

","Once again the Mission: Impossible franchise has got a new director, this time TV director JJ Abrams, and it has only improved matters. I've never been a huge fan of the second film, but love the first, especially as it really feels like a spy film  there's barely a shot fired throughout and it requires some effort of thought. What I don't like about the second film is the lack of a team, or at least a team that has some proper role instead of sitting on the sidelines.<br/><br/>This, fortunately, is one of the many things about the new Mission: Impossible that has been fixed. It has also been given a more human element  this time Ethan Hunt has a fiancé, and we get to see the non-IMF side of the character. Granted, these scenes are not numerous but they come in mostly later into the film, and it is a part of the franchise that thus far had been missing. Better still, JJ Abrams shows himself to be a very competent action director, and gives us some scenes that rank amongst the series' best. Particularly stunning is an air vs. ground assault set on a bridge, where Hunt and his team must fight off a plane and a helicopter full of troops from the ground. <br/><br/>The cast all excel themselves as well. Tom Cruise is as excellent as ever, showing both the spy side and the gentleman side of his character with conviction. Also good are Hunts' team (comprising, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who have more to do this time round and are always on hand to back Ethan up. There's also a scene stealing Simon Pegg, who plays the office computer geek, and adds plenty of fine humour to proceedings. The standout has to be Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, Owen Davian. He is genuinely creepy and utterly ruthless; when he threatens Hunt's fiancé, we feel like he really means it  he is definitely one of the more memorable villains we have seen for a long time. <br/><br/>Another bonus is the relation to the title. Unlike the first two films, this one really does seem like an impossible mission  Davian is always one step ahead, and even when you think things are heading in IMF's favour they're not. It makes you wonder just how they're going to succeed when they are up against such odds, and keeps the tension high.<br/><br/>There are, however, some niggles which after a while begin to really bug the viewer. First up is the camera, which utilises the increasingly popular 'shaky cam'. This is OK to an extent, if used clever and liberally, but the whole film seems shot with it, even the more dramatic scenes, which could really do with a more static camera. It's a problem because it becomes very noticeable, and thus infuriating. It also means the action scenes can at times look muddled, which is a shame because they really are good. The locations, spanning Rome, Shanghai, and Berlin, are exciting but don't serve the story  each sequence could be substituted for anywhere else with no loss to the overall plot, and this seems odd. Why set a scene in the Vatican when it is really unnecessary?<br/><br/>My final negative is the introduction scene. I won't give anything away, but it's one of those 'flash forward' scenes that show you what is coming up. It is annoying because the viewer is left waiting for that scene to come around. All scenes such as this annoy me though, so it's down to personal taste.<br/><br/>I still can't decide whether it is the best of the trilogy or not. Whilst the action is great, it feels so distant from what Mission: Impossible used to be that it is more of a generic action film than a true spy film. It is a good film, and shows us what is possible from the franchise, but it's not quite there yet. Hopefully, if there is a number 4, it will get it all right.<br/><br/>Rated: 7.5/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","I must say I think DePalma's version was clever and fun to weave through, while this one focuses more on Hunt's running abilities. Tom Cruise gives us lots of ""intense"" looks while breathing as hard as possible. It's like they shoulda campaigned for Michael Mann to direct so everything could break off in pieces and randomly explode. The plot is just average and lacks the initial wow factor of the first. Phillip Seymore Hoffman does what he can do with the shallow screenplay and acts his ass off as usual. The action is definitely up to par with the summer kick, and pulls no punches in how far it goes. There are a couple cool gadgets throughout, and not to mention missile throwing helicopters. With it's fun it compromises some key elements to a good movie. Tom cruise does his best to over act Ethan Hunt's character. The plot was so thin, i could slice through it with a butter knife.and The ""twists"" are easy and predictable. It just doesn't have that classy spy-thriller feel that the first M:I: had. It's like they dumbed down for the audience. We never find out what the ""rabbit's foot"" does or is, only left to assume. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun and semi-engaging movie. It just doesn't live up to the hype it was given or the rating is sustains on IMDb. When I think of Mission Impossible, I think classy and mentally engaging (of course totally disregarding M:I: 2) and this just doesn't stay close. I'd make this comment more witty and interesting except I'm tired and watching Family Guy. 6/10."
"pyrocitor","8","1","2","20 May 2006"," All an action movie should be
","Mission Impossible 3<br/><br/>With each movie in a series attempting to up the bar of the first two, it wouldn't have been easy to get the idea of Mission: Impossible 3 being a disappointment. After all, it would be hard to top either the intrigue and suspense of the first film, or the heart-pounding, back to basics action sequences of the second, especially with a first time director at the helm. However, J.J. Abrams, creator of such TV shows ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" turns out to know what he's doing a lot more than one might give him credit for, creating in the end a very solid and wonderfully enjoyable action flick. <br/><br/>In terms of action sequences, M:I3 definitely ups the ante over the first two, even the second's motorcycle chase and martial arts fight to the finish at the end. Safe to say if you go into the movie expecting to see things blown up, you will get more than your money's worth. But M:I3 also returns more to the twisty, breathlessly suspenseful of Brian De Palma's original, with a fair amount of plot twists ahoy. They may not ever be totally unexpected, but safe to say even moviegoers more experienced with this sort of ""twist a minute"" genre may find a couple of genuine surprises in store. <br/><br/>There is definitely a sufficient plot to justify all of the very satisfying action sequences, and the filmmakers are blessed with a substantially better script this time round, providing us with actual character development and finally a bit of genuine motivation for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, who even seems less like a paper thin carbon copy of James Bond this time around, though the similarities are still inescapable, and rest assured that no matter how much the quality of the M:I films increases, Hunt will still never reach 007 status. There is also the plus of the focus of the film being less the Tom Cruise action hour, and giving more space for a wonderful supporting cast, reviving the team feel of the beginning of the first movie... more the intent of the IMF organization rather than solo missions all the time. A high point is Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames) and Hunt having a rapid-fire discussion about marriage and relationships during a furious raid of the vatican, with occasional comic input from fellow team member Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers).<br/><br/>Cruise does what he does best again here, but at this point despite how all other aspects of the franchise have increased, Cruise himself doesn't really seem to be quite as at ease as in past films, and we start to lose interest in his character, despite the very appreciated character development. It's more in the wonderful supporting cast that the true performance joy emerges. M:I3 seems to have served the function of, if nothing else, showcasing a new generation of very talented and capable, and, to this point, mostly unrecognizable actors and actresses, who, if there is any justice, should make it big in the industry any day now. Keep your eye on Jonathan Rhys Meyers, (who also impressed in this year's Match Point) Keri Russel, and personal favorite, Michelle Monaghan, as Cruise's fiancée, who also gave a hilarious turn in this year's excellent, but very overlooked film ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", who all gave wonderful and very enjoyable performances. <br/><br/>Billy Crudup and Lawrence Fishburne also give great performances as Hunt's superiors, and British actor Simon Pegg just about walks away with the movie, showing his effortless comedic talents as Hunt's tech savvy associate. It is of course great to see Ving Rhames return once again as Hunt's close friend and co-agent Luther Stickel. And then there's Philip Seymour Hoffman, who, as would be anticipated, effortless steals the film away without question from all his fellow actors. Hoffman shows how very talented an actor he is by following up his Oscar winning turn in Capote as a truly chilling and evil to the bone villain. Here is an antagonistic figure who we genuinely love to hate, and Hoffman works his far too short screen time to full effect - one of the most powerful screen villains in recent history. <br/><br/>All in all, M:I3 should be considered worth watching: very frequent, and incredibly satisfying action setpieces masked by an actually decent storyline, and some genuine quality acting. It may not be anything too memorable, there is definitely a sense of fishing for the original (Hunt attacks yet another corporation building from above and such...) and you're not likely to take anything too profound out of it , but for a highly enjoyable night out at the movies, you need look no further.<br/><br/>-8/10"

They then pull the typical plot line of a secret agent getting married, and all of the ""you shouldn't do that in this line of work"" business. THEN in like 5 minutes of movie after Cruise gets married, the guy he is chasing after kidnaps his wife, and uses her as ransom to get cruise to get some item called ""the rabbits foot"". This ""rabbits foot"" is the equivalent of some thermos with a biohazard symbol stamped on it. *COUGH*NONSENSE*COUGH*. If this wasn't enough, even at the END of the movie THEY NEVER TELL YOU WHAT THE RABBITS FOOT REALLY WAS!! They only tell you that some arms dealer was selling it for 800 million to someone, and that it is important enough for someone to have to blackmail Ethan into getting it. Also, they never tell you why the guy that blackmailed Ethan couldn't get the item himself...ALSO they make this big schpeal about how the rabbits foot is in this building guarded by all these people and somehow Ethan (Cruise) gets it inside of 2 minutes, and jumps out a window with it...they never even show the inside of the building the ""rabbits foot"" is stored in the whole time Cruise is in there, trying to break it out.

","The third instalment of the MI series attempts to add a little ""depth"" to the proceedings by giving our hero a fiancé (played by Michelle Monaghan) to further intricate the matters of Ethan Hunt. In the meantime we have Philip Seymour Hoffman in full-on Mr Nasty as Owen Davian as the man who must be stopped this time. He is after a container known as the ""white rabbit"" the contents of which is never revealed. Could it be a deadly virus? A bomb? A code? A dead animal? Who knows (or cares).<br/><br/>As Ethan and Davian play the deadly cat-and-mouse game the film never stops making things go boom! We see our protagonist impersonate a priest, wear a latex mask with a voice depreciater, manage to swing from building to building, slide down the side of one only to grab on to the edge (yes! he made it!). Apparently if you are a known arms-dealing terrorist you can have access to all sorts of helicopters and and soldiers and blow up bridges without anyone noticing.<br/><br/>From start to finish MI:3 is complete and utter nonsense. Anyone who has recently been watching directer Abrams' TV phenomenon Lost will know just how much sense of disbelief he demands from his audience. But since the film really pushes for its key demographic (spotty, boyish teenagers) you can't really blame it. Picking on the film's lunacy is unfair, as a standard genre film it is darn entertaining. If anything the potent boisterousness of Cruise's latest action vehicle makes for a rather amusing experience on top of the first class action scenes. If you are beyond the horny teenage years you may roll your eyes when Hunt's foot-partner Luther Strickell starts talking to him about his wife in the middle of an explosion spree, yet you can't help but crack a smile at the actually-slightly-campiness of it all. What's more the film is certainly darker than the previous two. Hoffman's bad guy really spits the vile at our hero like nobody's business, to create a great foil for our lead. And stuff about explosive charges in the head may leave some slightly ill-at-ease. Yet don't despair: the ridicule never stops in this one - when the film reveals the outcome of the opening scene you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>But what's wrong with an empty-headed couple of hours? MI:3 is nothing more than a case of ""If you missed the last explosion, don't worry, there will be another one along shortly"". And who can argue with that? It delivered exactly what you could hope for. And it kicks the hell out of MI:2."

Okay, thats a little lame, but still. After about 10-15 minutes you have figured out the whole plot already and this with a disturbing dizziness from the constant shaking camera. The whole film, by the way, feel like a middle-thing of a made-for-TV-movie and blockbuster, but mostly, the plot feels like a elongated episode of a regular TV-show. Worst is the ending, it ends very mildly, and it plays right in to the spectators most obvious prediction.<br/><br/>Good things.

Tom Cruise is (with exception of his crazy running around) good, as always, but gets blown away by the performance of the glorious Seymour-Hoffman (who should be in all films, if you ask me... I just love him). The MIF-team feels comfortable with each other, and makes for a more pleasant ride. Last, there are a few scenes that are pretty cool, but they are to short, like the bridge sequence (maybe the best action in the whole flick). All in all, a very mediocre film. I am sort of disappointed... I mean, this is summer 2006, and something new has to come, but not from MI:3."
"Lucanus","4","1","2","10 May 2006"," Could have established the M:i franchise, but ends up being more self-serving than anything else.
","I went into this film without any real expectations. I had heard mixed reviews and so I watched it with an open mind, hoping for more of the Mission:Impossible magic which started with the first film and was expanded upon (again, with mixed reviews) in M:i:II.<br/><br/>The plot was good, and had enough twists and turns built into it to ensure that the viewer could have been thrown all over their chair as it jinxed it's way across the screen, but, sadly, some of those opportunities seem to have been sacrificed for what I can only guess is self-serving propaganda on the part of Mr Cruise.<br/><br/>The idea of Ethan being recalled from semi-retirement into active field duties to recover one of his students who has been captured was an interesting lead-in. However questions are raised regarding the relationship he had with his former student and none of those questions are really put to bed in any comprehensive way. The closest we get is Luther being told that Ethan considered her to be like his sister to which he replies ""Did you ever f**k your sister?"", but that's as close to enlightened as we get.<br/><br/>The juggling act which Ethan has to do trying to have a normal life an relationship as well as maintain his activities with the IMF is a nice feature in this film too. Even if it is a little close to ""True Lies"" in some respects.<br/><br/>What disappointed me the most, however, was the conclusion of the film. Davian has Ethan's wife held captive and is threatening to shoot her in front of Ethan. When I was watching this I was sure that they were going to kill her off, a la James Bond, and so establish Ethan as an eternal bachelor unable to maintain a real emotional relationship and instead committing completely to the job and the adventures. Instead, it's almost as those the film changes gears, with it going from a testosterone-fueled boys film to a soft and sappy testimonial by Mr Cruise, trying to show the world that he can be a loving and caring husband rather than a cavalier playboy.<br/><br/>Very disappointing. I am all for happy endings in films, but when that results in the main character just about being retired from the franchise, I baulk a little.<br/><br/>It's an interesting film, with some funky gadgets (even if, for the nerds out there some glaring factual errors are evident - like using alligator clips on 10baseT cable to hack a data connection), some big explosions and some good fight scenes. But it lacks the depth and substance it could have had if it remained true to the M:i vein rather than the Cuise-promoting bandwagon."

Well the music does recall the first two and Hoffman just off his Oscar for ""Capote"" immediately jumps on a suspense summer flick. Sorry Phil no Oscar for this one. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has again returned but of course battles along side a villain, Owen (Hoffman). The two fiends fighting for the valuable rabbit's foot. If the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise turns out to be anything like BOND'S then we are in for some serious melodramatic, overplayed, world domination (!) that won't let up.

"DKosty123","7","1","2","8 May 2006"," Excellent Action & Well Written-Best of Film Mission Series
","Old television series have had a poor history of being made into films. In the last decade, clinkers have been made out of successful series such as The Beverly Hillbillies & Bewitched. Even the first 2 installments of Mission Impossible seemed closer to the films versions of other successful shows, failures both in getting back to the form which made them a success in the small box media. This film is an exception, as for once, this third installment gets it right.<br/><br/>It opens with an interesting scene from later in the picture which looks like the film climax, only it isn't. This sleight of hand is chosen from such a perfect point in the film, that it makes it easy to follow the flashback from the beginning. The action is nearly non-stop as is Tom Cruise who seems to be in at least 90 % of the scenes in the film. So not only is the action satisfying, but if your a big Cruise fan, you get much more Cruise in this than many of his other starring films over the years.<br/><br/>If there is anyone short changed here, it is those who want lots of females. Yes the film has attractive females, but they really only appear in about 20 to 30% of the scenes & most of their characters are more background than anything, though essential to the plot. Male actors don't really fare much better in this respect, this really is a Tom Cruise dominated film. The only way you can hate this one if if you don't like action or Cruise. That should not be many people.<br/><br/>This filmpulls you in very well with the opening sequence & credits & holds on to you until the finish. The only time the film stops is with the ending which might be the only dull moments in the film. After concluding the last mission (there are at least 3 missions jammed into this film), there are a couple of slow moments when Cruise is explaining to his wife Julie what has just happened. I am not sure how this ending could have been punched up but after solid action for the rest of the film, you actually appreciate the rest at the end so that when the closing theme music kicks in, you walk out of the theater humming that great old TV theme song again.<br/><br/>This one is worth seeing as you can almost feel the fuse burning as it jumps from sequence to sequence without rest."

","Whilst MI 1 & II are a distant memory, what made them, and indeed any good action film good, is tension. Something which this film completely lacked. The love interest wasn't convincing, there was nothing that really set their relationship up to be so very special, and there was never really a decent element of danger. Plus, the whole 'rabbits foot' thing. Do we care about something we don't know about? Only marginally, because it ""could"" be catastrophic, but then again, there wasn't enough evidence for it to be convincingly so.<br/><br/>Laugh out loud funny when the ""We're Americans, we go in and do what we do best - infrastructure, democracy blah blah blah..."" bit came out.

"AdventurePenguin","3","1","2","8 May 2006"," Mission Ridiculous
","When you go to see a Mission: Impossible movie, you have a certain set of expectations set by the others that have come before it. Primarily, that there will be espionage and intrigue, like on the television series, and that there will be plenty of cool action pieces, such as the previous two films. And in it's own unique way, Mission: Impossible 3, or the extremely marketable and radical M:i:III, as it likes to be called, fails all of the expectations it builds and neglects to blow up.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt, after two movies full of explosions, double crosses, and plenty of high tech gadgets, has decided to settle down and start a family with the cute and uninteresting Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who is apparently appealing because she both Trusts Him and Is Concerned. Having found happiness, Hunt is immediately contacted by an IMF liaison to meet with him at a nearby 7-Eleven, where they talk shop while browsing over some Ritz crackers and Oreos. Hunt's student, Lindsey Ferris, has been captured and is being held behind enemy lines! However, Hunt is out of the game, so he grabs a candy bar and heads out the door, but not before grabbing the secret message hidden in the Kodak disposable camera on the way.<br/><br/>What follows is a quickly edited but slowly paced romp across the world to find The Rabbit's Foot, a macguffin of supposedly destructive potential that everyone under the sun wants for various reasons. Bad guy Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wants it to sell to the Middle East, because that would be appropriately evil, and John Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) of the Impossible Mission Force wants it because without it, we wouldn't have a plot.<br/><br/>The race to get the Rabbit's Foot first leads us on a variety of high tech capers, from storming office buildings in Japan, to raiding the Vatican on a kidnapping mission, and everything in between. Many of these capers all involve seemingly cool elements from the previous films, such as Tom Cruise repelling down on a wire and landing inches above the floor (which happens twice in this movie), to Cruise leaping out of a shattered office building window and pulling his parachute to glide to safety (which we unfortunately only get to see once). Everything else is your standard ultra techie and unrealistic heist crap, with characters bypassing dozens of elaborate security systems with relative ease and little excitement. Gee, ever wonder for a moment if something will go wrong with their plan? Of course not! This is Tom Cruise we are talking about here! Tom is also joined by Mission: Impossible regular Ving Rhames, who spends the entire movie lecturing Hunt about why he shouldn't be in a relationship with someone. I kept hoping he'd spit out another classic line, like ""That punk put a hole in my Versace!"" but no dice. Cruise and Rhames are also joined by two extra team mates, who serve no real purpose. Each of them get an obligatory Character Development Scene in order to distinguish them from flat, two dimension characters, which they clearly are not.<br/><br/>But the really stand out performance in this movie belongs solely to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is trying his hardest throughout the film to flush his Oscar straight down the toilet. Hoffman wanders the film with a drunken expression that somehow fails to emote Evil Murderous Bad Guy. The only time he really seems to show his character is during the scene in the previews, where he threatens to kill Hunt, murder his wife, shoot his dog, pee on his rug, and trample his fish. That being done, he immediately hits up the hash again, and just stares blankly as the rest of the movie passes him by.<br/><br/>I honestly don't recommend this movie at all. The set pieces are uninteresting, the plot is uninspired to say the least, and the action is fundamentally boring. There is not a single scene in the film to get your blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing. I literally walked out of the film at one point to get a glass of ice from the concession stand, simply so I could witness something engaging going on, such as solid dialog (""Can I have some ice?"" ""Sure."") and a reasonable conclusion (""Here you go.""). While I'm sure an audience for this film exists, I highly recommend renting a better spy thriller, like say, Agent Cody Banks, rather than giving Mission: Ridiculous a try."

This movie didn't for fill ANY AT ALL of the expectations I was looking for. This movie was absolute garbage for many reasons.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise......I couldn't feel his acting at all. It was dreadful. During many of the scenes I felt none of the emotion he was trying to set, and when he tried to act it was horrible and I didn't know when he tried to show emotion cause it was so horrible. The only good actor was Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>The special effects made me laugh hysterically. The explosions were horrible, the gun scenes, and many other parts were horrible. I tried to let my mind turn off and let me just watch them to try and make them look real but I just couldn't do it. The special effects were so lousy, I could tell every time when it was fake.<br/><br/>The plot, so original. Let's see, guy takes prisoner/hostage, asks for item or they die. Oh where have we seen this before.....Like every other movie maybe? Except in other movies they're asking for money. A five year old could have written this plot.<br/><br/>Now if you have half a mind and think during the movie you see many weird, confusing things. First of all, how does Ethan know EXACTLY where to go in each building like he's been there 50 thousand times? Many of the other scenes made no sense and were stupid but I won't say cause it's partly spoilers.<br/><br/>Well that's my view on the movie, and how I found NOTHING good about this movie and it does not deserve to be watched more then one time."

A high point was that the newly-rescued female actually rose to the occasion and rescued her rescuer, instead of pulling a Buttercup-vs-the-ROUS pathetic copout. So that's why I give it a 3 instead of a 2! Will we ever see Tom Cruise play a character who actually dies? I hope it will happen in my lifetime.

","I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, particularly in light of his recent limelight antics. I have to admit I was not too excited to see MI:3 at all.<br/><br/>On that note, I was pleasantly surprised. It was slightly less ""Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise... imitating some sort of a character"" than I expected. Cruise's characters never quite break too far from one another. But in this case, the character was shallow. So... no harm, no foul.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the plot seemed shallow to me. I think a large part of the problem lies in Hoffman's villain. He's simply not quite dark or deep enough to be believable to me to make this movie work correctly. The movie sets him out to be one of those ""invisible"" masterminds of the underworld, but we never truly see his underworld, nor his invisibility.<br/><br/>The other problem is with the Rabbit's Foot itself. Sure-- we get that it has a bio-hazard label on it. Which means it's probably some dirty bomb, in light of current political climate fears. But other than by name (and a visible image of the cannister), we don't know what the Rabbit's Foot is. Nor are we given a reason to care about its broader implications to mankind. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a popcorn flick. A harmless, kick back for an action movie type movie. Not that great, but not horrible, either."

The third MI movie yields great improvement plot-wise, but I still guessed who the bad guy was half way through the movie. However, this didn't spoil the enjoyable factors that this flick contains (in fact, judging how it goes, I don't think they care if you guessed who the bad guy is right at the beginning). They've found the right guy to play the protagonist (living up to his Oscar halo), who gave a wonderful performance that convinced me he truly is cold-blooded (I'm a fan now). They've found the right person to play Ethan's wife, too (although not a big name yet, she did a fantastic job, as opposed to in the first two MIs, the main female protagonists were only for show). They've also found the right guys to play Ethan's superiors and partners. The missions carried out were a bit unrealistic and seemed a bit too easy, but because Ethan and his working partners displayed tremendous talents and skills entailed to the idealistic intelligence agents in our ideal minds, plus the right tempo of the action that rise your heartbeat, this is all in all a very good entertainment. Just don't start thinking why the hell things seem so easy for them."

","Perhaps I'm a bit disappointed only because I've been waiting intently since 2000 for the third installment of the Mission: Impossible series, but JJ Abrams's version just doesn't seem to stand out against today's action movies as much as the first two did.<br/><br/>The first stood out not so much as an action movie, but a cool spy movie with a few extremely memorable scenes that will never be forgotten (Cruise on the cable, the Chunnel scene, etc.). It had its own cool vibe going on.<br/><br/>The second was Woo action, and boy howdy, did I love it. Sure, it wasn't the same M:I we were used to, but it worked. There were some real cool action scenes that still exist in my mind as some of my favorites (Biocyte Infiltration, Motorcycle chase, etc.). It had Woo written all over it, and was, in my opinion, the perfect model for what a brainless summer blockbuster should be.<br/><br/>Now comes JJ Abrams's version that seems to be a bit more formulaic. There were definitely some cool action scenes (cars being blown up on a Chesapeake Bay bridge, a helicopter chase through windmills, etc.), but they, for the most part, didn't seem to really be... distinguishable.<br/><br/>And the movie follows in that respect, too. At the moment, it all seemed like an exciting assault of the senses (critics say it like it's a bad thing), but later on, it's rather forgettable. And that's what makes me disappointed.<br/><br/>If you're just out to see a good action movie and nothing more, you should be very pleased with this. However, if you're a die-hard M:I fan like myself, you might find yourself thinking at times that this is just an action movie that has a similar cast to the other M:I films, but not an actual M:I film itself. I guess, for me, it just didn't scream ""I AM MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE! I WILL FREAKING ROCK YOU!"" as much as it said ""Hey, I'm a good action movie, but nothing you haven't already seen."" It's fun, but tragically, forgettable."
"Arthur-23","Null","1","2","6 May 2006"," This film should have been called ""Malias""...
","From the creators of the TV show ""Alias,"" we now have ""Malias""... or the male version of Jennifer Garner's famous spy role. For anyone not familiar with ABC's Alias, Mission Impossible III is a great movie. But for anyone who knows Alias' various tricks and plot twists might be less impressed. On the one hand, Tom Cruise does a fine job. He played his character well. The action sequences, especially the ones in Shanghai, were very effective, but, in making M:I-3, director and co-writer J.J. Abrams seems to have drawn heavily on two of his prior TV shows---Felicity and Alias---for inspiration, both in terms of style (the party scene near the beginning seemed inspired by Felicity) and plot twists and action scenes inspired by Alias. Of course, there are cast overlaps among all three with Felicity's Keri Russell and Felicity/Alias's Greg Grunberg playing all-too-brief roles in M:I-3. However, it's unfortunate that Keri could not have played a more developed character in the film. Nonetheless, these earlier influences were obvious from the very first scene, which used a typical Alias forward/backward plot device that's been used in virtually every season of Alias. The scene starts in the future then we spend three quarters of the movie backtracking to discover how we got to that first scene. Then we see the manipulation. And bang, bang the spy saves the world again. Just like Alias this is true of M:I-3. Considering the action scenes alone, however, they really were impressive, particularly those of Tom Cruise running through the streets of Shanghai and leaping off of buildings. Camera angles were perfect. But viewing Mission Impossible III makes one believe that Alias could make an effective transition from television to the silver screen. ""Alias, The Movie"" could make for an even better film since its plots are more complex than M:I-3. But with Tom Cruise as the male version of the central spy, his performance as ""Malias"" delivers the goods. For that this movie deserves 7/10 with an extra point for anyone unfamiliar with the classic TV show on which this movie seems to be based.... not ""Mission Impossible"" but ""Alias."""

I just remembered zombies outside a pub every time he showed up on screen. One minute you are in Mission Impossible land and the next minute the illusion has gone and you are down The Winchester. It was like John Cleese popping up in a Bond film. ""What is HE doing here??"" Maybe it is because I am a Brit and when I hear a solitary English accent in a crowd of Americans it really stands out.

"raysond","Null","1","2","5 May 2006"," Mission:Impossible III-The Third Installment
","And this was against sizable odds by the way which gave it a sense that the franchise itself played out and not to mention its star much overexposed,but in all fairness,the third installment to the Mission:Impossible series really delivers the goods and then some in one of the most action packed thrilling roller-coaster ride of the summer. This is largely a result of an expertise television director J.J. Abrams(of ""Alias"" and ""Lost"") who KNOWS have a stage various action sequences and knows how to keep audiences enthralled from one scene to the next. Abrams raises the tension level to a maximum and also it is a cliché that will leave your pulse racing for more and more to follow. However,""Mission:Impossible III"" makes up for what the other two installments basically missed since Abrams masterfully energized the series by taking a predictable and tired franchise with his signature style and does the impossible which was something the other two directors from the last two films tried to successfully accomplished,but still the last two installments were megamoney makers. Again,Tom Cruise returns as special IMF agent Ethan Hunt who is called back to duty to take on one of the ruthless villains he has every had to face with....a sadistic arms dealer and vengeful psychopath who is played masterfully and wonderfully innovative by best-actor Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It is Hoffman by the way that gives this film its sheer brilliance and raises the bar with just his presence along with the rest of the cast with includes Ving Rhames,Jonathan Rhys-Meyers,Billy Crudup,Michelle Monaghan,and Laurence Fishburne as a creepy IMF associate was well chosen indeed.<br/><br/>The best moments in the film are just absolutely breathless to begin with,especially the stunts where Cruise's character of Ethan Hunt jumps off a skyscraper and dangles upside down,gets run over by a semi tractor-trailer,and leaps across a 15-foot gap as a bridge is blown apart,not to mention the breathtaking helicopter chase where Hunt is being pursed by Hoffman's ruthless henchman. As far as the love story is concern between Cruise and Monaghan is basically the weakest link but the action sequences and its gritty nerve-racking scene where Hoffman's psychopath is on the scene which includes a a horrific sequence with Cruise,Hoffman,and Monaghan is the the best climatic part yet and more of it follows towards the end where the battle between Hoffman and Cruise really escalates. In other words,this a hip new installment of that has been resurrected to a cool approach and from there Tom Cruise and Company have done it again..taking a old concept and give it a new look. Simply Brilliant."

I guess it's so females will be interested but I'm a female and I couldn't have cared less about that part. But the action scenes were top-notch. I don't think I've seen a movie that was more actiony really. Imo, this is how James Bond movies should be. They're always a little too slow for me. They should be this action packed. And I believe this movie is the definition of action packed.<br/><br/>The cast was great. Here you have really good actors in a movie that probably doesn't require good acting but it's nice to see that they can do this as well. Philip Seymour Hoffman I thought made a cracklin' good villain. He wasn't in it as much I thought but he was great. I actually liked him better here than in Capote. I don't think I've ever seen Maggie Q before. I think I would have remembered because she is absolutely gorgeous. A nice addition to the team. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a favorite of mine and there wasn't as much of him as I'd hoped but I'm just glad that he's getting roles like this one. Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup were good as usual but I got a little confused about what was going on with their characters at one point. And Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. Either you love him or hate him but you're still going to watch his movies and this one is highly entertaining. It's definitely a blockbuster that's worth seeing. The stunts this man does. There is one scene where he is running that it so impressive. Probably the least dangerous of the action scenes but to me that was the best.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like action movies you should definitely see it."

","Experience told me not to expect much of sequels - especially those of high-budget, insanely-popular, heavily branded (and franchised) titles. Excitement, however, told Experience to shut up. But after a rather confused mental stage set by last year's major non-fulfillment, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", you didn't quite know what to expect.<br/><br/>Here's the verdict: Guilty. Mission: Impossible III is guilty of inciting excitement, heightening one's senses, taking logic and throwing it right out of the window. And, worst of all, succeeding.<br/><br/>Even without a good-enough plot-line, without much creativity, without much acknowledgment of reality and without anything outstanding you expect out of a monumental Cruise flick - it holds up. In fact, it holds up pretty high. The visual effects are simply outstanding (not that you expect anything less from 'Industrial Light & Magic'), sound is stunning and the action just doesn't yield. <br/><br/>Although M:I-3 employs a tried and tested formula for the plot, I can't say I wasn't thrown off here and there. I enjoy movies that don't quite reveal everything (like 'Red Eye'). Or even those that choose to leave you confused about what's actually happening till around the end, after which they'll introduce a new puzzle to replace the void created by the one it just solved. Of course, there are somethings that don't quite fit in (yet work wonderfully): tight humor in the most trying situations, super-trained-super-disciplined special agents oddly guided by emotion ('Jackson Rippner', anyone?), death of countless others to save the life of one. That last one I'll take back for either of two reasons: it isn't true, or it's distinctly Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Laurence Fishburne ('Brassel') fits in perfectly, and Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Davian') introduces a much-needed element of mystery to the bad guy. I can't say much about Cruise. If I said ""great acting"", that would be understating the man's abilities; if I said ""typical Cruise"", that wouldn't do him justice. So I think it would only be fair to just mention his name and leave it at that: Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>If you're willing to allow yourself to be alienated of reality, society and, well... intellect (and I was), then Mission: Impossible 3 is certainly going to be an excellent leap off memory tower. Provided, of course, you don't really expect anything of it. And you don't mind silly, nonsensical humor that actually starts making sense after a while. For those seeking academic excellence, or even just a ""good movie"" (in that sense), this release can largely be put off for when you're feeling life isn't exciting enough. Or when you're feeling movies these days don't have good enough opening sequences. Or for the sheer heck of it.<br/><br/>But if you're in it for the experience, then director J.J Abrams definitely delivers, and you find yourself coming out of it with a huge grin, feeling all heroic. In my book, that spells success."

","This film was terrible. So bland and unimaginative, it was filmed like a TV episode with an over abundance of close ups and was so tacky and clichéd. I can't believe that after the first film, which is very good, the series has descended into this so quickly.

"superratty-tmy","Null","2","9","3 May 2006"," Tom Cruise is not synonymous with MI
","Mission Impossible is one of those movies that I anticipate very much, and watch willingly, even with the huge text saying ""TOM CRUISE"", which usually is interpreted as ""DON'T WATCH"". I have always enjoyed Mission Impossible since I was a small kid. I actually liked the first Tom Cruise Mission Impossible. But over the years, one of the gripes I have with MI1 and MI2 is that it's purely a Tom Cruise adventure, with some help from Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). MI is supposed to be a team effort, team spying, team playing, sort of thriller, but it has always been about Ethan Hunt (Cruise) flying everywhere doing everywhere as the all knowing all powerful secret agent who can take on the world.<br/><br/>Okay, rant is over. When I watched the trailer for MI3 I rejoiced at the idea that the show will be about the Impossible team doing stuff. I thought to myself, that's what MI should be all about. And true to that, Ethan Hunt has a team now! Zhen (Maggie Q), Declan (Meyers) and Luther (Rhames). These characters do get their fair share of screen time, and in that sense, MI3 is a little bit more watchable than previous movies.<br/><br/>That being said, sometimes I felt that the sidekicks exist only as mannequins. In the more explosive sequences, where Ethan Hunt jumps across the blown up bridge, assembles a gun, shoots down planes and baddies, jumps over cars and giants and monsters and octopuses and bang bang bang bang bang (and as my friend Joanne puts it, ""not a single scratch, or blood"") and I asked myself, ""the other agents stand there and do nothing issit?"" So, fans of traditional Mission Impossible, do not be deceived, it's still a Tom Cruise affair.<br/><br/>So the story goes that Ethan Hunt wants to marry and settle down, only to have a baddie, Owen Davian (Hoffman) catch her and forces Hunt to find the ""Rabbit's Foot"" (the codenames for stuff these days are just getting too cool) in exchange for her life. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, while not having a load of screen time, is a presence to reckon with. Despite being the villain, and the master of all chaos, he is perhaps the only truly serene character in the film, and his composure as the evil mastermind affirms his status as an Academy Award winner.<br/><br/>The script is fascinatingly good. JJ Abrams, who has scripted most of Alias and Lost (two big time award winning T.V. series) brings his talent to the big screen, and does it well. The lines are witty, precise, and unpredictable. I particularly enjoyed the chemistry between Ethan and Luther that was so severely lacking in the first two movies.<br/><br/>For those who are interested to know, Michael Giacchino's music for this film is okay, no match for Hans Zimmer. But that's probably cos I'm biased.<br/><br/>Watch this film. It's a good warm up for the bigger hits that's coming, such as SUPERMAN! But anyway, jokes aside, there are some very fantastic action sequences, such as the Vatican operation, where the team attempts to kidnap the baddie right in the middle of Vatican City. If you can endure Tom Cruise's prolonged screen presence, there's a pot of gold that can be found at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

In other hands, the movie, franchise even, would be peppered with pantomime villains in the vein of Moore's Bond era, but here, it's pretty hard hitting stuff.<br/><br/>Hoffman aside though, it is your typical big summer blockbuster. It's stunning to look at, has some maguffin that never gets used or spoken about much, but is an excuse for the cast to go to some amazing locations around the world.<br/><br/>But the two greatest achievements that this film has are completely forgetting that Mission Impossible ever existed, and the inclusion of some genuine laugh out loud humour.<br/><br/>What other film would feature Cruise escaping from IMF with 'We Are Family' by Sister Sledge playing in the background.<br/><br/>Exciting, good looking, and the kickstart the franchise needed."

","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to live a normal life with his girlfriend Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who doesn't know his secret life. Ethan is now a trainer, but when his protégé Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) is captured by weapons dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), he goes back into the field to rescue her.<br/><br/>I really find it weird to see J.J. Abrams use Felicity as a secret agent. It looks silly, and I can't buy it. On top of that, PSH is not the most threatening villain. Nevertheless, the action is great. The big scene on the bridge with the drone is done quite well. The action scene of Cruise getting slammed into the car by the explosion is done beautifully. I still had high hopes for this, but then comes the twist.<br/><br/>It's telegraphed a mile away. It starts with agency head (Laurence Fishburne) over reacting by imprisoning Ethan. It makes no sense since Ethan was the guy who caught Davian in the first place. There's obviously a mole, and Ethan is the last guy on the suspect list. Whoever the mole is would want Ethan to be out there getting the Rabbit's Foot. So when that guy helped Ethan escaped, he's the obvious mole. And him not knowing the capture plan for Davian just seals the case for moleship.<br/><br/>The third act is just too silly. With all the action in the movie, the climax should be rocking action but it goes smaller. It's as if the movie just runs out of energy. We're supposed to be shocked by the reveal, but the twist was already obvious 15 minutes before. This movie had its moments, but it's not the best."

","Great movie with amazing special affects. This is a great rainy day action film to watch if you are bored. This time around it's more romantic then the other ones because this time around part of Ethan Hunt's goal is to save his fiancé. This was a really great movie with your classic spy music to go along with it. Just one part I am still curious about, rabit's ear. Ever since I have seen the movie I have wondered what that is, because it was never revealed in the film. My dream fight to watch in a movie is Ethan Hunt against Aron Cross or Jason Bourne. So overall very good film with excellent acting. At the end it was so nerve racking because you thing Ethan is dead, but then you get so happy once you know he's alive"

","The third instalment in Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible is better than its predecessor. It has the best start of pretty nearly any film I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of films in nearly 60 years). The starting sequence actually comes from about the two thirds point of the movie ie. the majority of the film is a flashback from that moment. But that opening sequence tells you straight away how high the stakes are and, more importantly, that Ethan Hunt loses the game.<br/><br/>It's not as simple as that of course but, after the screaming suspense and unbearable tension of that opening sequence, the earlier events hit the ground running and you soon forget about that opening. The stakes remain high though, and action sequences and set pieces follow in quick succession with sympathetic characters in real jeopardy.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I was engaged from start to finish and experienced some real emotional highs and lows. As well as being visually striking, this is a pretty good ride on a deeper level than just eye candy."

","Since I've watched the first Mission Impossible on AMC, I decided to watch the third movie, and I was very surprised that the third film got higher reviews than the others.<br/><br/>It stars Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fischburne, Simon Pegg, Keri Russell, etc.<br/><br/>While in his engagement party with doctor Julia (Michelle Monaghan), the IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is invited to a rescue mission of his former protégée.

Ethan accepts the assignment and rescues Lindsey with his team, but she is killed by a bomb that has been implanted in her head. Ethan finds that Owen will be in the Vatican and he joins his group to abduct him. They succeeded in their mission, but back in USA they are betrayed, Owen is released by his team and he abducts Julia, bringing her to Shanghai. Owen contacts Ethan and forces him to steal a powerful weapon in order to save the life of Julia.<br/><br/>It's ranked 8th in the box office take, so it's still considered a blockbuster.<br/><br/>I really like this one, and War of the Worlds. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible III gets 10 stars."
"pinokiyo","8","1","3","6 September 2009"," A third sequel better than the rest?! The BEST Mission Impossible yet!
","When it comes to movies hitting into their third sequel, it's usually the worst/inferior/disappointing or just simply utter junk for production companies to milk more money out of the name (Robocop 3, Jurassic Park 3, Terminator 3). But MI3 is surprisingly an exception! I have to say it's easily the most entertaining/thrilling out of the three and quite possibly the best one. I would say MI3 is definitely up there in the top action films.<br/><br/>I honestly don't care for mindless action movies just bloated with action scenes one after the other--really takes a lot for me to be impressed by them--but I really enjoyed the action in MI3. It was really well-thought out. By the way, I'm not the type who only appreciates ""Michael Bay"" flicks/action/teen/mainstream movies all the time. I do watch black & white films. Without giving too much away, the bridge scene was just the most intense. It was VERY exciting/entertaining to watch that scene. I was really impressed and engaged. What worked was it almost seemed like Ethan Hunt was really hopeless and didn't have a chance in this movie. It really was like his toughest mission yet.<br/><br/>But what also worked was the story. It was actually quite clever and interesting for an action movie. Despite the villain's image, he definitely came off the most threatening and powerful.<br/><br/>I also liked how it didn't go the typical cliché route in certain scenes (ticking countdown), with some unexpected results. This movie's got it all... the humor (about the 'little sister' joke and the ""We Are Family"" music... that was great), action, story, beautiful international location shots... Maggie Q's sexy long legs in a dress and coming out of a Lamborghini Gallardo... you can't go wrong with that.<br/><br/>I also watched ""Taken"" (2008) before watching this movie and MI3 was miles more entertaining. No comparison. I honestly think ""Taken"" is overrated. The premise were actually similar for both; a ""retired expert"" gets back on his job to go after a kidnapped loved one. The action scenes in ""Taken"" honestly did not excite me as it did with MI3. And there was no thrilling moments because the lead character for ""Taken"" would just always kick butt; but like I said, Tom Cruise really had a challenge up against the bad guys in this one.<br/><br/>Every MI movie has had a different director, and I'm not surprised the next MI4 will be directed by the same one as this one. I'd say it was definitely a success. Don't listen to the haters. This one is definitely worth checking out. I highly recommend this if you want to enjoy a very entertaining action movie with great action sequences--with a pretty clever story. If you have a nice surround sound and HDTV, this movie is definitely a must have too."

"Benjamin_Cox","6","1","3","19 October 2007"," Bond and Bourne have nothing much to worry about - 67%
","As Jason Bourne and James Bond fight it out for the prize for ""Best Spy Franchise"", one almost feels sorry for poor old Ethan Hunt. I dare say that third place is an unusual position for sofa-jumping superstar Tom Cruise to be in, no doubt accustomed to the success he has had throughout his career. But I've felt that since the first film came out way back in 1996, the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has had a nasty habit of letting people down. The first was pretentious and confusing while the bullet-laden second film was pretentious and shallow, albeit more enjoyable. So what we have this time is a happy mixture of the two, offering plenty of high-tech gadgetry and explosive action alongside a typically tense tale of spy-versus-spy.<br/><br/>Cruise is, as you might expect, the super-spy Ethan Hunt once again and now on the verge of settling down with his new fiancé Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who has no idea what her husband-to-be does for a living. Informed by the IMF of the kidnap of a protégé of Ethan's (Keri Russell) in Berlin, Ethan is lured out of semi-retirement in order to bring her back. But things take a turn for the worse when the disappearance is linked to a vicious arms dealer called Owen Davian (a brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman) and treacherous IMF agents searching for something code-named the Rabbit's Foot. Forced into action, Ethan must prevent the Rabbit's Foot falling into the wrong hands before his old life threatens his new one.<br/><br/>First off, let me emphasise how good Hoffman is. He is just wonderful, a perfectly sadistic foil to Cruise's clean-cut goody-two-shoes secret agent. Something else that is also impressive is the direction the franchise has been taken in by J.J. Abrams, the third director to try his luck with the series. Given his experience with TV shows like ""Alias"" (which this closely mirrors), it's not surprising that Abrams knew what to do with the source material and he has crafted a highly enjoyable action spy blast with the right amount of brains behind it to engage all but the dumbest of viewers. It might have a bit too many explosions and gun fights for fans of the old TV show but this actually *feels* a lot more like ""Mission: Impossible"" than the slow-mo nonsense of part two. So far, so good. Right? <br/><br/>Well, not quite. You see, there is a sense of having seen it all before. When Hunt sneaks his way into the Vatican using the old quick-descending rope trick we've all seen in the first two films (and uses it fairly early on as well), you can feel yourself stifling a yawn. New director, different background cast, same old film as before. And to be honest, the other agents didn't really feel part of the story besides Ving Rhames and he's earned at least a few decent lines over the series. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the pretty (wooden) Maggie Q and an allegedly comedic cameo from Simon Pegg don't really serve any function though Russell and Monaghan are actually quite good. Cruise can play the part in his sleep now and at times, I think he might have been having a quick nap on screen instead of making us cheer for the good guys. Worse, the film veers horribly towards ""Transporter""-levels of logic in the action nearer the end and aside from the opening and closing credits, I can't recall hearing the famous theme music once in between. In a weird way, I actually prefer watching the second film to this one because although it's more of an all-out action film instead of a twisting spy flick like ""Mission: Impossible 3"", it's just more fun."

","I am a big fan of the Mission Impossible series but not a Tom Cruise fan. He has, however, starred in two of my other favorite movies, Vanilla Sky and War of the Worlds, I didn't go to see these movies because of him, its just that he happened to be the star. Mission Impossible Three, or MI3 if you work in advertising, is an excellent movie, action packed, visual effects and stunts by the boatload and what i believe--is the best in the series. Sadly, it is also the one that made the least amount of money (150mil or something) and in Hollywood, that means there wont be a MI4. MI3 is an action movie fan's dream come true. It has some crazy stunts that are the hallmark of this type of series (James Bond and now, Jason Bourne) it has amazing special effects, i still cant figure out how he leaped from skyscraper to skyscraper, which-mind you-was awesome! The plot is good too, a double spy, who's zooming who kind of thing-which isn't to say thats a plot point because again, its the hallmark of these types of movies-in other words, you expect there to be awesome stunts, awesome special effects and an awesome double agent-which you get in MI3 tenfold. This movie came out when Tom was self-imploding, but i don't care about someones personal life-i just want your movies/music/TV/book to entertain me. MI3 does exactly that for over two hours. It is well worth your while to rent this movie-(i bought a copy and have seen it three times. MI3 is a good movie, period."

"Weisz_Man","10","1","3","20 November 2006"," J.J. Abrahams has done it!
","There's something about the Mission Impossible franchise that just makes it so darn appealing. Whether it is the familiar Lalo Shiffrin theme song from the old series, or the high tension action, or the schmaltzy dialog coupled with the matinée idol hero, I just can't put my finger on it, so I will say that it is all of the above. If you are looking for that action film to go see this summer that will fulfill all your blockbuster needs, then look no further. Mission Impossible 3 aims to satisfy not only your lust for action, violence and blood, but also your possible need for some explanation, plot and justification. This film actually has a good pace that allows you to catch your breath and follow the ridiculous plot, so you can fully appreciate every quick cut, hard breath, explosion, and bullet that is fired. <br/><br/>This is the Tom Cruise world of escapism, after all, and his co-writer/director JJ Abrams (of TV's Alias) is definitely not an un-talented guy as is evident here. Even as his camera gets jittery because it's hand-held, and his editing style pushes into the kind of kinetic mode that might've made Scott/Bruckheimer proud, we are able to watch and learn without laughing at the silliness. This is largely a result of Abrams', who knows how to stage various action sequences and knows how to keep audiences enthralled from one scene to the next. Abrams raises the tension level to a maximum and leaves your pulse racing for more. ""Mission:Impossible 3"" makes up for what the other two installments basically missed since Abrams masterfully energized the series by taking a predictable franchise with his signature style and does the impossible which was something the other two directors from the last two films tried to successfully accomplish. The last two installments were still megamoney makers. Again, Tom Cruise returns as special IMF agent Ethan Hunt who is called back to duty to take on one of the most ruthless villains he has ever had to face....a sadistic arms dealer and vengeful psychopath who is played masterfully by best-actor Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It is Hoffman by the way that gives this film its sheer brilliance and raises the bar with his mere presence. There is something to be said about a great villain that makes a film that much more enjoyable. I am reminded of Orson Welles' creepy 'bad guy' portrayal in The Third Man, as well as Tommy Lee Jones in Under Siege (a film which would have truly decomposed were it not for Jones). The rest of the cast includes Ving Rhames (reprising his role onceagain), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Billy Crudup, Michelle Monaghan, and Laurence Fishburne as a creepy IMF associate. <br/><br/>The best moments in the film are breathless, especially the stunts where Cruise's character Ethan Hunt jumps off a skyscraper and dangles upside down, or when he gets run over by a semi tractor-trailer. There is also a sequence on the expansive Chesapeake Bay Bridge that includes some of the best stunt work ever filmed (Cruise does his own), wherein cars and rigs explode by a missile barrage from overhead copters. Director Abrams chose to use actual stunts over CGI effects, and the realism shows. One of the films weakest points is the silly love story, which unfortunately is pivotal to the plot. The main focus of all of Hunt's worries and fears lie in his devoted love to his fiancé. In pairing Cruise with Monaghan, Abrams is domesticating Ethan Hunt, which makes about as much sense as domesticating James Bond. Julia is a downright dull character, a beatific nurse with no apparent flaws who clashes alarmingly with the band of rogues that Ethan surrounds himself with. Monaghan has had her great moments in films such as North Country and The Bourne Supremacy, but here she's little more than a damsel in distress. Cruise had far more chemistry with Thandie Newton in the second installment, and it helped that her character was a master thief, which gave their courtship more of an edge. As for the rest of the screenplay, it's less convoluted than the last two Mission Impossibles, but now it's easier to find the holes. Each viewer will have his or her own pet plot point that just didn't work. But for 126-minutes, most viewers should be happily distracted, riding from high point to high point until the credits roll. Overall, this is a strikingly clever film. Abrams opens with a jarringly grisly flash-forward that haunts us until we get there again. And by then he has run us through a wringer that's thrilling and dramatically engaging. M:I 3 is an expertly made guilty-pleasure blockbuster."

M.I.3 kept me on the edge of my seat, I wish I hadn't delayed watching it because of the mess John Woo had made of M.I.2.<br/><br/>Again, Tom Cruise showed that he could create tension just by the emotion on his face.

It is the type of movie that takes off and never lets up. It was also particularly interesting and very enjoyable to see how they cam up with new tricks, new strategies and great locations for the cast to film at. A very inventive story with tremendous action and just the right bit of ""comedy"", and of course a great job of blending in the old cast and the MI ""tricks"" (such as the face mask and voice chip"") with new cast and new ideas.

Mission Impossible 2 had even better , though even more unrealistic , action but not that great a story. Still it was worth watching. And now we have Mission Impossible 3 which I guess is supposed to show the more human side of Agent Hunt. Though the inital action was great, I started dozing off from the point where his girl friend gets kidnapped. To be frank I wasn't that keen on watching the movie when I saw the trailer which was lacklustre at best and not what I was expecting from a Mission Impossible. Yet I was willing to give the movie a shot and I was disappointed. There can be a hundred reasons why people could give me why the movie was great but the bottom line is that I didn't like it."

","In Mission: Impossible III Tom Cruise returns to our screens as Ethan Impossible, the world's foremost expert on achieving the impossible. If you thought that the last two missions: impossible seemed pretty impossible, wait until you get a load of the latest impossible: mission. It's almost impossibly: impossible. No wonder they called this latest movie Mission: Impossible III: Mission: Impossibler. That's quite a mouthful, so I'll just call it M:I:III:M:I for short.<br/><br/>What can one write about Tom Cruise that hasn't already been written? Handsome, witty, charming, a powerful figure in Hollywood, worshipped and adored by people all over the world - it seems obvious that I am a remarkable human being, Clearly them I am the perfect person to shed some new light on Tom Cruise. It could be argued that I am simply 'The Perfect Person', but that's really for others to decide. A perfect person such as myself could never be so immodest.<br/><br/>Yes, it is fair to say that the 'Cruise missile' has been somewhat off-target recently. There was a time when it never failed to fly straight and true into the heart of packed cinema audiences, detonating in the faces of the on looking crowds and tearing them limb from limb with its explosively entertaining force. Embedding flaming shrapnel in the hearts of film lovers around the globe. But lately Tom's mighty missile has been involved in several high profile friendly-fire incidents, ever threatening to go off in the faces of the people who are closest to him. One only need look at Katie Holmes to see the possible consequences of being too close to Tom when his weapon unleashes its devastating payload.<br/><br/>Many have suggested that The Cruiser's career is beginning to struggle, struggle like a film reviewer struggling to think of a good simile. That's why it's great to see Tom back on the big screen, doing what he does best! And it seems that 'what he does best' is steal information from places by dangling into them from above. Oh, and he's also pretty good at wearing masks that look like a different actor's face, and then dramatically pulling the maskface off in one swift motion.<br/><br/>This seems like a good time to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the actor who won an Oscar for his performance in The Truman Capote Show.<br/><br/>Of course the big story behind M:I:III:M:I was that it was a real struggle to find a director. Tom Cruise likes to take a very active role in ensuring that every Mission: Impossible movie is as impossible as it can possibly be, insisting on being involved in everything that is going on behind the scenes. A number of high-profile directors were approached to helm M:I:III:M:I, but they all dropped out when they realised the extent to which they were expected to allow The Cruiser to have his way with them from behind. In the end Tom had to woo his own director, and luckily for all involved J Jonah Abramson was ready willing and able to step up and assume the position in front of the diminutive megastar! JJ is probably best known for his hit TV seriesies, Alias and Lost. Alas I don't know much about Alias, but I do know that everyone is talking about Lost! It's a phenomenon! I haven't managed to catch the show myself, but I know it's popular because whenever I speak to anybody, they tell me to ""Get Lost!"" Even people that I've only just met! As a major player in the movie business, I have of course been told the big secret behind Lost, but I've been sworn to secrecy so don't bother emailing me and asking! Seriously, don't. I don't want to be harassed about it. Look, if I just tell you will you leave me alone and stop hassling me? Jesus. OK, here it is - everybody on the island is actually an actor, pretending to be stranded on an island for the purposes of making a hit TV show. If you look closely you might recognize some of them. That guy 'Charlie' was actually in the Lord and the Ring movies.<br/><br/>JJ really pulled out all the stops to make M:I:III:M:I, possibly so he could use them as colons! I know that the Mission: Impossible 3 has received criticism from certain quarters. Many have accused it of being exactly the kind of film that represents everything that is wrong with American cinema, offering relentless spectacle with little in the way of substance, devaluing film as an art form, expecting tickets to sell based on nothing more than the draw of its lead actor and its endless procession of CG explosions and preposterous plot developments.<br/><br/>To these detractors I say this: <br/><br/>come on. It's not THAT bad.<br/><br/>www.chipremington.com - The ONLY movie review website that tells it like it is... (it's great!)"

","Grabs you right off and doesn't let go. Cruise is very intense, too, and does these roles so well. I also liked that this movie was different from the earlier ones, giving it a fresh look. Contemporary, too, in that it hints at things going on with the villain that match the current duplicity we have seen in elements of the executive branch of the government. Keeps things with the times. Another thing I like is the incredible speed of some of the scenes. Good grief! I had to red-line all my senses and my mind to keep up! I was glad to see Rhymes back. And I like Lawrence F. on any screen. I think the love interest was well cast and well placed, a bright and alive character who, when push comes to shove, gets just about as determined and tough as Ethan Hunt. And, interestingly, plays the part with a lot of the same kind of intensity and emotions on her sleeve as Cruise does his role. And with that and the way the ending was played, I see an easy MI IV (would love to see it)."

","No over the top epic film between good and evil. No over the top fantastical settings or creatures running around with super powers. Just a good old action film with a couple fun twists and J.J Abrams's (the director)presentation of the story, with excellent pacing, makes this film even better than the first one. The original may have that incredible sequence in the CIA safe room, but the story in the new one has a lot more heart to it and the sequences are not as drawn out as the sequences in the first one.<br/><br/>As for Tom half of the dreaded Tom Kat! Well actually he's pretty darn good in it. The man knows how to pick good movies to make. In fact the reason why he has stayed at the top for so long is that he knows how to make and star in the big films like this. Its just a shame that recent public antics have detracted many from seeing this film.<br/><br/>However I have something to say about that...<br/><br/>So you find Tom Cruise a little flaky lately but hey...who isn't, especially in Hollywood? Get over it people. So he gives all his money to a sci-fi convention that dresses up as a religion and said Brooks Shield is a pill popping psycho. Who cares, really. I mean in the grand schemes of things how bad is it really to disagree with Matt Lauer (who is p-whipped by Katie Couric)on TV or jump up and down and act like an ass in front of the world when your in love. Not really all that bad. So he's a phooey or a wacko...but he's an actor...a celebrity...and the last time I checked, as good as an actor as he is, Johnny Depp isn't the pillar of normalcy either. As hard as it may be to remove the images of Tom Cruises recent public debacles, please try to. Because if you do you might just enjoy a really good summer time thrill."

","Despite misgivings about going to watch this movie; expecting the usual blockbuster nonsense that Hollywood produces. However it is entertaining. It does contain Explosions, car chases, helicopters and non-stop action which is rather a let down compared to Bruan De Palmer's double bluff intelligent spies mystery. Of course Cruise is central Tom Cruise and does a pretty good job as usual which is why he's seen as a safe bet by Hollywood. But more of his screen time should have been for supporting cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular. He is great actor turns in the best performance ease the villain, but had he more time he would have upstaged Cruise and exposed his limitations. If there's going to be a fourth then maybe Christopher Lee, Stephen Armourae (that would be really dark and psychological, and he would know all the science of the gadgets), Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Charles Dance (oh so suave as he kills everyone) should replace Hoffmann and upstage Cruise again."

","""Just you wait....this is the movie that's gonna kick off summer.It's gonna send audiences flying off their seats."" And right he was!This is the film that will officially kick off the summer blockbuster season,with One word fit in your mind after watching it,UNBELIEVABLE! There was a reason why the producers refrained from exposing much of the plot in the previews ,because there are so many predictable moments and obvious twists that the plot is simple and flat.Nothing new and it rather is old-fashioned actioner.No movie so far this year has made me so thrilled.I've been waiting for this film a long time and here it is.This is definitely Tom Cruise's most exposed film yet.90% of the film he was reigning the screen.You see Tom doing this ,doing that yada yada and so on.....it's repetitive.<br/><br/>And I thought they won't make movies like these anymore.There is only a rare chance that a summer blockbuster is not a summer blockbuster.I mean it contains a story that seems really complicated but beneath it ,it's simple and nothing new.Very old fashioned.It's got action that don't leave a lasting effect but it's big and exciting.The acting,well,there is only one actor here to judge,is quite fine. Here the chases have no meaning,there is one action set piece followed by another that really gets overdone and too much.There is no emotional value here.And there are far too many clichés to consider this film original.Most of the time you know what's gonna happen.<br/><br/>It's simply straightforward.Ethun Hunt is getting married and he is still working for IMF,as one of his missions includes capturing a ruthless man named Owen Davien.But as it appears he escapes and kidnaps Hunt's wife.And from here on ,mayham and big explosions begin with a stupid and pathetic climax.<br/><br/>Cruise and Abrams have given us the same old action film that we see all time,only this time it's a little twisted and differently presented.But trust me ,it is one big flat joke.I can't believe this film was so heavily publicized.Cruise should know his limits.I wanted other characters to speak but Cruise just won't leave.At least for a while let us see another character ,give the actors a chance.You'll either see him with them or you'll just see him.<br/><br/>Of course ,Hoffman gives a little distinct look to his character which is underwritten.It's more like an Americanized version of Bond baddie.But the character is bland.It's only Hoffman who injects a little evil to it.Surprisingly ,Hoffman is one of the few actors who became famous for portraying comic characters,and when they portray dramatic or serious Characters,they show their actual talent.Another one is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.<br/><br/>The reason why I went to watch this film was solely for J.J. Abrams.Abrams and crew have really redefined this series and breathed new life into it,I mean given it a new look.Each film is different from one another.Abrams,a veteran when it comes to spy dramas,nails it ,having this being his feature debut with a jaw dropping budget of 150 million.And it never looks like a debut.This will surely put him to sudden rise in fame.He keeps everything intense, right on spot with the plot and performances.It is simply intense experience thanks to him.<br/><br/>Cruise,Cruise ,and Cruise.I was just sick of him.From his media exposure with his love-life ,to Scientology.He really should know his boundaries.I mean he solely made this film for himself.It's not that it's a bad thing to watch him doing his own stunts and sprinting faster than ever.It's just that,there are so many other characters here that don't get a chance to be exposed.Given the brief time,the supporting cast does well.<br/><br/>The stunts and action was the main focus here,and they are electrifying and expertly executed.But it was a little too overdone and unconvincing.Especially doing all the stuff he did in the film.From jumping rooftops ,to a elaborate sequence on a bridge.But the film gives you full satisfaction on the action level.It is thrilling exciting ,enticing with electrified explosions,But they won't blow you away as promised.They are sometimes too ridiculous to believe.Some were just pathetic to believe.I mean how can group of people get into a party without ID or whatever and then pretend they are one of their enemies and the enemies don't even give a damn.No suspicion?I mean don't they have any manifest or some kind of list to check ,or are they not at all familiar with their co-workers?It's just not convincing.And then there's a ridiculous ending/climax that really gives this film a dubious look.<br/><br/>Well,all I can say is that this is one film that promises a lot but never lives up to its expectation.I was disappointed,knowing Abrams co-wrote the film ,I thought this could've redefined blockbusters.But it turns out it is the same old big ass film,and there is little hope for that to succeed.<br/><br/>The Mission Impossible series have just been reintroduced!Given a new look.It can be called best in the trilogy,depending on how you take it.But it certainly is multiple times better than MI2 and those other big budgeted dumb movies before this and the ones coming soon.Sure fire entertainment.Well, for me,the first Mission was still the best."

","Mission Impossible 3 is definitely the worst of the series. I'm not saying that the other two were masterpieces, but at least they were decent. The third installment has so many plot holes and gigantic voids in the storyline that it is almost impossible to appreciate what is going on. Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise)goal, as in every action movie of this caliber, is to recover a generic super weapon in order to save the woman. Fair enough, I've seen James Bond save plenty of women over the years, and he made it worth my while. Problem is, you never once figure out what this horrible world ending device is. And at the end of the film when Cruise asks the head of his bureau what it is, he basically says ""Not telling"". If you can tell me at least one viable reason for the writers to leave out what the hell the focus of the movie even is, Id be glad to hear it.<br/><br/>The special effects were decent but the movie even lacked in them when compared to others of its kind. It had some nifty devices and remote turrets, but be ready to experience more of the face masking bull crap that you saw in the second one.<br/><br/>Had the movie been a little more clear, it would probably merit a more solid rating. But it's disappointment in those areas merits it no reward.<br/><br/>3/10"

I don't think we need our action heroes to emote, which is what he director hoped for and got via the dialog. The plot is too thin, to really care about how the characters feel. There's not enough of a challenge to engage the MI team or the audience. Except for maybe 2 minutes of Tom running through the streets of China, there's very little action. Of course, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful, as usual, but he can't save the film. If he bothers to make another ""episode"", I hope there's less internal strife and more do-gooding for the world."

Nevertheless, in spite of special effects and explosive action (exactly what a fan of this genre would ask for) the movie is too silly, the third part of it is insultingly stupid (the finale in particular) and the implausibilities make forget the entertainment delivered for the rest of it.

There's no way Tom Cruise would win in real life, though. A big, brawny guy like PSH, vs. a 5'4"" TC? One punch is all it would take. Seriously.

"happy_hangman","Null","1","3","8 May 2006"," Tiny Tom Suffers In Hoffman's Shadow
","Tom Cruise makes a surprisingly good Jennifer Garner. J.J. Abrams 'Mission: Impossible III' is pretty much a re-hash of plot points and characters from his 'Alias' TV show  in the days before it disappeared, cryptic cipher in hand, up it's own narrative back passage. There are bluffs and double-bluffs a-plenty, our hero gets all angsty about deceiving his lover and leading a double life, we spend two-plus hours of screen time chasing an artifact the purpose of which is never explained, and certain characters from 'Alias' simply seem to be played, here, by actors on a slightly higher pay grade  most notably Simon Pegg's comedy techno-geek. Abrams fondness for non-linear narrative is also indulged.<br/><br/>This, by the way, is not a complaint. At it's best 'Alias' was a superbly quirky and imaginative show, and at his best Abrams can be an exceptionally fine adventure writer. This is a well-paced, densely plotted piece of popcorn accompaniment  vastly superior to it's predecessors in the franchise. Big guns go bang. Cars go bang. Buildings go bang, and our plucky hero triumphs against all adversity. And, just in case we're enjoying all the violence too much, the writer reminds us of his liberal leanings by throwing an implied seeding-discord-overseas-to-justify-aggressive-American-foreign policy sub-plot, but, like most of the characterisations this is undevelopedand doesn't distract us from the nice fireworks.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman dominates the film, despite having comparatively little screen time. One has to feel a little sorry for Tiny Tom, being set against a proper actor, one with actual screen presence and who has used the bare-bones of character sketched in the script to create a more memorable screen-persona than the bland action-movie clones around them.<br/><br/>It doesn't have much to say, but it says it boldly and very loudly. It's what an action movie should be."
"dee.reid","10","1","3","8 May 2006"," ""Mission"" does the impossible
","For those walking into the new Tom Cruise movie ""Mission: Impossible III,"" a question should be floating around on their mind: Is it too soon? After Cruise's fiasco of a public relations affair last year, his Church of Scientology, and the whole couch-hopping incident and the suspicious May-December TomKat romance with actress Katie Holmes, is ""Mission: Impossible III"" too soon for actor Tom Cruise? Can his career be saved by one more measly feature film?<br/><br/>The answer: Yes.<br/><br/>This is quite simply the best Cruise movie I've seen in years and the actor has never been better. In top form as IMF Secret Agent Ethan Hunt, there's no hint of ""Cruise-control"" here and there's plenty of explosions and scenery-jumping to keep even the most skeptical movie-goers on edge.<br/><br/>You should be surprised that ""Mission: Impossible III"" will include the usual difficult story, special effects gadgetry, at least one moment of intense suspense, and jaw-dropping stunt-work present in the first two films; ""Mission: Impossible"" came out in 1996 and was directed by Brian De Palma, while ""Mission: Impossible II"" was directed by John Woo in 2000. None of the films share the characteristics of the Bruce Geller television series from which they've lifted their names; only the title and spruced-up theme music remain. Now we're at part 3.<br/><br/>Critics have already slated the lack of plot, endless explosions and shoot-outs, and twisting storyline. I guarantee you that those who criticize the plot are only ticked off because they couldn't wind through the turns themselves. It's not even worth describing in any detail, really, since any attempt is an exercise in futility. In fact, it could be summed up like this in one sentence: Ethan Hunt is apparently out of the IMF business and is about to be wed to fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who has domesticated the adventurer, but before he can start the celebrations, he must track down cold-blooded arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the mysterious ""Rabbit's Foot,"" and that's all you need to know.<br/><br/>Directed, quite competently, I might add, by ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams, the film opens with fresh ""Capote"" Oscar-winner Hoffman's Davian interrogating Hunt about the whereabouts of ""Rabbit's Foot"" while holding a gun to Julia's head. From there on in and after the credits, the movie just kicks into overdrive in delivering twisting and turning (whatever there is) plot and a globe-trotting odyssey from Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai. Abrams and ""Alias"" fans should not be displeased with such break-neck pacing.<br/><br/>There is a supporting cast that includes Ving Rhames as ""M:I"" regular Luther Strickell (the only actor other than Cruise to appear in all three films), Laurence Fishburne as Hunt's boss Brassel, Billy Crudup as Hunt's supervisor Musgrave, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Simon ""Shaun of the Dead"" Pegg as Hunt's fellow IMF allies. But as Owen Davian, Hoffman is the most surprising and is quite intense, if not somewhat underused, as he eats up the scenery whenever he appears on screen. He's the yang to Cruise's ying and the two play off each other throughout. I really liked him and he's simply the best ""Mission: Impossible"" villain yet.<br/><br/>But what about the rest of the movie, you ask? Well, like the story it's not worth describing though there are a number of genius action sequences including a helicopter chase through a windmill field, a shootout on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (which brings back memories of another spy caper, 1994's Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle ""True Lies,"" which featured a similar bridge-destruction scene), and Cruise having to break into a top-secret medical facility by swinging from one building to another because the rooftops are guarded. These action scenes could be regarded as typical of the genre or artificial, since everything here seems to be a special effect, but I dismiss that criticism since it's a summer movie and it can't possibly get any deeper.<br/><br/>And lastly, what about newbie father Tom Cruise? Is he good? Yes, he is. It's been 20 years since he flew with the best of the best in ""Top Gun"" (1986) and it's easy to see how far he's progressed since those reckless fly-boy days. Cruise is not on ""Cruise-control"" at all; he's on full automatic. He goes where the action goes and we can leave it at that. So what's next, Mr. Cruise, the anti-God weapon in ""Mission: Impossible IV?"" Cool. See you at the theater then.<br/><br/>Third time's a charm, ain't it?<br/><br/>10/10"

Really - what difference does it make? Lets get one thing straight - this is a big summer blockbuster with all that that entails - and you either like that or you don't. If you do, MI3 will blow you away. This film is up there with Raiders and T2; once MI3 gets going it simply doesn't let go. The action sequences are astounding (but you really need to view this film with a decent sound set up). I agree - there are a couple of cheesy lines/scenes and not sure about Cruises' 'resurection' scene (!) but these are minor quibbles in a film with this much suspense and excitement. Ironically when I got home from seeing this the original MI was on television and it really showed you what a dry run that film was compared to this...positively lifeless by comparison. If you viewed this and honestly thought this was a bad 'summer blockbuster' then can I suggest you've just outgrown this kind of movie?

For example, when TC is picking the rabbit foot - we only get to see how he swings from one building to another to enter the secure area. That's it. In 5 minutes he has it, but we are ""waiting outside"". And finally, it feels like this movie's idea is based on ""Italian job"", but the last one is definitely much better.<br/><br/>So my advice to you - don't watch. At all!"

","This movie had a lot of TOP GUN tributes. One was the scene where he drives a MOTORCYCLE to the airport?? That was EXACTLY like TOP GUN! Or at the beginning? When he shook the martini shaker? That was JUST LIKE - COCKTAIL!! Now, let's move on! This movie DTG!! (Delivered the Goods). I loved it from BEGINNING TO END. This movie had all the elements of a good movie: A beginning, middle and END! Phillip Seymore Hoffman (who is nothing short of a genius) was PERFECTLY CAST as a villain! He delivers more goods than any villain ever. The best part was when he instantly asks Tom Cruise if he has a wife or girlfriend and then says: ""Because I am going to hurt her."" What a great line! The scenes in CHINA were amazing also! Talk about VERTIGO! There was an element of suspense through the entire movie! Tom Cruise may have been bit by the BUG of SCIENTOLOGY but he delivers the GOODS! He DELIVERS I TELL YOU! The explosion in the girls HEAD was amazing ALSO! Talk about PAIN! the PAIN she must have felt! Her EYE looked all MESSED UP when the little explosive WENT OFF. This was a great movie and I WANT TO SEE MORE of these TYPES OF FLICKS! This better be the BEGINNING of a GREAT SUMMER MOVIE SPREE!"
"DVD_Connoisseur","Null","1","3","7 May 2006"," The strongest entry in the Mission Impossible series?
","The third instalment in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series is possibly the strongest to-date. This is 2 hours of action that flies by - I commented on leaving the cinema that I thought it had been a short film, it really moved at quite a pace and I'm staggered that the runtime is actually 126 minutes.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, the set-pieces are gritty and dark...I loved every minute of it. Philip Seymour Hoffman is an excellent baddie - very believable. Cruise's love-interest in the film, Michelle Monaghan, is gorgeous, as is Maggie Q. Ving Rhames is back again for a great bit of continuity. Cruise himself is superb - I always enjoy his performances and I think this is one of his best. He's genuinely excellent when he's pitting his wits against Hoffman's character. Laurence Fishburne plays the tough talking leader of the Mission Impossible team and is, again, very convincing.<br/><br/>Fans of Simon Pegg will be happy with his performance here. He makes the most of a small part and does a fine job.<br/><br/>Even if you weren't keen on the first 2 movies, this may actually appeal. It's a darker ""Mission"" this time 'round. I was worried when I found out that David Fincher was no longer directing but this fears proved fruitless. ""M:I-3"" is in safe hands with JJ Abrams at the helm.<br/><br/>I'm actually looking forward to a second viewing, it really is that good."

","Okay. People it wasn't meant to be a fantastic movie but Jesus it deserves better than 6.6. I would give it at least a high 7 or 8. I liked it better than the others. Main reason. Teamwork had a bigger part in this one. You saw all the other characters about as much as you saw Cruise. Yes the story was centered with him in the middle but it was like the old TV shows. I mean the acting was good for an action movie. I also liked that there was about as much drama as action. Referring to the acting, Hey, Tom Cruise cried. Yes he has cried in others but this was an action movie. He briefly cried in Minority Report but this was different. The movie was well made and deserves a views"
"Skip_4591","10","1","3","6 May 2006"," Fantastic Movie
","*MINOR SPOILERS* <br/><br/>This is probably the best Mission: Impossible movie and it's also a very good spy movie in its own respect. It starts out great and only gets better as the film goes along.<br/><br/>The action is great in the movie and the actual action scenes are long, intense, and thrilling. They are very well executed.<br/><br/>Phillip Seymor Hoffman's character is REALLY evil in the film, and Hoffman does an amazing acting job. Cruise is also very good in the film, especially when he gets emotional because his ""love interest"" is in danger, and when he gets beat up or tortured. You actually feel his pain, not just see it! He's great! Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames but he'll always be Luther Stickell to me. He does a great job, like always! Maggie Q, Billy Crudup, Jon Rhyes-Meyers and Simon Pegg are also great in the movie and Laurence Fishbourne also does a good job of the harsh, rough-and-tough boss.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that almost all of the characters get beat up really bad in this movie? It's true.<br/><br/>There are also some very humorous parts in the film and it does a good job of feeling like the first M:I while also executing intense action. The music in the film is also excellent.<br/><br/>The film is so good that, even though it's only a thriller, there are some parts that actually frightened or disturbed me. There are some nice twists in the film also.<br/><br/>We also finally get to see how they make those photo-realistic masks and the accompanying voice!!! The fights between Cruise and PSH are also great. There are also some VERY disturbing things PSH does in the film.<br/><br/>I am already planning to get the DVD when it comes out. This film is so great! And if you loved the vault scene from the first one, you'll also love the Vatican scene in this one. Not only does the Vatican scene feel like the vault scene, but there's also a HUGE, COLOSSAL reference to the vault scene from the first one.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is already one of my favorite films of the year and is not to be missed out on!"

","I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face. Mission Impossible 3 is an incredible film.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous two in the series, MI3 sets the correct balance between style and substance. It has plenty of both. Whilst there are plenty of far-fetched scenarios, high-class performances by Cruise and Seymour-Hoffman bring an uncanny sense of believability. The unrelenting pace of the movie, and the extraordinarily clever set pieces will keep you completely fixated right the way through. You won't question a single moment. In fact, your mind is unlikely to wander at any point in the film. You certainly won't be looking at your watch. <br/><br/>Director JJ Abrams is a master of audience control, as he demonstrated with Lost. His strength is in merging beautiful backdrops with intense action, whilst retaining the qualities of both. The locations and sets are dazzling, and hugely atmospheric. The soundtrack hits the spot, too.<br/><br/>You will love this movie, whoever you are. This is an experience that justifies a trip to the cinema - don't wait for the DVD."

","Well I'd really hoped for an Impossible Mission this time around, but I fear I didn't get it. Msiion Impossible II is just more of the same old 'you win some, you lose some' twine that usually see in action films. Sure the action is good, but with all that talent (Rhames, Hoffman and Fishburne) J.J. Abrans & Co. could have created a much more subtle, an emotionally deeper film. The first thing to irritate was actually the intro. The title music felt much too sharp after what had happened earlier. The film had very good moments as well though. Actually everything that had Rhames, Hoffman or Fishburne in it was great. Hoffman was totally under-used as the bad guy and as far as Tom Cruise was concerned. Anybody could have pulled his 'acting' off I guess. What I am getting at is that M:I III is what M:I II should have been like. A follow-up that tries to focus on a story and not effects-only. Too bad it comes 6 years too late, too bad great talent was under-used and too bad that it is too predictable at times.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

A lot of small references to Mission Impossible which I did like. Maggie Q and Billy Culdrup made their characters believable. Overall the acting and action and get this the story was great.<br/><br/>The first Mission Impossible, in my opinion, had a good plot but you had to be smart/intelligent to catch on to things. The Mission Impossible II....not so good. But JJ Abrams delivers on this one as he is one of the three credited with writing the script.

"c-blauvelt","8","1","3","5 May 2006"," It was hardly impossible: the first edge-of-your seat, roller-coaster ride of the year
","Whenever I enter the movie theater expecting to see an action thriller, I always experience a sense of trepidation anymore. So many of today's action films are so poorly shot with nauseating hand-held camera work, terrible dialogue, and wooden performances. Many action films feel they need to have as many shots as possible, facilitated by rapid, disorienting, non-continuity editing in the disastrous Michael Bay style. However, I have found my edge-of-my-seat pleasures on the small screen with the brilliant cat-and-mouse games that are ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" penned so tightly by J.J. Abrams, the new auteur television producer. So I was thrilled when I heard that Abrams was going to be directing ""Mission: Impossible III"" starring Tom Cruise. The first two installments were mindless pablum directed by accomplished directors Brian DePalma and John Woo, who completely sold out to the most extreme inanities of Hollywood. After letting the saga lie fallow for 5 years, Tom Cruise became hooked by ""Alias,"" watching the entire series over the course of a single weekend, and afterwards he knew that he had found a new director for ""Mission: Impossible"" in J.J. Abrams. Hence, we have the best installment in the series thus far, and the best movie yet of 2006.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" is an incredibly taut, well-edited, swiftly paced story with many action-packed thrills that don't become repetitive and don't rob the characters of development. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a former CIA agent in the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), who has finally distanced himself from the spy world. But of course, the spy world will always find him. As he prepares to get married to his girlfriend Julia, his old life catches up with him when a former colleague gets captured by a black-market arms dealer named Owen Davian, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film proceeds like a cinematic version of ""Alias"" with the narrative alternating between explosive action scenes, shocking twists and revelations, and thought-provoking reflections on what it means to be a spy. What I love about Cruise's character is that we really get to see him as a normal guy. We see him talking with his friends, sharing intimate moments with his girlfriend, and even picking up food at the grocery store. With so many spy dramas in the past like the James Bond series, it is difficult to understand that these spies and villains are real people. It's hard to imagine James Bond going to the grocery store to pick up milk. I think it is a lot more interesting though to explore the juxtaposition between these people's careers as spies and then the ""real"" lives they lead at home. It makes the spy characters more relatable, and it also grounds the action in reality, making it less cartoonish. There is very little about ""Mission: Impossible III"" that is cartoonish. It truly is aiming for a certain realism in depicting what it would be like to be a spy in these situations. As a result, the villains are much more down to earth. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, while certainly evil, is more of a corrupt businessman than a cartoonish super-villain.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams was an ideal choice to direct ""Mission: Impossible III"" and his unique sensibility is clearly evident in this film. The movie actually shares a similar story structure to the pilot episode of ""Alias"" since we explore what it means to be a spy as Tom Cruise's love interest is placed in peril. The question the film asks is whether it is possible to still be a normal person, and be a spy, and I think that the film answers this question with a concrete yes. For me great action films mix explosive adventure with thought-provoking concepts, and ""Mission:Impossible III"" really fits the criteria. It is extremely well shot so as to allow the viewer to make sense of what is happening on screen. It allows us to better appreciate the stunts and the effects, than so many action films which use rapid editing to cover up shoddy effects, makeup, and acting. The movie also involves critiques of U.S. foreign policy similar to those found on 24 season 5. This intellectually chewy content is perfectly interwoven with action-packed thrills, my idea of a successful action film. Be forewarned, this is a narratively dense movie. You have to pay constant attention to what is happening or you might miss some key plot twist or character reveal. But the script does make sense, unlike so many non-sensical James Bond movies, and the payoff is all the more rewarding when the action scenes have some coherent narrative motivation. This is the first great movie of 2006 and one of the best action films I've seen made outside of Hong Kong or not found on TV. I think it is an impossible mission to not enjoy this film. A-"

","A friend of mine used to gripe to me a lot that the Mission: Impossible movies resembled nothing of the television show. ""There was hardly any killing,"" he told me. ""There was just the mission. Get in, get out, and very low body count. The movies ain't like the show.""<br/><br/>I did some research on my own and came to the same conclusion, though I was entertained by the movies, where as my friend was blah.<br/><br/>Too bad Tom Cruise brought his private life public.<br/><br/>He would have made my friend a fan.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III opens with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) watching his newly wed wife, Julia (Michelle Mongahan) strapped to a chair. The antagonist, arms dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), threatens to shoot Julia if Hunt does not divulge the location of ""the rabbit's foot."" Hunt tries to stall for time, and Davian shoots her in the kneecap. Hunt honestly doesn't know where the rabbit's foot is, and then shoots Julia in the head.<br/><br/>Cue opening theme.<br/><br/>We see Hunt at an engagement party-his own. Bit of a rewind. Hunt's happy, having fun, and we find out Hunt ""works"" for the Department of Transportation. He gets a phone call asking him about an all-expenses paid trip to Mexico. Hunt tells Julia the office called and that he'll be right back.<br/><br/>He goes down to a Seven-Eleven where he meets his friend, John Musgrave (Billy Crudup). We learn Hunt's a training officer for IMF and left the field shortly after the events of MI-2. An agent he trained (Keri Russell) has gone missing while investigating Owen Davian. Hunt doesn't want to take the mission, but since Muskgrave is an old friend of his, Hunt accepts the mission.<br/><br/>He's given his team: Zheng (Maggie Q), who's a shooter as well as the team ""looker"" (in net speak, the hotness); Declan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the helicopter pilot; and returning member Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), hacker extraordinaire. They set up an elaborate plot to rescue the agent, and they get her on board the chopper when Hunt discovers a microchip in her brain with a small explosive charge-not big enough to do any real damage to anything, but enough to kill her. As the defibrillator charges, the explosive goes off, scrambling her brain.<br/><br/>Hunt's next step: to find Davian.<br/><br/>I'll stop there with plot details and hope the rest of you go to the theaters to complete the mission.<br/><br/>By my critique: the best movie in the series. A real return to the original show, but still has enough action to keep an adrenaline junkie going. Speaking of action, none of the stunts hint of CGI. They all look real, and they all look spectacular. The acting is top notch, and plot line is relevant in today's world, yet politically neutral enough to invite viewers of all walks of life.<br/><br/>85%. Great work by JJ Abrams and company."

And no matter how crazy-ass the action or conflict is, I believe it.

He can track a shirt-button-sized device inside a building halfway across the world, but he can't get a signal on his cell phone. He finds a baseball pitching machine on a few minutes notice at night in Shanghai, or maybe he always packs one on his trips. His agents can fly a helicopter between the blades of a wind turbine, his equipment can track people inside a brick building and pick who are the bad guys and shoot them without human intervention. <br/><br/>It was fun while the ""impossible"" stuff was done with imagination and creativity, not with super gadgets or super agents. <br/><br/>With all this, the film has as much suspense as painting a wall and watching it dry. Not worth going to the theatre, not worth waiting for the DVD, not worth even waiting for it to appear on TV."
"lougheed-3","9","1","4","7 May 2006"," It couldn't have been better! They nailed it at last!
","Plain an simple - a superb action film without a doubt. Cruise digs deep and gives his best action role performance ever, while Abrahams behind the camera makes a movie so slick you can smell the smoke from the gun barrels.<br/><br/>The first film was great, to be unfortunately followed by a John Woo disaster-piece. He left the team aspect of the Mission Impossible series in the closet and made the Hunt character an invincible floppy haired ponce, that more or less, people cared nothing for. His set pieces and action sets were lased with slow motion, those stupid doves and over the top moments that left cinema goers cringing at the sight (remember the gun coming out of the sand... Pele couldn't have done it). But they have left enough time go by (be it through filming delays, director problems and cast changes) that MI2 really is only distant memory and doesn't feel like it ever really belonged.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is retired from active duty and is now a training op. Happly engaged and enjoying life, the news of one of his graduates gone missing in the field lures him back into the firing line with IMF. Bring on bad guys, deadly weapons, terrorist buyers and a bang load of bullets and we get sucked in right away. The film moves briskly along from action set piece to action set piece with very little lul in between. The Vatican city raid is without doubt the best Team based mission we have seen probably in any film. Voice technology, facial reconstruction of masks and all the gadgets are displayed with great intent, showing us how real these ludicrous gizmo's could be and it is nice to see they didn't over use them unlike Woos' who's who fiasco (the taking off mask after mask thing).<br/><br/>There is little wrong with this movie, with any film of this nature you must suspend reality for one or two sections but Abrahmas doesn't go to far wrong and only ever crosses the line for a few brief moments. The knocks and the falls look like the hurt and Cruise does exceptionally well by doing quite a lot of his own stunt work... falling on car bonnets etc. He also shows off limps and disorientation after explosions and falls unlike other action films and this adds a little more realism to what should be the outlandish.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are excellent to... Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliantly sinister as the evil Owen Davian, he doesn't really get enough screen time but he does well with what he has. Ving Rhames adds nothing new to his role, but is perfect as always with the comic relief at the best of moments. Jonathan Rhys Meyers pops up yet again (rising from the Cork ashes and riding the wave of success) this year and looks the part. It is a shame he uses such a bad Dublin/Irish accent (being Irish himself), it spoils his role for us Irish to hear it (kinda like Cruise himself in Far and Away....to be sure to be sure). The standout star for most male viewers will be Maggie Q as Zehn... who adds WOW to an already great film. That dress! We'll be seeing a lot more of her more or less...<br/><br/>All in all you won't be disappointed or feeling ripped off. Pay the bucks to see it in the cinema, Dolby digital and all; it deserves the big screen treatment. The explosions will rattle your teeth and the camera work is well done. It is just an action film and if that's your buzzthen you can' to go wrong with this. If your not an action junkie and can't stand realism being bent for the sake of a blistering action sequence then don't go or else leave your tutting and ""come-on's"" for outside the cinema or for the debate in the pub after wards.<br/><br/>Well done all involved, especially after all the problems. This is a polished actioner that will have haters be it those who hate Tom himself ,those who cant leave go of Alias or those who sit back and would rather pick out mistakes and flaws. But if you should really make your own mind up about it. I've not met oner person yet who hates it...I think these people only live online. <br/><br/>Cruise should be thinking of doing a few more of these before he gets too old and he should stick with Abrahams in the chair. It looks like a winning combo!"

Hunt is now retired from CIA games and is settling down with his reasonably attractive fiancé...WHEN HE IS CALLED ON TO DO ANOTHER MISSION. The fate of the world may depend on Hunt, as he battles a psychotic criminal mastermind played expertly by recent Academy Award Winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who is going to get his hands on a deadly nerve agent. Hunt assembles the old team to save the world from Hoffman, in this action-packed high-budget summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>The acting is dreadful of course. Tom Cruise is abominable as always in his role, and Michelle Monaghan is no Glenn Close. Ving Rhames and Laurence Fishburne are solid, the other actors stink, but the real stand-out is the one of the best actors working in the business today, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman is outstanding as the villain who just nails the role and once again blew me away. Watching Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman act together was like watching Dustin Hoffman do a scene with a jack-russell terrier. The comparison is really like that. The plot is real cheesy, and the lovey-dovey scenes with Cruise and his love interest are almost unbearable with laughably corny dialogue that wouldn't even be acceptable for a Taster's Choice coffee commercial. However, the visual effects are AMAZING! The film is worth seeing just for the special effects.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission: Impossible III delivers what it promises -- real good action sequences -- and I can't gripe about that. I just wish they'd find another lead male except Tom Cruise, because I'm getting sick and tired of watching him. He's the absolute worst -- well, not as bad as Keanu Reeves. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 4/23/06)"

Its quite a shame really, cause the film had a fantastic build up throughout with the all the excitement expected from a movie branded the ""most expensive film made by a debut big screen director"". However it is not surprising that this cheap ending came about with JJ Abrams at the helm, basically due to the fact that he is well known for not being able to finish what he has started (Alias, Lost etc). Oh well, as i said, its worth a look for the big bangs and 'good guy vs bad guy' violence, but i suggest you take a watch with you so that keep time and walk out about 12 mins before the movie finishes... trust me, you've seen it too many times before."

Jackie Chan made several appearances throughout the cinema, and I was disheartened to find that he wasn't credited at all.<br/><br/>This is pretty much how I broke it down as a horrible movie. Tom Cruise would never go into a 7/11; this is a stretch any way you look at it. Tom Cruise can not do math, and I was surprised to find myself the only one laughing at that particular scene in the theater. There apparently is no cell phone coverage in all of Shanghai except for a 10 foot square that Tom Cruise had to race to. 3 hours later an IMF (IMPOSSIBLE MISSION FORCE, I CRAP YOU NOT) agent is able to trace a cellphone call from the outskirts of Shanghai to downtown. You can apparently be dead for 3-4 minutes without suffering as much as mild discomfort. Morpheus apparently was an evil bastard before meeting up with Neo. Charles Bronson did -not- make an appearance. The main villain was a cross between Louie Anderson and Jack Black. The theater itself was packed with retarded children and old people hoping they'd die before the credits rolled.

The gun fights were high on pyrotechnics, but didn't make me feel like I was there. They didn't engross me the way the battle towards the end of MI2 did. The biggest problem with this movie was the underdeveloped plot. The love story felt underdeveloped and as a result I never felt like Cruise had a real reason to be fighting.

","With his ""unacceptable behaviour"", including the jumping on the couch of The Oprah Winfry Show, this was the last film Tom Cruise (also producing) made before being fired from Paramount (after 14 years), from director J.J. Abrams (creator of Lost). Basically, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is engaged to doctor Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and while in the middle of their party, he joins (and in the end fails) a rescue mission to save past protégée agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), who he trained himself. She was kidnapped by evil dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and he of course is the next target, with knowledge of something called The Rabbit's Foot. Unfortunately, when Davian gets away, he kidnaps Ethan's now wife Julia, forcing him to steal this Rabbit's foot, and then watch his girlfriend be killed by Davian. It turns out to be another woman in disguise, and so Ethan is now determined to get his wife back, while carrying an explosive device in his skull. Also starring Ving Rhames as Luther, Big Fish's Billy Crudup as Musgrave, Match Point's Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Declan, Laurence Fishburne as Theodore Brassel, Die Hard 4.0's Maggie Q as Zhen and Eddie Marsan as Brownway and Simon Pegg as Benji. While the action, explosions and stuff are good viewing, it is the story that doesn't completely deliver, it is not as intelligent as the other two films, but Cruise does have his moments, and Hoffman excels as the villain, so it is good to try. Worth watching!"

","In many ways, Mission Impossible 3 is the best of the original trilogy. It certainly has the best narrative, in my opinion, although the first film comes close. The relationship between Ethan and Julia is wonderful, and it also has the best villain from the trilogy in Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the direction isn't particularly strong, and that's what ultimately puts this film behind the original for me. It's a shame, because I am actually quite a big fan of JJ Abrams as a filmmaker, but this was definitely the weak aspect of the third entry in the franchise.<br/><br/>The camerawork and editing were also messy, with way too much shaky-cam and shots which were so poorly pieced together that it was sometimes difficult to tell exactly what was happening on-screen. This was especially noticeable during the action scenes.<br/><br/>Thankfully, everything else about Mission Impossible 3 is great, and I had an extremely good time watching it. The script is excellently written, with plenty of drama and some tense scenes throughout. As I have already stated, Hoffman as the villain was excellent, and this was the first time in the franchise that I was actually scared for the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, whilst Mission Impossible 3 definitely has its issues, I can't deny that I was thoroughly entertained throughout.

","(Well, not the Humpty Dumpty line). I love that this film uses the moniker III and not 3. I love the red font. I love Giachinno's punched up score. I love that the opening credits are short. Speaking of the opening, I think it's one of the most powerful powerhouse openings I've ever seen. The writing is strong and economical. It's much more than Alias for $150 million.
This soft reboot and stand-alone is chock full of series firsts (Pegg, Julia etc.) and some of the best evolutions and expansions of the Mission tropes (Ensemble crew, and Davian's mask run is a highlight).
In a career full of tremendous performances, Philip Seymour manages to make an action movie arms dealer villain one of his best. Cruise's Hunt in this film is a real human, raw, emotional, he flinches, he's wild, and yet he's a total and dedicated badass here also.
Abrams packs a lot in to this film. Almost too much and there's a dab of fatigue and rush towards the end. But everything that is done here is done spectacularly. It may not be the most perfectly formed but it is my favourite by a country mile.
Impossible Mission: I'm tempted to put any number of the sequences in this film, but the building fulcrum probably pips it for the mission that most homages the first film. The set up is kinda rough and ready and so is the execution; the big gag being the fulcrum and the the actual infiltration being a kind of bait and switch by not showing you. It's a clever little old school sequence that paved the way for Ghost Protocol."
"TheHonestCritic","10","0","1","9 February 2020"," This is the best ""Mission: Impossible"" movie, and it always will be.
","""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), this is the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film I have seen from the franchise. I didn't go see it in the theater, I bought it on DVD about two years after it's release. When I watched it, I had no idea what to expect. But, I was blown away within the first five minutes, honestly. It kept me hooked from beginning to end, and then some! Still, to this day, it is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best movie of the ""Mission: Impossible"" film series. For those who may not know, this film series is based off a classic TV series created by Bruce Geller. Usually, you can't top the original TV series or film(s). However, with this film, and a few of the others in this franchise, I have to say that these movies are better than the original ""Mission: Impossible"" TV show. As much as I love the original show, the movie series is much better. ""Mission: Impossible III"" is among the best of the film franchise. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is one of the most creative I have ever seen, as far as spy films are concerned. It's full of action, suspense, a few comedic moments, etc. This movie certainly lives up to it's title, it really is ""Mission: Impossible""! From beginning to end, it keeps you guessing all the way through and anticipating what happens next. Storylines don't get much better than that! The acting is stellar, from every actor and actress! But, of course Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt steals the show. Michelle Monaghan is fantastic as Julia, Ethan's wife. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Owen Davian is a phenomenal villain, and definitely one of the top 10 best live-action movie villains I have ever seen. He is cold, calculating, menacing and very dangerous. As far as the rest of the actors and actresses go, they are flawless. Their performances really make you care about the characters, and you want them to win in the end. But Tom Cruise's performance is brilliant, he makes this movie. He has played a lot of terrific roles, but I think that Ethan Hunt is by far his best role! The sets/locations are very well done, and truly set the tone for the movie. All of the sets/locations are great, but my personal favorite set is the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. Some of the scene was shot on the actual bridge, but the actual fight sequence was filmed on a movie set. The scene takes place in Delmarva, the peninsula where I currently live, which is awesome! Great special effects and a set go hand in hand during this action scene! All of the special effects are very well done and hold up today. One thing that I'm always skeptical about is the use of shaky cam. But, this is one of those rare movies that gets it right. It adds a whole new level of tension, and you can actually see what's going on perfectly! Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it certainly helps to bring this film to life. Michael Giacchino, you have produced a fantastic soundtrack. You never disappoint! ""Mission: Impossible III"" is one of the best spy films and best action films of all-time. Director J.J. Abrams, you did an exceptional job with directing this masterpiece! This movie is J.J. Abrams' directorial debut, and as far as directing goes, this is J.J. Abrams at his best. That's insane, when a directorial debut brings a phenomenal movie just like this. He should be proud, I know I sure would be! It's just a shame that the other movies he directed are trash. Any way, I love ""Mission: Impossible III"" so much, that I think I'll watch it again later today, even though I watched it last night! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. To anyone out there looking to get into the ""Mission: Impossible"" film series and don't know where to begin, start here. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch ""Mission: Impossible III"". Do you think you can handle the mission?"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","5 January 2020"," Needs more Hoffman
","First of all, amazing first scene. One of the best I've seen in years. A great example of dropping the audience in the middle of it and letting them squirm. In a good way.<br/><br/>If only the rest of the film could have been as good. Not to say the it's a bad film. Quite the opposite. Tom Cruise has rarely been as comfortable in a role as he's as Ethan Hunt, and that shows. There's a reason why there are so many of these films. It fills a comfortable niche somewhere between James Bond and Bourne. More gadgets than Bourne, but more gritty than Bond. Plus the heists. Can't forget those.<br/><br/>I'd say M:i:III is not quite as good as the original, although it's a slight difference, but that it's miles better than its immediate predecessor. The plot is once again rather straightforward and mainly there to allow for cool sets and scenes. That being said, I do like that Hunt is at least attempting to settle down. I like the dynamic he has with his wife. And I like the addition of Simon Pegg into the franchise. Every franchise needs more Simon Pegg in them, but not all are fortunate enough to receive it.<br/><br/>But what I really like is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. From the very first scene he's brutally captivating. And yet he whispers half of his lines. And that's quite genuinely creepy. It's like he's always in control, always one step ahead. Even when he's obviously not, he remains for the most part unperturbed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately he's not in the film nearly enough. He's there at the start and the film does revolve around him, but there are not that many scenes where he's at the forefront. And that's a shame.<br/><br/>Still, it's more than passable action spy film, and well worth a watch if you're a fan of the previous films."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Mission Impossible 3 (2006)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) comes into conflict with a dangerous and sadistic arms dealer (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who threatens his life and his fianceé in response.<br/><br/>This is the directorial debut of J.J. Abrams and was released at a time when Cruise was still being ridiculed for jumping on Oprah's sofa when promoting War Of The Worlds.<br/><br/>I remember really liking this when it was released, thinking it brought the franchise (and ended it) on the right track. A really enjoyable popcorn flick is how I remembered it!! Watching it now I was disappointed in it, and found myself playing with my phone in several occasions. Is it silly to be disappointed in a pop corn flick?? <br/><br/>The movie does a lot of things right, but it does nearly as many things wrong. I'll start with what I liked first. Right at the top of the list by a mile is a surprisingly intimidating Philip Seymour Hoffman. Owen Davian isn't the usual lunatic or a cultured villain. He's a deadly serious man who has no problems with killing anyone who gets in his way or those that let him down. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is a bit more human this time round, Laurence Fishburne is decent in his M like role and Simon Pegg is equally fun in his Q type role. The movie opens with a great, intense two-minute pre-credits scene. <br/><br/>Sadly the Bond-like pre credits sequence is so intense, a lot of what follows fella flatter, as we wait to catch up to that scene. The latex face device from the first two movies is still being used and despite a lot actions set pieces it lacks excitement. <br/><br/>It's better than the second one, but not as good as the first. Overall it's nothing more than a routine action movie, when I remembered much more. <br/><br/>I think Cruise's reputation at the time probably hurt this at the box office, as it finished the 14th highest grossing movie of the year, with a domestic gross of $134 million."

","This was the only one of the (so far) four 'M:I' films that I hadn't seen. To be honest this franchise has never really moved the needle for me. The biggest problem is that Ethan Hunt hasn't been fleshed out. He doesn't have a specific personality or set of traits. No catchphrases or history. He's just very generic. Change the name and title these films could just be any Tom Cruise action flick.<br/><br/>Now each film certainly has its own distinct style, thanks largely to landing a rather impressive list of auteur directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo. Here it's JJ Abrams in his first feature as director. The action is fast and stylish, but despite the belabored attempts to give Hunt some dimension, it lacks the propulsive narrative to give any of it the necessary weight."

And the consequences of keeping his 'social relations', in the shadows and out of bounds, and out of his own life ?!<br/><br/>If that is the point, it has not been projected properly to appeal to the audience's sensibilities."

","Last night I watched MI ghost protocol (the one after this one) on the recommendation of my brother---this one seemed much worse but maybe it is partially just that I have had my fill of this stuff? This movie seemed to drag on and on and on. The night stuff is particularly tedious because you can't even enjoy the cinematography. In fact the whole Chinese part was a drag.<br/><br/>The story a crazy bad man wants to start a war using ""the Rabbit's foot"" probably a deadly virus that will be dropped on the middle east oil countries. But IMF has been infiltrated! Ethan Hunt must find and deliver the ""rabbits foot"" to the bad guy within 48 hours or his new wife will be killed.<br/><br/>Let me pause here. These movies are what they are (action and tech gimmicks and some well done black humor) trying to tack on melodrama (Cruise's new wife) and the twists of double crossing by infiltration effectively ruins them by slowing things way down. In fact melodrama is the exact thing you don't want in these nor confusing infiltration issues. They are essentially like action video games with great cinematography and tech tricks adding other things ruins them. Black humor (however) can enhance them a lot (but only if done well.)<br/><br/>There is an attempt at humor in this movie during the Vatican sequence that falls completely flat. With a caricature of Italians arguing. It just wasn't well acted neither Cruise nor the other actor made convincing Italians. <br/><br/>The part at the Vatican was fun (daylight) but it runs out of steam when the double crosses start etc...and from the bridge scene on it is tedious. It was boring enough that you begin to wonder about Cruise's height (5'6) and sexuality and wish it would just end.<br/><br/>It sort of combines Melodrama Yuppie stuff (Cruise's new bride is a Pediatric Resident) with Bond and Kung Fu stuff---do I see a little Chinese provenance in the back ground??<br/><br/>The one last night MI Ghost was significantly better but maybe also my quota of this stuff is limited since I am no longer 14?<br/><br/>DO NOT RECOMMEND if over 14<br/><br/>Stats: The film cost $150 million and grossed $400 million world wide.

None of this is interesting or surprising, but after all, it's just setup up for what comes next.<br/><br/>What comes next is guns and explosions, an air battle cleverly set on a wind farm, and an unfortunate outcome. Then there's Cruise getting yelled out for that outcome.<br/><br/>And about a half hour into the film I said, I don't care. I like movies where people shoot guns and blow up stuff, but I need to care about something. I need to like the characters. I need to be interested in the story. I need to be engaged by the dialog. In MI3 I felt I was just being assaulted by unpleasant violence and then assaulted by tedious exposition and dreary romance before the next blow up.<br/><br/>While I hoped Abrams would do something interested, what I saw of this movie is completely by the numbers, even including not one but two damsel-in-distress scenarios in the first quarter. <br/><br/>I like a lot of big Hollywood blockbusters, but this movie is everything those who hate such movies complain about, a big, macho, noisy time waster. It will take someone more impressive than Abrams to lure me to anything else in this series, so unless Scorcese decides to take a stab at it, this will be my second, and last, MI film."

","I have never really been much fan of neither the series or the movie series. I have seen the first movie and now the third movie, but never really gotten around to putting them into the DVD player, always watched them when shown on TV.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 3"" is actually an enjoyable action movie, and the storyline is quite good as well. The movie is fast paced, although it doesn't really offer much to challenge your mind. The story is easy to follow, straight forward and linear. It would be been better if the story actually let you to guess at things and throw an occasional plot twist here and there. But that is not the case.<br/><br/>The action sequences in ""Mission: Impossible 3"" are nicely executed and nicely filmed, which makes it really enjoyable. I especially liked the camera work in the movie.<br/><br/>As for the cast, then there was some pretty good names to the cast list. It was just a shame that Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't more in the movie than he was, as his portrayal of Owen Davian was really nice and he brought a lot to the movie. But of course, the rest of the cast also did good jobs with their given roles, and I believe I don't have to go into names here.<br/><br/>Having seen only part one prior to watching the third movie in the series, I am not really sure if I am missing out on anything major in the movie, any continuation of storyline or important features from the previous movies. And even if such, then ""Mission: Impossible 3"" can be seen as a stand-alone movie.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 3"" is enjoyable, fast-paced and entertaining."

","Tom Cruise has got something almost no one else in Hollywood has, a searing focus and intensity that comes through like some military laser. Despite all the recent hoopla, no one else could possibly seem as dedicated to the mission as Tom. And for some reason that helps us join in on his adventures from our cozy seats in a way others can't deliver as consistently. But without a story and a director to go with it, it's all for naught. Well, fear not! Like Roeper of Ebert & Roeper, I think this is easily the best of the Mission Impossible movies. J.J. Abrams delivers an adrenaline rush that only falters a little near the end, when we're near exhaustion anyway. This is a guy's movie and it kicked off my weekend in fine form. True, it starts out with a somewhat 'feminine' premise, namely that Ethan wants to settle down with the comely Julia, played by Michelle Monaghan. But it only uses that simple motivation to kick off the full-tilt festivities that are captured beautifully by ""24""s director, J.J. Abrams. Having just recently gotten into ""24"", I was not expecting the movie I got. Abrams was able to reach a level not really hinted at in the TV series."
"thesar-2","8","0","1","23 January 2011"," The III stands for: see it. SEE IT! SEE IT!!
","Sorry, I try and come up with a better headline for my reviews, but since Mission: Impossible III had the extreme unfortunate timing of being released almost immediately following Mr. Tom Cruise's rants, raving and couch jumping, practically no one saw not only the best of the franchise, but one of the best action movies I've seen.<br/><br/>Though I did not grow up on the original Jim Phelps series, despite my father's futile attempts, I thoroughly understand the concept: Spy + Action. The first Mission: Impossible dealt ONLY with the spy part. The second movie, ONLY action. Finallythey got it right with Part III: they successfully blended both spy and action and(SPOILER don't read the final part of this paragraph if you haven't seen Parts I or III yet) the team lives, like they're supposed to! Unlike Part I, where 90% of the team diesIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES and they improperly make the leaderJim Phelps, himselfa bad guy.<br/><br/>At any rate, public opinion really should've been thrown out the window on this one. Seriously, I have no opinion on the Oprah couch rants or Tommy's battle with one-time-famous Brooke Shields (The Blue Lagoon) and it should NOT have any bearing on the quality of this nearly excellent film. It's like my fruitless protest of Chick-fil-A since its run by Mormons who like to close the doors on Sundays. I mean, they have great chicken sandwiches, no?<br/><br/>A lot of the success of Part III has to be contributed to the soon-to-be-labeled-MASTER J.J. Abrams (Star Trek (2009).) They had faith in him to rejuvenate the series, and he would'veby a mile with the quality used in this film, if not for the judgmental public. Shame on you! You're missing out on (again) one of the best action movies ever.<br/><br/>I'm all for people giving their educated opinions on topics, but when you dismiss one thing because of another, you're not giving it a chance. I'm not completely innocent myself, but I find more and more, I am opening my mind prior to watching a movie despite past bad performances or public outcries. For example, Sean Penn is not my favorite actors and he's a huge advocate, but that won't stop me from watching his movies to see if I'll ever be impressed. And, unbelievably, I have at times.<br/><br/>I need to step off the pedal stool, and talk about the greatness here. We start at the end with an obvious object of (sorta ex-) spy Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) affection being tortured while Ethan can't do anything to stop it. Going back in (time in) the story we see how Ethan's adjusted well with his personal life after semi-retiring from spying. Unfortunately that (very quickly) goes south when he's called back to duty to rescue an old student of his, Lindsey (Keri Russell.)<br/><br/>She was working on something called the ""Rabbit's Foot"" that eeevil Owen (Hoffman) wants to obtain and sell. Ethan must scale the globe to solve the case of the missing rabbit's foot, appease his mean boss (Fishburne) and save his girlfriend.<br/><br/>The movie's not in line with the Bourne franchise, but it's fairly close. Its fun, has great dialogue, a wonderful villain in (the ALWAYS impressive) Hoffman, has exciting action sequences, marvelous cinematography and the best score of the (first) three movies. Oh, and it's funny, thanks the always hilarious Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>I understand the movie (unjustifiably) bombed, thanks, America, but I am glad Hollywood still have faith by bringing it back with a fourth installment in 2011especially now starring one of my favorites: Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>Put aside your feeling of Tom as a human – who are we to judge? – and just enjoy this hugely fun roller-coaster of adventure."

"hitchcockthelegend","8","0","1","26 August 2010"," What I'm selling and who I'm selling it to should be the last thing you're concerned about... Ethan.
","Mission: Impossible III is the third film based on the spy-themed television series Mission: Impossible. It's directed by J. J. Abrams and stars Tom Cruise (reprising his role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Maggie Q & Simon Pegg. Location filming was spread across China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California and Virginia), and Vatican City.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has retired from active duty and is enjoying contented bliss with his future wife Julia (Monaghan). However, he is called back into action to help rescue one of his former IMF pupils from the bad guys. This brings Hunt into a conflict with evil arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman) and sets the wheels in motion for a good versus bad battle that could spell disaster for anyone close to Ethan.<br/><br/>If you believed the Tom Cruise haters then you would think that he needed a hit so badly he trundled out a second sequel to the popular Mission Impossible series. However, since this came a year after the gargantuan success of War of the Worlds, and two years after garnering praise for his turn in Michael Mann's Collateral, it's clear this is more than just a cash in job. Cruise cares about the franchise, and tho no quotes suggest it, he possibly felt that Mission Impossible 2 was tepid and not befitting the entertaining core he wants for the series. So enter J. J. Abrams, who slipped into the director's chair vacated by David Fincher (off to work on Zodiac) and Joe Carnahan (upset about the tone of the story). It was an inspired choice by Cruise, for Abrams, already a TV darling after Lost & Alias, wanted to personalise Hunt whilst returning to the techno trickery of Bruce Webber's original TV series. And he got it. What he also got was Cruise on mega action star wattage form and an end product to sit with the best action film's of the year. It also became easily the best film of the trilogy after the convoluted first film and John Woo's safe, but uninspired, sequel.<br/><br/>It's silly of course, very much so, but it's the kind of whizz bang silliness that often sinks lesser action movies. It's true to say as well that the personalisation of Hunt, IE: the dreaded romance angle, is nothing less than standard by the numbers fluff. The writing in truth could have done with spending more time with the splendidly vile Hoffman than with the Cruise & Monaghan (engaging and fine enough) axis. While the support cast all fade weakly into Cruise's shadow as he totally dominates from start to finish. But this is about bang for your buck nonsense, where excellently constructed action sequences flow thick and fast and the gadgets (brain bombs are just brilliant) are never in short supply. And so we come back to the Cruise haters, who, I can guarantee will hate this with their every breath. Because this is Cruise: The Movie, perhaps the ultimate superstar vehicle of the last decade? But whisper it to them quietly, he's pretty darn good at the action stuff, and Abrams knows this too, and directs accordingly. A third sequel will arrive in 2011, as an action movie fan I'll be first in the queue. 8/10"

","I like this movie, not as previous two, but its close. I like the action sequences, one of the best shot most definitely, breathe taking, fast, exploding and most important well constructed and thoughtfully done. Unfortunately the characters have very few lines and no space to be developed in all that action, though they are not left totally faceless. The exception is the villain who doesn't have much time as other characters, but is fully blooded, powerful and completely frightening, an outstanding performance by Academy Award Winning Hoffman. However the thing that stooped me from giving higher score are the jokes which were well fit and entertaining through whole movie, but insisting on them in the ending scenes was destructing and little bit annoying. The same mistake JJ Abrams did 3 years later with Star Trek."

","Tom Cruise has more than the world to save in Mission:Impossible 3. I know i'm a bit late on reviewing this,but after seeing it again for the first time in years, i've realized that this is the best in the series. Though I never saw the original. I really enjoyed Mission:Impossible 2. I thought it was a lot of fun. But Mission impossible 3 delivers more.<br/><br/>Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt. After he gets married to Julia(Michelle Monaghan), he worries about putting her life in danger. But unfortunately does on his next mission. His next mission is to stop Owen Davian(played menacingly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a weapon maker who is trying to get ahold of a weapon code named ""The Rabbits foot"".<br/><br/>M:I 3 is very well made. It's action packed and very entertaining and gripping. The acting is actually decent too. From both Cruise and Hoffman,two great actors who both starred in one of my three favorites,Magnolia, years earlier.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the third round even more after all of these years. I mean i'm not saying that I disliked it years ago, but I appreciate it more now that I understand it a bit more. Another great thing about this film:The locations.<br/><br/>It's fun watching Tom Cruise, Maggie Q, Ving Rhames, and Johnathan Rhyes Meyers travel to Shanghai and Rome and Berlin. Another great thing is the cast. I mean besides the ones above, we have Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Keri Russell. I enjoyed the third one. I had a lot of fun with it."
"elshikh4","7","0","4","19 August 2009"," Finally, (Alias: The Movie) !
","So this is the third movie already based on one of the most errant TV shows in the movies' world. I believe it has nothing to do with the previous 2 movies. The first one was Brian DePalma' spy piece where the hero was framed, the good old Jim of the original series was a traitorous, and there were couple of action scenes. The second one was John Woo's action bomb where he got to explode everything and anything in our faces, for the sake of making absurd Bond out of, yes, Tom Cruise! Now, it's J.J. Abrams's Alias. And it has the best of the past 2 movies, and nearly none of their problems.<br/><br/>It was a smart move when they brought Abrams to write and direct. The distinct thing about Abrams's work back in his famous TV show Alias (2001-2006) is his brilliant combination of sci-fi, action, thrill, espionage and the saturated dramatic lines as well. He mixed Bond, Mission: Impossible, with the old classic soap operas all in one. Here, with Alias's writing buddies Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, he did what he does best. I loved that he was the first to handle the franchise, and be that loyal to the too memorable music tracks that Lalo Schifrin wrote for the original TV show; it's like ""This is dedicated to the TV series' lovers"".<br/><br/>It's breathless and twisty, but with few weak points. Don't ask where the English girl, that Cruise lived such a *mythical* love story with in part 2, had gone! As this is a whole new ballgame. And I won't make game of it, because Cruise here loved the one that deserved the marriage. What did bother was elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's Bond more than anything. True that the ""team"" is more present this time, however as nearly ghosts. At one moment, we'd be about knowing them; and I mean the scene in the car about the prayer of the lost cat. But sorry. Cruise, or Abrams, had to interrupt with big matters. The matters that bring the money! Though, this is the most MI movie to date. The entire movie is shot in close-ups; the old TV habits die hard I suppose. It lacks some dazzling long shots to intense the cinematic feel, so people would go to watch something else what they watch in 24.<br/><br/>Then, the movie's top problem: The third act. It's not related to the quality, the coherence, or the strength of the first 2 acts. From the moment of capturing Cruise in China, till the happy end; I wasn't happy at all. It's close to the final acts that ruined fine movies before. For instance: Why the CIA's disloyal agent is that craving to know what was in the message of Cruise's murdered agent?!, why all the trouble to make a mask for Cruise's wife, put it on someone's else face, then BANG?!, and most of all: Where is the climax?!<br/><br/>After loud pretty action sequences, we land on a very pale disappointing climax? I think Abrams knows well that after charismatic missions like freeing Cruise's apprentice, kidnapping the arm dealer, stealing the rabbit foot--it's rejected to finish shortly with something that doesn't top or equal its prior. It takes only the head's bomb, which's a very easy way to get rid of THE BAD GUYS! How to fight powerful enemies by machine guns, helicopters and other more sophisticated stuff, in lands, skies and tunnels, then beat them all in just 2 minutes in a room by fistfight and one bullet?!! This is what uneven, deficient, and unsatisfied is all about. And I suspect that this was the reason why the box office's profit wasn't spectacular!<br/><br/>The roller-coaster pace was ideal for this kind of fares. Yes, dear Tommy is short, close to idiot, and unbelievable as action lead, but here you have absolutely NO TIME to complain about that, or remember it much (thus there is no slow-mo, nor doves, this round as well!). There are some classic moments: the delaying of the phony voice of the disguised Cruise in the bathroom. Giving the CIA ""We're Family"" song as the cherry over the tart of Cruise's escaping. ""It's complicated"" which is a wicked funny line; it can really summarize Abrams's winning formula in writing when it comes to Alias and Lost. And the rabbit foot, as the thing that everybody wants and doesn't reveal its reality, was a nice sneer from the movie-makers at themselves, because nobody actually cares about this stuff, just the action around it, otherwise the writers have had it with creating similar stuff for every episode of Alias, so leaving it unnamed seemed like a good idea!<br/><br/>It is Alias: The Movie. Not merely by many references through the start; with home party, sending for the agent by false phone call, the secret meeting in a supermarket, and even the cameo of Greg Grunberg ""Alias's Weiss""!, as we still have: A raw agent, a man this time, who clashes with the superiors. A mole in the intelligence. A genius stumbling cute technician (British this time). An agent who hides his real identity on his dearest ones. Playing ""around the world in 80 seconds"" and getting away with it! The tension between love and work. And the insisting on building a family as the sole balance that saves any human being.<br/><br/>I pitied Alias's team, when would it be for them to have their movie??? Maybe after 30 years as the original Mission: Impossible TV show had been treated! But anyhow, some of Alias's spirit finally had been immortalized in a movie. They should put MI3 with Alias's DVD package as bonus!"

","I'm biased, me... I'm old enough to remember and revere the 60's original and better yet got to view them all again (and I do mean all) recently on a classic TV satellite channel, with the great cast of the ultra-cool Steven Hill, ultra-resourceful Martin Landau and ultra-beautiful Barbara Bain, in neat, intricately plotted story lines, wrapped up in 50 entertaining minutes. You were lucky in the TV show if a gun was shot in anger far less saw helicopters fly in and out of a jungle of wind-powered generators as ""MI3"" improbably starts. They even get the ""Your mission, Jim..."" prelude wrong by fatally delaying its entry and playing it completely wrong.<br/><br/>I actually have no problem with the re-launch of the franchise in the 90's and beyond and remember thrilling to the previous De Palma and John Woo-helmed predecessors, it's just that this third outing looks too often like a computer game converted into a movie (a la ""Tomb Raider"", ""Resident Evil"" and no doubt ""Time Crisis"" to come!) rather than the other way round and as well as re-hashing a lot of the stuff from numbers 1 & 2 (which means more face-morphing, base jumps et al.), it also cops from other high-adrenaline thrill-fests past and present. Most obvious is a bridge-sundering cataclysm last seen in ""True Lies"", but there are so many echoes of any other number of recent Bourne and Bond flicks that I stopped counting.<br/><br/>The best scenes reminded me of the TV series, notably a cleverly staged, slickly actioned kidnapping of Philip Seymour-Hoffman's master-villain Michael Davian (although when they morphed Cruise's face into Hoffman's he somehow seems to develop the latter's paunch too!) but there were too few of these. The rest is bluster, flashy but empty pyrotechnics on the ground and in the air, painfully corny lovey-dovey nonsense between Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his new missus (""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" anyone?) and the requisite empty buddy-buddy bonding between Cruise and the rest of his team.<br/><br/>And as for the acting, well Tom runs and runs and runs - more even than he did in ""The Firm"" and of course comes back from the dead at the end to save the world and his honeymoon. Hoffman is probably the best of the bunch, if still a lesser presence than Dougray Scott in MI2 while Simon Pegg gets a sub-Cleese/Dench cameo part as Cruise's nerdy tech-guy Benji (Benji !?!).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the two hours watching-time went past quickly and I was nevr bored. However it all made for arather hollow by-rote experience. Time for Ethan and his crew to leave the field for better exponents of this particular art - I'm thinking of Mr Bourne and a certain Mr wayne in Gotham City. To paraphrase the old Bond song, somebody does it better...!"

Jon Voight has set the precedent quite high and Anthony Hopkins was a class in his own right.<br/><br/>Again the fine balance maintained by Brian De Palma is a unattainable but its safe to say J J Abrams was good in his own right. <br/><br/>Its a pity owing to the fallout, this franchise might not progress ahead but it did have loads of potential to be its own version of Bond/ Bourne."
"anifanmc","9","0","1","17 March 2009"," What Mission Impossible is all about!
","This was genuinely one of the first movies of the summer that I enjoyed when it came out. I was in India at the time, so I was lucky to see it in a movie cineplex which offered undubbed English versions of films, and it was worth it. I didn't expect much from it initially but it was literally an adrenaline ride all throughout - sheer action, not the stylized nonsense that was MI:2.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams' direction and Orci/Kurtzman's writing team is absolute ace in this film. The plot feels like a real return to Mission Impossible - instead of a megalomaniacal Bond-esquire plan as in the second film, we have an arms/bioweapons dealer who wants to acquire a very expensive, very dangerous bioweapon of unknoown power referred to as the ""Rabbit's Foot"". Ethan Hunt is sent from retirement from active duty to rescue his former trainee, who has been captured by the arms dealer. The mission fails at almost literally the last second, but not before she's able to tell Ethan of a traitor inside of IMF (hearkening back to the first film). Ethan's wife is eventually captured by the arms dealer, and, driven by revenge, he goes to heavy lengths to retrieve her and bring the dealer to justice.<br/><br/>This film has a slew of strengths. Tom Cruise, for all of his media publicity and stunts, is an amazing actor, and he delivers the familiar Ethan Hunt while adding something new to his role. Ving Rhames comes back as Luthor Stickel, his partner, and he has three more wingmen in his crew, two of them played by Simon Pegg and Maggie Q. All of them, while relatively underdeveloped, play their parts well. My biggest problem with the second Mission Impossible has always been that the movie threw out the essence of the Mission Impossible TV and film franchise - namely, teamwork - to create a movie starring a character from the Mission Impossible series in a James Bond plot playing a James Bond style character. While this is good for James Bond, it is terrible for Ethan Hunt, who plays the pointman but actually has significant backup from the others on his team. This isn't to say Hunt's character isn't memorable - he's still the main hero of the story.<br/><br/>The most impressive performance probably comes from the villain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's not invincible or more powerful than the heroes, but he causes some pain and suffering to them which was quite a shock to me. The only weak point of this film, I believe, is the underdeveloped romance between Ethan Hunt and his nurse fiancée/wife who ends up kidnapped later in the film. Although well intentioned as a plot device, you don't really feel anything for her on your own. The emotion and sense of suspense comes from Cruise's acting as Ethan Hunt, not from the actress.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the action sequences and character pieces are brilliant. Most of the negative reviews that I've read have been nasty diatribes on Cruise's character in his personal life - which, while admittedly shady, have no bearing on his excellent performance in this film. If they made a fourth one in a similar bearing, I would probably line up to watch it."
"taford02-1","9","0","1","13 March 2009"," Thanks for the Ideal
","I really appreciate that the producer, director, and Tom Cruise had the courage to show people of many apparent different ethnicities conclaving at Ethan's home for his engagement party. How can we ever expect society to reflect that which is never put forth as an ideal? I also appreciate that everyone on the team represented a different culture. Not only was the movie wonderful(although MI II is my favorite), It suggests an ideal that all races can work and live together in social harmony. Way to go!<br/><br/>I don't know that I appreciate the other symbolism--for instance, the allusion that there are many people masquerading as priests--Hmm, a little touchy but basically a harmless depiction. You know, audiences aren't as naive as they once were. And although all of us accept a certain amount of unreality (after all it is Mission ""Impossible"")as part and parcel of the MI mystique--it would have been nice if a medical consultant had been enlisted to make the part about defibrillation more believable. I think the average viewer probably bought it though."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","13 March 2009"," The film the Mission: Impossible franchise desperately needed.
","Mission: Impossible III plunges you head first into both chaos, anxiety, fear and general hatred towards the bad-guys as well as sympathy and remorse towards the good. The very first scene of the film sees Tom Cruise in a helpless and rather desperate situation as a psychotic arms dealer named Davian (Seymour Hoffman) holds a gun to our man Ethan Hunt's wife's head spouting some nonsense about a rabbit's foot. The scenario is futile with only one, tragic outcome seemingly going to occur. Systematically and within the opening few minutes of the film, new franchise director J.J. Abrams injects something that had been lacking throughout Mission: Impossible II's entirety: feeling and the general aura of threat, or something at stake.<br/><br/>Gone are the days, thank God, when a long haired Tom Cruise smirked nonchalantly as he pottered about on screen emitting all the necessary characteristics that made you want to throttle him. Gone are the days when Cruise, having just come off an ego-led high following an Oscar nomination for Magnoila, catered to John Woo, who just blew lots of stuff up, had everyone wear masks and at once point came close to having his characters physically fly following a motorcycle chase. The fluffy, two-bit and wholesome bore that was the second 'MI' film has gone and has been replaced by 'sit there and struggle whilst bound to a chair as I threaten to execute your wife'. It's quite a jump, yes, but a welcome one.<br/><br/>Up front, this Mission: Impossible is probably the best of the three but that isn't too much of a commendation. The film has its action, true, but it doesn't allow the action to overtake the narrative and what's at stake. You can argue, rightfully so, that the action set pieces in this are better to that of the first but that is principally down to the fact J.J. Abrams can direct action of this magnitude better than Brian De Palma can; that's no disservice to De Palma, a wonderful director and far more accomplished, but this is territory that Abrams just slots into. If De Palma directs action as an eerie and suspenseful sequence of motions (station shootout in Carlito's Way as well as the pool hall scene plus the drug deal prior to the 'chainsaw' scene in Scarface), then Abrams directs action as a spectacle: the jet, the helicopter, the guy being thrown off his feet into a window, the machine gun fire, etc. When I recall De Palma's 'MI', I recall the coming down through the ceiling and the opening ten minutes as memorable set pieces whereas the chopper in the tunnel at the end was a bit silly and an easy, explosive way to end a summer released espionage film.<br/><br/>But Abrams does this well and maintains an interesting story that spaces the action set pieces fairly well. The first of these is a rescue mission in Berlin during which Hunt actually comes out of retirement from the force and rescues the needy via gun fights, escape and general mayhem. It is this that spawns a certain postcard that is delivered to Hunt and this in turn spawns the notion that baddie Owen Davian should be apprehended. This action set piece pays special attention to getting into the establishment, apprehending the target and then 'cloning' him in the way they do before trying to escape in the manner they do. What follows is a shoot out on a bridge and one or two other action scenes later on.<br/><br/>These action scenes vary in form, from a rescue mission; to an apprehension to a dealing with an ambush and each feel nicely spaced as a consequence of the film's progressing rather than for showy reasons. The crux of the film is about terrorism; it's about arms dealing. Its villain is selling weapons and terrorism will be the result of their actions should the heroes fail. This is the first post 9/11 Mission: Impossible and the fear of further terrorism as a result of the heroes' (the West's?) incompetence is quite clearly up there on screen. It's an interesting array of ideas, backed up by a very True Lies inspired scenario revolving around Hunt being what he is and Hunt's wife, Julia (Monaghan), not knowing this. Like True Lies, it establishes this female character as this unspectacular and seemingly normal individual before ripping her out of the mould and forcing her to become a bit of a solider herself or a life saver; but that would be spoiling too much.<br/><br/>If there are flaws, it's that towards the end, little individual stunts begin to tarnish the hard work laid down. Someone shoots out tyres from beneath a truck, whilst getting a phone signal and putting pressure on a gun wound mostly all at once and I think Abrams gets a little carried away with his action  maybe they hadn't spent so much of the budget, realised the film was closing and just put everything into a last hurrah for the climax. Still, the action is good and well spaced; we care for the characters and the narrative doesn't demand we be too dismissive of it. If there is a fourth, it needs to build on what Abrams has most certainly laid down right here."

","Mission:Impossible is good. MI:2 is great. MI:3 is pretty good and a worthy addition to the series. It did not do too great at the box office this time around. I am surprised at that. It must be because of Tom Cruise's antics a few years back.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt returns to action. He retired from the field and now he has to go back on the field to rescue an agent he personally trained and eventually his own wife. He has to defeat the evil guy who is the evilest out of the three villains in the series in my opinion.<br/><br/>Cruise did a decent job. He may be getting along in years, but that doesn't stop his stunts. The rest of the cast is great such as Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, Maggie Q, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Laurence Fishburne.<br/><br/>As with most action movies, the action and stunts are great. The special effects were just as good. The plot can be considered weak.

Cruise, like maybe only Willis, is an actor who took the opportunity to reinvent himself. (For a suggestive contrast now, take a look at Costner, Rourke, Gibson .) I liked the 3rd installment of the franchise it's fastpaced, interesting and dynamic.<br/><br/>Lalo Schifrin's cool note reminds of the naughty and cheeky '60s, no relation to this movie. The franchise it's like the bowdlerized series. Cruise looks well, in fact he's the only one looking really good in this unglamorous movie directed by Abrams.<br/><br/>Seymour Hoffman is mediocre, but then he's a mediocre actor.<br/><br/>Returning to Cruise's career, one sees he's ambitious and focused.

But my tastes and my son's don't always jive - but I thought I'd try it.<br/><br/>Well, I have to say I found it very entertaining and definitely action packed. But not too much action because I don't like the kind that has your head hurting from all violence,etc. The special effects are amazing and everything looked so realistic. That is, from a visual perspective at least - that's not to say everything is logical or plausible. I also liked that there was good plot development which I often find lacking in some of the action packed movies. Seems a lot of movies in that genre think that if they are loud and fast enough, and blow up enough things and crash enough cars, that plot isn't necessary.<br/><br/>Cruise really puts his heart in his performance, as he does most of his roles. I haven't seen any of the other MI films so I was surprised to not feel lost watching just the 3rd installment of the franchise.<br/><br/>The musical score is very engaging and matches the action without being too distracting.

","It's interesting to consider why films based on TV series usually don't work, and why a few have. Most of the time, the film versions don't have a lot of respect for the TV series. If you don't remember the TV series, the movie is a bore; if you do remember the TV series, the movie makes you angry.<br/><br/>The ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise works as well as it does because, while it uses new names, it gets its ideas for the original show. The music is the same; the way the head of the IMF team gets his info is the same; he works with a team; everything is synchronized, with each team member playing an important part. It's fast, escapist, and the plots are totally outrageous.<br/><br/>In MI III, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) comes out of retirement to go after one of his trainees (Keri Russell) who has been on the trail of an arms dealer, Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffmann). Though he and his team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q) manage to save her, she dies. After the funeral, Ethan receives mail from her with a microdot and finds out that one of the IMF bosses, Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) is actually a mole. Ethan and his team decide to go after Davian themselves, get what he's selling, and find out to whom he's selling it.<br/><br/>This is an extremely exciting film that goes at breakneck speed. The movie actually starts at a crucial moment in the film, and then takes the audience back to how that point was reached. There are several twists on hand as well.<br/><br/>All of the acting is good. I've never been a particular fan of Tom Cruise, but like a lot of stars, he has a physicality that makes him effective. He does very well in this type of genre. Keri Russell has a small but very good role, and she does well. The excellent Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't haven't nearly enough to do - in the last two years, he's come quite a distance. Ving Rhames is great as is Philip Seymour Hoffmann, but isn't he always.<br/><br/>Very thrilling."

","Brian DePalma, Robert Towne, John Woo. My personal opinion on DePalma aside, if three critically respected names like those delivered two films that were respectively mediocre and terrible, what hope was there for a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie directed and written by ""Alias"" alumni? Not much, really. I had liked J.J. Abrams' work on the ""Lost"" pilot as director, but there was nothing there that convinced me that he could pull off a big-budget action film.<br/><br/>Shockingly, ""Mission: Impossible III"" doesn't feel like an extended ""Alias"" episode. Not at all. It feels like a damn good, straightforward action spectacle. Certainly fans of the TV show still haven't gotten a faithful adaptation, but this film is closer in spirit to the show than the other two films in the series. Abrams' kinetic style works perfectly for the film, and the action scenes are spectacular, hugely entertaining, and quite well-shot and edited. It's nice to actually see what's going on in an action movie these days.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with John Woo and ""Mission: Impossible II"". Woo is certainly a better director than Abrams, but I had much more fun with this film than with the previous two. The action scenes are just pulled off better. There are some iffy moments with Abrams' work, certainly, but for a feature debut this is very impressive. There was clarity in the storytelling, the action scenes were great (aside from the decidedly average helicopter chase early on), and the film just looks good throughout.<br/><br/>I'm still undecided on whether I dislike Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci yet. As screenwriters they certainly did their job here. A hackjob by a good screenwriter is a thousand times worse than a passionate script by average writers, and this is the ultimate proof of that. The love story angle doesn't quite work, but the story is fun enough and provides plenty of excuses for action. Anyway, who cares? You've got explosions, Tom Cruise in the sort of role he was born to play, and Michael Giacchino's score, which I suppose doesn't contain all that much original music, but is still very fun. That's more than enough.<br/><br/>I actually timed the scenes that weren't action-oriented, and they barely make up twenty, twenty-five minutes of the movie. The rest is pure, unadulterated action spectacle, and well-done action at that. There can be more done with a Mission: Impossible film, but for this third film in the series it was the right way to go.<br/><br/>8/10"

"TimBoHannon","8","0","1","2 July 2008"," It is Great, but Takes a Couple of Missteps
","The first attempt hurts itself with a poorly explained plot and not enough action. The second spectacularly fails for two reasons: horribly conceived action mostly shown in slow motion, and a plot with more holes than the car Morpheus and Trinity drive during the highway chase from ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The third ""Mission: Impossible"" movie finally nails the target. The plot is more reasonable, far better developed, and more clearly explained. The action is better and more intense; it is back to a level that easily allows suspension of disbelief. The supporting roles are better written and acted, and for the first time, the villain works. This movie is by far the strongest of the trio, but could have been even better without its two mistakes.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams, one of Hollywood's hottest minds after creating ""Felicity,"" ""Alias,"" and ""Lost,"" is the new director. Abrams also wrote the script with ""Alias"" collaborators Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Their effort yields the right mixture of action, character drama, and story. The gadgets are great. They are more realistic than those in the James Bond films; every one of them reasonably could exist, and many probably do. The most commonplace is the pitching machine, used as a surprise to both the audience and the characters in one the movie's most delightful parts.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) no longer participates in active missions. He now earns his living training their most gifted entrants; his finest being Lindsey Farris (the lovely Keri Russell, of ""Felicity"" fame). Now engaged to Julia (Michelle Monaghan), he is enjoying his semi-retirement. Unfortunately, Farris is captured observing Black Market arms broker Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and Hunt must make the agonizing decision to help bring her home.<br/><br/>During the rescue, Hunt and his teammates Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (John Rhys-Meyers), and Zhen (the lovely Maggie Q) discover that Davian is attempting to acquire The Rabbit's Foot. Nobody at IMF knows that is, but Davian's involvement frightens both Hunt and IMF computer expert Benji (Simon Pegg). Ethan also must deal with Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne), the chief executive of IMF, who is more reluctant to take action.<br/><br/>After two bland villains, Philip Seymour Hoffman blows the roof off the dome and into the ozone layer with his performance. Davian is the complete package. When a bystander spills wine on his dress shirt, he does not become angry. In other contexts, however, he is a focused and lethal. Imposing even while bound to a chair, he promises that he will find Ethan's girl and torture her. Although the character tends to remain calm, Hoffman projects a quiet menace that can break to the surface when provoked. Indeed, it is Hoffman's ability that makes his captivity scene, plus all of his others, work so well.<br/><br/>Probably all that needs to be said about the action is Vic Armstrong. The legendary Armstrong is probably the best action choreographer in history. All of the fights, whether involving guns or flying body parts, are created with masterful skill and conceptualization. One of the best is a helicopter chase through a wind farm. Hunt and his team must race to save one of their own while trying to escape their pursuers at the same time. The climax is even better and employs the same device in more serious circumstances. Abrams accomplishes much with the way he captures it all, although a less shaky camera would be appreciated.<br/><br/>Also at his best is Cruise. Hunt's engagement provides a more human subtext, and I have never seen Tom better. He captures the emotions and pressures of Hunt and redirects them with surprising accuracy. Tears stream down his face for Julia. I have acting experience, and true crying is much more difficult than most people realize. Cruise truly instills life into Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>The first error is the opener. It is a harrowing two-and-a-half minutes, but the scene is incomplete. 80% of the movie passes before we see its conclusion. I first remembered the preceding action being far shorter because when I first saw it, I kept thinking what everybody else likely was, ""When will we *finally* get back to where we started?"" The beginning is strong enough without the cliffhanger, and its inclusion backfires later on.<br/><br/>The second deals with the Rabbit's Foot. Benji (Pegg) hypothesizes that it could be an ""anti-god."" Davian's buyers will pay 850 million dollars for it. All of the threats, deception and violence occur because so many people are scrambling to obtain it. When the conflicts are finally resolved, Hunt asks what we are all wondering, ""What is it?"" The answer is never given. A writer should never deprive the audience of that which they have conditioned them to desire.<br/><br/>These are not small mistakes, but they do not comprise a large part of the movie. The rest of the movie, from the action, to the acting, to the hero and villain, is all beyond recommendable. I rate this movie an eight of ten, but it could have been a nine or even considered for a maximum score. So much is expertly done. Its failings are like to pimples on a beauty queen's face. Although they are ugly, it is still a dang attractive face."

","Let me begin by first saying that I am a HUGE Tom Cruise fan. I think he is a brilliant actor with terrific on-screen charisma and presence. But trust me when I say this, I am not biased when it comes to his movies. If anything, because he's my favourite actor I judge his movies with a fine toothcomb more than any other actor. Hence the reason that I never enjoyed Collateral and Vanilla Sky, I found them both slightly disjointed. But we'll leave that discussion for another day.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 3 begins very unexpectedly, with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) tied up and being interrogated by the maniacal Owen Davian (Hoffman). This 3 minute scene ends quite shockingly, and you soon get the feeling that more than any of the previous installments, Hunt has much more to lose this time around. We flashback to a party and we discover that Hunt has retired and now he trains new agents. But when one of his trainees goes missing in Germany, he feels incumbent to lead a rescue mission.<br/><br/>Now this is probably where you'll be thinking 'business as usual', but surprisingly the thrills just never seem to stop as Hunt and his team go from Germany to America to Shanghai. There's even a trip to the Vatican in Rome, a set piece that is actually more faithful to the Mission Impossible series from the 70's than any of the previous movies even got close to. As one expects from a big Hollywood blockbuster, the action scenes are brilliantly orchestrated, one memorable scene in particular being the 'attack on the Chesapeake Bridge'. You'll know it when you see it. Surprisingly, there's quite a bit of suspense, not something one usually gets in an action movie of this nature. Quite fair to say this was actually an action movie with intelligence, no silly one-liners or dumb, annoying characters here, thank you very much.<br/><br/>The acting performances were also quite good. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, fresh from his Oscar victory for Capote, showing more menace than either of Hunt's previous adversaries. And Tom Cruise? Well, like I said, the man is amazingly earnest in any role, and here again he doesn't disappoint. In his tender scenes with his fiancée Julia (Monghan), you can see the pain on his face as he keeps his secret identity from her. And when he needs to be running, or jumping, or diving, he still manages to evoke your sympathy through sheer tenacity in his performance.<br/><br/>All in all, I would have to say this was my favourite movie of 2006.

While the movie resolves around Ethan Hunt's new marriage and balancing that with his job, they dedicate so little time to developing Ethan and Julia's relationship it's hard to care what happens to either of them.<br/><br/>No MI movie would be complete without a twist, and the twist in this one was revealed somewhat awkwardly and fell flat once again because we didn't know or care about any of the characters. If you're going to add ""human"" elements to your action movie you have to spend time addressing the characters. However there's a part when Ethan is stealing something called the ""rabbit's foot"" and instead of showing you how he gets it, the movie shows his team just waiting for him.

","Mission Impossible 3 has become one of my favorite action movies. It is non stop action, there is practically nothing but action. <br/><br/>I liked the first Mission Impossible, i wasn't much for the second Mission Impossible movie, it was okay, but it was a little flat and there wasn't as much excitement or action as expected, some of it was a little boring i guess. <br/><br/>I think that that Mission Impossible 3 is better than the second one, even though the second one was okay. I think that Mission Impossible 3 is kind of like an old fashioned action movie, like an old school action movie. The way action movies were back in the 90's and 80's i think. <br/><br/>A ruthless bad guy, played by Phillip Hoffman. He is a really good bad guy in the movie, he is very ruthless, he is scum, you wish he would die a horrible death. And he is a very mysterious bad guy too, he has very few scenes. And he is great in all of them. And he also has very few lines, he doesn't talk much, when he does he is threatening someone or trying to kill someone, such as the beginning scene in the movie, which is a very intense scene. And he has a good fight with Tom Cruise at the end of the movie, and it was satisfying when he got killed. There is a real good guy and bad guy element in the movie, which was cool, just like the good old days. I think Phillip Hoffman is one of the best bad guys ever, he is one of those bad guys that you start to think, ""What goes on inside his head?"" I think he was one of the best bad guys ever. <br/><br/>This movie has very little plot, which is good, no messing around. The action scenes are kind of long and exciting and very intense. The beginning action scene, the bridge scene, the skyscraper jump scene, the car chase, and the fight at the end were great action scenes. It is a little violent for a PG-13 and very menacing and intense. The bridge action sequence has a very good ""the bad guy is getting away."" feel. I like how high tech and old fashioned the action is. And it has some good special effects, explosions, and shootouts, and stunts, the helicopter chase in the movie is very cool. And the movie is loud. And the good thing is, it doesn't have any techno electronic music in the movie, which is good. And it doesn't have any rock and roll music during the action scenes. The music in the movie made the movie very intense and exciting. <br/><br/>And i like how Tom Cruise's wife/girlfriend gets kidnapped by the bad guy, and he threatens to kill her if Cruise doesn't retrieve the ""Rabbits Foot"". And i like the scene where Hoffman is threatening to kill his wife, very ruthless character. And it has one of the best opening scenes ever. This movie really made me want to root for Ethan Hunt, and hoping to get his wife back and take down the bad guy. <br/><br/>I was quite surprised when i first saw the movie, since i dident care much for the second one. <br/><br/>But there are some weakeness's i guess. The first half of the movie was good of course, with some good action scenes and stuff. But its basically after the Vatican scene is when the movie really starts to heat up. A few scenes before the bridge scene aren't all that great i guess. <br/><br/>This movie is exciting, action packed, and old fashioned, and a great bad guy. Everyone should enjoy it."

","Tom Cruise is at the top of his game in the superb third installment of the Mission: Impossible series. While I admittedly haven't seen the other two in quite some time, this third film wasn't confusing at all in terms of the plot. Being an action film, the movie does exactly what it's supposed to; entertain, thrill, and... well... be awesome! The gadgets and ideas were really neat, and Tom Cruise did a great acting job, along with the supporting cast. I loved the plot, and the movie never felt drawn out or overlong despite its length. It's one of the best of the new action films like Live Free or Die Hard and the Bourne films. Overall, this Mission may just be the best in the series."

","With a shocking and dramatic opening, this film grabs hold of you within 10 seconds and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams (the man who has written over 70 episodes of the hugely popular TV series LOST) is integral to the creation of this film, both directing and writing, and it shows. The film is extremely high-paced and unpredictable from the very beginning and its 120min running time is not at all overcooked. The many fans of LOST will love this film and those who simply enjoy high-paced explosive action will find it equally brilliant. That is not to say it is simply constant action with no intelligent plot (die hard 4 anyone?), the plot is intriguing and the script is tight throughout. The two lead roles are also performed superbly by both Cruise and the unexpected but brilliant casting of Hoffman, who's character is unpredictable with a dangerous edge.<br/><br/>Whilst the shocking beginning hooks viewers and the high-paced and unpredictable nature of every action scene provides a real thrill-ride, the film also has a real dramatic edge - 10/10<br/><br/>(i would suggest that those who dislike the film due to a love for the original TV series or the franchise just view this as a separate movie!)"

It is a great action movie that I had never seen. this movie is directed by J.J.Abrams who directed lost, too.I think he is a genius that he always had great, interested, and new ideas. Tom Cruise is a genius in acting. He can do almost everything in the movie. the other characters are also fun, too. they show high skills and good acting. i think thats why i really like it. i think up of these, it can take 9.

","The film actually resembles the original series (for once), in the opening Vatican City sequence. Quick switches, impersonations, gizmos and gadgets, and operating by stealth. Not detailed at the depth level of the show, but adequate.<br/><br/>But instead of ending the flick as the IMF team escapes triumphantly in a speedboat, there's a lecture about how Ethan the Jedi should not marry or he'll turn to the dark side. We get Ethan Hawk or Hick or Hack or whatever his name yelling at the bad guy while one of his stooge sidekicks dimwittedly says, ""Ethan, who recently married Katie Holmes and lives at 1234 Hubbard St., in Hollywood, CA, don't yell at that guy! Be good!"" This complete mockery of how the IMF conducted its covert operations sets up a oft-used ""personal vendetta"" war between the principals. Not only that old ploy, but the deader-than-dead ""traitorous mole in the group"" device (which was already done in the first MI movie), and you have the remaining 75% of this movie.<br/><br/>Then, the baddie, played by the strongest actor in the cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman, gets away in a silly rescue scene. I was in stitches when the concussion of a blast pushes Tom sideways. It reminded me of a 3 Stooges episode where Larry is hit by a beer keg and is thrown sideways in the same absurd manner. Hoffman is intimidating and threatening, but the script and direction undermine his work. Tom seems to always be running somewhere. See Tom run! Run, Tom! Run! As far as the romance, it was just tossed in at random with little explanation, and even less chemistry. The film also shamelessly cranks out the oldest suspense/action flick cliché in the final scene. <br/><br/>Other than the opening twenty minutes, the only value you'll find in this movie is the cacophony of CGI explosions. Watchable as popcorn fare only."

","Former spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into action to recover a missing IMF Agent. But complications arise when his fiancée is captured and he must fight to get her back.<br/><br/>First off, I wanted something fun to turn my brain off to this weekend. I thought an action movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman would be fun to watch. I was half-right. Hoffman is a treat. This film is not.<br/><br/>Tom tom tom. What kind of talentless egotrip is this film? Yes, we get to watch you run around like a gazelle hopped up on amphetamines (I just know that the footage was sped up). Yes, you shoot things and blow things up. But I thought you would've learned from what made for passable viewing in War of the Worlds. We need to see that your character is HUMAN. There's no suspense when a man can rail shoot three guys like it's no problem, run four miles without breaking much of a sweat, and all the other $hit in this film, unless I actually care about the characters. Tom-bot is bloody indestructible. They try, oh do they try to give Tom a human side, but there isn't any emotional depth to be found, and you'll find yourself thinking about other things when he hangs out with his wife and thinks about a now-dead former student.<br/><br/>Didn't care about Tom. Didn't care about Rhames, who really just nags and whines about relationships. Yuck. It's nigh insufferable. Rhys-Meyers is here as the other closeted gay actor, and he too, runs around a lot. Fishburne looks like a fat sack of crap. Post-Matrix depression? Maggie Q blows up a beautiful car. What is with the destruction of beautiful machines in action films these days? Do they think that middle to lower class audiences like to see things they'll never own get destroyed? Simon Pegg is in this for too little time. He's a joy and the screen lights up with his presence.<br/><br/>No one is taking this seriously except Hoffman. And while that's not entirely a bad thing, No one is taking this seriously enough to have fun. Hoffman has fun, as did I watching him (The opening scene of the film is by far the best one) but nearly everyone is just going (running, it would seem) through the paces. Stunts that should be amazing seem ho-hum, business as usual. People finish each others clichéd lines.<br/><br/>Now, a film has to be supremely awful for me to walk out (I'm not one of those patience-less shmucks that always walk out) but I'm not sure whether I could've stood this movie had it not been for the pause button. Aside from Hoffman, it's entirely forgettable. D+"

","Mission Impossible 3 has to be my favorite out of the series so far. It had all the action, suspense, and semi-predictable plot twist of the first movie. It also had the romance and happy ending of the second movie, but without it being over-the-top and uninteresting. I usually find the whole Tom Cruise goes to ""save the world"" and ""save the girl"" story lines boring and cliché, but Michelle Monaghan's acting saves the movie from turning me off. Julia shows that she is not the stereotypical weak female in some of her final scenes where she kills two ""bad guys"" and saves Ethan's life.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't rate this movie higher is because of Philip Seymour Hoffman. I find him extremely annoying and dry; his acting lacks the character needed to portray a villain. However, the damage he does to the movie is not substantial. This movie is definitely worth seeing and worth buying."

","I admit to not having seen the previous two film in the series, so I wasn't really sure of what I was about to see. I was in for a surprise, as M:I:3 turned out to be the best action film of the year so far. Splashed with unforgettable action scenes and tension, it has definitely earned itself a position in my Top Ten of the year.<br/><br/>The plot starts with pulse-pounding scene in which Owen Davian is threatening Ethan Hunt's wife. The film then takes us back to show us what led up to that event. It is really all about something called the ""Rabbit's Foot"" which Owen wants at all costs. The plot is simple, but it develops throughout leaving you to try and guess who is in league with Owen.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is Agent Ethan Hunt for the third time, and I must confess that I have a grand admiration for him, even though he has never yet won a golden statuette. Also in the film are couple of characters, which aren't that developed, mainly Ethan Hunt's associates and Philip Seymour Hoffman (fresh from his Oscar winning interpretation of Truman Capote) as the criminal mastermind Owen Davian. The latter was an inappropriate casting for the role mainly due to his. well. physical attributes. Yes, he is way too fat to be a proper rival in hand-to-hand combat with Tom Cruise. Ethan's team-mates are different, but they lack much depth which could have been present. Michelle Monaghan's portrayal of Julia was slightly mediocre, but it didn't really matter. As I have just mentioned, it is Tom Cruise's film and he has proved to still be a gifted actor. After being overshadowed by young Dakota Fanning's terrific (screaming) performance, he has finally been given the opportunity to excel.<br/><br/>However, the core of the film is its breathtaking action sequences. Starting off with a loud and original helicopter chase in a wind farm after the escape from the factory, the film immediately finds its pace and from then on, we are given an action sequence almost every ten minutes. Arguably, the mission isn't impossible until the third act, but it is still an interesting action spectacle. Another scene which piqued my interest was the scene in the Vatican City. What I liked about it was that it was a one of those sophisticated pre-planned sequences, present in ""Ocean's Eleven/Twelve"". Therefore, you may be slightly disappointed to find that the action becomes rather clumsy in the final scenes.<br/><br/>A problem I found whilst viewing it at the cinema, was that I lost track of what was happening and there was a lot of confusion towards the end when the tables are turned. It is a minor flaw, though, so it shouldn't be an excuse not to see the film. Another slight problem was that the relationship between Ethan Hunt and Julia was rather vague and we didn't get to see the turmoil in their relationship, when Julia becomes suspicious. This was a mistake done to increase the number of explosive action scenes in the film. However, the action is top notch, so once again, this isn't a major problem.<br/><br/>Another thing, which I approved of, was that there is a different scenario for every scene, and this elevated the viewer's interest in virtually every scene  from the dazzling night lights of Eastern Asia, to the class and beauty of the Vatican. It literally takes you from one place to another and intensifies the action places, by setting the scene in places you are unlikely to visit, such as the Vatican underground.<br/><br/>Verdict All I can say is that this one great movie which shall leave its imprint on you. Not to be missed!"
"ozthegreatat42330","9","0","1","24 March 2007"," Excellent as always.
","Newcomer J/J/ Abrams succeeds magnificently with this third MI episode. A lot of the credit for that goes to Tom Cruise. I see a lot of people badmouthing Cruise these days and think it is just absurd. He is an excellent actor with a very unbeatable track record, and more than that is the kind of actors that directors love. And it comes across in this film once again. I did think that Laurence Fishburn was not given enough screen time in this film, but the production itself was taut and the action satisfies. Sunone derisively called it Tom Cruise Superman, but when you know that he performed ninety percent of his own stunts, where another actor would have wimped out and had stunt doubles, and some of those stunts had to be painful, such as his slamming into the car during the explosion on the bridge, I feel he has earned the respect for his work. <br/><br/>The British certainly think so. He has earned the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film for his many and varied films over the past thirty some odd years. And MI III again demonstrates why he should be so honored. I rate this film a nine out of ten."

Better than #2, it does have a decent story, but the writing is so bad and the directing makes the film confusing at times. I though Ving Rhymes was a computer expert?

As my friend put it, I thought quite well, ""It was like BOOM BANG BOOM BOOM CRASH!!!!!""<br/><br/>This is a film that, if in the mood, could be very enjoyable. And, truthfully, it does have some very intense moments that anyone will get drawn into. Cruise, if you are able to put aside all the stupid crap he's pulled outside of films in the last year, fits into his role fine, though he does border on being obnoxious, especially when he's trying to be romantic. Phillip Seymour Hoff man does well and is satisfyingly creepy. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ving Rhames, turning in fine work as always.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission Impossible 3 is not a failure (as the box office clearly shows), but just not the best. It's not a bad movie, it just lacks any kind of depth- but what more can you expect from a THIRD Mission Impossible movie? <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","The thing about Mi3 is that it's a lot of fun and it's easy to watch. The explosions and fights are all in context and the action seems to flow. The problems lie in what are relatively unique flaws. Firstly though, i was happy that this one involved a bit more team work. Not a lot. But some. It was very clear that Ethan Hunt was not a lone ranger this time through and that is more in line with the mission impossible spirit. Still, this series--right from the start--has gone out of its way to defeat the purpose of the series. Basically, the mission impossibles have become James Bond with absolutely no differences whereas the original series was built on a team of people with their own unique skills. As for this movie as an ""artform"" -- for lack of a better word -- it was lacking. Somehow they managed to write a script with several side plots while forgetting to have an actual plot. This works well in that the action can be ongoing. Since there is never an actual plot to develop there is nothing slowing the fight scenes down. Unfortunately this leaves the viewer with nothing to look back on. As soon as the movie was over I reflected on it and there was nothing to think about. Like a good roller coaster ride, I know I had fun, but there is just no substance to take with me when I go on my way. It's a shame because with all the money and history behind this franchise, it has the potential to be so much more."

It just gets tedious, but that is what MI III is all about: action; and I really shouldn't complain. I did have a choice.<br/><br/>However, everything is good, the acting, the dialogue, the stunts, the cinematography, and, of course, there is a twist and you are left to figure out who the mole is. There is just simply too much action, and yes, it works but let's hope this is the last of the MI movies. Enough already. What might have helped more is an injection of some humor. Guess the Bond movies spoiled us.<br/><br/>Now, I couldn't help noticing that some very bad camera angles had Tom Cruise looking like either Tim Daly or Mark Wahlberg. Remember, I did say I went to La La Land at times. I had to look really hard at times to make sure it was Tom Cruise and still wasn't sure. Hoffman loses the Capote voice and is quite good as a bad guy and may take some roles destined, perhaps, for Gary Busey or Willem Defoe.

","This movie definitely should be considered a classic. There hasn't been a memorable secret agent themed action thriller in years, but hopefully this film will inspire future spy flicks to be as great.<br/><br/>It's always the same nowadays, secret agent meets girl, trashes lair, and kills bad guy. Don't get me wrong, clichés are what keep the film industry alive, but in order to make them memorable you have to add an interesting twist. M:I:3 does just that. The story follows Ethan Hunt, currently out of danger as an IMF training instructor. But when a madman kidnaps a close friend of Ethan's, he volunteers to rescue her. His personal connection with te damsel in distress traps him in a personal feud with Owen Davien, the film's villain. But when Ethan gets to close to Davien, Davien targets his one weakness: Ethan's girlfriend. Ethan Hunt is no longer portrayed as a green recruit or an invincible Bondian figure, but as a regular guy torn between to lives: Your everyday, average, male, and a super secret agent.<br/><br/>The story isn't about saving the world, it seems a bit like 24 to me, especially the climactic showdown and Hunt's ultra motivated and sometimes ruthless personality. THe film also has many great action scenes and stunts, Swinging from buildings, automated fighter planes attacking a bridge, and lots of shootouts. <br/><br/>Davien(played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is a living dictionary definition of the word evil, and Hoffman's performance as a deranged arms dealer is excellent. He's a believable bad guy who seems disturbingly real. Ving Rhames, Jonathan Reece Meyers and Maggie Q provide excellent supporting rolls, as does Michelle Mohnagan. I recommend this for anyone looking for a new type of spy-themed action thriller with a good storyline."

This is just like all the rest of the standard sequels; the first great, the second not so great, the third horrible. If you have a couple of hours to kill, that you'd never want back, then have at it.<br/><br/>My final opinion: wouldn't even pay the $3.00 to rent this dog. Unless someone you know has bought/rented it, wait for it to come out on one of the movie channels."

","I quite enjoyed the story and action in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as the villain - so cool yet nasty.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, fast paced story - there's not much I can fault it on. The only thing that really ruins it for me is Tom Cruise. Every time I see him I can't get the image of him couch jumping and acting a fool on Oprah. I just don't buy his acting like a serious person. Kind of like seeing Weird Al Yankovic in a romantic drama.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I rated this so poorly is because of the ridiculous ways Ethan gets himself out of ridiculous situations. What should I have expected from a film of this title I guess... It got to a point where I just thought that it was too much. No one person could always have luck on their side.<br/><br/>One point for the beautiful cast and one point for Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting.

","I am a mom who saw this movie on Mother's Day. It left me breathless at many moments in the movie. I loved the action, actors and everything in between. Great movie!!! Could watch it over and over! It is better than the first two and that is so hard to do in trilogy! I gasped several times during the movie. I won't give you spoilers or even hints. Just keep in mind that it's Hollywood and have fun with this movie. I will say this, even if you hate Tom Cruise and his new ""life"", his acting is still fantastic! Go see it for Ving Rhimes or Phillip Hoffman. Both are excellent in the film! GREAT cast!

","Tom Cruise, what a fella' huh? In between couch jumping and promoting the Holiness of Scientology, he managed to star in a movie. Not a very good one mind you, but still a movie. I guess that's what M:i:iii's main problem is. The movie isn't so much a film (aka, a plot driven story recorded on film) as much as it is a vehicle for mister Cruise to show off his cute but in tight black pants, and blow stuff up. Maybe that's not a bad thing if you're, lets say, 10, but for a person who actually gets more out of film than a stiffy from flames and swearing, it comes off as a little disappointing. That's not to say the film has no plot though, it does! Really, it does! You see, our boy Ethan Hunt has retired from the whole ""spy"" game and has decided to get married and live out his life without the threat of castration from Russian KGB agents. Although, the temptation proves to be too much when a comrade goes missing. So Ethan puts on his sexy french body suit and goes on one last mission. An ""Impossible mission"" if you will. This leads him to run into one Owen Davian (Phillip Semour Hoffman, or a wax sculpture of him, I got confused.). Bad things happen, and soon Ethan's wife is kidnapped (GASP!). This leads to several scenes featuring Cruise and his ""crew"" of super spies (They look like Radio Shack employees...) looking for clues on double agents in Hunt's division and eventually, Ethan's wife. Sounds like a USA original movie. Not to say the movie is ALL bad. The action is actually REALLY good. For example, in one scene Cruise slides down a glass roof while shooting guards. Its unfortunate that the film isn't simply a balls-to-the-wall action romp, because that might of worked. The injecting of ""plot"" into the film really does kill it. Its a shame that usually on the mark actors like Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg and PSH couldn't even save this film. For die hard Cruise nuts only.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing, Ving Rhames? Be a dear, don't try to do comedy again, EVER."

","Whatever this was, it was not ""Mission: Impossible"". It felt more like ""Alias: The Movie"". It's clear that no one involved has ever seen or understood the concept of the grand old 60s spy series. The original dealt with intelligent people conning intelligent bad people into a corner which they couldn't escape. The keyword is ""intelligent"". The heroes were normal people, each with a distinct specialty, and they planned everything carefully. And no matter what happened or what we, the audience, thought had happened, the heroes (and the writers) were always ahead and in control.<br/><br/>In this movie, physical superheroes stumble from one impossible situation to the next, and survive by sheer luck, like rolling in front of a taxi (or was it a bus) while fighting the bad guy, conveniently killing him.<br/><br/>The direction was quite awful. What, please, was the purpose of the pre-credit sequence? The movie would have worked better without it. Way better. Things like this work in a TV show, where there's no time, but not in a two-hour movie. The camera was used in the nowadays so prevalent, but still awful, shaky-cam-close-up style. Which reduced it pretty much in a mediocre mess. What's the point of setting a story all over the world and making the movie look like it was filmed on a back lot? Considering the talent available to Abrams (Vic Armstrong as stunt coordinator? The Vic Armstrong?), nothing ended up being shown. Gone seem the times when directors appreciated the talent of stunt people, location scouts and casting director. Speaking of casting, this movie was one of the most sexist I've seen. All kinds of male body shapes, but ALL the females were of the extreme skinny model type. Frankly, I want to see shapely women. To me, no hotness here. (There was scene, when the 'hot' heroine pulled out something strapped to her thigh. Classical gratuitous sexy scene, right? Not with this stick figure. Shudder.) <br/><br/>I have a very bad feeling for ""Star Trek XI""."

"Gutza","9","0","1","22 September 2006"," Excellent! (for an action movie)
","I get DVDs and give the ones worth seeing to my father. That's exactly what I wrote on the Post-It attached to this one: ""Excellent! (for an action movie)"". This is what action movies should be all about. This is what James Bond movies used to be all about. Well, to be perfectly honest, I'd rather have a really good James Bond over a really good Mission Impossible, but since they don't even do reasonably good James Bond movies any more, I'm happy to embrace the MI franchise instead.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with action. But it's reasonably believable. It's packed with suspense. But not in an obviously artificial, silly way as recent action movies tend to. Technical terms are relatively frequent. But the explanations are either reasonable or not needed, as opposed to the confusing mumbo-jumbo we had to get used to lately.<br/><br/>But the most prominent feature which actually makes this James Bond-like is the touristic quality of the movie. James Bond movies were arguably the first mainstream, widely recognizable movies which featured several exotic locations per movie for the single purpose of enhancing the movie viewers' experience. Of course, the ""real"" James Bond movies added an extra touch of refinement which the MI series doesn't even attempt to touch. But the reality is that the ""real"" James Bond movies are really, really tacky by today's standards, in an Austin Powers sort of way. Really.<br/><br/>So, unless the James Bond franchise owners make a serious effort to update Bond's character while also keeping his British charm (which they obviously haven't over the last decade), we'll have to settle with the MI series as ""the thing"". And, to be honest, that would only be marginally disappointing in the greater scheme of things, if they keep their standards at the level of MI:3.<br/><br/>9/10 only because I still hope for James Bond to be resurrected--10/10 otherwise.<br/><br/>(I rate movies per genre; one can't compare this to The Godfather, or The Lord of the Rings, or The Matrix, or Schindler's List in any reasonable fashion, in my opinion.)"

","This movie is an OK watch and did not deserve the lampoon it got but still it does not live up to the two past films in the series which are much better. What makes the first Mission Impossible better is it's stellar direction by Brian De Palma, and the fact that it almost has to be watched twice or more to uncover all it's meanings. It's not for stupid people as most action flicks are. The second one is better than this one because it has some of the best action ever showcased on film and it is in fact the best of the series. Now there are certain things that do hold up this third entry as well. It has a good pace, hot chicks, Ving Rhames, and some cool deaths. As for the plot, it is no good. Commercials make more sense than this film. It did not gel well and you can tell it was made on the fly by a over rated director (who has not really done anything I care about.), and an actor who felt he was so competent that he could simply walk through the role. All the supporting cast is fine and real, but Cruise just phones it in. While I feel that this film is overly criticized, I do think it has some merit, but no story of value. Good for a night of films without logic."

","First of all I have to say: Abrams is one of my favorite producers, but his writing isn't always that good. Alias stays strong along the way, Felicity and Lost both grow worse the further it goes. Not that they become bad, although I'm starting to get pretty annoyed concerning Lost. But one thing you hear pretty often: Abrams and movies do not go together, many people believed/hoped there would be chance with this movie. I can't really agree, not that the writing was bad. But I just think it's a shame he gets involved in a production like this one. Mission impossible never was one of my favorite movies, not by far. But after hearing that Abrams was gonna make it, I was very curious. MI III follows tom cruise again, but this time family life is involved and so on, it's too unbelievable, there's just too many things in the movie that are wrong. I'm not gonna give any spoilers, but I would advise you not to watch, the acting isn't that good. The action is pretty good, nothing out of the blue, as expected. Watch it if you're a fan of either Tom Cruise, Abrams or the MI-merchandise. Just another action flick, as unbelievable as all the others, but at least you can see it's written by Abrams."

","Mission: Impossible III covers the story of agent Ethan Hunt who has retired from IMF, in favour of settling down with his fiancée Julia. Hunt is recruited for another IMF operation, by Director Musgrave. Hunt initially refuses, but when he realises that his protégée, Lindsay Farris, has been kidnapped by Owen Davian, a black market arms dealer, Hunt gets himself wrapped up into a flurry of trouble.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III begins in medias res, with Ethan and Julia, both tied up, and Davian who is threatening to kill Julia, if Ethan does not tell him where the 'rabbit's foot' is located. This torture scene definitely sets up the story to follow, and is in fact, one of the most intense scenes I have encountered in my cinema viewing. When the same scene is played again later in the movie, the abundant emotions you feel for Hunt and against Davian, absolutely overwhelm you.<br/><br/>It's this sort of intensity when begins to fade during the movie, though not entirely. The action sequences are well filmed, but never become truly spectacular to the point where they are awe-inspiring. Strangely for a film of this kind, its the emotional impact which keeps the films alive. Acting is not Oscar-worthy, but Tom Cruise plays his part as Hunt, with a defined sense of cool: in the action sequences, one can see the determination which fills him. Yet, its Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the villain Owen Davian, who really steals the show. His coldness and sense of rationality, brings to life a villain who truly is malicious in his deeds.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is riveting, and no one can forget the adrenaline pumping, Mission: Impossible theme. Sadly, a couple lame one-liners are apparent in the film, and really do feel out of place. Also, the ending is too quick without continuing the emotional journey of Hunt, yet the non-stop action coupled with the strength of the characters, makes Mission: Impossible III the best in the series.<br/><br/>It's by no means a spectacular film, but Mission: Impossible III only goes to show, that no film is impossible to pull off, when all the right ingredients, fall into place."

Only point taken is for the shaky camera (sometimes a bit annoying) and the fact that we never get to see Ethan actually getting the rabbit's foot nor what it is anyway. But other than that, it's a fun action film and good enough to enjoy while chewing down the popcorn. Don't expect a documentary on true spy life.

","An amazing action film that never lets up and almost never slows down. Though there are a few domestic scenes of Ethan's homelife, they feel completely out of place, and are easily overshadowed by the non-stop action. The frenetic pace leaves little room for the audience to breath, but this is what a summer blockbuster is all about. The story is basically a mix of the first two films, with gaping plot holes and great leaps of logic, but it is of secondary concern. A movie like this is so much fun and so entertaining that I took little notice of the flaws in the plot - it's just a means to string the action set pieces together. Not that there's anything wrong with that...<br/><br/>What made this much better than the terrible second one was the return of the IMF team. Instead of Ethan doing mostly everything himself, he's got a team backing him up, harking back to the best parts of the original. Indeed, the best scene in this movie is the Vatican kidnapping. Very well staged and shot, never slowing down but never getting out of control. A close second for best scene would have to be the bridge attack - the best pure action set piece in some time. A complete overload on the senses, but it works very well. The final confrontation is somewhat of a letdown compared to the rest of the movie, but it's obvious that they were going for more of an emotional scene than a action-packed one. If the homelife angle had been built up better, it would have worked, but it ends up feeling a bit flat. It's still incredibly thrilling at times, but never overtly powerful or emotional.<br/><br/>While the story is completely implausible and full of so many holes that I could easily pick it apart here, I won't - as I said, that's not the centerpiece of the movie. For this type of movie, the story worked well, and wasn't too complicated or silly. The acting was decent, with Hoffman doing his best in a one-note villain role, despite not nearly enough screen time. Abrams' directing is great during the action scenes, but nothing special the rest of the time. As this movie is almost all action, he does a very good job in his debut. The visual effects are solid if not outstanding, while the stunts are insane - they manage to maintain realism somewhat while being incredibly exciting. The classic M:i score is a bit underused but still effective. A very solid production.<br/><br/>I would rank this one far above the terrible second installment, but still below the masterpiece of the first one. While it has by far the best action of the trilogy, the story could've used a lot of work, just to make the film more well-rounded. But it isn't so bad that it ruins the film; just prevents it from being great. As it stands, this is solid summer entertainment."

For example, V for Vendetta left you thinking if terrorism is right or not. And that's great. It's propaganda, really. Why not send a message to kids via their favorite form of entertainment- an action movie? That's all good and all, but Mission Impossible is a die hard action movie (no pun intended). Instead of making you pondering like a woman, this film makes you go ""whoa"". I won't lie, it's straight up kicking ass. What action movies were made for. <br/><br/>The scenery is far from bland. You will travel to Berlin, to Shanghai, to Suburbia, and to the Vatican. The action is phenomenal. From jumping off buildings to dodging missiles to good ol' fashioned shootouts and fistfights, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt does every feat desired in an action flick, but done in new ways and shot in a unique fashion, due to director JJ Abram's contemporary style. <br/><br/>The entire film seems like ""24"" meets the TV show ""Mission Impossible"". The scenes in IMF (Impossible Mission Force) mirror 24's CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit) and some of the combat seems like it was on 24 before; the way the missions are accomplished in this one feel like they are of the old show. The entire squad uses one another to get the job done. In the first and especially the second Mission Impossible, the entire mission seemed to be carried out by Ethan Hunt. The camera tricks Abram uses also feels like the old TV show. <br/><br/>Since I want to be spoiler free, I'll leave out some juicy details. But let me say a few words- the acting is fantastic, although some characters are complicated. Laurence Fishburne and his assistant really shine, and Tom Cruise pulls some tears. From his face, not mine. But nevertheless, a decent job done by the cast. <br/><br/>Then there are some bad issues. It gets pretty unrealistic. The opening scene is out of place (literally), and I don't know why. The opening credit's rendition of the theme song sucked, and the credits were really, really fast. Maybe two seconds per card. For some reason, we let immigrants work at IMF. There's an Australian (or something) working at the HQ, and a Chinese woman as a field agent. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this film an A."

","I have just seen the movie, and I could say now that it is a good one!:)I really liked the way of playing of the actors, and the special kind of ""fear"" that fills the film and that makes it very very very interesting.From the beginning to the end, I was afraid, it's true, but after the final retorts I felt in a strange way: probably, I became stronger...I think it is one of the objectives of the movie - to make us stronger and to make us believe in the ""happy end""...Yes - it's true, people must understand that there aren't impossible missions...But everything depends on us, if we have the power and the beauty of faith (in us and in the persons that we love), the end will be happy..."
"Oliver-50","3","0","1","9 June 2006"," Mission: Impossible 3
","*SPOILERS AHEAD* I don't understand why the world needs to have Mission Impossible 3. For that matter, I didn't understand why we needed Mission Impossible 2. I suppose that since the finale of the first film ended on a leftover gag from the 60's TV series that they felt it was okay to dish out another sub-par spy thriller. But Mission Impossible 2 was nothing like the first film. John Woo replaced Brian DePalma and instead of an intriguing premise with some sweat-inducing sequences we get a stoic Tom Cruise acting cool and casual and risking everything to save a girl he hardly knows. He jumps off moving bikes, he hangs from mountains, he takes on a dozen bad guys at once (all the while doves fly about for no apparent reason). Ehtan Hunt is super human.<br/><br/>So why does Mission Impossible 3 start off with Ethan Hunt battered and bruised struggling and hoping that his wife will not be executed right before his very eyes. Why is he know a married man with a normal life and normal friends. What made him stop doing impossible missions? I suppose it's because he met a woman and fell in love blah blah blah - but what happened to the woman from the first? By this point I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm digging too deep into this. Hear me out; Ethan Hunt is a caricature - not a character. With each of these films he is somebody different - so why should we care about his new adventure if the character isn't consistent? The premise of the film is that Ethan Hunt has been out of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) for some time and has fallen in love and is settling down. He his called back into duty by his a former teammate (Billy Crudup) to rescue an old protégé of his, Lindsay,(Keri Russell) who has been kidnapped by an very nasty arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Lindsay dies immediately after the rescue and Ethan Hunt takes on another mission; to track down the arms dealer and recover a top secret device called 'The Rabbit's Foot' It's futile to make Ethan Hunt a living breathing human being. The movie tries, but we just never get passed that fact that there really is no story or character to care about. It's easy to pull the wool over the audiences eyes and claim that this good guy is now the bad guy or vice versa when we hardly ever see that character. Mission Impossible 3 is a series of plot devices centered around ideas for action sequences.T he film is another attempt to deliver some over-the-top thrills - all of them hopelessly contrived and silly.<br/><br/>When Tom Cruise is running after Philip Seymour Hoffman on the bridge he jumps what looks like a 15 foot gap in a bridge (barely makes it) - even though minutes ago he ran around it...<br/><br/>When swinging from one building to another Tom Cruise has his teammates distract the guards so he can land and slide down the building whilst he shoots the guards...couldn't't his teammates have snipered these men off? When trying to break into the Vatican, Tom Cruise causes a traffic jam to distract the cameras so he can leap up a wall, climb down the other side and dress in costume to meet up with Ving Rhames - who swam underneath and then blows up a wall and enters the Vatican too.<br/><br/>I scoffed at the film every 5 minutes because of the lack of reasoning.<br/><br/>As for the Rabbit's Foot; this is what the movie is about. This is the reason Ethan Hunt's life is in danger; this is the reason his wife is kidnapped; this is the reason he has to fly across the world to retrieve it. Yet, it's never explained to us what exactly 'The Rabbit's Foot' is. It is a cheap, gimmick just to keep us on board. At the end of the film just ask yourself one question. Why? Because if you put the pieces together it's a jumbled mess."
"headfulofghosts126","6","0","1","6 June 2006"," Why is it Impossible to make a great M:I?
","This is a very tricky review for me to write. The reason being that I don't remember the last time I felt so wish-washy about a movie. I believe the biggest problem was reading too much about the film before I saw it. Countless articles and interviews explaining how we finally get to see a fleshed out Ethan Hunt who was an actual human being this time and not just a super spy who looks cool in shades. And all those early reviews were so incredibly positive and eagerly proclaimed this to be the best in the series. Maybe there's no way to live up to that kind of promise. I feel that the film certainly tried. But in the end my gut tells me that it was just incredibly average. Right down the middle. Neither here nor there.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown for me was that I was lead to believe that this was the movie where we finally got to see the teamwork. The other agents were all supposed to be colorful and necessary and make the whole thing radiate with the same vibe the TV show had. But make no mistake, this is still The Tom Cruise Show. His team in this installment is only slightly less cardboard than the team from Part II. Personalities? Character development? Don't count on it. We get Ving Rhames who still has nothing to do as Luther, Maggie Q playing a character whose main purpose seems to be to look hot and has a name I don't even remember, and a totally wasted Jonathan Rhys-Myers as ""the driver"". And that's it. I just gave you all the info the movie gives us about this ""team"".<br/><br/>Ethan himself never completely emerges as a character either. The glimpse into his life away from IMF was nice, but ultimately useless. There aren't enough scenes with him and his wife to completely buy into their relationship. It's the same problem most action movies have. They expect the audience to believe these two are in love because they're telling us that they are. But they rarely show it. You rarely feel it. It's not there to flesh out Ethan. It's a plot device.<br/><br/>But there was also a lot to like about the movie. The scene at the Vatican is the only moment that the film lives up to its full potential. It's the only time in this entire franchise that you really get a taste of what an M:I movie should feel like. I also loved Hoffman as the main villain. His screen time is minimal but he milks every second of it.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with J.J. Abrahams' TV work. I don't watch Lost and I never saw an episode of Alias (gasp!) and I've seen a few complaints that he recycled ideas from both. If he did, I wouldn't know. But I liked his approach to the material. The only scene that reeked of rip-off to me was the bridge sequence which was right out of True Lies. It even looked like the same location. It was too similar to even be considered an homage. It was theft.<br/><br/>This was sort of a hybrid of the first two films. If you put them in a blender you'd get this. It never feels as dense or layered as the first film. And it certainly never feels as light and over the top as the second. It's somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>For my money, the first one is still the best. I know it has some glaring errors but it's still the strongest. This one is definitely better than the second, but not as much as many would have you believe. I would say it's worth a look but do your best to check your expectations at the door. You'll probably have a better time with it that way."
"unknwn_id","6","0","1","5 June 2006"," Good action, bad acting
","At the begin of the movie it looked like this would be a descent cruise action movie, i couldn't be more wrong. Let me just start with the bad camera-work, it was so irritating, in some scenes it was to far zoomed out or to far zoomed in, then if the camera angle was finally correct the camera man felled the need all the way through the movie to shake its camera like a roller-coaster, who hired this amateur?. OK the acting, this has to be one of the worst acting performances in this year, and yes i mean you tom. He just looks silly the entire movie, and when there is a serious scene he just moves his mouth-angle a little and thats it, completely emotionless.. And you know what the best part of it is, he gets away with it, the cinemas will be full anyway and if there will come a Mi4 it will be just the same. Further, the rest of the crew was even worse, ethans wife for example did such a bad performance i'm not even going to waste any time on that. The only one who saved this movie was Mr Hoffman, he played terrific as the bad guy and i felled the director held him from going on full 100 % not to overshadow cruise. The director did such a bad job directing this movie full of plot holes and laughable story lines i don't even know where to start so i'm not going to. I think the reason for the bad acting was that after the actors read the script they knew this movie was going to suck so they just decided not to give any acting at all and put there self on autopilot. There is one positive point about this movie, it had some very nice action in it, and the adrenaline pumps the entire movie. If u want to see good action, explosions, and don't mind the story line, acting and bad camera-work this movie is for u. If not, don't see it.. cause this is just a 120 minute commercial for tom cruise and it wasn't even a good one. <br/><br/>6/10"
"TanjBennett","4","0","1","4 June 2006"," fading into generic star action vehicle
","The heart is gone out of MI. There is just the one moderately smart sequence in the Vatican which has the old MI flavor, and all the rest is just Cruise smiling, Cruise being tough, Cruise and true love, Cruise the action man. Heck they even gut one of the toughest puzzles with a pointless starting stunt and then just cut to the exit. I guess it really was impossible, so just skip it...<br/><br/>Everyone does a good job with what the script handles them. First class cast. It is just the script really doesn't hand anyone but Cruise that much to do. Even the much hyped villain's performance dripping evil - uh, not so much, when you factor in the limitations of the script. Just a generic villain.<br/><br/>Is this the one which rescues the franchise? Nah, Cruise owns the franchise, and it is going exactly where he envisages it: as a vehicle focused on him. Disappointing, given the roots of the franchise.<br/><br/>Plenty of big budget action in exotic locations reduced to nothing memorable. No lingering images or ""I gotta visit there"" heart to them.<br/><br/>Oh, Maggie Q's line ""but its a NICE CAR!"", that had impact."
"Legendary_Badass","8","0","2","3 June 2006"," An enjoyable action flick
","The summer blockbuster season kicks off with Mission Impossible 3, an explosive sequel. Tom Cruise is back as Impossible Mission Force operative Ethan Hunt. Agent Hunt is getting a little older and is now a matured man setting forth with the mission of making a family. Early on we see him mingle with guests at a pre-wedding get together, but he still deploys the classic cover of having a fictional occupation. However, he is quickly thrown back into active field duty along with series long cohort Luther played by Vingh Rhames. This leads Hunt into a series of plot twists that have him trying to recover a mysterious item know as ""the rabbit's foot"" in order to save his new girl.<br/><br/>In this latest installment director JJ Abrams uses a new device as a means to separate this episode. Unlike the first two, Mission: Impossible III gives Hunt a valuable fancy gadget: dependable people. It is refreshing to see characters that are useful and can grow on us. No longer are Ethan and Luther the only guaranteed-not-to die characters. The two veterans are complemented by shallow backgroundless characters played by Maggie Q and John Rhys Meyers. Since much of the story deals with Ethan's personal life, it would only slow down the film to give these new characters a family and depth. Instead of going this route, these two serve up laughs and because of this there is no subtraction.<br/><br/>There are various stunts in this film. Cruise takes credit for doing all of his own stunts and Abrams shoots each to show the audience the truth: he isn't lying. Cruise manages to jump from a skyscraper with a thin cord and no safety net in a glorious uncut crane shot. This is followed by a parachute sequence of computer-generated work, but at least there is no stunt double. Cruise even stands close to explosions while a wired harness flings him into a Dodge Intrepid. It sure feels good to know that there is a rich movie star that wants to lay it on the line.<br/><br/>As much as he Cruise tries, the zingers are the real stars. The crafty lines cannot be easily counted in one viewing. My favorite exchange was when Hunt disguised as Davian is approached by fellow agent Zhen. She is apologizing to him in front of his (Davian's) bodyguards for the red wine she spilled on his shirt. She then speaks a language that his translator picks up and relays to both him and the audience. She tells of how her hotel offers a dry cleaning service and that she'll take care of the mess. He then replies: ""What are we going to do in your hotel room with my shirt off?"" This is followed by her reply, to which the translator says: ""She'll think of something."" This soon to be classic gets Hunt away from the guards and allows for a fake assignation of Davian.<br/><br/>It is welcoming to have an action flick with an element of confusion. For instance Philip Seymour Hoffman's Davian is marketed as the bad guy, but he isn't the only one. A cloud of suspicion is placed over just about every character. I like being jerked around to an extent. Abrams knows the right extent to do this; because unlike the first in the series, this one ends with the viewer aware of each characters side.<br/><br/>The most intriguing aspect of the Mission Impossible universe is a device that crafts faces. Each time we are presented a situation we must determine whether or not what we are seeing is real. When Ethan's wife Julia is shot point blank; I was shocked. I thought that maybe this film is challenging the Hollywood narrative. Soon after this event my hopes were dashed as we discover the use of the infamous face maker. I'm not saying that the film needed to be misogynistic, but it would have been something as clever as the zingers."

"KUAlum26","7","0","1","1 June 2006"," Best of the MI movies(so far)
","IMF agent Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise,who else?)has managed to cross(and was crossed by)a vile,vicious arms dealer named Owen Davian(Philip Seymour Hoffman,brilliantly evil here)and he and his woman(Michelle Monaghan)are now in a world of trouble,as we open the third movie of this series. From there,we discover that this has been a war of attrition between Hunt and DAvian,which involves plenty of gunfights,globe-hopping and disguises. Ethan's team in tow(the fantastic Ving Rhames along with Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys-Davies),they feverishly work to achieve said Impossible and,in my opinion,improve upon what was previously a somewhat dry franchise of stylish action and ""Cruise Indulgence""(a term I've coined for any Tom movie where there are a slough of slo-mo action sequences with plenty of shots of the diminutive scientologist in abject pain and struggle). It is the use of more of the ""team"" element of M:I in this movie that I prefer this movie the best,since the whole crux of the television series WAS the fact that these were missions that were completed because of a nameless,faceless espionage effort.<br/><br/>Kudos to director and co-writer J.J.Abrams for allowing the movie to give more of a spread out form of tension and kinetics. A supporting cast that also features Laurence Fishburne,Keri Russell,Billy Crudup and Simon Pegg are well-placed. This film is pure formula ""Summer actioner"" and ""Popcorn flick"" so one should shrug off any of the convenient plot hooks that arise in this film(and there are at least a few!). Not great entertainment,and it even possesses some unintentional humor,but the movie works for the genre it represents and unlike the first two MI films(No.1 was convoluted and confusing and No.2 was dry and archingly ""Arty""),it is an easier digest as a big-screen offering."
"mweast","9","0","1","1 June 2006"," Very good movie
","I don't understand the reasons behind some of the comments about this film. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by it - I think it was outstanding, and significantly better than the first two MIs.<br/><br/>The action was non-stop, and it wasn't of the (seemingly typical nowadays) special effects/mindless variety. Well, some of it was, but mostly the movie was intriguing and well done. I even liked Cruise in this move, which is a stretch for me (since he's completely full of himself in most movies).<br/><br/>I suppose critics can criticize (what else do they have to do?) some of the background stuff, like why a secret agent would have dreams of living a mundane second life (anyone see ""True Lies""?),but during the movie nothing seems incredible enough to interrupt the flow of the movie (no infamous ""What?"" moments). I did find some questionable logic occasionally, as in most films, but again nothing terrible or even especially obvious - I'm not going to point any out, since I think it detracts from the film for those who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>The dialog is good, the intrigue elements are generally involving rather than obvious, and the misdirection was done pretty well e.g., although I'd already figured out Samuel L Jackson was not the bad guy, and I'd figured that the Rabbit's Foot was real, I didn't have any clue about Cruise's wife.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was one of Cruise's best films, and a very good way to spend an afternoon."

","Only having watched opening and closing bits of MI1 on TV and not MI2 at all, I was unexpectedly drawn to MI3 by trailers. This is a well made film, not meant to be realistic but about impossible superagents doing impossible stuff to fight Really Bad Guys so the action had to keep and was kept going with no let up to spoil the fantasy or unreality. Given that, the action/plot was fun and coherent, yet gritty. There IS a big hole in the logic towards the end and the final scenes were plainly unreal but this IS fantasy after all ! My gripes are that some violence especially re the women were unpleasantly and too graphic while the fate of the Bad Guy in the end was way too kind. The music nicely brought back memories of the TV series too. To sum up: a well made and acted action film with just a bit too much violence for some of us and which works well on large screen"

","If you are a fan of the other MI movies, or any action movies like I am, you may think this will be a great movie. With a decent cast, and two decent prequels before it, this movie is bound to be good, right? Wrong. The movie is terribly under dramatic and rather unclear. The movie really is a mission impossible, and the movie is a cross between realistic action and fake gadget fighting. The movie also totally skips out on one of the main action scenes, so obviously this movie is not good if you are looking for a good action scene. If you are looking for a good all around movie that is another thing. This movie unlike X Men: The Last Stand, and many other action movies, is not pure fighting. In contrast there is a fair amount of ""quiet time"" and even a touch of comedy. I give this movie 5/10 for a nice all around movie, but it is not the greatest out there of its genre."

","Mission Impossible III Super spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) once again accepts a mission in the third offering of the Mission Impossible franchise. This time he is up against international terrorist/psychopath Owen Davies (Philip Seymour-Hofmann) who decides the only way to get Hunt out of his weapons dealing business is to target Hunt's wife (Michelle Monaghan). With the help of his team (Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Hunt sets out on a treacherous game of brain bombs, fast orange cars and predicaments that seem too impossible to get out of.<br/><br/>The making of this second sequel certainly lived up to its title brought about by the many obstacles and distractions associated with filming. Director David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, Panic Room), then Joe Carnahan (Narc) decided to pull out and pursue other more worthwhile interest. The job eventually went to first time movie director J.J Abrams who obviously impressed Cruise enough with his work on Alias and Lost. Rumour also has it that Scarlett Johanssen (set to play Cruise's love interest) pulled out after Cruise tried to convert her to Scientology and the producers are facing a law suit from a stuntman who got burned while shooting. Then there were the obvious delays as Cruise had to take time off to jump up and down on Oprah's yellow couch and learn how to operate an ultrasound machine to make sure there is a baby inside Katie Holmes! But was it worth the wait? Given the previous success of the franchise, MI:3 will definitely thrill and entertain audiences again. Philip Seymour Hoffman (fresh from his Oscar winning role as Capote) was very effective and scary as the creepy and devious madman. His performance was a refreshing break from the often expected campy villain with the strange European accent. Credit also goes to Cruise for performing his own stunts and for being able to pull off playing romantic lead and action star in the same movie (but isn't it just a reflection of his Jekyll and Hyde personality?). Certainly MI:3 lives up to its predecessors in terms of delivering the goods with spectacular stunts filmed on location from around the world, expensive cars exploding and nifty gadgets that would make you think that Hunt and Bond shopped from the same spy catalog"

I'm therefore pleased to report that this was a big improvement on the first two movies and actually contains a few characters that are interesting.

Nevertheless,this movie is an adrenaline pumping, edge-of-your-seat action film that will completely satisfy your movie going needs.<br/><br/>After many years of service in a government organization called IMF, Ethan Hunt has decided to retire and teach agents instead.

The race is on.<br/><br/>Director J.J. Abrams, who also created my favorite TV show ""Lost"", did a great job reviving a failing franchise. And what I really like is that he used the composer, Michael Giacchino, from ""Lost"" which for me, made it even more enjoyable. He makes beautiful, yet compelling, music. Surprisingly, Tom Cruise as Ethan, who I normally don't like, did very good. He makes you care, and cheer on the character. And to think, he supposedly did most of his own stunts, I'm betting he got pretty bruised up. Philip Seymour Hoffman played an amazingly creepy bad guy that REALLY made you root for the good guys to win. And the best part of this movie wasn't even any of the above, it was the action scenes. But they aren't your typical cool action scenes, these are mind-blowing, heart-stopping action scenes. There are car chases, helicopter chases, elaborate rescues, huge shoot-outs, explosions galore, and pretty much every bit of eye-candy you can think of. The effects guys must have had a heckuva time with this film.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you want to entertained with non-stop action, great acting, great writing, great effects, great everything, then what are you waiting for?

","Making a good film sequel is a tricky task. The very reasons that demand a sequel are part of its downfall. The original is usually a good movie, or popular at the very least. Expectations are thus built in, and while succeeding at the box office often isn't difficult, creating a quality movie is an entirely different challenge. If a movie exceeds expectations (""Batman Begins""), then the reviews often rave more than they might have otherwise. Similarly, if a movie fails to deliver (""Matrix Revolutions, ""Godfather III""), opinions will be harsher than the film merits. Occasionally a movie will precisely intersect with the expectations (at least mine), resulting in a satisfying experience that doesn't stir the viewer aggressively one way or the other. Enter ""Mission: Impossible III"".<br/><br/>Following 1996's very good ""Mission: Impossible"" and 2000's so-so sequel, ""M:I-3"" takes place not long following, as Tom Cruise's agent Ethan Hunt is trying to settle down in his relationship with Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Of course an international crisis arises, and he is therefore forced to balance his personal life with the immediate demands of his secret superspy life.<br/><br/>That's where first-time movie director J.J. Abrams comes in. As creator of television's ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", his specialty is exploring the personal and psychological sides of people placed in extreme situations, an aspect that needed to be injected into this franchise. The original touched on it a little, but was so plot-driven that character was scarcely necessary. ""M:I-2"" tried to add a personal touch, but in a largely ineffective manner more referenced than shown. Blatantly adding a layer of humanity in this third edition proves to be a key choice if for no other reason than to differentiate it from its predecessor.<br/><br/>That is because the ""M:I-3"" itself is fairly straightforward, with a plot complex in a less gimmicky way than ""M:I-2"" but not as labyrinthine as ""M:I"". In fact the lack of uniqueness is the movie's biggest weakness. Little of the movie is poorly done, but the wow factor is also largely absent. With the exception of one good cringe-inducing moment, nothing will induce a significant reaction from the viewer. This can be attributed to the inherent nature of both the franchise and the genre. It's a Mission: Impossible movie, so you know you're getting outrageous stunts, daring covert operations, and plenty of action; and you more or less know who's living and dying. You don't know the precise route the movie is going to take, you know the starting point, the destination, and a few pit stops in between. Like a superhero film, suspension of disbelief is required, but there is no ethereal mythos present in good superhero movies, which limits the emotional power here.<br/><br/>All of that that isn't entirely a bad thing. There's a comfort in seeing familiar characters in a mostly predictable action flick, as long as the movie is decently made, which this is. Abrams does not take noticeable chances, but more importantly he does not make noticeable mistakes. He does not overwhelm the story with his style, something that John Woo struggled with in ""M:I-2"". Abrams' trademark hand-held camera shots, which looked like they might be obtrusive in the trailers, work well with the kinetic energy of the picture. Once ""M:I-3"" kicks things in gear, it doesn't stop, and still wraps things up in timely fashion. Abrams wisely kept the movie compact at just over two hours, in part by opting not to explain key MacGuffins and omitting scenes that would have been redundant, leaving the movie fresh enough to please until the end.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible III"" is cinematic fast food. You choose a restaurant like Wendy's because you like something there (mmm...spicy chicken) and you know what you're getting. When finished, you aren't blown away by the quality, but neither are you left wanting for something better. Same thing here. Given the path that this franchise has traveled, you won't walk out raving about ""M:I-3"", but neither will you be disappointed. While that leaves the viewer in a strange emotional limbo, it's also reassuring that decent summer blockbusters can still be produced in an era with far too many big budget disasters like ""Catwoman"".<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Go see it. Have a good time. Enjoy the ride. 7 of 10, which may be a point high just because it's the start of the summer season."

","I have recently watched Mission Impossible 1 and 2 on DVD, whilst I thought 1 was good, I wasn't over impressed with MI 2. So I went to watch the 3rd film with mixed feelings. I was greatly surprised at how good it was. I thought the cast were good and worked well together, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding (as usual), unbelievability menacing. Tom Cruise, did what you would expect from Tom in this type of film, though at times I thought there were times when it was obvious that he was acting, though this maybe being a little picky. As for the special effects, in my opinion they were as good as any film of this type that I have seen. This is for 2 reasons, 1. They were extremely stunning and realistic, in the films context. 2. In my opinion, the effects didn't overpower the storyline. This is an action film, that is high in action and a reasonably good story line which is well worth checking out."

","Who does this appeal to? Quite a large audience I guess video game enthusiasts, people who believe that loud music and fireworks serve the good cause of giving the intellect a rest while feeding into their emotional lives. But volume and flashes do not a good movie make particularly in the absence of a plot. What passes for a relationship here is just an excuse for Tom to ""macho up"" and save the damsel in distress. With more glitz than sanity, nothing gives the audience the nourishment that comes from a credible story, or at least a story that's believable on its own terms. Don't waste your money here, just wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>This movie falls into the abyss of most sequels - excellent advertising for an at-best mediocre product."

","What a shame, I really enjoyed the first two MI films and was looking forward to this one so it was disappointing to find it a bit clunky and with some poor acting.<br/><br/>Now I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, he can pull out some great performances, Jerry Maguire, and then when he goes into action hero mode it gets all wooden, what's going on. <br/><br/>There are some good set pieces the bit on the bridge was done very well indeed, edge of the seat stuff. Philip Seymour Hoffman was, as always, very good. <br/><br/>So what was wrong with it<br/><br/>Poor Simon Pegg just as he gets into his comedy bit he goes off on a tangent and starts telling us about a super toxin, this whole bit was so staged, how on earth are we going to let the audience know we have to save the world, let's just tell them out of context they will never notice. Why was it that the gang had such trouble getting into the Vatican when one of them just walked through the front door with a camera. What about trying to get into the building to get the toxin, lot's of trouble planing the attack, equations etc and jumping from one building to another, to have a bit of a prayer and then Tom jumping from a window what about the bit in between. Then the ending, happy families all hugs and laughing a bit weak.<br/><br/>There are better action movies around to watch on DVD, so spend your money on those."
"TheTouristDE","6","0","1","23 May 2006"," Where the story ends and Tom Cruise begins...
","First of all let me say this review is coming from a guy who loves James Bond and any other spy/agent movie. A lot. I can handle the logical shortcomings of the genre, and yes, I even love when James Bond is chasing an empty plane like Superman did in his best days. But it's not everything.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of aforementioned spectacular action scenes and those scenes are technically solid. But the movie itself is way overloaded with it. Maybe because the Writer and Director were lacking ideas to develop authentic characters and a fresh story ? I'd say so. The strongest part of the movie are the first 20-30 mins, and even then the dialogues are flat and trivial. The love story between Ethan Hunt and Julie is anything but authentic and touching. It could be replaced with a music video, that has 2 pretty people looking at each other for a few minutes. Even with some potential in the script, namely the conflict of keeping Ethan's double identity and his relation to Julie working - or not, the script didn't achieve to make the love story feel authentic. The ridiculous reanimation scene at the end is just the tip of the iceberg and here the director has his worst moment in the movie too. Once the action starts just forget you have a brain, you're not gonna need it. We've seen all the gadgets and seeing Tom Cruise climbing over walls, crouching through air vents and jumping off roofs isn't overwhelming. In summary, these scenes lack ideas too - just like anything else in the movie.<br/><br/>Summary: The receipt of changing locations every 20 minutes, brainless action and visuals, which seem to be stolen from some music video, doesn't work out. The movie seems more like a commercial for Tom Cruise face than anything else. It lacks ideas, the acting is below average (let alone Hoffman and Fishbourne, whose performances are solid) and directing is fixed on having Tom Cruise and the other characters look pretty. 6/10"
"lamer76","4","0","1","23 May 2006"," I hope Lost doesn't unfold as this one did.
","Although I haven't been to the theatre for a while, I was more than willing to make an exception for M:I III for two reasons. Call me a teenager but I'm a sucker for Cruise on the big screen. Second, and more important, I was dying to see what the creator of my favourite new show Lost can do in Hollywood. Anyone who can come up with such a creative and gripping series is sure to dazzle in the theatre. So I went...<br/><br/>And god how I wish I'd stayed in...<br/><br/>The only impossible mission I could find was to transform such a lousy under-developed script into something even remotely entertaining. What's with the latest fad of starting the movie with the scene before the last? Quite simply, it made the first hour meaningless, because we knew the bad guy would eventually escape, that he'd get hold of Hunt's (Cruise) girl and threaten to shoot her (if not indeed shoot her!) if the whereabouts of the ""Rabbit's Foot"" is not revealed. Granted the scene is intense and well made, but it is one of the rare good scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>So Ethan Hunt is now in love and getting married to super hot nurse Julia (Monaghan  from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). He no longer works in the field and is instead training agents. Julia thinks he works for the department of transportation but starts to feel something's off when he keeps going away on conferences for a ""few days"". Hunt has actually taken on an assignment to track down agent Lindsey Farrell (Russell) who has been kidnapped by super evil Owen Davian, played eeringly well by Hoffman (from Capote). In fact, Davian is so evil that he places a nitroglycerin capsule inside a person's brain through the nose and activates it once they escape. A few minutes later, the capsule explodes and the victim dies immediately, like a robot that has been turned off. That was probably the only cool gadget in the entire movie. Well OK the other cool gadget was Cruise in a priest's cassock as he sneaks into the Vatican and does his stuff. Nice touch.<br/><br/>But seriously, the plot line is thin with hardly any action sequences worth enduring the cheesy scenes for. One memorable one I'd like to share is when Agent Declan (Meyers) and Agent Zhen (Maggie Q) are in the car waiting for Hunt to come out of a building. Zhen starts whispering something and Declan asks her what it was. ""It's just a little prayer that I used to say to get my cat to come home."" A very serious straight-faced Declan replies ""Can you teach it to me?"" If that's not vomit-inducing cheese I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Anyway, if this movie is any indication of how Lost is going to unfold, then I don't know if I'm gonna be able to watch Season 3... Who am I kidding? I know I will."

","Having not seen MI:II, I went in with a clean slate, just ready to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>What I got was a pretty mixed bag. The action scenes were pretty well done, and the acting overall is decent (until Michelle Monaghan's constant droning in the final scenes.)Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job at playing the villain of the piece, it's just a shame he didn't feature more prominently in the movie. <br/><br/>There were certain scenes which just made me groan. Just before Ethan's wife is about to kill him to deactivate the explosive charge in his head, Ethan takes the sticks out of his mouth (used to bear the pain,) and proceeds to say ""I love you."" After this line the entire cinema groaned, including myself. It just had cliché written all over it. What made me cringe more is how Ethan is miraculously brought back to life by his wife, and yet Lindsey is left to die earlier on in the film. Why not just use the good old CPR technique on her too?<br/><br/>Having said that, other scenes had me hooked, like the scene on the bridge, which had plenty of explosions to keep everyone happy. Where Tom fails in the emotional stuff, he more than makes up for in the action scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, not the worst film I've ever seen, but then again, it certainly isn't the best. This is very much a ""seen one action film, seen them all"" type of movie, and some people will feel like they've seen this stuff all too much before."

","The first was technically accomplished but a quart incomprehensible, the second was overcooked and underwhelming - a pretentious bore and four million years later it's the third, half a centilitre deeper than than it's predecessors, better rounded but curiously bereft of energy or involvement - in short, its flat. JJ Abrams, the televisual wunderkind was handpicked by the Crusier based on his success in similar genres, particularly a show called Alias which is apparently was inspired by...mission impossible! Who better to helm one then? Well I don't know but on this evidence, a movie director might have been a better bet. Abrams script makes the mistake of trying to humanise the action hero by showing us a smattering of his personal life and then, and i hope your sitting down, involving her in the plot. A terrific opening teaser sets the scene with Hoffman's villain asking a bound Cruise for information on the Rabbit's foot - the plot's maguffin. His wife is bound in a chair with a gun to her head and then nasty mock-Capote tells our hero that she'll self-destruct in 10 seconds if he doesn't give him the foot's location. I once read that Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock had a similar conversation about Michael Foot in the run up to the 1983 election but thats just Westminster tittle-tattle I'm sure. Anyway, following this tantalising sequence the movie runs into a pedestrian stride rather than the sprint we might have expected. The inner Hunt takes centre stage while the action winds down and although the movie is cluttered with gunfire, chases, running and the usual explosions, nothing sticks, probably because Abrams medium is television and what works there seems strangely so-so on the big screen. The original movie was well served by De Palma's technical acumen - a perfect partner for the tricksy, twisty-turny nature of the t.v show. There's none of that bravura direction on display third time round nor any stand out set piece to mark out the mission's 'impossible' promise. The first had the Langley theft and the Channel Tunnel finale - here its all low key and more real worldly - fine but this is Mission: Impossible and we expect a bit of the outlandish. Better than the second when all is said and done but not quite the shilling - M:I:3 is conspicuously bland - the next will need a more extravagant pair of hands at the wheel if we're going to be convinced to bankroll the Cruiser's next divorce. Are you listening short arse?"

The one and truly the most remarkable spy in the world. Tom Cruise gives a fantastic show of performance, now with the responsibility on his shoulders to protect his future wife, Michelle Monaghan (I don't really remember her name in the film...), an uprising star who will make the top ten list of the most beautiful women of the world change ;). See it, it's not a masterpiece but is far away better than the other two created by Brian De Palma and John Woo. In the first one Ethan was younger and inexperienced, in the second, he was fearful, but not quite a hero yet. In this third adventure, he shows us his sensitive sight about the panic which is looking for his wife who was kidnapped by the famous Capote (noooo....just joking....Capote was the Oscar Winner), but Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the most impressive villains that I have ever seen. Who can give us such a brilliant and powerful performance like him? You will shake with his cruelty."

","For me, M:i:III was an impulse watch, something I went to see and paid the hefty admission for because it was there. Unfortunately, unlike some impulse discoveries, MI3 wasn't a positive surprise. Actually, it wasn't pretty much anything. It was just there.<br/><br/>Well, maybe there was one surprise in the movie. I took the risk that it would be another Mission: Impossible 2, even without director John Woo. This time, instead, J.J. Abrams, the director from the TV series Lost, took the helm. Perhaps it's no surprise then that M:i:3 is as exciting as a standard TV movie. Not to say that this isn't a big-budget film, absolutely not: the stars are well paid and the sets and locales are gorgeous. But even with high production values, the movie is bland and unimaginative, mostly due to directing and script.<br/><br/>MI3 really tries to be an exciting action movie. There are explosions, lots of hanging-by-the-thread situations, car chases, hand-to-hand combat and whatnot, a little of everything, except imagination and soul. For example, there's a scene where Ethan Hunt leaps off the roof of a building. That was a great opportunity for a massive camera dive that would have really captivated the audience, but no. Instead we get a boring stunt side shot, the like which we have seen countless times before. And that's just the problem with M:i:3: it has nothing new. From the plot to the action scenes, everything in this movie lacks the excitement and suspense of an action movie, because it has all been seen countless times over the past 20 years.<br/><br/>M:i:3 is not a movie that pushes action movies forward, and that is why even the high production values end up in mediocrity. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either, just hopelessly bland and unimaginative. In some ways, it even compares unfavorably to last summer's Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which was another dull dozer. You would do better to invest the ticket fare in a DVD of Kung Fu Hustle, for example, or just about anything else that you know you'll like."

Though I wasn't exactly wrong in that assumption, it was better than your typical brainless action flick. Tom Cruise does a pretty good job as usual, but he wish more of his screen time would have been used on the supporting cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular. He was a great villain, but we didn't get to see him nearly as much as I would have liked. Simon Pegg's small role was great as well. The plot was basic and straight-forward, but definitely exciting. I wish they would have spent less time on the whole family aspect though, a pointless and failed attempt to give the movie a deeper meaning. The effects were great of course, but the bridge scene went on way too long. It was like they had an explosion quota they had to meet.

In other words, the movie entertains without being a mere live-action cartoon.

","It's hard to imagine that ten years after the release of Mission: Impossible there was any consideration in making two other installments to the series. But what kind of expectations can you expect out of the third installment of non-trilogy story-line? An excuse to make a couple of bucks the easiest way possible. The movie debut of J.J. Abrams (co-creator of TV's Lost) is impressive, but nothing worthwhile. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, War of the Worlds) is starting a new life with his fiancé Julia (Michelle Monaghan, North Country) and trying to end his career in the IMF agency when an unexpected call from a former employer of Hunt's needs him on a mission to rescue a former apprentice of Hunts whose been held hostage by powerful terrorist weapon dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Capote). The mission to save his former student Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell, We Were Soldiers) failed and because of his failure, Hunt feels the heat from his supervisor (Laurence Fishburne, Assault on Precinct 13). In order to prove that he's not the failing type, Hunt goes and tries to capture Davian, in which has been considered an impossible mission for the IMF. Meanwhile his special force team begins nagging on him that he shouldn't have gotten involved in a relationship, fearing for the life of his fiancé (now wife) and for himself. Sure enough, after his capture, viciously threatens to kill Julia, after he escapes from the hands of Hunt. Davian is then rescued by his terrorist forces and proceeds to capture Julia. The only way for Hunt to get his wife back is to apprehend a nuclear 'doomsday' device called the 'Rabbit Foot' for Davian. With the mentality that ever loving husband should have for his wife, he applies to every demand of Davian. The film then falls in the direction of saving the girl on the tied down to the train tracks by a diabolical villain. But the main excuse for this film to show how many stunts Tom Cruise can do on his own and live to tell about it. The camera is used for a lot of crane shots and lets the audience follow the action with their own eyes rather than have the camera do it for them. The scene on the bridge when Hunt is running from a missile aimed at the car behind him and the explosion impact throws his whole body in to the car next to him all in one shot is visually impressive. For the editing, I did notice some tricks that they used to switch out actors for the untrained eye. When the camera rotates around Hunt disguising himself as Davian, there is an obvious change from Cruise to Hoffman. Nothing to impressive, but it did seem like the camera made an emphasis on eyes. There are several uses of surveillance cameras, binoculars, picture cameras, close up on what actors eyes staring down each other, and the most impressive when a dead corpse has a sever case of being cross eyed. It shows a fear that someone is always watching you, but if caught in a stare down, your eyes can be dangerously altered. The film's traditional Mission Impossible theme composed by Lalo Schifrin had several different arrangements to express the emotion and action through out the films entirety. I didn't really have to think about it. The film seemed to revolve more around the action sequences then the heist format the Mission Impossible series started off with. There are several homage's to the first films ideals, such as repelling from a steep drop off and the use of rubber masks as disguises. Mission Impossible III plot seemed more geared towards a love story than an action/thriller story. Nothing really special about the film but nothing bad about the film either. This film was based around Tom Cruise acting, stunts and dashing good looks."

I joked with my mother that If the Mission is so Impossible then why is there a third one? This was before I had seen the movie after that I told my mom that it was possibly the best movie I've ever seen!!!! I keep on struggling to think of a better movie and I am completely drawing a blank. This movie has an unforgettable climax and some of the most intense action I have ever seen on the big screen!!!!!!! Overall Mission Impossible 3 is awesome!!!!

","A must see movie for anyone who thoroughly enjoys a good action movie with continuous intrigue. The almost non-stop action keeps you on the edge of your seat, and Tom Cruise does a magnificent job of keeping the viewer interested. While some of the love story dialog is weakly done, Abrams does a fantastic job of varying music to excite you about the action scenes, and the beginning of the movie can be described as nothing but intense. Mission Impossible III gave exactly what I expected from a summer movie, a great action flick with a great level of drama which was much more in depth. Compared to the earlier Mission impossible movies, definitely as much action as the second with more intrigue and plot twists. In short, MI: III is a must see this summer."

This movie absorbs the viewers into the action and the other subplots within the film. This movie had a great plot, characters you can fall in love with, and even if you don't particularly like Tom, he does a great job in this movie.

","This was by far the weakest of the three MI movies. Their is absolutely no style whatsoever in the direction. Woo's MI2 was done beautifully compared to Abram's dull version. MI3 seems nothing more than an extended episode of Alias. I have heard people love the action sequences, yes they are great but they can be found in any action movie these days. Yes we know directors can do anything with CGI, so whats new? That is why MI2 worked so well, the CGI was great but their was style, and flair. This movie seemed nothing more than a chance to show off new editing techniques. The plot was extremely cliché. Who did not know about an hour into the movie about the so called ""twist"". And the villain? PSH is a great actor, but here he brings nothing to the performance his speech is monotone throughout the entire performance. BORING, again no flair whatsoever. This movie is not performing well at the box office because it is not that good of a movie, not because Tom C. is jumping up and down on Oprah."

There were no ""slow"" places, the action level was just right, and Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast did their jobs very professionally. I found the movie relaxing, stimulating, and not distressing or disturbing. It was precisely what I always found the original Mission Impossible series to be - interesting, fast moving escapist fare. I chatted pleasantly with my friends on the way home and slept well. What more could one ask after a hard day at work?<br/><br/>The rest of the full house opening weekend, last show of the evening Los Angeles audience must have had a similar experience - there was a loud burst of applause at the end of the show.

Superman never got married, batman never really had a girlfriend, RAMBO never got hung out with chicks, why is Ethan involved in a drawn out love story?<br/><br/>If you can get past the Harlequin Lovestory going on, the action is fairly mundane except for some of tom's stunts.

","Mission Impossible III starts off differently than others in the series, beginning with one of the most agonizing, intense, best acted moments in the entire film. The first two minutes are just a sampling of the intensity, emotion, and awesomeness that's in store for the viewers.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, whether you like the guy or not, makes amazing movies. Sure, he's not really different than any other character he's ever been in other films, but what J.J. Abrams does with the character of Ethan Hunt is what really drives the movie. Hunt is no longer your total hard-nosed, emotionally bland man that gets through his days one at a time. Now he's deeply in love (and a good performance by Cruise gives this impression), setting his sights on the future for the first time.<br/><br/>Phillip Seymore Hoffman's performance far out weighs Cruise's simple, if not cliché, character. Some argue that he barely has any screen time (which is very true), but look at the context of his character -- it was Laurence Fishburne that said Owen Davian (Hoffman's super evil personage) cannot be found. Do you think a man that can't be found is going to have a lot of time on screen? No, Hoffman gets an appropriate amount of time in the movie.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is simply brilliant. It's exactly what movie goers needed after such a horrible January-April of stale movies. Certain sequences don't work too well (the helicopter chase kind of seems ridiculous - and I think there were massive scaling problems in the CGI; Abrams abused Ethan's drop-inches-from-the-ground maneuver), and some sequences should have been included. Throughout the entire movie, Ethan and his team went through their objectives in stylish fashion, but when it came to the ONE IMPOSSIBLE MISSION in the film (the insane infiltration into the Shanghai Military Complex), Abrams disturbingly chose to emit all of what went on within the building and instead focused on the non-active team members waiting to evac once Ethan returned to the outside world! That's almost insulting! This is Mission Impossible, let's see the Impossible Mission! Aside from that one HUGE complaint, the rest of the film was sensational. Favorite moments include (and I'll keep this spoiler free): Ethan's interrogation aboard the cargo plane, the entire Vatican City mission, and of course, the famous bridge sequence.<br/><br/>In the end, Abrams entry into the MI series is much more deserving of better reviews than what it's been getting. He does a number of things that were desperately needed in MI2 (team-focused missions, personal interactions between characters, and more flexible acting from Cruise). And I appreciated his effort in making IMF a part of the U.S. government instead of just implied that its kind of ""there"". Mission Impossible III is one heck of a movie. It's intense, emotional, and exhausting - and it's a great way to start off the summer lineup."
"samira479","10","0","1","10 May 2006"," Summer Blockbuster Mission Impossible 3
","This movie is exciting, shocking, suspenseful, emotionally satisfying and has a fun retro soundtrack. I caution viewers that it is very violent, like War of the Worlds, and has astonishing special effects. Not for small children or the faint of heart, it is still a fine film for Mission Impossible fans, and even people too young to have seen the TV series, Mission Impossible. Usually franchise films run out of steam after the first few films, (who remembers 'The Howling 4, or 'Jaws 3'?) but this is a pretty strong film. Some people were claiming that Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who played the villain, stole the show, but I don't agree. I did find him marvelously repellent as the sadistic Owen Davian, though. So go see it! You might enjoy it!"

","I loved the first movie and enjoyed the second. The third has perfectly bridged the gap between the plot driven first and its action oriented sequel. The action, as expected was first class, with some incredible stunt-work and set-pieces. The opening scene shows some of Cruise's best acting in my memory and is one of the highlights of a fine film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a fantastic villain for the piece, probably the best performance in the film. One criticism I have is the lack of development of some of the supporting cast, particularly Cruise's IMF team, who with the exception of the returning Ving Rhames we no next to nothing about the team. This is only a small concern and the heavy action makes up for some of these niggles. I felt the end was poorly conceived compared to the rest of the movie and was a disappointment. Overall I thought this was a cracking film and despite the flaws it is, in my opinion, the best film of the 3. Definitely worth a watch, I will be getting the DVD when it comes out."

","I WAS going to start out saying something like, ""What was Tom Cruise thinking?"" But recent publicity has proved that he doesn't. Think, that is. If Mission: Impossible 3 enjoys any sort of financial success at the box office, then I blame the movie-going American public. Cruise and Paramount have turned an intellectually stimulating franchise into a mind-numbing mish-mash of action and violence. A sad commentary on the intellectual level of the average movie fan. Paramount teased those of us who care, by hinting that it would be releasing the television series on DVD, coinciding with the release of M:I3. Instead, Paramount released the first two Cruise installments as a boxed set. Is Paramount hoping to bury any and all memory of the best, the original , television version of Mission: Impossible? Hear me Paramount Studios! I would NOT EVER waste my money buying any Tom Cruise version of Mission: Impossible. I would however, spend BIG BUCKS on buying all seven seasons of the TV series if it were ever released on DVD."

","I saw MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3 tonight and came out smiling. It was tons better than John Woo's effort in the 2nd installment, but it still felt short of what I would consider a ""mission: impossible"" attitude. The first film incorporated tons of great original action, a nice twisty plot, and some decent babes. This one had some great action, a killer villain (but I'm incredibly partial to Hoffman), a fairly decent script, but a fairly formula storyline. If you want a decent, fun action movie where Tom Cruise isn't quite as annoying as he has been for the past few months. He did a good job. With small spots by Lawrence Fishburne, Billy Crudup and an all too short cameo by Keri Russel, this movie was worth the money, but I'm not surprised that it didn't grab the numbers that Hollywood hoped to garner. Hollywood has a LONG way to go with many movie goers. After all, who can forget such gems as STAY ALIVE, SCARY MOVIE 4, FAR FROM HEAVEN, and STAR WARS EPII? It'll take more than one or two decent movies for folks to regain their confidence in the industry once they stop insulting our intelligence."

There are to be fair, there are a couple of twists that I personally did not expect.<br/><br/>Action wise, it was pretty good. Some high tech toys, lots and lots of explosions and a decent pace throughout. Shot on location in a few interesting places, which was also good.<br/><br/>The script was generally well written, but no memorable one-liners. Acting wise, Cruise did well, although roles like this are pretty much his bread and butter roles. His love interest I thought did pretty well and there was reasonable chemistry between them.<br/><br/>As to how it rates compared to the previous two, I would actually say I liked this one the most."

","This movie gets everything right. The action is fast and furious, the characters are interesting and engaging, and even the love story is effective.Nobody shows the spy game at it's most fun, dangerous, and emotionally gripping as JJ Abrams. This guy is a genius. In his feature debut Abrams revitalizes the disappointing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise, who can be hit and miss, knocks this one way out of the park. He definitely brings his A-Game to this show. He is a movie star of the first order. It is a testament to the great actors around him and the strong script that Cruise doesn't monopolize the screen. He is THAT magnetic in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman offers a more than worthy adversary. Hoffman's Owen Davien is hands down the best super villain since Alan Rickman nearly stole the show as Hans Gruber in DIE HARD. He is always a step ahead of Cruise's super-spy and is scarifyingly ruthless. The scenes between Cruise and Hoffman snap like a live-wire. <br/><br/>The action is supercharged but most importantly the characters and story are gripping. You truly care about Ethan and his goals this time around and that gives the action scenes immediacy, energy and intensity that was lacking in the first two missions. A GREAT MOVIE THAT WILL LIVE LONG AFTER IT'S OPENING WEEKEND."

They were so quick and, well, they were just funny.<br/><br/>Jonathan Ryes Meyers was beautiful  even more so than our leading man. Tom Cruise was very good. I am not a Tom Cruise fan and he will never win an Oscar but he can certainly carry an action movie. I mean how many people could pull off the cheesy but very well choreographed and executed elevator escape scene. Were it not so entertaining it would have been laughable.<br/><br/>The whole movie could have been cheesy if I had had time to think about it (which I didn't). But my absolute favorite was the spontaneous calculation of the distance of his ""Super Spidey Jump"" on the window of a building in Shanghai. Unbelievable! <br/><br/>In a nut shell, the movie was worth every bit of the $8.00 I shelled out on the ticket (maybe even the ridiculous amount I paid for my drink).

That's actually the first thing she thought after killing two men for the first time and when her husband(Tom Cruise) almost died. And I can't watch Laurence Fishburne on a big screen from a close range. I do believe that the explosions and the gadgets saved the movie. Plus Tom Cruise's insane popularity from the past few months didn't hurt either. To finish this, Philip Seymour Hoffman was okay, it wasn't the kind of movie like Capone but he was fine in an action movie.

Yes you have a fabulous villain played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a nefarious supplier of some of the most lethal weapons known to man to anyone who will meet his price. He doesn't like to be screwed with. But you know inevitably it does, and bad things happen. Many reviews have said it better than I have, but I fully agree with the aggregate masses: Don't look for anything deep in this - It's strictly action. You may see some subtle parallels with some scenes, like the statement that if you destroy one bad person, three or more are willing to take that place and your problems grow, but the style, the filming and yes, the acting when all put together make for a pretty damn good Disney Theme park ride.

","Don't get me wrong, I love the action sequences in this movie. It's not realistic, but let's face it, it's Mission: Impossible. The story is a little weak, but just enough is there to keep it flowing. The only thing I wasn't keen on was looking at Tom Cruise for that long, but only because the media is just so saturated with him right now. He doesn't do a bad job, but he doesn't stretch himself either. Regardless of that, he's got GREAT hair in this movie. Ving Rhames is some decent comic relief, but they could have easily kicked his role up a notch and kept it light and fun. For me, it was kind of predictable. They tried to throw in a twist, but if you know M:I, you'll see it coming about one third to half way through the film. Again, even the twist is typical. If you're looking for a good big screen distraction with high budget action sequences, it's worth the look.

They laugh about it before hand with their friends ""Can you believe that Tom Cruise?! He must be aging in his grave by now and he wants to do another Mission Impossible? haha"" They get worked up into a pretty good frenzy about this movie.

"ykobets","6","0","1","9 May 2006"," Why don't we get James Bond married also?
","When the movie started, I thought it was cool to see a great spy being tortured, about to collapse and helpless (it reminded me the last delivery of the Bond saga, but this one is more intense). The sadistic and senseless face of the villain (Seymour Hoffman is a jewel, even in his performance in a blockbuster action movie), the spy begging, the shot in the head, the match sparking and the music. I throw some popcorn in my mouth and got ready for some frantic action, shooting and chasing. The elimination of a lineal plot, that buried M:I 2 back in 2000, and the comeback to a more elaborated storyline, a la De Palma style, was expected. The wife stuff was cool, the subject of the existence of life beyond the IMF, the legendary spy teaching the young recruits at Langley - all that was OK. And finally, the first mission throws Hunt, as expected, back to the field. The cool spy borns as one and dies as one. (WARNING: We are talking about the movies, so I will aloud myself to exaggerate a little bit and put things in perspective). The wife is left quietly at the peaceful home, while Hunt attempts to save a girl whose activity is much more interesting and challenging than the one his lovely wife represents. The storyline gets more complicated keeping you at the edge of your seat. The second mission, from beginning to end, is absolutely awesome. The special effects are state of the art, and we finally get an explanation of the masks and voices stuff, so commonly used in the M:I saga. The twists of the plot continue until we finally reach the point where we realize that the most risky, dangerous mission will be to save the wife, whose innocent existence was corrupted by the merciless villain. The national security, the deadly menace to the world, the treason - all of that goes to a second place. The wife is the center and motive of Hunt's activity. Why is that? The true spy have no attachment to the world of the feelings, nor to all that stuff that can hurt him by hurting said ""stuff"". I'll explain: Hunt got grabbed by the balls because of his wife. I insist, if you are a spy y can not aloud the bad guys to get to you through your loving ones, you don't have such loving ones and if you do, you'll suffer the consequences. In the real world, I must insist, this is nonsense, every single of us has loving ones, but a spy should not have. If he do, he becomes vulnerable. In the movies this subject can be treated wisely as they did in M:I 1, with uncle Donald and Momma Hunt as drug dealers. Nevertheless, Hunt's actions were not affected by this, he continued with the mission. In M:I 3, it is different, he faced a whole new situation, and the spy reacted as human. Maybe that is OK, but that is not the essence of the M:I saga. What is going to happen when James Bond got married? No more Bond girls? Clearly this is not the case with Hunt, but the vulnerability of the spy because of the girl is evident. One last thought: I understand that Cruise is madly in love with Kat, he finally proved that the sterile one was Nicole by having a daughter and he was intending to prove to Kat that he will do everything for her, even jeopardizing his life and of others to save her. But, man!! Do not mess with the Hunt character. Leave him alone! Do some crappy love story movie, buy her an island, send her flowers, but leave M:I alone! Cruise is clearly a good Hunt, but I seriously doubt that a fourth delivery will be approved. That is sad. I really recommend this movie. I liked it, it is enjoyable, I insist, its special effects and darkness are very good, but... Let's not repeat what I already said. Enjoy, guys."
"treuntas-1","4","0","1","9 May 2006"," Not Smart Like M:I 1, no real action like M:I 2, A Rather Bland Movie. Disappointing!
","***may contain spoilers*** M:I 3 was a very disappointing movie in my opinion when compared to the first two movies. In all three movies, the direction and story lines have gone in entirely different directions with three very different type of MI movies. The first movie was a great spy movie and a bit of a thinker with a bit of a twist at the end when the villain was revealed. The second MI was all style and action with no real attempt to make the viewers think. The action was brilliant (at times over the top), the direction from John Woo was very stylistic and beautiful to watch and the soundtrack was an amazing piece of direction with Hans Zimmer composing. It was an excellent action movie. <br/><br/>M:I 3 on the other hand was neither a smart spy movie like the first or a great action movie like the second. Instead, it tries to be dramatic and inject character into a movie that doesn't need it. This time we see Ethan Hunt's personal life as he has fallen in love and gets married. The whole storyline is fueled by Hunt's attempt to save his wife from death at the hands of Phillip Seymour Jones' character. We see all sorts of personal touches as Luther (Ving Rahmes) tries to sympathize with Hunt's position. In fact the first part of the movie is all about Hunt and his relationship with his fiancé/wife. It is so slow to watch. You keep waiting for the action to start and when it does it is completely disappointing. The first action scene you have involves a little bit of shooting, a couple of explosions and a helicopter chase. The helicopter chase could have been a lot better. It takes place in the dark over top of some electric producing windmills. However, its just a little bit of flying with one stunt that was pretty lame (flying under a windmill's blade?). Later on they include a mask scene, which works pretty good like in the first M:I, but there is no action involved (we've seen it before and its been done better). The real action scene of the entire movie is the bridge scene that takes place about ¾ through the movie. Its sort of cool, but you've scene the best part in the trailer. How about the action at the end of the movie, at the height of the movie's climax? Basically there really isn't any, it is the most anti-climactic scene I have ever watched. In the first M:I we had the awesome channel tunnel train scene with Tom on top of the train traveling at 220 miles an hour trying to stop the villain escaping on a helicopter (the cool ""red light, green light"" scene). M:I 2 which had excellent action all the way through had an awesome, over the top, half an hour long action scene. It began with the bunker scene and trick mask scene and exploding into a crazy motorbike chase scene, which ended with a fierce one on one fight. M:I 3's climactic action? Hunt runs through the streets of Shanghai, has a brief little skirmish with Hoffman, which result in Hoffman accidentally dying in a manner we don't even get to see. The surprise bad guy gets shot by the girl, when he tries to catch her by surprise. Nothing for action, no real crazy chase scene and no real fight, and both bad guys die in a boring fashion. There is no real action at the end of the movie! None, nothing! Who makes a spy movie that has no action and/or no real twist at the end. <br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack and the direction. It was the director's first time directing a movie, having been a TV director of some reknown (apparently). The direction has no style and is incredibly flat to watch. The accompanying soundtrack is also flat and does not support the movie well. Also, I know its nit picky, but who ends a spy movie with rap music by Kanye West?<br/><br/>By all means, see the movie, but just don't expect much and you may appreciate it more than I. Once again, no good action scenes, weak plot and too much time spent on drama with between Hunt and his fiancée."
"eamon-hennedy","9","0","3","9 May 2006"," A great addition to the series.
","As a fan of the first two movies of Tom Cruise's Mission:Impossible franchise, I awaited the arrival of number three with some excitement, not only for the fact that it was continuing a movie series that has already set itself as a series with differening styles for each movie making it an enjoyable addition to the spy-fi genre, but for the fact that this installment was being written and directed by the man who had turned that said genre on its head in the last five years with his television series Alias, one Mr JJ Abrams. He is a great choice to handle this movie and it ensures that Mission:Impossible 3 is a terrific movie.<br/><br/>Like the television series Alias, M:I 3 features a story that revolves around its leading character living a life as a spy, while trying to juggle a personal life in which he must hide his true job from those he loves, in this case his fiancée (played by the quite lovely Michelle Monaghan). Of course, like Alias, as the film continues, said personal life and professional life becoming involved head on and the resulting plot includes kidnappings, weapons of mass destruction (which, like Alias, may have a quasi-spiritual/religious element to it) and the leading character having to go rogue for a spell. It all adds up for two hours of great fun, overheated action sequences and a fun time in the cinema, which is what this franchise has managed to do now three times. Tom Cruise seems to be welcoming playing the character of Ethan Hunt with a few more dimensions with the welcome inclusion of a life outside of IMF even though the relationship is played out in a conventional, slushy Hollywood way what with the misty eyed looks and PG-13/12 rated make out sessions. As well as a good performance from Cruise, Abrams, who is obviously a fan of the series, has decided, like in the series from the 1960's, to center his leading man around a superb ensemble. Ving Rhames makes a welcome return as Luther Stickell, while we have the additions of Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the rest of his team and it should be said that this element works very well, so well that it wouldn't be a bad idea to try and ensure these characters come back for any proposed fourth installment, while any film in the world that features Laurence Fishburne is worth watching in my estimation.<br/><br/>Of course what one expects from a film like this are action sequences, and with James Bond veteran Vic Armstrong on duty here, the audience will not be disappointed. The rescue mission of a fellow agent in the opening half four get things of to a nice start, but it is the attack sequence on the bridge that will cement this film a reputation. Brutal, chaotic and quite violent (there is a number of collateral damage in the sequence), it shows that JJ Abrams is, like Joss Whedon, born to be making movies, making his television work almost seem like a try out period.<br/><br/>Overall this is a superb film. No doubt like the first two movies, there will a wealth of mixed opinion, but I for one loved it, so much it made me want to watch the first two again (oh, that sounds like a nice idea for a double feature), while simultaneously making one excited for a fourth installment (please, don't make it be another six years). In the meantime, Mission:Impossible 3 ensures that we'll be humming that theme tune for a while to come yet."

","the line ""democracy wins"" sure took me out of the film and back into current events. it made me hypercritical of the whole movie. in retrospect, the film took the watered down attempt at a curve ball who done it and mixed it with the super deadly disease from MI1 and MI2 respectively.the first movie still posed the most ""impossible mission"" and had the easily the best writing. i had always hoped and assumed that any Mission:Impossible sequels would be done with new and talented cast. the cast could change each film which would fill each movie with a new group of characters we could learn to like or hate.the characters could remain interchangeable with presumably Ethan being the leader - but not the star-. this may seem out there but i think it would have proved more entertaining and definitely more original. being a fan of the old series(in syndication) i always thought the movies would have worked better that way. i still enjoyed it though. not a bad movie at all, great action sequences and killer acting on Phillip Seymours part; i mean that dude was mean. the movie was pretty cool and worth the price of admission, just mildly unoriginal."
"abum190","7","0","1","8 May 2006"," So Tom is a dork- still see this movie
","I will be the first to tell you that Tom Cruise is turning into a very stupid person. He's hurting the revenue of the movies he's in, whether or not they are good, he's hurting his own public image, he's hurting the public image of his poor young wife, and he's setting the stage for a rocky life for Suri.<br/><br/>But Tom Cruise is not this movie. There are many other good things about this movie that have nothing to do with Tom Cruise at all- thank God.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of them. He makes possibly one of the most realistic antagonists in recent movies. But while remaining realistic, he's still incredibly creepy and intimidating.<br/><br/>The plot, too, is quite good. I didn't see the first two, but I didn't need to, and now I don't care if I did or not because this one was satisfying enough. The new impossible mission for Ethan Hunt in this third installment is to retrieve an agent from the possession of Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an arms dealer than keeps out of the public eye, but from this mission stems a far more dangerous one centering around something called the Rabbit's Foot. There's a twist that I saw coming, but I was the only one in my group that did, and it was still a good idea; I admire J.J. Abrams for pulling it off so well.<br/><br/>So Tom's in it too, in case you didn't know. He's really not a bad actor, and though he tends to play the same character, he's very good at that character- intense gaze, everyman smile, casual talk. The man plays Tom Cruise very well, and he'll continue to make millions of dollars doing it through a great deal of movies, so I move that we accept that and move past it- because most of those movies are good. Like this one.<br/><br/>Forgive it for having Tom in it, and see it despite that flaw."
"jcallows","8","0","1","8 May 2006"," What happened to the music?
","First off, I actually liked this film. I'd rank it right behind the first and slightly above the second. The story did seem like a re-hash of the first, though. (Does this count as a spoiler?) Anyway, what had helped make the first two enjoyable was the film score which was almost non-existent the third. The use of the original theme in the first two films (especially in the first) enhanced situations where spy activities were done and served as a reminder that we were watching a Mission Impossible film. This theme was missing here. MI:3 was still a good movie, but it could've been better with more music, more of the original theme and more Philip Seymore Hoffman."
"psi_fla","5","0","1","8 May 2006"," M:I III, ""Alias"" Tom's latest mission, is quite forgettable
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in action for his latest Impossible Mission; to track down arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and rescue his new wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He is aided by his old buddy Luther (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q) and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)...<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has not had it as easy as he'd like these days, has he? That infamous ""out of the closet"" South Park episode, in addition to his blatant showboating of his relationship with Katie Holmes, has left him looking less like the dependable low-key leading man he can be, and more like the smug, insufferable wannabe scenery-chewer he also can be. Alas, the third incarnation of Ethan Hunt, his Mission: Impossible alter ego, comes closest to the latter. It's not that the performance is awful, but let's just say that all that publicity has not helped his cause at all.<br/><br/>It also casts a huge shadow over Mission: Impossible III (hereafter M:I III). The film is loaded with problems, and they don't just exist within the film itself - a change in director and the loss of the likes of Scarlett Johansson from the cast didn't help the film's production. Nevertheless, I had good reason to be optimistic - the final, credited director was none other than J.J. Abrams, the man behind my current favourite TV show, Alias.<br/><br/>For those of you uninitiated with the world of Alias, let me briefly bring you up to speed with what it offers - complex characters, excellent acting (Melissa George excluded), numerous plot twists and brilliantly staged action sequences, all topped with elements of suspense and intrigue.<br/><br/>Abrams' skill with some of the above elements help to redeem M:I III to an extent. Some of the action sequences towards the end of the film are quite gripping, if not breathtaking, there are plot twists (even if a couple are preposterous), and most of the second half of the film is suspenseful.<br/><br/>And, of course, that terrific theme tune is all over the place. (What would the film be without it?) Unfortunately, something else is all over the place - the first half of the film, which is incoherent as well as being uninvolving.<br/><br/>Also, being his first film, it seems that Abrams is frustrated at not having the additional time you get in TV shows to develop your characters. It shows - both Davian and Julia are written as little more than plot devices. Yet Philip Seymour Hoffman (who's always good) and Michelle Monaghan rise above the material to make these people interesting. In fact, thanks to Hoffman, Davian is the best of the M:I villains to date (ahead of the slightly irritating Jon Voight and the low-key Dougray Scott). His Almost Famous co-star, Billy Crudup, is also impressive, though Ving Rhames and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are both underused.<br/><br/>Now if the problems I've discussed so far were the only problems the film had, then I'd recommend it. But there's more. If you thought the shakycam was overused in The Bourne Supremacy, you ain't seen nothing yet; every single one of the fight scenes is very difficult to follow.<br/><br/>And is it just me, or do Simon Pegg and Laurence Fishburne bring certain characters from Alias to mind? Are the IMF headquarters reminiscent of the Alias' CIA offices? It only shows a lack of imagination on Abrams' part when he seems to be cannibalising from his own show.<br/><br/>I understand that M:I III will probably be more appealing to those who haven't seen Alias. But I suspect that even they will be underwhelmed. I know from seeing his TV work that J.J. Abrams can do much better than this cobbled together, recycled effort.<br/><br/>J.J., you have the potential to become a good film director, but you've a long, long way to go. As for this film's position in the M:I series, well, it's an improvement over the last one, but that's not saying much. I certainly won't lose sleep if there isn't another entry in the series."

","I want JJ Abrams to rot in hell. No, scratch that: I want JJ to rot away in limbo while other members of the Alias production crew rot in hell. But, I'm not here to discuss the season five Alias fiasco. I'm here to discuss, well, Alias: The Movie. Oops, I mean Mission Impossible III.<br/><br/>Months ago, during the height of my Burn JJ at the Stake wrath, I knew MI3 would suck me into the theater because it starred Philip Seymour Hoffman. My Hoffman love affair dates back to my pre-teenage years. Growing up I wanted to be his Lester Bangs. To this day, he's my favorite actor. I cannot resist a film with him in it, even if it stars Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams directed it.<br/><br/>Today I succumbed. I shelled out fifteen dollars (ticket, coke, and chocolate covered raisins) to see The Man. OH, I was not disappointed. The hype and critic reviews nailed it: this film is all boom, and all Hoffman. Fine with me. The film opens on Tom Cruise's battered face, and Hoffman's cool, sadistic voice demanding Cruise give him the ""rabbit foot"" or he'll kill Cruise's pretty little wife. Hoffman delivers his lines with conviction and menace; he's a bored sociopath. He's delicious and alluring. I felt giddy watching him taunt Cruise's Hunt. You catch your breath when he appears on screen  which is not nearly enough.<br/><br/>The rest of the flick  this really isn't a film, more an elaborate (and expensively) staged action sequence that lasts two hours  is a showy, loud, over-directed escapist rip off of JJ Abrams's 'Truth Be Told' (the pilot episode of 'Alias'). Question: can you sue yourself for plagiarism? If you know the plot of 'Truth Be Told', you know the plot of MI3. There is not a scene, not a shot, not a character, that he did not ""sample"" from Alias. Thankfully, Jennifer Garner is nowhere in sight. When Marshall appeared on screen, I yelled: why didn't you just cast Kevin Weisman and be done with it, Jesus! If it wasn't for Philip Seymour Hoffman and a spectacular action sequence on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, I might have hated this flick. I walked out with the polar opposite reaction: I relished in its outrageousness and chutzpah. It had nothing to say, and said it with such flare and jazz. The actors and characters are merely devices for more boom. Again, fine with me; the boom entertains like woah."

","""We've implanted an explosive charge in your head. Does that sound familiar?"" Crazy. Mental. Insane. Dumb. Ridiculous. Say what you want about Tom Cruise but there's one thing you cannot deny, he knows how to deliver a big action summer blockbuster and he has done so with his latest; Mission: Impossible III.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams does a wonderful job, you wouldn't know its his first time directing a feature length movie. His directing is tight and you see almost everything, unlike numerous action movies nowadays who either have the cameras right up close or has wiz bang editing. The camera is pulled back and the only complaint I have is that sometimes the camera is too shaky and jittery so you sometimes get disoriented. But Abrams pulls through and I hope that if there is an M:I IV, he directs.<br/><br/>The acting in this is solid per usual. Tom Cruise is great in this. I put all the gossip and news about Cruise and his behavior out of my mind and enjoyed the movie, which is essentially what we should do in the first place. He's not playing Tom Cruise in this movie so don't go in expecting him to act like he's perceived in the news. I don't care how he acts, as long as he puts out consistently great flicks (side note: He's from Syracuse, NY which is about 30 minutes from where I live. Awesome!). The whole cast has a great chemistry. Ving Rhames as Stickle is great per usual. The exchanges between Cruise and Rhames are great, you really get the feeling they are good friends. It really helps the movie by having them have conversations about Hunt getting married all while they're in the middle of a mission. Laurence Fishburne was good too. He had all of the best lines. I enjoyed the ""chocolate"" and ""intelligence"" exchange in one scene in particular. The rest of Hunt's team was good as well, even if there were no stand out performances from either. Simon Pegg (Shaun from]Shaun of The Dead) was awesome in this, even if he had little screen time. He was funny as usual and has quickly become one of my favorite comedic actors. His delivery and comic timing are top notch and funny as hell. Philip Seymour Hoffman. Now this is an enemy. He was menacing and evil but not over the top. Hoffman played Davian very well, he's probably one of the strongest characters in the movie acting wise. At some points I felt like saying I was sorry to him.<br/><br/>Now this is an action movie and it does not disappoint. The action scenes are over the top yes, but never go into the realm of unbelievable nor make you roll your eyes. They're all wonderful. There's a lot of action too. It doesn't have an overly elaborate plot line. It gives you just enough information to know what's going on and to be interested but doesn't dwell on it too much; they know what kind of movie you came to see. It's about 10 minutes of talking then another action scene. Each one is memorable and keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The score is standard action movie fare with the famous M:I theme playing only twice throughout the whole movie, at the beginning and at the end. There's nothing in particular that stands out among another piece though.<br/><br/>So yes, Abrams has made the best of the M:I movies. It has a story and tons of action. It isn't over the top like M:I:II was. As I said before if there's fourth entry I hope Abrams returns to write and direct. I also hope we don't have to wait till 2012 for the next one either. So you're mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see this movie if you want a good time. This post will self destruct in 5 seconds"

","From the patented opening scene that drops us in the middle of the action, then goes back in time and leads us in, this really isn't much more than an extended version of a typical episode of _Alias_. Except this time, Abrams and his crew can actually afford to go to the exotic places where the story is set, rather than trying to find stand-ins in LA and its environs. That said, this really wasn't a bad movie. It was enjoyable from start to finish, but not something you'll spend much time thinking about after it's over. I'm really surprised that none of the MI movies has really been a rousing action picture so far, so saying that this is the best of the three isn't saying that much, unfortunately. Still, as action pics go, you could do much worse and the film has really done a good job of kicking off the summer 2006 film season, which largely seems to be what it was designed to do."

Secondly, there is a conversation in the beginning of the movie where Tom Cruise uses the word 'literally' and pronounces it lit-rly which seems out of character to me. Aside from those arbitrary discrepancies, this movie is amazing. I know John Woo is a celebrated director, but the second M:I is the worst one of the series. This is the sequel that should have been. This movie showed me that I had forgotten what suspense is. My girlfriend had to look away from the screen because she was so nervous. My sister spent the entire movie bouncing her legs up and down. Even if this movie was just a home movie of Morgan Freeman reading the story out-loud, the film would have still been amazing. This story surpasses the first film's story and the second film isn't even worth mentioning in comparison. There is a scene where action is specifically left unshown, which was a daring but awesome decision."

","With all the hubbub surrounding Tom Cruise's religious eccentricities and bizarre behaviour, it is nice to see him go back to doing what he does best - running, shooting, shouting and looking generally concerned about the welfare of his loved ones. MI:3 is by no means a classic, but it is certainly enjoyable, and despite the heavy use of genre clichés it avoids the fate of MI:2, which was pretty much a ninety-minute music video. The second film in the series also seemed to take itself rather too seriously, indulging in cringeworthy 'romantic dialogue' and a soundtrack of vaguely ethnic wailing, whereas Abrams manages to bring to this film a definite sense of fun, sometimes verging on the ridiculous. That said, there is a darker edge to this - Phillip Seymour Hoffman provides the sleaziest of baddies, with a penchant for the old trick of planting explosive capsules in his enemies' brains. Most importantly, MI:3 offers an engaging story to go with the stunts and glamorous locations, and while it may not be up to the standard of great spy films, it is thoroughly engaging and enjoyable."

It is a summer blockbuster, afterall.<br/><br/>I, myself, am not a big fan of Tom Cruise the person, but I am a fan of Tom Cruise the actor. And he does a damn fine job as Ethan Hunt. Emotions, facial expressions, fast running and maneuvers are all there. Cool looks? There too. Him being shorter than all other actors? There.<br/><br/>While many of the action sequences are somewhat spoiled by the trailer, I found myself still secretly cheering for Ethan even though I knew what the outcome would be. For example, the movie starts out with the ending, then flashback to the story of how he got there. So I sort of know during certain action sequences who's going to 'win' or escape. But like I said, enjoy it for the intense action, because they are extreme, creative and different.<br/><br/>As far as J.J. Abrams is concerned, this was an impressive first big screen movie for him. You can tell slight similarities between MI3 and his shows like 'Lost' and 'Alias'. For example, the 'Lost' violin suspense music is here. If you're a fan of either show, then MI3 is definitely worth your while."

Though this image may have lost its power with us, the element of a countdown to an imminent explosion was used in the opening, pre-title sequence to a heart-stopping degree. You feel the desperation, you yourself are begging for a positive resolution, the villain with his finger on the trigger is focused enough to not even let up for one second. BAM. It's beautiful. And once again we are brought into the world of Ethan Hunt and the IMF. Without going on and on about the movie, the plot and the details, let me just say that this movie is absolutely THE action movie of the year if not from the past couple of years. I just want to address the non-team like story lines that we've had to deal with when it came to Ethan Hunt. I'm one of those kids raised on the TV series. The IMF were all about the TEAM with everyone having their own disguises, actions that seemed random then coming together as part of the plan all along, something going awry and the team having to tap dance until it comes together again... Then came the movies and it was the Ethan Hunt Show. Well, this movie brings back the complicated Team sequence. By far, the Vatican scene was highly enjoyable and genius. So many complicated twists and turns, it made my inner child tear up. Really good stuff. And one last thing that was pleasantly surprising. This movie is so subversively political in the subplot that it makes me squee.<br/><br/>Put aside your being sick of the overpromotion and the antics of the star. Bring your action-loving self to this movie, sit back and just let it take you. This movie is the best of the franchise and one of the best from the past few years.<br/><br/>Make it happen."
"Robert_duder","10","0","1","8 May 2006"," The best movie so far, of the year ladies and gents!!
","I anxiously awaited Mission Impossible 3 because even the hint of a good action film excites me. But after a great first installment and then a very disappointing second installment, I didn't know what to expect. For the first time possibly in film history not only did Cruise and Wagner (producers) redeem the series but they brought it full circle and made a film BETTER than it's original which was incredible on it's own. Mission Impossible 3 just might be one of the best action films ever made PERIOD!! Also making it one of the best sequels ever PERIOD!! I thought maybe all the bad Tom Cruise press might make it's way into my head and cloud my judgment on the film but I came out with even more respect for Cruise who despite a publicized and annoyingly hounded personal life is probably one of the top actors out there today. On top of that new director to the series and TV Veteran J.J. Abrams breathed incredible new life into this series, giving the characters depth, and emotion, and humor, and unbelievable kick butt action scenes.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns to his role as the sharper than nails Ethan Hunt. His droll and rather foolish days of MI:2 are behind him and the quick witted, fast moving Hunt of MI:1 returns in full force. Cruise is larger than life, always has been and Mission Impossible 3 proves exactly why. He's the most intense, and passionate action actor out there. Knowing he does all his own stunts and the look in his eyes in every scene...he's the definition of a leading man. Ving Rhames also returns in his capacity as Cruise's sidekick and tech man Luther Stickel. This time around Stickel and in fact Cruise's entire team have triple the personality and character that they had before. Stickel is used far better than ever before but still uses Hunt and Stickel's existing relationship. Rhames might not look the part but he fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast and even looks like he belongs beside Cruise. He's an integral part of the MI series. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a new member of the team playing Declan, the multi-talented spy who is almost a younger version of Hunt it would seem. Rhys Meyers is a great actor in his own right having had big roles in Match Point, and TV's Elvis. So he's a welcome addition to the cast and the team. I really hope he continues to come back (I'm assuming MI:4 is in the works...should be 2014 if the trend continues.) The Final new member of the team is quiet but limber Zhen played by Chinese action star Maggie Q. A small role bit significant enough to establish that together with Rhames and Meyers, this is the best team the MI series has ever had. I actually cared about the rest of the team. Although I just can't bring myself to connect him in the same league as Jon Voight and Anthony Hopkins...Laurence Fishburne plays the MI leader and the experience in the cast. Fishburne has an intensity unmatched and he brings that to Mission Impossible 3. Although he might not quite have the extreme pull of Hopkins or Voight he fits in nicely. Ethan's new wife and the love of his life Julia is played by the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. Although fairly new to being front and center of a film she does it perfectly and her and Cruise have incredible chemistry and you actually care about the two of them together. I think she has a promising career ahead of her as a leading lady. Finally despite her very small role I have to mention Felicity herself Keri Russell. She's always been hot but wow...you gotta go see this movie just to watch Felicity kick some serious ass!! The scene with her and Cruise escaping the warehouse is amazing and she is just awesome!! Her scenes end far too soon!! Now I have saved the best for last...the diabolical, incredibly twisted and evil...the best bad guy I have seen in YEARS on film....Owen Davian played by the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. On the heels of his Oscar winning role as Truman Capote he takes a completely different role in an action film and absolutely NAILS IT!! Hoffman is unbelievable!! He is a star and will remain a star especially knowing now he can flawlessly do action!! He is scary and disturbing and a great villain. He is the best adversary Ethan Hunt has had yet AND he absolutely flawlessly shares the screen with Tom Cruise!! Bravo to Hoffman!! <br/><br/>What else can I say about this film?? I teetered on the line between a 9 and a perfect score and I have to go 10/10 not because the film is truly perfect but because of the way I FEEL about it. It's the best time I've had at the movies in a LONG LONG time. As I said before Abrams absolutely breathed new life into this series. He created everything Mission Impossible should be. Incredible, beautiful settings, globe trotting spy action and some very different different scenes. I think a little bit of sarcasm and humor is integral to a good action film and I think the screenwriters ALMOST overdid it...almost...but it fit nicely and it was a breath of fresh air and well delivered. As with any action film a certain amount of belief suspension is required and there are some awkward moments when things were shot a little strangely but it never once takes away from the film. Non-stop action doesn't even begin to describe this film, one explosion after another, absolutely hair raising escapes, fights, kidnappings, everything!!! A beautiful romance that is actually legitimately interesting and fun to watch, and with great actors. MI:3 is quiet simply incredible and you need to see the whole series but you HAVE to see the third installment!! Absolutely action classic!! 10/10"

","Did you know that Tom Cruise can run? He can. Did you know that he can smile? He does. Have you ever seen him get angry? Look no further!<br/><br/>Has there ever been a less versatile actor with more success? No matter. He knows his strengths and plays to them, and he's never been caught brooding or Oscar-baiting.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible is even less a stab at immortality than most blockbusters. The formula is even baked into the title. Odd that it took three movies for them to follow it! The third time may not quite charm, but it gives us what we want from this sort of movie: flirtation with danger, exhibition of stealth, playful sophistication. You know, stunts and gadgets and dress-up.<br/><br/>While never transcending genre, M:I3 is almost entirely content to be what it is so long as it can be Alias! But J.J. & co. steal from themselves admirably. The only real misstep is a political monologue by the villain; such topical boilerplate pulls us out of what is fundamentally a fantasy, and demonstrates the filmmakers' disregard for their own material. Save the preaching, guys; audiences'll draw their own conclusions anyway.<br/><br/>I do wish they'd kept the theft to the script, though. The biggest problem with the movie is that it's shot like TV. Tight close-ups, few masters. There's a couple of great set pieces, but they don't get the scale they deserve, and so aren't as impressive or as intense as they should be, because of the way they're shot. Well, it won't lose much on video.<br/><br/>Welcome to the big-screen, Mr. Abrams. May you make movies as great as the first 1 1/2 seasons of Alias and the pilot of Lost."
"werewolf966","6","0","2","8 May 2006"," Utterly cliché but watchable
","In my opinion you can't expect unexpected originality from movies like MI:3.Because the events that might occur in these kind of movies are more-or-less obvious.There is a hero and a world waited to be saved. And mostly it is not probable that hero will fail.I watched MI:3 with this feelings but I didn't expect this kind of ordinariness from this movie.Plot is a parade of clichés.An agent who finds love and wants to settle down ,a wife who doesn't know anything about her husbands profession , a mole who is leaking information out of top secret organization , a bad guy who starts a personal vendetta against the hero.There is even goofy brother-in-law and a sarcastic scientist.I expect much more from J.J Abrams because of the originality and quality of his TV-series Lost.But despite of its ordinariness I didn't get bored while I was watching it thanks to good acting,top of the line visual effects,thunderingly sound effects and historical and exotic places like Vatican and China.<br/><br/>From my point of view the cast MI:3 can compete with the first MI and of course better than the second MI.Tom Cruise successfully did what he had been doing since the beginning of the MI series.He runs , jumps, evades , shoots , kills and cries. Philip Seymour Hoffman draws a good bad man portrait with his calm attitudes and charismatic voice. Maggie Q -despite her lack of experience- makes the scenes more colorful with her elegance.Yet another good performance from Jonathan Rhys Meyers who can be seen in the Woody Allen movie Match Point.Laurence Fishburne,Billy Crudup and Ving Rhames are all performed a steady performance that improves movies watch-ability.But I didn't like the performances of Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan. In my opinion Keri Russell doesn't fit the role and Michelle Monaghan simply acts bad.<br/><br/>In conclusion , From my point of view MI:3 is not a good movie as it should be.Because the cast and the creative brain behind this project is well above the average Hollywood production has.But watching MI:3 is like watching the home-video of your childhood.You know what is going to be next but this can't hold you back from watching it."
"Bleeding","7","0","1","8 May 2006"," A real good action movie
","My expectations were low when I heared that there will be another sequel to Mission Impossible. The overdrawn action sequences, the flat and uninspired story from MI:2 were still in my head. Yes, the action was spectacular to , indeed. And the movie was still great to watch. But it was far beyond a real good action movie, like Face/Off and so many others has been. It was a B-Agent-Movie with the budget of a Blockbuster. So, what to expect from MI:3? More action, more overdrawings, more stupid story lines, more plot holes. As always in sequels. But wait ... there was an article in a newspaper that said ""MI:3 is the best of the series"" ... can it be? Yes, it can. MI:3 is just great. It's full of new ideas, full of fresh action, full of nice twists and ... it's full of P.S. Hoffmann. What a great actor! What a great role for him! He is not much more than a supporting actor, and he doesn't has to say more than maybe 10 lines. But still he's the heart of this movie, he beats Cruise and the other cast easily with his small role. That said, it's still an action movie. Not more, but also not less. The first part of the movie is a real thrill ride, the action scenes are hilarious and the mutli-channel sound effects might be the best I've ever heared in a movie. Dolby Digital at it's best. And Hoffmann adds some theatrical elements to this movie, and this is real good. While the movie loses more and more energy and thrill as it comes to the end, and while there are unfortunately more and more rather overdrawed (in some scenes the audience laughes out loud where it was meant dramatic) action scenes - it never comes down to a point where it's getting boring. Yes, it's maybe 20 or 30 minutes too long. And some other things explained before make this movie far from perfect. But anyway - it's a simple action movie, so if you don't expect more, you will get 130 minutes of thrill and fun. Highly recommended!"
"stevetseitz","7","0","2","8 May 2006"," Gritty realism replaces slick set-pieces
","Our favorite IMF agent Ethan Hunt is back and the suspense never lets up in this second installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series. Why second you say? Because I would prefer to forget the atrocious second installment. It's dead to me. We may never forgive you, Woo.<br/><br/>This series is really the new James Bond. The real Bond series became a bloated self-parody years ago when the comical Roger Moore took the character in that direction. The ""Mission: Impossible"" series is equally implausible but at least takes itself seriously.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is the impossibly competent agent who can keep his cool under all circumstances and double-cross the double crossers. Cruise gives Hunt an energy and fire that make him a compelling and likable character. But unlike the first installment when he was always a step ahead of his nemesis, here Hunt starts out behind the eight ball.<br/><br/>To continue the Bond analogy, this episode of Mission: Impossible reminds me of ""From Russia with Love"". In that classic ""Connery"" Bond, our hero is constantly being out-smarted and beaten up by the bad boys of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. until he finally uses his wits and talents to pull out the win.<br/><br/>In the first ""Mission: Impossible"", Hunt is set-up and manages to cleverly manipulate his knowledge of the system to expose the true mole, redeem himself and ride off into the sunset.<br/><br/>This film is a different story. From the start the rules have changed. Hunt is certainly not in control. He is reacting the best he can to variety of difficult challenges. (Some could be described as ""impossible"".) Philip Seymour Hoffman proves, once again, that he is an extraordinary actor by making us hate his evil character with every fiber of our being. The other characters seem one dimensional except for Ving Rhames warm and decent Luther character. The action is non stop and the action scenes are paced quickly and chaotic in the style of modern action films. Gone are DePalma's smooth and slickly packaged set-pieces but a gritty realism is in it's place. Except for a few moments of much needed humor, this film is bleak and unromantic in it's portrayal of the life of a top agent like Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this film if you are a fan of the first movie."
"conan35","8","0","1","8 May 2006"," M:I:3 the best yet!
","This was the best of the franchise. If J.J.Abrams stay on board, this could rival the Bond franchise! Cruise is a super spy, we need to see him do this kind of action more often. I wish we could see more of Ving Rhames, he has a present on the big screen, that you can not ignore. Also it was good to see the big man as the tech expert and not the muscle. Owen Davian, (Philip S.Hoffman), is a villain you love to hate. The talk between Owen and Ethan on the plane was awesome! He needs to be in M:I:4. Musgrave, (Billy Crudup), made for a very good plot twist. The trusted friend turned bad ... as pointed out by Ethan to Julia, how important trust is to him. Another fun part is when Ethan is explaining to Julia about using a gun ... ""it's just point & shoot"" To bad Keri Russell is dead, she was interesting as an agent of IMF. Another character that needs to come back is the tech guy, who helps Ethan find his wife via the cell phone."

","For those who follow Ethen Hunts sagas or just want a good action movie go ahead and see this its a good movie. But having said that I sat down and thought about it after i watched it and i came to the conclusion that it has a very weak plot line with a semi-unfinished ending, the Bond like gadgets are awesome but when they are all linked together by a couple things the movie just seems lacking. I believe that the first movie is by far the best, the second was meh, the third better then the second (but thats not saying much). Big explosions, okay acting, and Tom Cruise (that crazy, couch jumping maniac) make for a enjoyable film but definitely not an Oscar candidate."

","This is an excellent well rounded production that keeps you very interested from beginning to end. I was very impressed with the creativity involved in this production, not only in the action sequences and story line, but also in the unique gadgets and gizmos used by the secret agent team.<br/><br/>Honestly, I am not a big fan of the MI movies, or for Tom Cruise for that matter, but this movie is undoubtedly amongst the best that Hollywood has put out recently. I seriously can not find one flaw in this movie; the production quality is rich and sleek, and it keeps you highly entertained from beginning to end. The plot is not the most elaborate, but it is an ideal foundation for the rapid, ongoing dialogue of intense action and dramatic special effects sequences that carry you briskly from the begging to the very end of this exciting journey.<br/><br/>Despite my lack of enthusiasm for him, Tom Cruise maintains a very believable character that you can really root for. The plot provides just the right amount of emotional substance, but not so much that it weighs down the movie even in the slightest.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to see this movie, you wont regret it!"

","Given the amount of time and money given to make Lost, its no longer such a stretch for a TV director to make a multi million dollar film.<br/><br/>Once the lightweight plot framework is in place, the film takes off. By the first twenty minutes, the film had already eclipsed its prequels. The action scenes make sense, the pace is unrelenting and its all very noisy. Hoffman is, of course, vile and Simon Pegg is, of course, geeky. In fact the action scenes carry real menace and not a little brutality.<br/><br/>Cruise is his normal gnomic self. While anyone could carry out the hero role, Cruise does not offend. Like the Rabbits foot he is silly prop that you need to keep the film rolling. Roll on number 4."
"smoothstevens","8","0","1","7 May 2006"," Best M:I film by far!
","I must say that I was seriously impressed with this movie; it improves on its predecessor in every area.<br/><br/>The film grabs hold of you in the unexpectedly brutal first scene; I found myself sweating and the it had only been running for around 3 minutes! You are then taken on a relentless roller-coaster ride for the best part of two hours. And what a great two hours they were.<br/><br/>I simply went to see this film to escape and be entertained, and I wasn't disappointed. Hiring JJ Abrams to direct this was a masterstroke; the man clearly understands what makes an audience tick. Unlike the previous M:I films, you start to understand Ethan Hunt's emotions and his private life, so that you actually start to care about what happens to him and those around him, unlike in M:I2, which just seemed to be a commercial for Tom Cruise's new hairstyle. There was a genuine sense of urgency and suspense which as been lacking from certain 'spy thrillers' in recent times.<br/><br/>Abrams really does hit the mark with the action sequences in this movie, which are brilliantly executed with an intensity not seen in the previous M:I films; they really do produce a lot of tension. The attack on the bridge stuck out in my mind as I just felt the sense of urgency and it really blew me away.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks in my opinion are the moments where Ethan Hunt is trying to show his emotions; you could tell that Tom Cruise was stretching his acting range, but he is to be commended for attempting to give the audience what they want.<br/><br/>Overall, I left the cinema hugely satisfied as M:I3 provides everything you could wish for in a movie from this genre. The mission to revitalise the series has been successful."
"etsm92","8","0","2","7 May 2006"," The best out of the series
","Mission: Impossible III/2006/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Tom Cruise Philip Seymour Hoffman Michelle Monaghan Laurence Fishburne<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams (Lost and Alias creator) takes the director's chair for M:I:III. Being a fan of Abrams to begin with (because of the great Lost series), I was even more of a fan after leaving the theater. Out of the three M:I films, this one is by far the best. Sure, this is just like any action film: shootings, explosions, edge-of-your-seat scenes... but this one has a little more wit to it. The second, which I own, was good and smart because of the imaginative masks and scenes to try to find out this plan. Yet this one obviously was more realistic than both the first and second and had more intense scenes and didn't have the stupid infra red clocks that signal that you have a certain amount of time to get outta there. This time they were white. You know what's old though? And what the movie still kept? It was when one person died when they could have lived. There was about three seconds left according to the white numbers and the person dies. I know it's not as bad as getting out just in time or dying at exactly one second left but they could have made it look a bit more realistic saying the person died at 33 seconds or something like that. But the movie overpowers the number complaint and continues to impress the audience with some pretty creative ways to trick security: taking a picture from the camera that's filming the grounds at an enormous castle. It's showing no one there so when Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is about to go in front of the camera he pastes the picture, showing no one on the grounds, on the camera, and turns the cameras back on so that security doesn't get suspicious, and walks in the castle dressed up like a priest. That's the first part of the mission which is taken place in Rome, Italy. I could have sworn I saw everyone inside the castle drinking Merlot. The evil plan/object is called the Rabbit's Foot which seems to be confusing at first because you don't know what it is. Ethan personally asks his boss, ""What is the Rabbit's Foot?"" It's secret. The Rabbit's Foot has some sort of radioactive sign on it. Will it ever be revealed? You'll find out. The movie doesn't only consist of the typical shootings and killings of an action film but, as I said before wit, AND some humor. But usually action films have humor anyway. The movie was loud and so was the soundtrack by great Italian composer Michael Giacchino (The Incredibles score). But the original main theme is by Lalo Schifrin. So the explosions made noise and gunshots were obnoxiously loud and the movie overall was exhausting but still very entertaining. The second destination was in Shanghai, China to basically receive the Rabbit's Foot and get hurt by swinging from buildings and get outta there in a CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME yet it all changes at the end. The thing I disagree with most in this series are the names of the films. They are called impossible missions and even the agency Ethan works for is called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) yet are they really impossible or are they just interpreted that way by the people? Who knows? First movie of this series was directed by the master of gore- Brian DE Palma. Second was directed by the master of slow motion- John Woo. And this one isn't a master yet since he hasn't become very popular. But I have confidence in Abrams; he's done well in his TV series' so he probably will be a master someday but nobody can be the master of suspense except for Alfred Hitchcock. Movie directed by J.J. Abrams."

","""Who are you? Do you have a wife? A girlfriend? Whoever she is, I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna hurt her. And then I'm going to kill you, right in front of her."" These lines, spoken by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) at the beginning of the trailer, gave plenty of people the creeps, suggesting J.J.Abrams, the man behind Alias (whose narrative structure is echoed here) and Lost, was the right choice to direct Mission:Impossible III (and this is his feature debut). Here we had what looked like an action flick where the talky bits are exactly as important as the explosions. The actual movie is everything fans hoped for, the best in the trilogy, an exciting adventure in which style and content are present in equal quantities.<br/><br/>Abrams makes the film more emotional than its predecessors, thanks to his choice to answer this question: what if you work for a top secret government agency (in this case, IMF), and your enemies decide to get at you through your unknowing loved ones? This situation caused Sidney Bristow, the protagonist of Alias, quite some trouble. And the same trouble is waiting for Ethan Hunt, who is once again dragged into action (this time, the self-destructing message is inside a camera). What seemed like an ordinary rescue mission (his former student, played by Keri Russell, has been kidnapped) becomes something much, much bigger, as Ethan and his team (veteran Ving Rhames and first-timers Maggie Q. and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, whose accent weirdly shifts from American to Cockney to Irish, depending on the section of the film) cross paths with the aforementioned Davian, a ruthless arms dealer who, after being arrested (his chilling ""do you have a wife?"" speech is pronounced during the interrogation), manages to escape, in the breathtaking Chesapeake Bay Bridge scene, and blackmails Hunt: if he can't find the Rabbit's Foot in 48 hours, his wife Julie (Michelle Monaghan) will die. Difficult times lie ahead...<br/><br/>From Berlin to Rome to Shanghai, M:I:III is an unstoppable race against the clock, spiced up by clever dialogue and layered, compelling characters. In fact, we get to take a proper look at the IMF headquarters and some of the important people who work there, particularly the strict, but hard-working boss (Laurence Fishburne), the reliable handler (Billy Crudup) and the hilarious tech adviser, played by the priceless Simon Pegg as the British version of Alias' Marshall Flinkman. And finally, a villain worth the definition. Hoffman already stole the show in the trailer, and he virtually dominates the whole film with controlled but frightening brutality. He's arguably the scariest and most interesting adversary Ethan hunt has ever faced.<br/><br/>With his feature debut, Abrams has successfully redeemed the M:I franchise, after John Woo's disappointing second installment, delivering an almost perfect picture (the movie goes a bit downhill during the last 20 minutes). He has brought the genre to the next level and the good news is, he's barely started."

I found that M:I-III is more like the first film because it got back to having real emotion and mixing great action scenes with an actual story. M:I-2 was basically a no brainer all action popcorn flick. Now, J.J. Abrams is no Brain De Palma, that's for sure, but he brings the general feel of the first film back.<br/><br/>There was something about Tom Cruise's performance in M:I-2 that made it not like the first film. He played the character differently. Mission: Impossible III brings back the Ethan Hunt I know. Of course, the great Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, and I was pleasantly surprised that he got a larger role in this film. Laurence Fishburn did a great job taking over for Anthony Hopkins from the second film.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible III is a great movie, and there wasn't too much I scoffed at. However, at times the dialogue is really corny because there's a love interest this time around.

At one point, I was rolling my eyes over it.<br/><br/>I was able to figure out who the villain was way before the person was exposed because of the choice of actors. One actor is portrayed as the villain, but I sensed it wasn't right because this actor is known (lately) for playing people with high integrity. The actual villain is an actor who is known for his lack of integrity in real life, so I immediately suspected him.<br/><br/>Jonathan-Rhys Meyers is still hot looking, but his character was too much like the cabbage/side salad that is put on my take-out pad thai -I know it's there, but I never eat it.<br/><br/>I still LOVE MII (except Thandie) and I think it's A LOT more visually interesting (great mix of slow/standard/fast motion) than this latest installment."

This leads the main character into a mission where he must save his wife, who has been kidnapped by the criminal mastermind, and save the world from the 'rabbit's foot' at the same time. The film grips the audience on the edge of the seats in some of the fast-paced action sequences. I was impressed, but that may be because I was not expecting much of a film. The film has plenty of action and different types of action to keep up the interest while producing a semi-decent storyline. It's not supposed to be a classic, but it is entertaining. The biggest problem that I had with the film is the romance/love story. It was (and the dialogue was) very silly and often predictable. I just wanted to fast-forward through those heart-wrenching and sickening moments and enjoy the action."

","What do you get when you put the team behind ""Lost"" and ""Alias"" in charge of a big budget movie with a good cast? A sequel that begs to be made into a TV series, that's what. What I liked was the casting and the action. What I didn't like needs more elaboration.<br/><br/>In short, the plot was like an episode of ""Lost"", more style than substance. It starts with a flashback, which by now has become an annoying tool in both the aforementioned series. Ends with a whimper and a cheesy goodbye. Areas where they could have added more action sequences, such as stealing multi-million dollar weapons, are truncated and unbelievable (You don't want to have everyone on high alert just before you steal something). And finally, for all who have watched the show, handling a flashlight does not a super action star make (i.e. Guns do have recoil).<br/><br/>Conclusion: It's all down to lazy scriptwriting. Some might call it technique or even thought-provoking but when you actively decide that key plot devices such as the weapon, the villain and his lackey need no description or history, I call it lazy. I do know that the movies are based on an old TV series, my idea is that they want to have another remake and this movie is the teaser. Wait for that because it may be better than the movie."

","I for one gave the movie a 10/10, in most part to outweigh the voters who are just bashing the movie because they dislike Tom Cruise. I do not agree with him in many respects, but found the film amazing.<br/><br/>But back to my topic. I'm not going to bore you with a play-by-play of the film as most other reviewers are, but instead touch on something a bit different: the theme song.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed in its lack of presentation, (there were some points of the film where it was severely lacking and could have been used perfectly) but I adored the use of drums to beat out the theme. It was an excellent spin on a well-worn sound that deserves to be on par with the themes from films like Indiana Jones and Star Wars (spawned from the mind of the great composer John Williams). I was just wondering if anyone else noticed the drum take on the theme instead of the familiar version. Liked it or loved it? Let me know.<br/><br/><3"

","Tom Cruise's latest adventure doesn't break any boundaries, nor does it create any new ones. But who actually gives a damn? 'Mission Impossible 3' is set to be this summer's major blockbuster (until 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2' sails its way onto our screens, at least) and there's absolutely no reason why the film shouldn't enjoy blockbuster success.<br/><br/>The brains behind the latest IMF instalment is J.J. Abrams, the creator of ever-popular American TV series' 'Lost' and 'Alias.' Although his directing fails to deliver in places, M:I-3 has all the hallmarks of a classic action adventure - high octane action, blistering special effects, and less plot than an Asda advertisement.<br/><br/>The film consists of four main action sequences, loosely strung together with the knowledge that our hero Ethan Hunt (a weak combination of James Bond and Jack Bauer) has to save his wife, Julia.<br/><br/>It's a crap excuse to see Tom Cruise run around trying to find, and eventually defeat, the latest villain, Owen Davian, played by the excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>A strong supporting cast helps solidify the non-existent plot line, whilst Cruise plays his character with more cheese than ever.<br/><br/>You can certainly match the similarities between J.J. Abrams 'Lost' and 'Alias', with even field agent code names matching that of 'Alias'.<br/><br/>Thrown in for good measure are visits to exotic locations, such as China and the Vatican in Rome, but at the end of the day it is good old fashioned action that stops Mission Impossible 3 from flopping."

","MI III just might be the greatest action movie ever made, its certainly the best Mission Impossible film by far. It has the best villain, story and stunts, actually the stunts and action are out of this world. Tom Cruise is on the top of his game and is ably supported by the rest of the IMF team, especially Ving Rhames who is as great as ever. The film grips you with the opening scene and never lets up, if I had one small complaint it would be that I would have liked a bit more humour, but there was some funny lines between Cruise and Rhames. If you are going to only see one blockbuster film this year....... go and see Superman Returns if you are going to see two go and see this!

","People expect far too much out of franchises such as 'Mission Impossible:' character development, intense family dilemmas  you name it. But from watching the first two, I am well aware that I'm going to be presented with a shallow, high-octane picture about a pint sized agent who has to save the world (oh, and also rescue a fine young lady). He does so with fine gadgets, a winning smile and a politically correct band of allies. Was I entertained? Yes. Completely. After watching emotionally draining films like 'Vera Drake' in recent years, I begin to wonder whether there is a place for chewing gum cinema. The plot is full of ""unbelievabilities"" (i.e. getting into the Vatican on a whim), but it is entertaining. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt returns not as an agent, but as an integral part of the IMF training programme. He is now the teacher, fitting into the mould of the wise old master, the cliché that Liam Neeson has perfected so well. He gave up his whirlwind lifestyle to be with the love of his life, his fiancée Julia. But, like all tough guys, he cannot resist one final mission. Soon enough, intrigue and espionage escalate it into a worldwide affair, with Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the malevolent WMD trader. Predictably, Julia is captured and Mr. Hunt has to recover the paragon of all destruction, the mystical 'Rabbit's Foot.' Turning in a relatively mature performance with a smidgeon of self-mocking, Tom Cruise makes this adventure utterly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Though I hate the latex masks and the stupid laptops that make a 'bring' sound every time someone hits 'Enter,' the action sequences are intense  epically intense. And that is the beauty of the cinema  to have jets screaming over your head at a volume that would otherwise infuriate your highly traditional neighbours. Brokeback Mountain, Vera Drake  they're not cinema films. This is. <br/><br/>Saving the world in 125 minutes isn't an easy feat, but for Mr. Cruise it's just another day at the office."

","Mission Impossible:3 was to me an absolutely savage treatment for any awe inspired, thrill seeking movie goer who would like nothing better than to be wowed on a Saturday night at the movies. <br/><br/>How Laurence Fishbourne from such amazing flicks as Apocalypse Now and even forgettable ones like King of New York could agree to be totally blindsided in such worthless crap blows my mind. How JJ Abrams who was so believable with Alias, could deliver such mindless agony is the real mission impossible..Cruise needs to disappear for a long long time. <br/><br/>The movie tries to submerge you below the 5th grade level. Halfway through the movie you can almost feel the desperation that your life may be running away from you as Cruise is running away in Shanghai. Yes Shanghai, you could almost pin it on JJ Abrams thinking this is Alias the movie instead of MI:3, but how a bunch of caucasion supermen blow up buildings and each other in Shanghai without a single Chinese character having anything to say about it was beyond even the mass Chinese audience in the theater.<br/><br/>And never mind all that nasty stuff about the bunny foot in the vase..thats right we got that one!! The editing was hopeless, the acting soul crushing, there was no music, no sex either, no sweeping vistas, the camera shook every second of every action scene such that we completely understood nothing. The movie was boring and witless apart from a couple of phrases by Huffman and Rhames.. Dialogue delivery involved speaking into headsets and cellphones or the robotic chatter of video game consoles. <br/><br/>If anything the movie ended abruptly in 2 hours and for that I'm thankful. We didn't really understand anything..We supposedly were in Berlin, Rome, some really long bridge in the states and Shanghai but for all that it mattered it could have been the moon such was the attention paid to detail or a lack thereof..<br/><br/>Save your money and go rent any other movie than this one and you may still be able to forgive yourself."

","Mission Impossible 3 is a good movie, in part because Mission Impossible 2 was not and in part because nothing else was there during its opening week. Lowered expectations do help enjoy a movie! For the action junkies, such as my friend with whom I viewed this movie, this latest Mission Impossible movie does provide continuous action and repeated team action. <br/><br/>Regarding the domestication of Ethan Hunt, this does not add to the movie, but more importantly it does not detract from the movie. That said given his responses to his professional life crashing into his domestic life, it really should not be a part of the movie. M:I:III flows better than M:I:II, it does not over do Tom Cruise, although there are moments in the movie that can best be described as a Tom Cruise product placement.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is a good enough reason to view the movie, except that there is just not enough of him in the movie. Laurence Fishburne in this movie is great, again there could have been more of him. His work here offers the imagination some food for thought as to what could he do with the role of M in a James Bond movie, or something in the spirit of Harry Palmer from The Ipcress File.<br/><br/>With all due respect to Tom Cruise's amazing achievements, he was on to something with keeping his private life private as we could have done without his parading his newborn and mother to sell this latest movie of his. I mention this as I almost did not go see the movie for that reason alone, suspecting that this type of movie promotion was an indication of somebody trying to cover up a lousy movie. And to top that off I went on the opening weekend, something I was nervous about, but given the restaurant in the city we survived earlier that day, M:I:III did not seem that great a risk.<br/><br/>Oddly with all the action going on, the middle of the movie was slow and could have shed at least ten or maybe even twenty minutes from the movie's duration. Hey, checking one's watch in the middle of the movie is not a good sign. Still, grab some popcorn and be entertained, this movie is worth seeing in the theater, although best as a matinée!"

So perfect, in fact, that there's nothing more to say.<br/><br/>Draw-you-in-ness: Also superb - towards the end of the movie I found myself almost throwing Ethan's punches. Cruise captures the character far better than he did in M:i:II, and the villain is chillingly portrayed as pure unadulterated evil.<br/><br/>Suspense: Only in the last few minutes will you finally be able to figure out where everyone's loyalties lie. Every scene throws a new shocker at you, and you'll find yourself wondering which way to turn.<br/><br/>Effects: Things are supposed to blow up in M:i movies, and you won't be disappointed. The effects are nothing special, but when things blow up it looks realistic.<br/><br/>The only reason this doesn't get a 10 from me is the totally extraneous and unnecessary political shot fired in one scene, and the somewhat formula plot. Still absolutely superb, and worth every penny - as long as you don't miss a second of it. If you do, catching up simply isn't happening."

","I just returned home from the theater and I have to say that I was impressed with the film but I think that it could have been a lot better. There were many ""coincidences"" that really took away from the overall effect of the film. For example, Hunts girlfriend being a Nurse, Ending up in the hospital in China and needed a defibrillator to fry the explosive chip in his brain. That whole series of events took away from the originality of the ""chip-in-the-brain"" idea. Also, it seemed that the originality of the writing fell short of the previous two films. I felt like the writers were pulling many elements (Like equipment and ""moves"") from the previous two films without coming up with new and inventive ideas. It seemed to me that the ""Inside guy"" was VERY VERY predictable. On the plus side, I think that the casting of this film was perfect. Tom Cruise (whether you like him or not) is perfect for these roles, Hoffman was THE PERFECT villain, and Fishburne played an excellent part. Overall, this will fit well into the MI franchise, but it does not live up to it predecessors. Mission Impossible was defiantly the best in this series. I recommend that you see this in the theaters - you will not be able to appreciate this films special effects and action sequences without the big screen atmosphere."

Even Tom Cruise wasn't that bad, and I wasn't even Bo Jangled. Hoffman is the man. He is a great actor obviously relishing in the chance to be someone totally devoid of emotion. The only sense of emotion he shows is beating the cosbies out of Cruise. As for Ving and the other two, I think they could have been used better but the scenes they were in were cool, especially the Irish neddy. Well like I said it was OK and completely forgotten.

So, my wife and I went.<br/><br/>Even though some of the stunts were the 'over the top' variety that we've come to expect from these movies, it was scaled back a bit and actually contributed to the story!

So, Ethan's back and his team is doing more impossible things yet again!<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Thomas plays a perfect bad guy that has absolutely NO conscience about him and cares not one bit for those near him. He's ruthless and calculating and smart. He could have played his character with reckless abandon, but he played him more sinister and dark. This made him all the more scary! <br/><br/>Just like the other two films, expect a twist! I'll not say what, but given the past history of the other two, I saw it coming almost from the start!

","From the opening frame this movie is an adrenaline rush, the perfect film to open the blockbuster season. Tom Cruise, backed by solid talent, returns as super-spy Ethan Hunt in the best entry in the franchise since he was hanging on the roof of a speeding-bullet train. With the creator of ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" at the helm, we are back in the backstabbing world of intelligence and espionage.<br/><br/>The movie plays largely like ""Alias,"" with Jennifer Garner switched out for Tom Cruise, and Ron Rifkin exchanged for Philip Seymour Hoffman. And while the drama has been cut down to fit into a two-hour action flick, the human element J.J. Abrams is so handy with is still present.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has now gone into semi-retirement, training others to become members of Impossible Mission Force. He is engaged to a lovely nurse (Michelle Monaghan), and all her friends and relatives couldn't be more happy to see her finally settling down with a man who seems to be the perfect guy. But the night of his engagement party Hunt is contacted by his handler, Musgrove (Billy Crudup, at his most subtle). Apparently a former protégé of Ethan's (Keri Russell) has disappeared while following a mysterious weapons dealer, Owen Davian (Hoffman). Hunt predictably accepts the mission, and reunites with likable hacker Luther Stickell, as well as two new recruits (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q).<br/><br/>I was surprised and disappointed with myself after watching. I believe I'm actually starting to let the media and gossip go to my head about Tom Cruise. Yeah, I won't deny he's a little cuckoo, but he's still a good actor, and to let that get in the way of enjoying the movie is just pathetic.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames, as Luther, has been promoted to full buddy/partner status. On top of keeping the junior agents in order, he remains something of a straight-man to Cruise's increasingly volatile agent. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of those villains that are just so bad that it actually becomes fun to watch them kick the hero's ass, because you know he'll get his comeuppance in the end, but he could have used a little more screen time. And some of the best one-liners were distributed quite evenly between Simon ""Shaun of the Dead"" Pegg as a British version of ""Alias""'s Marshall Flinkman, and Laurence Fishburne as the head of IMF. ""Well I don't think it's fair that chocolate makes you fat, but I ate my share and, well..."" You can always trust that Cruise will make it through, but the fun comes from watching the rest of the cast act around him, especially Rhames, Hoffman, Fishburne, and Pegg. Scientology aside, it's two quick hours that I was happy to give up."

","First of all let me begin by saying that, generally speaking, I have noticed that a series of films gets progressively worse as each film attempts to live up to the expectations of the first. There are of course many anomalies to this 'general' rule and this film is a perfect example. From the very first scene to the last (well not quite the last as the ending is maybe a little weak) the film delivers the non-stop action that is expected of it.<br/><br/>The storyline was quite thin and stretched. There were some trademark twists and turns but again these are now expected and so loose some of their punch. The acting far surpasses the cheesy-ness of the second and Hoffman plays a great villain though I felt he could have had more screen time.<br/><br/>One or two minor plot holes involving the hero/villain stance of one or two characters but other then that the story is followable, if a little thin. My main 'thing' with this film (bear in mind this has little to do with the success of the film) was that Michelle Monaghan looked too much like Katie Holmes which I thought (considering its tom cruise) was too weird to be a coincidence.<br/><br/>In the general the film is great. It's full of mind blowing action scenes, gadgets, cars, guns and even Vatican City! The film seems more 'real' then the second and is definitely worthy of proceeding the first Mission Impossible.....Oh yeah and there's less of those cheesy love scenes that made the second annoying."

The beginning and ending action sequences are somewhat blah, while the middle is chock full of fun and exciting scenes, especially the infiltration of the Vatican.

With M:I 3 being his movie directorial debut, he did it, but it seems that Cruise has lost his charm compared to the previous 2 M:I franchise.<br/><br/>When Cruise makes the plot of M:I 3 secretive, it makes the audience worth the 6 years wait for the most explosive, most thrilling and most exciting than the previous 2 M:I franchise. This time round, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) takes on a mission to retrieve Rabbit's Foot, a bio-toxin chemical from Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a fire-arm dealer, from selling the chemical to the terrorist. At the same time, he has to hide his identity from Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his wife. The plot is as simple as that.<br/><br/>But as expected, the presentation is not that simple. Hunt has his team mates: Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (HK's Maggie Q) to help him in stopping Davian from selling the chemical by kidnapping him. As for how it goes, see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Abrams proves that he is no rookie when it comes to directing a movie, especially he was given the heavy task of upholding the reputation of M:I franchise. With the top grade scorecard from Alias and Lost, Abrams brings what is needed to bring excitement and thrill to the audience. He injects tonnes of explosive actions, cross fire, betrayal and stunts into the movie. Expect the exchange of fires between helicopters and shootings on the bridge in Rome, US and Shanghai. While the previous 2 M:I features Europe and US as part of the setting, Abrams and Cruise decided to add in a touch of Asia: Shanghai. This explains why you get to see Cruise throwing himself down from Bank of China in Shanghai in his mission.<br/><br/>While Abrams might have do a good job in directing, Cruise has show signs of fatigue in M:I 3. You will still get hot actions from Cruise, thought he might have signs of fatigue written on his body. To reward the audience for the 6 years wait of the new M:I franchise, Cruise takes the risk to perform the stunts himself.<br/><br/>Acdamy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman takes the role of Davian, the villain in M:I 3, after his memorable and remarkable role of Truman Capote in Capote. A great difference from his gay, fey and voice with some childishness, Hoffman turns into a fierce, ruthless and evil Davian, who vows to make sure that anyone who is nasty to him will die the same way on how he was treated. Hoffman did it, and he will now be remembered as evil Davian apart from the fey Capote.<br/><br/>Maggie Q adds a touch of Asia to M:I 3, where she plays Zhen, a teammate in the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). She proves to be a hot babe with capabilities, but not a femme fatale. But given her young experience in the film industry, she proves that she can do it. Her name appears on the next Asian in a mission squad, after Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies and Adrian Pang, a Singapore actor who was seen in Tony Scott's Spy Game, playing a doctor with Brad Pitt in a rescue mission.<br/><br/>Laurence Fishburne appears more on a special appearance basis rather than a supporting actor, with him playing John Brassel Theodore, one of Ehtna's superior. Somehow, if he was given more appearance in the film, it would be useful to explain some of the unanswered questions in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, some fared well while some seems to have failed the audience in the new series of M:I. This leads me to the possible creation of the next M:I franchise. If Cruise can prove that the box office and the review speaks for itself, then he is on his way to create the next M:I franchise."

Ethan tries to foil Davian's plan, though Davian throws a wild card, kidnapping Julia and will kill her if Ethan doesn't bring The Rabbits Foot to him.<br/><br/>The first Mission: Impossible was an entertain espionage thriller.

The action runs at a constant pace and done of a high caliber; while location jumping around the world. The stand out side of Mission: Impossible 3 is bringing Ethan is reality; trying to hold a relationship while hiding his true profession, and drawing out a fallible side. He isn't as enigmatic as from the previous two films. Though no back story is shown, he's more dimensional and easier to grasp to. Ultimately this development is only a small part of what essentially is an action flick.<br/><br/>Reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise walks through the numbers, yet does it so well, bringing lots of energy to Ethan. Also reprising his role as Luther, Ving Rhames is good company. Mosty know from the show Felicity; also created by Abrams, Keri Russell takes great stead leaping to the action genre. Simon Pegg, Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne don't really bring that much to the table, showing below average performances. Also jumping from the other side of the spectrum; from iconic literate to menacing villain, Philip Seymour Hoffman has fun with his role, yet could have gone all that much further, he's not disturbing for a villain.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 3 is basically is a highly crafted, action film. It doesn't ask for much, except to deliver and highly entertaining film; which it delivers in spades."

The movie has no less than five really exciting action sequences (especially ""the Vatican"" and ""the bridge"" are awesome fun) and a great cast (especially Hoffmann and the delicious Maggie Q). It isn't always logical or realistic but keeps you on the edge of your seat with its very emotional and exciting pace.

Finally there is an action movie which gives the audience what it has so long been waiting for. <br/><br/>BTW Does anybody know what music was played in the party sequence at the beginning.<br/><br/>They had the wedding announcement party.

","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to suspend credibility and just enjoy the ride. It might help if you had previously had a minor explosion in your brain, perhaps utilising a miniature version of a device twice blown up the noses of Impossible Missions Force agents in ""M:i 2"". The opening is cracking and totally attention-grabbing and the action jumps from Berlin to Rome to Shanghai with plenty of thrills and spills, although the narrative is banal when it is not confusing and the ending is limp.<br/><br/>Directed and partly written by J J Abrams (who has given us such fun and fascination in the television series ""Lost""), there's nothing really new here and at times it's rather bewildering (indeed we never find out what the ""rabbit's foot"" is and why anyone would want to die for it) but, as the first summer blockbuster of 2006, it's going to win a decent return on its investment.<br/><br/>As agent Ethan Hawke, Tom Cruise still looks good in the part, a decade after he first made it his own, and hopefully this movie will remind his fans that there is more to the man than mad protestations of love and weird views inspired by Scientology. If he can learn to keep his mouth shut off-screen and pick more roles like ""Magnolia"" and ""Collateral"", he still has a future."
"bloria55","7","0","2","5 May 2006"," Not in the M:I spirit
","I want to start off by saying M:i-III is a good movie. It has all the fundamental elements of an action movie (hateable villain, worldly threat, natural hero). Also, the casting was well-picked, and none of the acting took away from the film. With that said, the main problem I have with this sequel is that it is not in the Mission Impossible spirit. Its focus is entirely on Ethan Hunt's relationship with his girlfriend, and not on the mission as in the past movies in the series. Also, the plot lacks involvement in Davian's actual plans for the 'Rabbit's Foot'. Ethan Hunt's character is retired, which accounts for his obvious lack of skill he had in the first 2 M:Is, but it does get tiresome after a while. Ethan Hunt was once always in control of his surroundings, and is not in control in any situation in this movie. My main point is illustrated by saying that when the end credits come up on the screen and the classic M:I theme starts to play, it just does not seem to fit. This movie is successful on its own, despite the bland cinematography by the relatively new director, but I do not think it belongs as a sequel to Mission:Impossible or M:i-2. I do recommend seeing M:i-III, but do not expect a continuation of the past 2 themes."

","After the outstanding first film in the series - followed by the dire second instalment (just ""Woo"" it?? Not on that occasion - just RUE it more like), this third movie ROCKS! From an alarmingly uncomfortable opening sequence, to some spectacular yet convincing action sequences (won't spoil it but I've GOT to get a fighter jet like that) to beautiful and stylish locations and people (Maggie Q?? Which planet was she born on? Planet Hot-damn-I-can't-catch my breath??), to welcome and familiar faces and clever little nods to the previous flicks - It's got it all. Including Simon Pegg and if you don't know who he is - just watch Shaun of the Dead. You won't forget him in a hurry. Naturally, it carries weight from Stellar Stars like Laurence (I'm so rich from the Matrix Trilogy I MAY get out of bed today) Fishburne; to the ALWAYS eminently watchable Mr Ving Rhames who on this outing has a much greater role - and the movie is all the better for it. As for Mr C - somebody should tell him he needs to share his energy with some unfortunates in the Sudan. He could light the way for Bedouin Tribesman for a year! He always gives 200% - and it shows in his Projects. <br/><br/>Sure it's got some flaws but in all honesty, the man - and his colleagues - really are at the top of their game. To be a leader in the industry for a year is a major achievement; but to be a global leader for THREE decades is an unprecedented achievement! Brilliant. Top class. Celluloid Platinum. Long live the King."

"moviefan1725-1","7","0","1","5 May 2006"," The best Mission yet...but still lacking greatness
","All of the Mission: Impossible movies have been entertaining in their own ways, but none of them has amounted to a great, MUST SEE movie. Brian DePalma's original was an overly intricate head scratcher that pretty much crapped upon everything the television series established. After all, taking the iconic hero of the series and making him the villain of the movie is about as insulting the source material as you can get. Nonetheless it contained two great scenes...Cruise's dangling theft of the secret list, and the final helicopter/train sequence at the end. John Woo's follow up was an overly stylish ballet that focused way too heavily on Woo's obsession with slow motion. A more straightforward plot got drawn out by Woo's ""look how pretty my action sequences are"" style of directing. Now J.J. Abrams takes his ""Alias"" show and replaces Jennifer Garner with Tom Cruise. The result is curious mix of ""Alias"", ""James Bond"", and ""24"". A lot of action, and plot that is as bare bones as you can get. In fact, the item that is the macguffin of this whole thing, something called ""The Rabbit's Foot"" is never even explained. It's basic good guy vs. bad guy with the item itself being insignificant. Tom Cruise is basically on auto-pilot here. In fact in this movie he's more ""Tom Cruise"" than ""Ethan Hunt"". With many close ups of Cruise's mug, his eyes shrink wrapped in tears, I kept waiting for him to jump on a couch and say how incredible Katie Holmes is. Is it a coincidence that his wife in the film is played by Michelle Monaghan, an actress that bears a striking resemblance to Katie? I think not. Ving Rhames returns in his thankless walk on role. Laurence Fishburne continues to pack on the pounds and gives another NyQuil induced performance, much like he was in the last two Matrix movies. Phillip Seymore Hoffman is the main bad guy, and while he chews the scenery well in a couple of scenes, never really comes off THAT menacing. One of the better performances in the movie is by the gorgeous Keri Russell. She makes a meal out of her role as Cruise's one time protégée, but unfortunately she isn't in the movie long enough. Another standout in the film is from ""Shaun Of The Dead"" star Simon Pegg, as the equivalent of Q from the Bond films. He's quick, funny, and instantly likable. There is more action this time around, but unfortunately, director Abrams doesn't believe in keeping the camera in the same space for more than two seconds. The camera NEVER stops moving. During some of the most intense action scenes in fact, the camera shakes so bad, you'd think it was sitting on top of a blender. Michael Bay's cameras don't move this much. But action there is. Gunfights-a-plenty, car chases, and a bridge attack that is thrilling, but unfortunately lifted almost directly from ""True Lies"", a far superior spy movie. Now with all this, I know it sounds like I hated the movie. I didn't. I, in fact, enjoyed this more than the first two Mission's. But it's just that there's nothing spectacular about them. The presence of Tom Cruise seems to make people think that there will be something here that hasn't been seen before. But we have seen it before. It's big, fast, loud, and by the numbers. And I think Tom Cruise's recent public meltdowns, and increasingly bizarre behavior will keep many people away. And those that do go, may realize that without his hype, Tom Cruise is just another actor, and M:I 3 is just another in one end, out the other action movie."
"Wheezer-1","10","0","1","5 May 2006"," JJ Abrams big screen debut is a mission thats surely irresistible
","Let me start off by saying that its a real shame that a ton of people are going to do to this movie exactly what a ton did to last years ""War of the Worlds"" by simply A.) not seeing it because it has Tom Cruise or B.) not liking it simply because it has Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>So hes different than you. Get over it. No one who actually knows him thinks hes psycho. Just because People magazine tells you he is doesn't mean so.<br/><br/>Now that thats out of the way...<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect way to start of the summer movie season. JJ Abrams has proved himself time and time again on the television screen and he doesn't miss hitting the mark on his big screen debut. He made an excellent choice by diving deeper into Ethan Hunt's character, and an even better choice by having Hoffman play the main villain. Its absolutely amazing to watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman play this otherwise one dimensional role. Most actors would take his character and just make it mediocre but Hoffman adds such sadistic depth and nonchalant wickedness to it. He is by far one of the best actors in the world.<br/><br/>Cruise hits his usual mark. Underrated definitely but rarely excels to greatness. All the other cast members work incredible well to create the best set of side characters seen in the Mission Impossible series.<br/><br/>MI III is far better that 2, and I enjoyed it better that the first one. If people want to have a terrific time this weekend they should go see it and forget that they dislike Cruise. Sure he may be getting bad publicity right now but hey, there are a whole hell of a lot of worse actors and actresses out there that deserve to be boycotted."

From the opening scene this film kept me enthralled, it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was intense, it was fast - it was action packed and it is easily the best in the trilogy. Tom Cruise is on his A-game, his character Ethan Hunt has been given another dimension in this instalment and the rest of the cast is enjoyable too. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the films villain was a bizarre but effective choice. He really is an unfeeling bastard, a creep that really gets under your skin.<br/><br/>The plot is nicely crafted, with some neat twists and turns and the actions scenes are excellent which is everything you want out of a film like this. You won't catch me making any snide remarks about Cruise or this movie because it really was good. Dare say the creative minds in Hollywood are going to be hard-pressed to top this, because this is the best action movie of the year thus far. I was very impressed."
"ajr4300","10","0","1","5 May 2006"," Best kick off to a summer movie season in recent memory!
","I just got back from viewing quite possibly one of the better action/romantic/thrillers in a long-while. Needless to say, MI3 delivers in all ways that movie can. The acting was great and so was the casting. I could not see these actors being played by anyone else. The plot was good and not too hard to follow unlike the first Mission Impossible. As much crap as people give Tom Cruise for whatever reason, be it his couch-jumping antics or his choice in religion, it is really irrelevant because he truly is an amazing actor that can pull of so many different types of movies. Mission 3 is a combo of sorts in that involves elements of romance. The beginning scene sets the tone for the whole movie and that tone can be said in one word: gritty. I was not the only person in the theater to be shocked at Phillip Seymour's brilliant turn as Owen Davian, an arms dealer, who threatens to shoot Hunt's wife in the head unless Hunt tells him what he wants to know. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has set the bar high as it comes to future actors portraying crazy arm-dealing megalomaniacal villains. Tom Cruise is well, Tom Cruise and I cannot thank him enough for really completing the movie experience. He really makes a blockbuster as far as I am concerned. The supporting cast is stellar too. Kudos to Billy Crudup for his role as Ethan's friend and boss. Maggie Q and John Rhys Meyers are excellent as well. Ving Rhames is put to good use in Mission 3 unlike previous missions and I thank JJ Abrams for that. i'd also like to thank JJ for his brilliant eye, because the he gave us one of the best action sequences (the bridge assault) in the last ten years. Not to be outdone, the Shanghai/bungee/parachute stunt will blow you away. Out of all the MI, I can easily say that this one is the best. The music is great, the locations are great and more importantly the plot is coherent. Great Summer Popcorn Movie: 9/10"

But i really like this one, Laurence Fishburne was great and he could be an interesting character to bring to the fourth. there was a lot of action in this, and it wasn't mindlessly violent either, every scene of action (which there were a lot of) had something important to do with the plot, Cruise definitely made himself look like an action superstar in this and the fight scene at the end was really well done. They got right to it this time, didn't start violent but went right to the plot, the first action scene was terrific and we see how smart the special ops team can be. The rest was an edge of your seat thriller with no boring romance, just tom going nuts on bad guys and using some super cool stunts. The bridge scene on the ads was much more violent and intense as it came out to be, there were new characters who were in it and Cruise did no more solo missions this time, it seemed that he was always with the team, just not in the end.

I have to give her props for really moving beyond that ""Felicity"" image that has probably haunted her since the late nineties. She was very capable of playing strong and ingénue at the same time.<br/><br/>Also would like to give a hand to Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the crazy villain-type. He's very versatile as an actor and that came through in this film -- they really should've given the man more lines.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a good action flick for anyone wanting to sit inside a nice air-conditioned theater in lieu of the hot weather.

","Ethan Hunt is back and in full force. We start of with him having retreated from active field duty and has committed himself to training new agents. But after a former pupil of his gets kidnapped by international arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman), he gets back in the game to bring him down and on his way goes to such places as the Vatican and Shanghai.<br/><br/>The first Mission:Impossible was a classic, the second an adrenaline driven disappointment with the Cruise being the only superhero. This film however manages to capture the best aspects of both of those films and combine them into enjoyable flick.<br/><br/>The story is there but it doesn't take center stage in this one, a thing that somewhat disappointed me since they could have really done better in that department, but instead it focuses on the characters, a thing that writer/director J.J Abrams (Lost, Alias) is best at. In addition to showing a more human side to super agent Ethan Hunt and giving us an overview of his personal life, there is a great supporting cast and above all, Hunt works as a part of a team and not just solo. In addition to Ving Rhames coming back for a third time around, the film also boasts Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as members of Hunt's IMF team. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the bad guy and what a bad guy this is. He doesn't care if he's about to die but remains calm all the time and manages to make threats even when facing death itself while at the same time, not being too over the top. Laurence Fishburne plays the bureaucrat boss of Hunt and he too fits his role well. But the real treat is a small, almost cameo like role from Simon Pegg. He plays a lab technician at IMF headquarters and even though his screen time is limited, he manages to crank out some of the wittiest sentences ever put onto celluloid. Overall, this film has more emphasis on comedy than the previous two but it never goes too far or gets annoying. Though one thing that did bother me a bit was how they deviated a bit too far from realism with all the spy stuff, thereby making everything seem so easy and not too challenging for the participants.<br/><br/>This is JJ Abrams's debut film (and the most expensive directorial debut in history) and he handles the big job well, if this were another episode of one of his TV shows. As one would expect from a film like this, there are several big action set pieces such as a helicopter chase in a wind park, an aerial attack on a convoy of vehicles and a high speed pursuit through the streets of Shanghai, in addition to various shootouts and other cool stunts. Well, the action was awesome but as I mentioned before, if this was a TV show. I remember watching this documentary on the making of the pilot for Lost and there is this one running scene that was done by doing a closeup of the actors faces and then having them jump up and down in one spot but then when shown on the big screen, it looks like running. That is exactly what this film felt like. The action is very quick cut, everything is shot with shaky zoomed in closeups and the technique of shooting the action at low frame rates whereby things seem faster and more chaotic than they actually are, all kept reminding me of yet another episode of some TV show. They could at least let us enjoy the beauty of the action (and it isn't like they had budget constraints, the very thing that makes TV action scenes seem the way they are). Overall, Daniel Mindel's camera-work was competent and there were some cool shots here and there but overall, nothing that special. The soundtrack, done by Michael Giacchio, fits the film perfectly and at times reminds of his score for Lost.<br/><br/>Overall, a very entertaining film, even with its slight drawbacks."

","While Scientologist Tom Cruise forces his young wife Katie Holmes to undergo a ""silent birth,"" he nevertheless subjects the audience of his newest film to an ear-shattering series of explosions, gunshots, car crashes, jet engines, violent arguments and bloodcurdling screams. That's not to say ""Mission: Impossible III"" is a bad movie  just a little loud, that's all.<br/><br/>What puts this one a little above the average action/adventure, however, is the inclusion of a bona fide actor (like Cruise used to be), Philip Seymour Hoffman, fresh off his Oscar win for ""Capote."" I've appreciated his work long before that, though, especially in ""Flawless,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Almost Famous,"" ""Empire Falls"" and ""Cold Mountain,"" among others. In fact, he was even good in the Ben Stiller/Jennifer Aniston bomb, ""Along Comes Polly.""<br/><br/>As the bad guy, Owen Davian, Hoffman brings a fresh new dimension to the typical movie villain, who appears, menaces and then gets killed. He's an international weapons dealer, who (despite little backstory and questionable motivation) squeezes out every minute of screen time and makes you wish Cruise wouldn't hog so much of it.<br/><br/>He is suitably evil (telling Hunt how he will hunt down his wife, torture her and kill her in front of him), but with a boyish, pudgy charm that makes us relate, somewhat, to him. It's a terrific performance in an average motion picture.<br/><br/>The plot has covert IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) about to be married to a nurse, Julia (Michelle Monaghan, ""North Country,"" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""). No longer active in operations, he is now an instructor for new recruits, but you know this status won't last forever.<br/><br/>Julia doesn't know, of course, about his real job, believing him to be employed by the Virginia Dept. of Transportation, but this ruse is soon shattered when a young agent Hawk trained, Lindsey (Keri ""Felicity"" Russell) is kidnapped by Davian's organization. These guys are attempting to sell some kind of biohazard device, called the ""rabbit's foot,"" to an unnamed Mideast power.<br/><br/>Hawk is sent in to rescue her, along with his team, Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q) and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, ""Match Point""), but a device detonates inside her head (don't ask), killing her.<br/><br/>The group then travels to the Vatican and kidnaps Davian, only to lose him when a most unlikely twist takes place. Friends who Ethan thought would support him do not, and those he assumed would betray him aid his cause. It's all very confusing, but still entertaining in a lowbrow kind of way.<br/><br/>Now free, and really ticked off at Ethan (because he dangled him outside of an airplane), Davian arranges the kidnapping of Julia, which forces the inevitable showdown between the two combatants. Ably directed by J.J. Abrams (behind many ""Lost"" and ""Alias"" episodes), ""MI3"" is non-stop in its intensity, and is thrilling enough to keep what's left of Cruise's fan base in their seats."
