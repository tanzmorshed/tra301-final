"hitchcockthelegend","9","44","48","30 March 2009"," It wears its sentimental heart firmly on its fetlock.
","As the depression era kicks in, Americans were grasping for any sort of inspiration they could get, enter equine supreme, Seabiscuit. Considered broken down, too small and untrainable, Seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorses and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.<br/><br/>Back in 2003 upon its initial release, critics were very divided as to the merits of Seabiscuit as a picture. Some were concerned that this adaptation from Laura Hillenbrand's highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements, others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting Oscar (something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances), the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece that it is.<br/><br/>It would be churlish of me to not agree that Seabiscuit is laced with sentiment, rookie director Gary Ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence, but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point, then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. Seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture, it's also a fusion of three men's personal wavering, who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain, make no bones about it, Seabiscuit is a very human drama. Knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem, because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending, one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of Americans back in the depression era day.<br/><br/>Ross wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can, archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire (waif like), Chris Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, top American jockey Gary Stevens and a splendidly jaunty William H Macy, all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. Yet it's with the thundering race sequences that Seabiscuit really triumphs best, magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track are excellently handled by Ross and his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound department's efforts, for this is definitely one to give your sub-woofer a work out.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning none, perhaps the Academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a Golden Statue? But now after the dust has settled some years later, it pays to revisit Seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms, for it's a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender, a fine fine picture indeed. 9/10"
"filmbuff-36","9","67","79","13 August 2003"," An old-fashioned winner all the way
","It's fitting that a film about underdogs giving it all they've got has been released among the standard summer action fare. No other movie this summer has capitalized upon the David vs. Goliath theme so thoroughly and effectively as `Seabiscuit' has.<br/><br/>The story of `Seabiscuit' is actually the tale of four long shots: Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), a wealthy self-made man and natural salesmen who's suffered both personal and financial loss through the Depression, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), an aging horse trainer unsure of his place in the world with the ending of the frontier, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a short-tempered jockey with various handicaps against him, and Seabiscuit, an undersized mustang whose been mistreated his whole life.<br/><br/>It's the Depression, and times are hard on everyone. The assembly line philosophy of business is starting to squelch independent spirit and people are looking for anything to help escape the dreary day-to-day of life. During this maelstrom of hopelessness, horse racing quickly gathers favoritism among those wishing to witness a spectacle in otherwise bleak times. It's under these circumstances that the film's four main parties come together. Howard, seeking a new business venture in horse racing, hires Smith as his horse trainer and Pollard as his jockey, and upon Smith's insistence, purchases the ill-tempered Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>It's not long before Seabiscuit becomes the `little horse who could,' gaining favor among the sporting fans on the West Coast. But despite the popularity the mustang and his team gains, they are seen as just a cheap novelty by the East Coast horse racing elite, led by Samuel Riddle, owner of the 1937 Triple Crown Winner War Admiral. This mushrooms into a media circus as Howard tries to gain public favor in order to force Riddle to put his money where his mouth is.<br/><br/>The story should have felt cliched and by-the-numbers, but a funny thing happened: the film makers took a nearly forgotten moment in time and managed to invest it with immediacy and suspense. The near mythic meeting of Seabiscuit and War Admiral on November 1, 1938 at Pimlico is an extension of the movie's overall theme; Seabiscuit, the representative of underdog hopes and pioneering dreams, and War Admiral, the recipient of champion breeding and training, a product of assembly line thinking.<br/><br/>Bridges and Maguire give spirited performances, with their characters forming a father and son bond that both men desperately needed. Cooper, who won this year's Best Supporter Actor Oscar, can give this kind of performance in his sleep, bringing a quiet, stoic depth to the Smith character. The supporting cast is top drawer as well, especially William H. Macy as `Tick Tock' McGlaughlin, the initially skeptical radio sports commentor who becomes a full blown Seabiscuit supporter.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross captures the time period marvelously, with broken human beings slowly recapturing their dignity and pride against a landscape of barren ruin. The conflicts are fought not on traditional battlefields, but atop magnificent beasts along a circular track, and Ross wisely utilizes this metaphor to full effect.<br/><br/>Many film goers this season will most certainly pass on `Seabiscuit,' choosing instead to see standard fare like `American Wedding' and `Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.' Others will undoubtedly avoid it because it looks to artsy to be entertaining. For whatever reason, it will be a shame that this film will not do well financially; the horse race scenes are some of the most intense I've ever seen, and the animals are pure poetry in motion.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars. A nearly flawless motion picture."

","If you think about it, this so-called film is just the Pixar classic Ratatouille, except in reverse (i.e. instead of an animal (in the case of Ratatouille - a ""rat"") piloting a human, this movie is a human piloting an animal (in this case, a ""horse"").<br/><br/>I did not enjoy it!"
"jsfmt99","Null","38","44","10 June 2004"," A very fine film!
","A wonderful story of the underdog who rises above adversity to become a champion.<br/><br/>A very good wholesome movie for the entire family. Good period settings and costumes and interesting plot of a broken down horse who brought three broken down people together who all ended up happy. A simple, believable concept. Good scenery throughout also.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of negative comments about this movie by those who called it boring and tiresome but that simply isn't true. Does a movie have to have profanity and lots of CGI imagery in it to be considered good ? I don't think so. <br/><br/>Acting was very good but I thought the most believable scene was when Red's parents gave up their son because they couldn't afford to keep him anymore.<br/><br/>That scene was very sad and based on fact where parents were placed in the terrible position to give up their children like that during the depression.<br/><br/>What struck me funny is that Red Pollard never reunited with his family after he became one of the most famous jockeys in the country but I guess thats the way it was back in those days.<br/><br/>Wonderful cast and exciting horse racing scenes that brought the viewer into the race and projected the energy and danger involved. It is interesting to note that horse racing was a bigger sport in its heyday than football or baseball. Bill Macy was also memorable as the funny and witty radio announcer<br/><br/>A good movie for the entire family."
"claudio_carvalho","8","27","31","25 December 2004"," When Losers Have a Second Chance to Become Winners
","After the American Depression, the millionaire Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) gets married again with Marcela (Elizabeth Banks) and decides to invest in a race horse. He gathers the old couch Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), the problematic jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) and the horse Seabiscuit, all of them losers, and he believes on them, giving a second chance to them. Seabiscuit becomes a winner and legend in a difficult period of the American life. ""Seabiscuit"" is a beautiful film with positive and wonderful messages. Charles Howard has the best lines, such as: ""When the little guy doesn't know that he is little, he is capable of big things""; or, ""Sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance"". The excellent and underrated actor Chris Cooper has probably his best performance along his career. Although having 141 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel time passing. I particularly liked not only the direction, performances, locations and reconstitution of a period, but mainly the never corny and very positive messages in the excellent lines and screenplay. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Seabiscuit  Alma de Herói"" (""Seabiscuit  Soul of Hero"")"
"Chris Knipp","Null","79","102","29 July 2003"," Triumphant conventionality
","Roger Ebert says he has a theory that `people more readily cry at movies not because of sadness, but because of goodness and courage.'<br/><br/>This is certainly a reason why Gary Ross's Seabiscuit tugs so effectively at the heartstrings. But the main one is the way the movie shows the triumph of the underdog spread fourfold among three men and a horse. And again the timing is right in the American release. Just as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was delightful because it was a low budget movie that could compete with a lot of loud and dubious blockbusters, Seabiscuit earns our gratitude by being a blockbuster without explosions or exhibitionism, an epic of restraint, modesty and -- yes -- `goodness and courage.' The loudest sound you hear is the starting bell for the races. There are those of us, mainstream folk, who've been starving for such fare. I saw people in the audience in the early matinee who plainly were alive in 1929 and 1938, and they wept and applauded throughout with awe and gratitude. We shall see how the younger generations respond.<br/><br/>An enthusiastic response is justified. There is nothing in Seabiscuit that's very original; it awakens involuntary flashbacks to many traditional Rocky-esque sports biopics as one watches. But Gray and his chief collaborators, the talented author Lauren Hillenbrand and the splendid cast headed by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and co-producer Tobey McGuire, have nonetheless provided us with a quite wonderful movie, as much for its surefire writing and brilliant editing as for any of the acting.<br/><br/>Everyone must agree that the three men behind the most famous horse of his time are played by three of the best actors Hollywood now has to offer. Critics are in accord in saying Cooper's performance is the subtlest and the most real: he models the principle that Less is More. Tobey McGuire isn't given quite enough to do; his greatest accomplishment may be his lean look; he's barely recognizable, and as a former redhead myself I don't think the dye job is as bad as some have claimed. Bridges is, in his way, magnificent, but glossily iconic and therefore somewhat opaque. His resemblance to Franklin D. Roosevelt is pushed a bit too hard, as is the whole uplifting populist message - the `we didn't fix the horse. He fixed us - and we fixed each other,' and `sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance,' stuff. (It's pretty corny. But within the context of this beautifully made movie that believes in itself, we buy it.)<br/><br/>It's important, anyway - if young people do come to see Seabiscuit - for them to get the simplified, but nonetheless just portrait of the times provided with authentic stills and footage, and the voiceover narration by iconic historian David (""The Civil War"") McCullough. The travelogue of the Depression and Prohibition years includes a quiet but heartfelt plug for FDR and that, too, is moving, especially in today's post-Yuppie mood of numbingly exploitive jingoism.<br/><br/>Indeed each of the three actors gives a powerfully understated performance - they're like thoroughbreds who're never given their head - whose litotes (a word schoolboys learned back then) enhances the movie's epic quality by never letting us forget that their triumphs were snatched from deprivation and adversity.<br/><br/>The long time devoted to the three men's backgrounds early in the movie isn't ill spent. It establishes the leisurely pace that is the essence of epic. But these back-stories aren't as necessary as the filmmakers may have thought. And despite the slow movement, there isn't deep detail. There's barely one scene to establish Red Pollard's (McGuire's) literate, close-knit family before he's cast (heartbreakingly) out of it. Charles Howard's (Bridge's) loss of his son is too telegraphic, though it's a fine touch to show him wailing with the boy's body but with his voice barely audible: it's one more example of the movie's sense of the period and of its restraint.<br/><br/>
Right from the first the horse races are astonishing in the camera's closeness and vividness, the way we feel the danger and physicality of the jockeys' brutal competition with one another. Since we know Pollard is a failed prizefighter and general scrapper, we take in stride that fact that he's physically fighting with other jockeys during the early races. This is a movie about horse racing and the races had better be terrific, and they are. It's when we see the power of those sequences that we realize Seabiscuit has the makings of a popular classic.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges' performance in particular seems etched in stone. There are touches of Jimmy Stewart, Joseph Cotton, even Orson Welles in his role and his looks. The chameleon Bridges comes carrying traces of Coppola's Tucker, but he has entered into the period and the tradition with utter conviction. Cooper's austere minimalism, because it is the essential spirit of the movie, its understatement (litotes), is the central performance. He is a man who communicates better with horses than with men. McGuire's performance is the noisiest, but he too reflects the social restraints of the period, and his wings are clipped before the final triumph can take place. This was a time when people had superiors and recognized it by calling them Sir and Mister. Everyone male wore a suit and tie, even jockeys off duty.<br/><br/>
Seabiscuit's ability to tug at the heartstrings first appears when Red Pollard is let go by his destitute father so he can be a jockey. The moment is deeply sad because what seems an act of heroic renunciation by a loving parent is in fact abandonment, and it feeds the young man's rage thenceforth. And it's more complex than that because it grows out of the enormous pressures of the Depression, a time when millions in America wandered westward deprived of everything but their cars and a few possessions.<br/><br/>Not only Bridges' performance but whole sequences of Seabiscuit seem etched in stone and contain examples of textbook-perfect editing that possesses sweep and complexity and advances the story while keeping our focus on the prevailing mood.<br/><br/>This is, of course, the classic American story of triumph out of defeat and resolution out of conflict. As is a little too clearly pointed out, all three men, Charles Howard, Tom Smith, and Red Pollard, have had great devastation and loss in their lives (echoed by the whole country's economic devastation, failure, and loss of nerve; and it's implied -- with some failure of restraint -- that Seabiscuit's underdog triumphs were as needed as the New Deal). Their horse was rescued by Smith (Chris Cooper) when it was going to be shot because it seemed unruly and untrainable. Out of all this failure and tragedy the men forge their victories: Seabiscuit, the horse that lacked breeding, was untrainable, and was `too small'; Pollard, abandoned by his parents, beaten in many prize fights, secretly blind in one eye and `too big' to be a top jockey; Smith, a gifted horse tamer and trainer reduced to riding the rails and hoboing; Bridges, the self-made millionaire devastated by the destruction of all his hopes in a ruined economy and the sudden death of his young only son. They bond together to make Seabiscuit into one of the greatest racehorses in history. Who wouldn't be moved by this? Only the conventional fat man who's War Admiral's snobbish Maryland owner. It's all about heart, and Seabiscuit's got it.<br/><br/>William H. Macy's caricatured portrait of an alcoholic radio announcer is a highlight, in the sense of a bright spot on a painting. It's a shrill and brittle performace that we tolerate because of the moments of relief Macy's little comic vignettes provide. Subtlety is sacrificed to provide an effect, and to brush in a bit of humor amid all the earnestness. One only wishes there were more of a progression; that the character didn't sip from the same bottle in every scene but got drunker, or soberer, as things went along.<br/><br/>We have to allow for the exigencies of filmmaking that required ten horses to be used for Seabiscuit, leading to the irony that this unique horse is a composite.<br/><br/>If you accept its conventionality, Seabiscuit is not just a good movie but a great one."
"what3v3r","9","29","35","28 March 2005"," Sea of emotion!
","""Sea Biscuit"" is a story about a long shot horse and a man who discover each other on the road to equestrian glory. An extremely rewarding journey though the lives of man and beast. Every aspect of human emotion, bonding and courage is explored with an ""equine"" tinge. Set in a time when horse racing is more passion than business, Seabiscuit glorifies the positive appeal of horse racing. Every derby event is an emotional doorway which lifts your spirits. Be it the Santa Anita or the Pimilco, you are just just hanging on the edge of your seat praying, vying and hoping for a Seabiscuit win. Such is the emotional grasp and visual brilliance of Gary Ross's direction and Scwartzman's cinematography. Being a thoroughbred race horse by birth, Seabiscuit treads the race track under the watchful eyes of trainer Tom Smith (played by Chris Cooper) and jockey Red Poddard (played by Tobey Mcguire). What follows is a sequence of predictable vicissitudes. Why! This movie wasn't advertised in the mystery genre either! <br/><br/>A frail looking (really) Tobey manages to deeply bond with the horse at least on screen, kudos indeed. Nobody else could have possibly fit into his role as well as he did, physically too. Chris Cooper is the silent marvel. There is a completely subtle tinge to his acting which lays low, yet beautifully exuberates class. Seabiscuit is simply one of those ""silent' movies which just hurtles you beyond imaginable frontiers. Sit back and relax and let the long shot consume you."
"jacqsantora","8","31","39","22 February 2005"," Loved it - a wonderful uplifting (but not cheesy) story
","I have not read the book or anything about the story this movie was based on - I might have to now since I enjoyed the movie so much. The point of my writing this is to say: if you haven't read the book, you will probably like this movie. I'm sure the book portrayed so much more, but I don't think you can directly compare movies and books. In most cases, I have never loved a movie as much as a book - but that doesn't mean the movie should be disregarded. In some cases emotion can be better portrayed on film. (please note that all my ""quotes"" are paraphrased from what i remember and only set aside in "" "" to distinguish it from my writing). <br/><br/>That said, I completely disagree with the first reviewer above who did read the book first. I really DID get the message about what Seabiscuit represented at that time: a second chance, rising above expectations against all odds, and most of all - HOPE. When I told someone I just saw Seabiscuit, they said, ""oh, that's about the horse, right?"" and I said, ""no, it's really a story of hope and rising above tough circumstances - but there is a horse in it."" I was surprised at how much history and how many images of the depression were gracefully woven into Seabiscuit. I thought it worked very well and added to the realism of the film. <br/><br/>I also definitely understood that Red Pollard's family was wealthy, and that they lost everything in the depression. It's pretty obvious - the whole family is shown around a great big dinner table in a very nice house; his father even buys him his own horse. Next time you see them, they are basically living out of their car with a whole bunch of other folks doing the same - a kind of depression era makeshift camp.<br/><br/>It's also made clear later on in the movie that he never saw his family again - there are auditory flashbacks to his parents saying they will call him; how he almost dumps all his books into the water; the fact that next time we see him he's a young man and there's no mention of his family ever again in the movie. Seems like they just disappeared - and they did. Red also displays anger and frustration that is noticed by other characters. To me, this points to a sense of abandonment by his family. <br/><br/>Also unlike the other reviewer, I DID care a lot about the race with War Admiral - in fact, i almost had to just skip to the end first because I was so nervous about it! This was NOT just a story of profit. In fact, it never seemed like that was Howard's goal at all - his goal was to prove that the underdog can and will win - to prove that heart and spirit mattered as much as (or even more than) wealth and breeding. That seemed to be the point of the match race with War Admiral. <br/><br/>This is a story of rising above profit to reach an even greater goal. It's an uplifting story, as you can see in the crowd's faces as Howard tells them, ""just because he's beaten down by a nose, doesn't mean he's out."" and ""When the little guy doesn't know he's the little guy, he can do great big things."" You can picture the men and women, unemployed and hungry, telling themselves these same words. Things will get better; we may be down, but we're not out. In the words of Tom Smith, ""You can't throw a whole life away, just because it's banged up a bit."" Red's words at the end are touching as well, ""seabiscuit fixed us, and in a sense we fixed each other.'"" Red overcame his anger, his fear, his sense of hopelessness. So did Seabiscuit. And if they can, so can you."
"janyeap","Null","41","55","23 July 2003"," Seabiscuit is a winner...
","A fabulous movie! It offers credibility to the old saying that 'if there's a will, there's a way.' It's a great reminder that there had been people - of yesteryears - who had been brave and courageous to accept the underdogs with heartfelt benevolence.<br/><br/>As a film, revolving around the inspiring story of Seabiscuit, it works well. It connects the cultural icon with the life paths of three men of different social standings, leading me through a mixed journey of tragedies and jubilation, risks, disappointments and exuberance. It shows how these men and beast overcome incredible odds to achieve their goals. The bonding of the quartet is wonderfully captured in this film. Watching the horse transformed into a winner is as aesthetically beautiful as seeing 'Cinderella' transformed into a beauty by her three 'fairy godmothers.' This film has a compelling story that salutes the American dream.<br/><br/>This adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's book, unfortunately, does omit a great deal of the interesting biographical accounts of the trio's lives and the historical impressions of the nation's era between 1903-1940. But Director Gary Ross (watch out for his cameo appearance) does provide sufficient background to the lives of Charles Howard, Jim Smith and Red Pollard to justify how the trio becomes ultimately involved with the life of Seabiscuit. The small spirited bay is first introduced as a colt, and Red as a young kid, both ultimately separated from their parents, and both subjecting the viewers never to forget their crooked legs and their predisposition for indolence!  Strangely, the film does show many similarities, in traits and circumstances, between Seabiscuit and Red. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Toby Maguire are impressive in their roles. They are convincing sources to what is meant by perseverance and triumph. William H. Macy does 'tick-tock' through several scenes to provide the comic relief.<br/><br/>The film is filled with dramatically charming appeal and beauty, yet it has not failed to expose the brutality of horseracing.  even if Seabiscuit's glory had distracted millions away from the political, social and economic woes of their times. The visuals for the story's historical era are wonderfully detailed, creating a sense of realism to the period, the characters and events.  The choice of Randy Newman's music scores helps build up the viewers' emotions especially in the race scenes.<br/><br/>

","I can't say a bad thing about this movie. There wasn't a single moment that I didn't like. Everyone who acted in this movie did no less than perfection. The movie has so much depth, has so much feeling and emotion and none of it feels forced, phoney or corny/ham handed. The development of the characters and the plot feels very natural and real and the movie flows at a comfortable pace. It's a movie you can cry tears of joy about and not feel weird about it. And to think I was so naive and close minded that I didn't see it in the theater because I told myself, ""Who wants to see a movie about a racehorse?"" If only I'd known how ignorant that statement was. I'd pay several times the admittance to have seen this in the theater, just to have had that added experience of seeing it there. This movie easily makes my top 5 of all time and is probably the best movie I've ever seen, and although I've seen it a few times now I still have a strong emotional response to it every time I watch it and feel my appreciation of it not waning, but only enriching. This movie is truly a ""Must See."" I hope you like it as much as I do."

","So here it is: a story about a horse that would give spirit to a whole nation, after the depression of the late 20's and early 30's. Make it a story where the horse and it's jockey have to overcome injury to win it's final great race, and you got your tearjerker (and, therefore, Oscar winner) right there.<br/><br/>But, somehow, 'Seabiscuit' is much more than that. What is definitely a help, is it's incredible cast. Tobey McGuire once more shows he's one of the better youngsters around in Hollywood, and old-timers Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper will do the rest for ya, even though Cooper is not at his best here as Tom Smith, the trainer for the horse. Then there's William H. Macy in a hilarious role as 'Tick Tock McGlaughlin', a radio presenter.<br/><br/>The life-story we follow the most though is that of Charles Howard (Bridges), owner of the horse. As a self-made millionaire selling cars, who lost his son due to a car-accident, he finds a little bit of joy back to life, with his new wife and his new love, the horsing business. His inspirational speeches make 'Seabiscuit' a crowd-pleaser, in particular that of the 'common people', who recognize themselves in the little horse.<br/><br/>As said, the movie is a little bit too much of a happy ending story to really make it into the 'classic' category, but the movie looks great and hasn't got a boring moment in it. Good acting all around therefore make it a very pleasant movie experience. Although the 7 academy award nominations were a little bit much...<br/><br/>7/10."
"Jessica-65","Null","4","4","29 March 2004"," Worth seeing
","Though I enjoyed this film, I have to agree that it doesn't quite make it - it feels a bit too much like a documentary with some rather familiar melodramatic moments thrown in.  Having just read the book and watched the movie back-to-back, I especially noticed where they over-simplified the story (I know - it can't be helped when transferring a story from page to screen), where they changed the facts, and where they over-simplified the *message*, too.  I know it's nit-picking, but I just want to mention the following points:<br/><br/>1) Red Pollard's parents did NOT in any way abandon him, despite losing their money.  *He* was the one who wanted to try to make his way in the world.  It was the family friend who was supposed to be looking out for him who abandoned him.<br/><br/>2) Charles Howard's son was 16, not 12, when he died in a car accident going fishing, and *not* because his father pressured him in any way.<br/><br/>3) As I understand it, Red Pollard never told anyone except his wife that he was blind in his right eye, and Charles Howard and Tom Smith both went to their graves without realizing that their former jockey could only see out of one eye.<br/><br/>4)The movie turns Tom Smith into a kind of clichéd ""horse whisperer"", which was true, but it left out his very marked ornery side - the mind games he was always playing with reporters, the fact that he cared more about horses than people, to the point of not even noticing when one of his underlings was very sick.<br/><br/>5) The movie does not show the extent of Red Pollard's injuries - he had not one but three serious riding accidents before winning the Santa Anita (including the one where he lost his sight).  Yes, his leg was shattered, but that was only part of it.  He paid for his success with his health, and suffered chronic pain for the rest of his life from the injuries he sustained.  Of course, that doesn't play very well in a ""You can do anything if only you believe and work hard"" kind of movie, but IMO, sometimes the price of achieving a particular dream *is* too high.<br/><br/>6) The movie also mostly leaves out the ""class struggle"" that Laura Hillenbrand depicts so clearly in her book.  One of the reasons Pollard suffered so much was because nobody (especially the horse-owners) cared about the safety or welfare of the jockeys (Howard being an honourable exception).  This might have been harder to show on film, but I think it would have made a more complex and more interesting movie.<br/><br/>7) Just my opinion, but I didn't much like the actress who played Marcella Howard.  MH seems to have been a unique and interesting person, and this actress seems rather generic to me.  Plus, I gather that MH was Mexican or at least Hispanic.  I don't know whether she did or not, but I pictured her speaking with a slight Mexican accent."

","Unlike most people, I haven't had that many cases in which I didn't particularly rave over a good movie because it couldn't live up to the book....but that was the case here.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. I realize that, but Laura Hillenbrand's book, from which this movie is taken, is hands-down the best sports book I have ever read. So, I eagerly anticipated the movie. I found out what so many other people discovered when their favorite was made into a film: it can't live up to it. In fairness, no two-hour film can do justice to a good book.<br/><br/>In this case, there were many things the jockey, owner and trainer went through that made the story so compelling, and they weren't in the movie. I won't detail them. Just read the book. But you can't appreciate what these men and that gutsy racehorse really accomplished just by the film. It only scratches the surface.<br/><br/>I can accept those omissions because of time constraints but I cannot accept Hollywood inserting offensive language into the movie that was not in the book, such as a dozen usages of the Lord's name in vain, NONE of which was in the book. That's inexcusable.<br/><br/>The movie's strength was its beauty, just magnificently filmed. Man, this is a gorgeous film, from the first shot to the last. Director Gary Ross and Director Of Photography John Schwartzman put a lot of loving care into this film and it shows. The actors were fine, too. No complaints there. <br/><br/>If this film appealed to you, I cannot recommended the book enough. Please check it out."

Maguire was fresh off the first Spiderman film when he was cast, but he did some great acting in this feature.<br/><br/>The history involved in the making of Seabiscuit was tremendous, as a lot of time and facts went into the production; and having David McCullough narrate was great.

"gavin6942","7","5","6","19 May 2010"," More Than Just a Horse Racing Movie
","The story of Seabiscuit, one of the winningest horses of all time. This story is true, the events are true, the characters are real. Sure, things might be fictionalized for the entertainment value, but basically this is it! Seabiscuit was a symbol of hope during the Great Depression for people, a symbol that the underdog could win. It's a bad sign when people have to put their faith in a running horse, but I suppose that's how it was.<br/><br/>The characters each have their own outlook. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), horse trainer: ""every horse is good for something"", even if that something is not racing. He's the optimist. Cooper is vastly under-appreciated as an actor.<br/><br/>Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), automobile entrepreneur and amateur horse owner: ""everyone needs a second chance"", another optimist, though with much less pure motivation. And then Tobey MacGuire as jockey Red Pollard, he's just a blind drunk.<br/><br/>William H. Macy as Tick-Tock McLauchlin is the pessimist and cynic, calling Seabiscuit the ""surprise in the punchbowl"". But this is a happy story, so he's proved wrong. Interestingly, the great race is against War Admiral, which happens to be his uncle!"
"cosmorados","9","8","11","15 June 2008"," One of the most under rated films of all time, because it's too amazing to be true
","Usually when the book of a film is made (A La Akiva Goldsman, ""A Beautiful Mind) the makers feel the need to Hollywoodise it and take out the more objectionable elements, for this film the real story of Seabiscuit is so amazing that they had to actually remove some of the elements that were too Hollywood, such is the story of this marvellous little race horse.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit was a racehorse deemed too demanding by its original trainer and sold to Charles Howard, an automobile salesman. Howard hired Tom Smith, an unorthodox trainer who instinctively understood horses, who knew exactly what was required to get the best of Seabiscuit. Smith hired jockey Red Pollard to ride the biscuit and the combination of owner, rider and trainer would reap dividends, becoming a symbol of hope for America during the great depression, managing to beat all comers, with the the exception of the one horse that stood above the entire thoroughbred division, the mighty War Admiral.<br/><br/>This film is another of Dave Ross' excellent under-rated body of work, with a cast giving great performances, most notably Chris Cooper as the quietly all-knowing Smith. The story is fascinating, as the three different human characters, all with their own tragedies and problems, are told with passion, conviction and honesty, a rarity in film-making. The story of the other main lead, the biscuit, is also done with real skill, with the training and races handled superbly, managing to convey both the excitement and the inherent dangers in being a jockey at the end of the great depression.<br/><br/>This would have been considered a rank outsider for the best picture, had it contended in any other year when the ""The Return of the King"" wasn't contending, but just because it didn't win, don't let that put you off investing an hour and a half in one of the best true stories of all time.<br/><br/>PS. After watching the film I recommend you read the book, ""Seabiscuit"" by Laura Hillenbrand"
"jaddison383","8","6","8","20 December 2006"," Very Exciting and Moving Even!!!
","When Seabiscuit was first released to theaters, I had absolutely no desire to see it whatsoever. The three girls in my family who had read the book were adamantly for seeing it and insisted we all go. I walked into the theater expecting to be bored for two hours.<br/><br/>But I was sure wrong!!! This movie is the perfect example of a film that has taken an overall boring subject and made it into something extraordinary. Each cast member performs splendidly, and you really feel for each and every one of them. Tobey Maguire's lead performance is nothing short of amazing, especially the bond he creates with the horse. Jeff Brodges and Chris Cooper also turn in excellent work as his owner and trainer, respectively. Also a splendid(and Academy Award-nominated) performance by William H. Macy as the radio DJ Tick Tock McGlaughlin. I truly believe all these performers made4 this movie the best it could have possibly been.<br/><br/>Because Seabiscuit isn't really a racing movie, or a sports movie- it's a beautiful and touching look at how the relationship between this horse and this man could change so many lives, and, ultimately, change America. The last scene still gets tears from me every time.<br/><br/>So, sit back, relax, and keep some tissues ready. This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, laughing out loud, and even tearing up. Truly a very good film.<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","Excellent sports drama about the intense relationship between a jockey and his horse. I loved this movie, but the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even better. If ""Seabiscuit"" wasn't based on true events, this movie would have looked like another classic Disney-movie. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with these kinds of movies, but what usually disturbs me, is the fact that they are so unbelievable and predictable.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance as Red Pollard, the young but very talented jockey. Many other great performances in this movie by the always enjoyable Jeff Bridges, the outstanding Chris Cooper (Adaptation.) and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks (Spiderman) who plays Bridges' second wife.<br/><br/>Although this second Gary Ross-movie is less my kind of movie than ""Pleasentville"" was, I truly enjoyed watching it.

For having read the book, I knew what was coming.<br/><br/>And then at the end, they have two major events coming right on top of one another. They could have tightened up the beginning, and focused on the TWO major accidents that Tom Pollard suffered. The movie compressed them into one, for time's sake. And the real life love story between Pollard and his nurse is never even mentioned.<br/><br/>BUT these are only observations, not criticisms. I thought the movie worked better in individual scenes, than as an overall whole.<br/><br/>In an outstanding cast, Chris Cooper stands out, with his mostly wordless performance. The scene where he encounters barbed wire, knowing that his way of life will soon be gone forever, is magnificent.

"tedg","Null","10","19","26 July 2003"," Pairs
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Post 9-11 effects are nowhere as profound as in the wave of movies just hitting the theaters. This week, I have seen two films whose foundations are the upswelling of national identity since the attacks. But they are quite different. The first was ""Red, White and Blond"" which is lightweight, celebrates the simple platitude as truth, and has that respect for the stupid but well-meaning that characterizes Republican strategy. Enormously endearing, and I cried at all the patriotic parts.<br/><br/>And then there's this. Strong metaphors for a broken country given a second chance. A morality tale about the little guy against moneyed interests, about healing, about real compassion. In this case, the metaphor is made plain: history's popularizer David McCullough does a faux ""Ken Burns"" documentary within which we peer into this story of America revitalization from the destruction of greed. This is the other side of the patriotic coin, and we all cried at the patriotic parts here too.<br/><br/>Both of these are extremely well engineered, almost overengineered. In this one we have one of the simplest devices in the book, the rule of twos:<br/><br/>We have two men in whose hands this healing is wrought. The heart of the project is the heart of these two characters. They sought out two of the three male actors capable of a certain technique for this: the ability to anticipate the next scene. Acting is not the challenge of creating a character at all, it is the challenge of doing things that induce you as the viewer to create a character. That means that the actor has to create and maintain a channel between himself and the viewer; there are different styles, techniques and philosophies to do this. One -- rare but effective -- technique is to anticipate the future; it is what Chris and Jeff know how to do.<br/><br/>In this game, they each create two persons, the character who lives in the now of the story and the actor who knows that something is coming -- that it will all turn out all right if only the being of the actor can get past the flaws in the being of the character. They expose both of these beings to us and we watch them both. When we see Jeff's face in closeup -- and he literally tells us its all about the future -- we see half of him really does live in the future. These are superb actors, chosen because they each bring this linkage to the next scene. Cinematic storytelling, folks. Which, it must be said, has something to do with the strategy of racing that is described in redundant detail: let him see the partner so that he can race ahead.<br/><br/>Pairs throughout: we have the pair of the damaged: horse and rider, both as metaphor for the nation. This is so heavily and obviously pounded in, that it threatens the movie and only by repeated tests did they fine tune it: pushed only precisely so far and no further. ""Bagger Vance"" is an example of one that went over the line. Robert Redford.<br/><br/>The viewers have to be represented: here we have a pair of designated viewers -- standing in for us of course. The wife and the radio announcer. The wife duly soaks in the sweet platitudes and the radio guy (in addition to providing comic relief) provides an equally heavy metaphor for our own voyeurism. These bookends define the space for us to feel comfortable in. This announcer bit is also an example of repeated audience testing. It derives from the reporter-voyeur of the screwball comedy era, filtered through dozens of comedic versions in mostly baseball movies -- but with defining bumps in ""Best in Show"" and ""Major League."" Again it was pushed precisely as far as audiences could take before they had a reaction. An example of too far is Jennifer Leigh's reporter in ""Hudsucker.<br/><br/>Pairs: the pair of patriotic approaches, the pair for us as Americans, the pair for us as patient husbanders of the good (each as the actor/character pair), the pair for us as moviegoers. Its called bracketing and is engineered cinematic storytelling at its finest.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

","This wonderful movie is the kind to which the epithet 'heartwarming' can be applied without making you want to reach for the sick-bag. It's a tear-jerker but it manipulates your emotions very skillfully; (it's got a cast of very fine actors who never succumb to the sentimentality factor). It purports to be the story of the real-life, (and legendary), racehorse Seabiscuit but really it's the story of three men whose lives become intrinsically linked through the horse. I suppose what it's really about is family; these men are lost boys who find in each other the families they have lost and in the roles Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire give marvellous performances, (Cooper is quite magnificent), as well as being a history of America in the years following the Great Crash, and thanks to John Schwartzman's wonderful cinematography it looks absolutely gorgeous."

","Well, I bought the DVD after viewing it about 3 times from the library, so I must like it.<br/><br/>Horseapples to people who don't like it. Or ask for it to be less predictable. The original story is amazingly corny -- you'd never want to hire God as a script-writer, because he/she/it has got a very predictable sense of plot. And the parents never did come back. Asking for ""unpredictability"" in this story is like asking that the Titanic makes it to New York.<br/><br/>Had a lot of fun watching one of the 20 horses that played SeaBisquit perform the actions that the actors had discussed. In the final scene, Bisquit #19 or 17 or whatever, filmed in slow motion, visibly and clearly changes leads. It's easy for a horse to do -- it's exactly like the little hop a soldier, having gotten out of step on parade, performs to get back into step. But it may not always be so easy to film.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper's ""Turn him loose!"" is a nod to the same cry from his character in ""Time to Kill."" Cooper's great. My three fav actors are Chris Cooper, Chris Walken and Geoffrey Rush. We will, of course, never see them in the same scene together, because that would be -- ahem, considering so many of Walken's roles -- overkill.<br/><br/>The movie shamelessly uses music, cuts and timing to get your heart-rate up. So? It's a lot more entertaining than the usual snore that goes into an action film. It's about massive rhino relatives pelting down a track at 35 miles an hour -- and the tiny fragile monkeys who should not even be daring to be on top of them, let alone controlling them with a couple of little leather strings. No one can display how dangerous this is -- although SB makes a good try. In no other movie will you see a horse displayed as powerfully and unintentionally deadly as it can be -- rearing to dinosaur height, slamming down like a pile driver, screaming like Godzilla, and, merely by running like a scared cat, carom-ming a mere little human off a wall like a hair-ribbon. My back is the way it is because of a horse-roll. Edited or not, I watch that scene through my fingers.<br/><br/>(I once baby-sat a 17-hand horse. Believe me, War Admiral, at 18 hands, is indeed a Monster.) It's about the horses. Shamelessly. Everybody else should be getting second billing.<br/><br/>This movie never fails to be watchable.<br/><br/>Which is why I bought the DVD."
"RT Firefly","Null","10","24","13 August 2003"," The pinnacle of Hollywood tomfoolery
","I remember a Three Stooges short where whenever Curley would see cheese, he would freak out and the only way to calm him down was to rub a tassel under his chin. Never mind the fact that I enjoyed that more than Seabiscuit, I was struck that in much the same way it seems writer/director/producer/Clinton speech writer Gary Ross thinks he can keep his audience from revolting by using slick cinematography and Irish penny whistles in the movie Seabiscuit. <br/><br/>This movie is cheese, but it's tricky little tassels did not fool me or calm me down. I use the term 'movie' loosely, as one would in regards to a two hour political commercial. ""Their candidate wants to kill your pets with a giant knife! Our candidate wants to give everybody a hug and free money."" I was eager to see this film going in; I thought the trailer looked fantastic, I enjoy sentimental feel good films, if done well, the cast was great, wonderful story etc... But halfway through Seabiscuit, mind you, not knowing who made the film, I leaned over to the person with me and said, ""was this directed by Bill Clinton?"" When I got home I looked it up. I was close, one of his speech writers. That Seabiscuit is not panned across the board is a tragic sign at how effective the media has become at lulling people, especially it's own, into a false sense of superiority. I mean that. Many a demagogue has taken advantage of such weaknesses.<br/><br/>This is NOT a good movie. It is hardly even a movie. It is a set of images and messages, most unrelated and pointless, meant to stimulate your feel good senses like a political speech. The true story of Seabiscuit is one of the most inspiring movie ideas in decades. It is almost a guaranteed hit. Almost. Leave it to Spielberg's buddies (producers) Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall to drop the ball. Can you say ""Congo""? I know this sounds snobby, and I hate snobs, but this film can only be enjoyed by the very simple. I'm not talking about Capra-corn like simple, my favorite film is It's a Wonderful Life, I'm talking about Rambo III like simple. Independence Day simple. Propaganda simple. I present the following to make my case:<br/><br/>Exhibit A: The screenplay: it stunk. Ross wrote it. In lieu of possible elements like, oh, say  character development? he uses a narrator. On a side note, Ross foolishly employs David McCullough from Ken Burns epic civil war series. This made the film feel like it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a documentary or a feature film. (Back to the horrible writing) Using a narrator was nothing more than a diversion to cover up the fact that Ross couldn't convert the information in the best selling book to dialog. Every time the narrator spoke it took you out of the movie and made you think of the documentary. It did not fit with this format. Here's a thought, Gary, have the characters or action explain the story.. Imagine if a similar film, say Rocky, had a narrator.<br/><br/>Exhibit B: Pacing: most of the scenes, especially in the beginning, were choppy and too fast. As mentioned, the narration also ruins the pace. Is this the editors fault? I don't know, but it drove me crazy. Not that good pacing will fix a story that isn't making sense.<br/><br/>Exhibit C: Directing: many of the characters show confusing emotions for unexplained reasons, except, perhaps, to manipulate gullible audience members. At any rate, much of the emotions make no sense. A good example of this is the ""poetry at the dinner table"" scene. It is downright laughable. Red's mother told his father Red needed to earn a horse, not just be given one. So the father makes young Red earn his horse by reciting a poem from memory, which he cannot do. The father finishes the poem for Red and suddenly everyone at the table is cheering and Red gets his horse. What? Did I miss something here? If you don't think about it, however, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Exhibit D: Story line: It had too many, a problem that seems to plague modern film making. Pick a storyline and stick with it. It's like the clowns that make Dumbo jump from the elephants, ""If 40 feet was funny, 80 feet will be twice as funny!"" So far as I can tell there were no less than five story lines in Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>Exhibit E: Cinematography: Stunning, like in one of those fancy orange juice commercials. In fact, too good. Too perfect, too contrived, too Pepperidge Farms (fancy commercial in the US). It was obvious it was there for me to admire, not to communicate the story. <br/><br/>Exhibit F:Soundtrack: I found the soundtrack to be inappropriate to the action. From the beginning it felt like I was watching the ending of the movie. Obvious, sappy, manipulative and annoying. I expected a slow-motion pan of an Indian crying while trash is thrown from cars.<br/><br/>Closing arguments: This film's failure can be summed up by it's 'chock-full-o' style imagery. There were too many pointless close ups of cool looking props. I felt like I was watching a gay rodeo. Certain shots seemed to be included for no other reason than that they looked cool. Never mind the fact that it creates a red herring for the viewer. But apparently, if peoples positive comments on the IMDb can be trusted, making sense is not high on anyone's priority list. I therefore ask the jury to find the defendant, Gary Ross, guilty of crappy film making and that Seabiscuit be given the maximum punishment of a 1 (awful) rating."
"Li-1","Null","5","10","6 May 2004"," A bit dry, but still a decent feel good drama.
","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is the epitome of the kind of film the Oscars generally award: it's packed with respected and talented actors, it's an underdog story, and it's a ""biopic"" of sorts. But in this day and age, it apparently takes a little more oomph than this kind of film has to take home the best picture statuette (this was easily the least critically acclaimed of all the films nominated for best picture in 2003).<br/><br/>But it's also those same elements that make Seabiscuit an appealing film, one that's generally easy to enjoy and appreciate. The film tells the story of three men in the 1930s Depression-era whose lives merge after they've been beset by tragedy and heartbreak. Self-made millionaire Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) takes an interest in horse racing and hires Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) as the trainer. Smith is a tad old, but it's the horse and jockey that spectators question. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is too tall and the horse, Seabiscuit, is too small, but Smith sees the same fighting spirit in both of them and sets out to make winners of this unlikely pairing.<br/><br/>And since this is clearly the story of underdogs who give their all, there's nary a single moment in this film that's not predictable or even slightly manipulative in one fashion or another. In a less well-crafted and well-acted film, such blatant incursions would have been unforgivable, but the film succeeds admirably for the majority of its running time.<br/><br/>I still have a number of issues with the film, namely in its opening 1/3, which sets up the lives of our protagonists. Pollard's, in particular, is probably given too much extraneous focus; early scenes with his parents, obviously meant to tug the heart, just don't have that effect because we don't know these people. Worse yet, there's no emotional payoff, when the parents say ""We'll be back"" but we ultimately end up never hearing from them again, I wondered why writer/director Gary Ross went to the trouble of even including his parents in the picture (the later quotes from famous works of literature that Pollard recites from his childhood adds absolutely nothing to the picture).<br/><br/>In comparison, the film's more interesting characters, Charles Howard and especially Tom Smith, are given the short shrift, particularly Smith, whose brief set up mostly consists of him riding and lassoing horses. Unsurprisingly, because they've got more interesting (in quality, certainly not in quantity) material to work with, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper deliver far superior performances over Tobey Maguire. It's a bit unfair to compare Maguire to two highly experienced pros, but in this day and age when child actors can hold their own among the older crowd (as Max Pirkis amazingly did in Master and Commander), I expect more from even a dullard like Maguire.<br/><br/>The training scenes are among the film's most amusing, best of all is a hilarious off-screen encounter between Seabiscuit (the horse) and a goat. The payoff is predictable, but undeniably priceless. The film's horse races are directed with a nice sense of energy and are sometimes a little suspenseful even when the outcome is never in doubt. Marring such scenes are the obvious moments when camera angles are used to obscure the fact that a stunt double is being used in the more dangerous moments instead of Maguire. <br/><br/>The film slowly stumbles in its final act, which drags interminably until we reach the admittedly rousing and triumphant finish, which wisely concludes before the proceedings get sentimental. This is not the masterpiece the studio would like you to believe and it lacks much of the passion that the best underdog stories have, but it's still a decent accomplishment that displays strong efforts from almost all involved."

","I feel a little guilty for not liking this movie more because it's so obviously ""nice"" and ""uplifting."" However, for something to be ultimately uplifting it must have some real sense of sorrow. In this I felt sorry for characters and events but the movie demanded no emotional investment whatsoever. It has a good period look and feeling but a very superficial gloss that prevents any immediacy of experience. The races look way too fake, especially the conversations between riders. Randy Newman's wafty weepy score just adds to the corn syrupy goo. The performances by this talented cast are absolutely static. The best performances come from the horses, but even they sometimes seem unnatural and plastic."

","The larger-than-life titled racehorse gets the royal treatment in this would-be-masterpiece from director Gary Ross (who had an electric debut with ""Pleasantville"" back in 1998). ""Seabiscuit"" is one of those long and sometimes nearly excruciating exercises that ultimately ends up trying to do too much to be a complete success. It is the Depression-era in the United States and the country is literally staggering to survive economically and personally. A youngster (the character grows to be Tobey Maguire) leaves his family so he can work with horses and eventually becomes a jockey that struggles with his weight and the emotional losses he has suffered. Old, washed-up horse trainer Chris Cooper becomes little more than a vagrant as the Depression hits and tries to keep his sanity by working with the animals he loves. Self-made man Jeff Bridges does not get hurt economically, but loses his only son in a freak accident and sinks into a personal depression as his wife leaves him as well. Soon though all three men will be brought together via an old horse that has never been nurtured and treated the way he should have been. What follows is a long and emotional journey for the major players as they all attempt to turn their lives around with the help of the famed horse. Bridges finds love again with a much younger beauty (Elizabeth Banks) and one of Maguire's rivals (Gary Stevens) also becomes a prominent figure as the film hits its climax. In the 1930s the press (sleazy radio personality William H. Macy in particular) had a field day with the horse, making comparisons between the animal and the way that most in the country had also fought back from hardships. ""Seabiscuit"" is one of those near misses. It is a would-be dramatic powerhouse that loses its way with an annoying narration, a climax that comes way too early (a syndrome with Hollywood products these days) and unsteady direction by Ross. The screenplay (also by Ross) goes too much for forced comedy and that gets in the way of its dramatic momentum. Bridges and Cooper are very solid, but Maguire disappoints here. There are several performers who would have been better suited for his role really. I still liked the movie in spite of numerous problems, but it is not near as impressive as the film-makers had hoped it would be. 4 stars out of 5."

"moonspinner55","5","5","11","30 October 2005"," It's smothered in good taste...
","From Laura Hillenbrand's factual book about Seabiscuit the racehorse, a small and incorrigible animal in the 1940s overcoming all expectations once he hits the racetrack. Tobey Maguire is the horse's hot-tempered jockey, Jeff Bridges plays the rogue-ish owner, Chris Cooper is the wily trainer. The acting is above-average, the cinematography and technical aspects are very high, but this hackneyed script is a hurdle for all concerned. Director Gary Ross goes for a burnished, gleaming-copper look and feel, yet he can't seem to overcome the timeworn clichés, depressingly in place right from the start. Overlong film takes a good while to get cracking, and once it does it resorts to obvious (and annoying) plot devices. This seems much more ""Hollywood"" than any factual account, with smothering good taste but little personality. ** from ****"

","I don't know what Hollywood has against Tom Smith, the highly talented trainer of Seabiscuit, but he has been both ignored and slandered in two movies about that remarkable horse (The Story of Seabiscuit 1949 and Seabiscuit 2003). In The Story of Seabiscuit, Barry Fitzgerald replaced him with an Irishman, whose daughter (played by a mature Shirley Temple) believed in 'the little people' (ugh!). In Seabiscuit, Smith was reduced to a character who said little and frowned a lot, and who added very little to the picture. In the movie's crucial scenes, when Seabiscuit was recuperating from a ruptured tendon in his right foreleg, Smith was absent. This wasn't one of Chris Cooper's memorable roles. For the record, Seabiscuit's success in racing and recuperation from a potentially career ending injury was attributable to Smith and not to jockey Red Pollard, as depicted in the movie. In reality, Pollard took orders from Smith about how to ride the Biscuit, and he rode Seabiscuit in grand style, but he wasn't the loose cannon and miracle worker as portrayed by Tobey Maguire. In the movie, Pollard blew a race at the finish line and blamed it on blindness in his right eye. The real-life Pollard blew the race also, but he never revealed his handicap to anyone as long as he raced because he knew his career would be over. A blind jockey is a danger to himself, to the other jockeys and to the horses. The real Charles Howard would never have allowed Pollard to continue to race if he had known that Pollard was blind. In the movie, Pollard was injured while exercising a horse, and the doctor was concerned that he would never walk again. In truth, Pollard was injured much worse. The doctors were afraid that he wouldn't live because of a crushed chest and other fractures. He and Seabiscuit experienced remarkable recoveries; Pollard because of the love and care of his nurse (whom he later married), and Seabiscuit because of Smith's knowledge and love of horses. While the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral was exciting, if you want to see the actual race, see The Story of Seabiscuit. George Wolf, the jockey who rode Seabiscuit during that race was believed by many to be the greatest jockey of his time. He rode Seabiscuit several times while Pollard was recuperating. The scene where Seabiscuit reacts to Pollard after they both were disabled is Hollywood at its worst. Seabiscuit loved to race; he didn't care who was aboard when the gates opened. After their deaths, bronze statues of both Seabiscuit and Wolf were dedicated at Santa Anita Race Track. Laura Hillenbrand, the author of the wonderful book on which Seabiscuit is based, is listed as the movie's technical adviser. I wonder how she feels about the soap opera they made of her masterpiece."

","I can't believe how easily people are taken in by this trite piece of cinematography. Formulaic, patronizing, and cheap are a few words that come to mind when I think of Sea Biscuit. This has nothing whatsoever to offer. Any message of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity was lost in the 45 minutes of black white montages. And another thing, were does empathy come in? How are we supposed to care about any of the characters in this film? Granted what happened to Bridges' character was tragic, but everybody has had their share of tragedy in life.  I apologize if I fail to empathize with a fifty year old millionaire with a trophy wife, hundreds of acres of land, and horse trainer who utters little nuggets of wisdom like: `Horses still crap in the barn, well they do.' And McGuire's closing monologue was the proverbial salt in the wound: `We didn't fix Sea Biscuit, Sea Biscuit fixed us. And in way we all fixed each other.' This phrase seems more fitting on a bumper sticker or in a episode of Full House rather than a `Oscar Worthy Film'."

","""Seabiscuit"" is a lot of fun.  If a few swear words were taken out, it would be a good G-rated Disney movie.  Of all the actors in the movie, I was really impressed with Gary Stevens' portrayal of jockey George Wolff.  Turns out Stevens IS a jockey in real life.  Good performances all around, even from the horses.  I liked this movie.<br/><br/>Oh wait.  One thing I didn't like.  Randy Newman's soundtrack.  Not the soundtrack itself, but the way it was used.  It was overwhelming during some scenes."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","23 December 2003"," Truly fine dramatic movie of a real horse, and the real people he helped save.
","Set mainly between 1910 and 1938, the movie 'Seabiscuit' is about a racehorse that waited to show his stuff until the right set of people came along. Jeff Bridges plays the owner who had been despondent after losing his young son in a car accident. Chris Cooper plays the horse trainer who had lost his 'west' as fences went up and motorcars began spoiling the plains. Tobey Maguire plays the jockey, too tall and almost too heavy, and who had lost his family during the depression, leaving him to ride horses, essentially deserting him. This unlikely trio recognized the potential of this ornery and too small horse, and together they made racing history.<br/><br/>
Gary Ross wrote and directed, based on a best-selling book. Ross also was responsible for 'Pleasantville', one of my favorite movies, as well as being the screenwriter for two other smart comedies, 'Big' with Tom Hanks and 'Dave' with Kevin Kline. So it came as no surprise that I really enjoyed 'Seabiscuit.' This is an old-fashioned movie where time is taken to develop characters and tell a good story. At key points in the movie we also see authentic B&W stills from the era, which adds to the realism. Overall, one of the better movies of 2003.<br/><br/>The DVD is beautifully done, with a sharp picture and realistic surround sound. During the racing scenes, you can actually feel the pounding on the track. The 'making of' extra is also worth a look, as is the feature on Seabiscuit, with racing film from his heyday."

","This movie was an agony to watch. You always know what's about to happen, and keep watching only because you hope there will be at least some plot twist or surprising event along the way, but no. It goes just as all those other Hollywood sport hero movies and bores you to tears. <br/><br/>The script is dull. It just picks events here and there along the time line and fails to create any suspense. Directing isn't all that inspired either. So the story gets just told and that's all.<br/><br/>The actors do an OK job considering the circumstances, but can't save the movie. Tobey Maguire even manages to create some depth into the character of jockey Red Pollard, but generally the characters remain paper thin.<br/><br/>Usually, when a movie doesn't seem interesting after 20 minutes or so, I stop watching, but this one had been praised so much, that I had to see if there's anything in it. But the longer I watched, the more disappointed I got, and It was relief when the movie finally ended."
"carsch","2","7","19","25 January 2004"," Over rated
","I saw this movie a month after it came out and only saw it because of all the hype about it saying that this was one of the best movies ever. After I was done watching the movie, I was left wondering if I had seen the same film.<br/><br/>First, the movie is way too long. The first half hour or so is a boring preamble about the Great Depression. Everyone who has had high school history knows what the depression was like, so we don't need a narrator to remind us! I remember looking at my watch several times during the movie wondering when the movie would actually start.<br/><br/>Second, although the actors in the movie are very good, the material that they are given are not. We are supposed to root for Tobey Macquire and Jeff Bridge's characters, but they are both so pathetic that I couldn't make myself feel empathy for them. The best performances in this movie were given by Gary Stevens, who is a professional jockey and not an actor and the horse who plays Seabiscuit, who is in fact a HORSE. Perhaps it is appropriate in a movie like this that a horse upstages the lead actors, but I would have expected Jeff Bridges and Tobey Macquire to put up a little more effort.<br/><br/>Finally, I didn't like the movie because it was framed like a history channel documentary. The movie has a narrator and the effect of the narrator being there was that I felt that I was watching some kind of afterschool History Channel documentery rather than watching these great events unfolding. The narration made the action so much more stale.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am the only person in the world who didn't like this movie. There is and was so much hype surrounding this film that people seem to have lost track of the fact that it isn't that good. It would be a shame if the movie wins any awards."

Seabiscuit also has a very good soundtrack and the race sequences are gripping.

"FlorianSchirner","9","3","6","1 February 2008"," Corny, predictable, flat and just simply wonderful!!!
","Yes, you read my summary right. Viewed objectively the story is like any other sports underdog story. Many lines (especially Charles Howard) are so corny you almost cannot believe it. And though the characters are brilliantly played and have nice background, they are not very deeply detailed.<br/><br/>But...and this is a serious but, this movie made me watch it over 20 times now, 5 times in the cinema alone. Why is that?<br/><br/>My guess is its beauty. This movie reminds me in its slow pace and wonderful scenery of some Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood movies. The pace really brings out the shots and thus even contains the corny dialogs in a sense where you can hear them and they fit.<br/><br/>Then there is, almost as a contrapunction, the fast and wonderfully shot race scenes.<br/><br/>Another reason may be the acting. I would not say that Bridges or Maguire or Cooper deliver performances never to be topped, but they are their characters and you believe in them. That is what an actor should do. Apart from the three leads I always was enraptured by Elizabeth Banks, who fills her role with only a few lines to say. And a surprise for me was to hear that Gary Stevens, the actor of George Wolfe, wasn't an actor at all but a professional jockey. He delivers a great performance for an amateur.<br/><br/>Then there is the nice collage of still photographs of the depression era overlaying the narration by McCullough, which is just great. m<br/><br/>All in all this is one of the movies of my collection that will be watched over and over again."

However movies in the 30's or 40's would NOT have had a scene with the jockey visiting a prostitute and her taking her shirt off. A movie in the 30's and 40's would NOT have had the characters saying the Lord's name in vain 20 times during the picture. If the producers of Seabisquit had been wise they would have eliminated the superfluous prostitute scene and the curses and then this movie would have been one I could have taken my children to see. As it was I am glad I went alone to see it to check it out first. I felt sorry for the parents in the audience who had taken young children to see the film, thinking they were going to see a wholesome picture.<br/><br/>Hollywood, listen up.

Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing, where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity. This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers; homilies are handed out like parking tickets. And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker, and most of them get to deliver many more. ""Seabiscuit"" isn't even really a bad movie--it's an uninteresting movie, which is much worse.

","I just saw Seabiscuit at a preview show in Germany. At the end of the movie, people were clapping. But - patriots beware - it was highly ironical. You cannot image how my friends and I burst out in laughter during various stages. Really, this is a movie that it so bad that you cannot do anything else than laugh. Did the filmmakers take this movie seriously? I couldn't.<br/><br/>If you like horses or jockeys, or if you are a true American patriot, this movie is for you. In almost every other case, avoid it at any costs.<br/><br/>The 9-11 references are obvious. I don't have a problem with that, but the dull dialogues are extremely clichÃ©d. They even reminded me of 'Pearl Harbour', that other movie I loved so much. (warning: irony). It seems obvious that a Hollywood movie such as this doesn't want to provoke (it's about horses, you know). However, the references to the American dream and christianity (the coin scene at the end) are so damn ridiculous and foreseeable. In several scenes, Jeff Bridges even looks like king George W. Bush the great master himself. The movie tries so hard to have depth, and it fails miserably. The movie definitely is destined at Bush-followers, but in this context, the history scenes that show the effects of the Great Depression and which praise the New Deal are out of place. If Bush, Cheney & co had lived during the FDR presidency, they would have attacked the New Deal as 'socialist policies' without a doubt. The pseudo-intellectual references to British and American literature are a desperate try to put some credibility in a story that is, over all, BORING. And it is way too long. I wished at so many points of the film that just something happens: an UFO landing, Godzilla or something. JUST SOMETHING! After going out of the cinema, I have to admit that I had the urge to eat some horse sausage. This movie is a good example of the mindless mainstream stuff that is not for people who actually want to THINK about the society they live in but for those who want to feel good, especially for themselves. I understand that a lot of Americans need that feeling after 9-11. But in liberal and left-leaning parts of the US and in most foreign countries, this movie will make people laugh at the ignorant and naive Americans who still believe in the perfect stereotpyical American dream - or it will make people cry in disbelief. However, leaving 9-11 behind, this is a well-made movie - for horse lovers."

","For his sophomore effort, director Gary Ross re-teams with Tobey Maguire and William H.

Unlike 1949's fictionalized The Story of Seabiscuit starring Shirley Temple, this version attempts to present a factual account of the story, which centers around the three men who saw the famed horse to victory.This biographical sports drama film based on the best-selling non-fiction book Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand. The film is loosely based on the life and racing career of Seabiscuit, an undersized and overlooked thoroughbred race horse, whose unexpected successes made him a hugely popular media sensation in the United States during the Great Depression.Jeff Bridges,Chris Cooper and Elizabeth Banks co-star to play key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Charles Howard is an entrepreneur who owns the unlikely racehorse. Howard teams with partially blind boxer-turned-jockey Red Pollard and horse trainer Tom Smith. Together, the three work to help the famed horse to several symbolic victories that helped to inspire a downtrodden 1930s America.<br/><br/>It's inspiring despite a sobering thesis: The future is intoxicating, but progress is a kind way of rendering someone's livelihood obsolete. Gary Ross probed the underdog principle's heart: Success outside the comfort zone is the sweetest of all.It may not be a work of great art but it tells its solid story with grace and dignity.And most of all,this is a great story of American entrepreneurship, optimism, and resilience.It definitely is an epic treatment of a spirit-lifting figure in sports history."
"classicalsteve","10","2","4","21 May 2012"," Story of the Most Intiguing and Popular Celebrity Figure of the 1930's in the US was not a Human but a Horse
","A four-legged animal who couldn't read and write, couldn't be elected to office, and couldn't speak at press conferences (although he seemed to drink in celebrity like Clark Gable) was quite possibly the most intriguing figure in the United States during the Great Depression. Shirley Temple may have been his only rival. According to Laura Hillenbrand, the author of the book ""Seabiscuit"" on which this film was based, the race horse Seabiscuit was the most written about individual during his era in terms of how much newspaper real estate was devoted to him. Apparently, President Roosevelt was second. The film in question is a wonderful dramatization/docudrama of possibly the greatest race horse who ever ran.<br/><br/>The film begins unexpectedly like a Ken Burns documentary with the calming yet compelling voice of David McCullough of PBS fame, known for his narration of Burns-PBS' ""The Civil War"". The film introduces three interesting aspects of American life at the beginning of the 20th century: the rise of the automobile, the obsession with horse racing, and finally the Great Depression. Instead of merely engaging in a chronological history of Seabiscuit and his owner Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), his trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and his jokey Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire), the film sets out to establish a context for the story. One of the recurring themes of the story of Seabiscuit is how the horse, at first dismissed as having no racing potential, symbolized hope for a broken down nation, and how he beat the odds at nearly every turn of the race track.<br/><br/>After the historical subtext is established, the film moves between three different stories: the eventual owner Charles Howard who became a successful automobile salesman in the 1920's, Tom Smith, a down-on-his-luck trainer who was regarded as an eccentric by others in the racing world, and Red Pollard who began life in a middle-class family in Canada. Pollard's family would eventually lose almost everything due to the Depression and were forced to part ways with their son when he is offered a job at a race track. Pollard was also a part-time boxer.<br/><br/>The three lives eventually slide into one another, almost offhandedly, along with the devastation of the Depression. When Tom Smith first sees Seabiscuit, he notices something, a rare spirit, an undefinable ""attitude"". Smith isn't sure what it is, but he believes deep within the horse is something untapped and unappreciated. He then informs Howard that the horse may be worth further exploration.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit was not like his forebears Hard Tack and Man o' War. He was small for a horse, only 15 hands long. Most champion race horses were 17 hands or larger. His rival War Admiral, a second cousin, was a full 18 hands long. He was also thought to be lazy and overfed. And he was a handful for anyone trying to race him. He was thought a failure by his first owner and sold to Charles Howard for $8000, regarded as a low price for a race horse at the time. Smith finds Pollard and eventually, these four interesting and unlikely characters are brought together: Howard, Smith, Pollard and of course Seabiscuit. And then something unexpected and magical begins to occur. After early success, Howard begins to make overtures toward the owner of War Admiral who at first dismisses him. But at some point, he realizes he can't dismiss Howard forever.<br/><br/>One of the great inspirational movies of the early 21st century, and may have won Best Picture for 2003 if it hadn't been up against some tough competition, particularly the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King whose other two installments had been up for Best Picture in previous years. ""Seabiscuit"" the film couldn't quite beat 2003's War Admiral, the Lord of the Rings, but the fact is the film is still an absolute triumph. The acting is absolutely on the money, although none of the leading human players were nominated since there was no award for Best Performance by an Animal in a Leading Role. I have seen people who never cared much for horse racing literally stand up and yell ""Go Seabiscuit!"" when they see this film. Without question, Seabiscuit the horse is the star of the show. All the others are merely supporting players. On a personal note, one of my grandfather's articles is referenced in the original book, describing the enthusiastic return of Seabiscuit to the so-called ""Hundred Grander"", one of the last races portrayed in the film."

A horse which was almost always neglected foul minded along with the jockey who had been beaten up all throughout his childhood team up to become a legendary combination. But the most pertinent question is who made this possible off course the trainer who in this movie had been shown as an extraordinary trainer but very subtle in his role but a little banged up in life like everyone else. <br/><br/>A banged up owner reeling from his own personal shock of recession and most importantly the loss of his own son finds a son in the Jockey and takes him as his own which is very visible at the end of the last race. He finds the trainer who is beaten up in life down but not out. They team up and teach the beaten up pony and lets him become a horse again after a banged up life. The pony goes on to become the greatest race horse. <br/><br/>The best dialog of the movie is the last one it summarizes the movie in itself. Yes I agree that though people used to say that they found up a broken horse and fixed it but in a way it fixed them too. Man and Animal reunited. Lets cheer for such a great movie. I am lucky I watched it."

","Its a well made film that reminds me of a PBS special in both good ways and bad ways.<br/><br/>I know several people who are raving about it and how wonderful it is. Personally I've seen better.<br/><br/>There are a couple of problems with the movie, the first is that you know how its going to end. You know this for two reasons, first they don't make big feel good dramas about losers, and second the movie is so manipulative you know where its going.all you have to do is listen to the music.<br/><br/>The movie is too long by at least twenty minutes, probably more, my interest only took hold about 45 minutes in.<br/><br/>To say the women in this movie are give the short shrift is being kind, they do nothing, look good, and little else. Then again this is a movie of few words by numerous longing looks. Everyone looks but very few say anything or do anything. Frankly without the narration (PBS anyone?) the film would sink under its own weight.<br/><br/>There is either too much back story, the first half hour, or not enough. I kept feeling that this is a longer film waiting to break out.<br/><br/>Technically three and a half stars, story and emotionally two and a half.

It's mostly a subtle and calm movie but it's enough that there are 3 main races that add the exact amount of dynamics that is needed to satisfy the audience.

"bob the moo","Null","2","4","4 January 2007"," A professional feel-good true story that is entertaining despite lacking depth
","The country is booming and the future looks bright until, that is, the depression hits and near everyone finds their fortunes change for the worse. Rich families struggle to stay rich while the working men find themselves defining ""home"" in an entirely different way than they once did. Charles Howard loses his son in the one of the very machines that he made his fortune selling and loses his way until he meets a new woman. The depression forces Red Pollard's family to let him stay with a horse-owning family so that he has a shot at a better life, while former horse trainer Tom Smith takes to riding the box carts looking for work. These three men cross paths years later when Howard decides to get into horses thanks to the influence of his new wife. Together they take on their undersized horse and over-sized jockey to go against the odds against the background of a country trying to get back on its feet.<br/><br/>Despite being a best picture contender of a few years ago I never got round to seeing this film as it didn't really appeal to me but, screened as it was in the middle of the afternoon during Christmas it made for more of a proposition. The opening credits reveal how the telling is going to go as it all starts with a slightly sentimental approach of history around the depression. This continues with a rather sanitised view of history that focuses on the story surrounding this famous horse. The story is a simplified but effect one of ""losers"" overcoming the odds in an allegory for the American spirit and the country coming out of the Depression. This is a big aim and of course aspects suffer as a result of it trying to be out so much. The emotions never get deeper than the superficial and sweeping but the film is glossy and professional enough to get away with this and produce a feel-good film with its hooves in a true story.<br/><br/>The casting matches this by being impressive as professionals even if nobody really excels in their performance. Maguire is a good lead even if his character doesn't give him a huge amount to work with at times. Bridges and Cooper are better simply because they have stronger characters. All three of them are best in the moments where they get to look into the middle distance with a sense of pride while the music swells  it is that type of movie and they all work to that well enough. Support is mostly good but they are all doing the same. Ross writes and directs well; he can't find the depth in any part of it but the film looks great and is professional and slick  just what the material required.<br/><br/>Not a great film then but an unsurprising nominee for best picture at the Oscars. It does raise the spirits and it works really well at the superficial level with a great sweep to it helping to compensate for the lack of depth within the story and characters."
"mlevans","9","2","4","15 February 2005"," Seabiscuit is a real treat
","One thing is certain: Martin Scorsese could never have directed Seabiscuit! Scorsese would have been absolutely lost, trying to direct a biopic about decent, genuinely likable characters. That is certainly part of Seabiscuit's magic. <br/><br/>Another ingredient is the classic American sports movie motif of never giving up, rolling with the punches and regaining self-respect. When that motif is extended and given the much broader and more poignant association with the nation as a whole, grappling with the Great Depression, one really has a story that grabs and holds the audience.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is a joy to watch for several reasons. In addition to those already alluded to, the film is also exquisitely shot and edited and extremely well-acted. It is also very historically accurate.<br/><br/>While director Gary Ross and his cohort on the DVD commentary stress that the protagonists are all flawed, contrary to today's popular Hollywood assembly line style, they are still very decent, likable people. I find it very difficult to avoid using the term 'likeable' over and over in recounting the film and its characters.<br/><br/>Start with Charles Howard. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of the self-made auto magnate, turned horse owner is brilliant. He captures all the nuances as Howard fights his way up in true Horatio Alger style, then finds his success empty after his son is killed and his marriage disintegrates. Ross, in his commentary, talks considerably about Howard healing himself as he reaches out to help others in the story.<br/><br/>Helping HIM heal is Marcella (Elizabeth Banks), a young beauty, but also an extremely kind, determined woman. I absolutely fell in love with Banks as Mrs. Howard  and considering how highly I regard Howard, I felt good seeing him marry her.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is brilliant as jockey Johnnie 'Red' Pollard, a down-on-his-luck jockey who has to scrap as a boxer to get by and Chris Cooper is wonderful as iconoclastic trainer Tom Smith. Real-life jockey Gary Stephens, meanwhile, adds realism and a surprisingly natural stage presence as legendary jockey George Woolf.<br/><br/>Flawed antagonists? Certainly. Howard finds that his faith in technology and corporate America have left him alone and shaken. Maguire, hurting over the breakup of his family as a youth and his hard knock life, is too proud to accept help at first and has a hair-trigger temper. Smith is a man whose day has passed and one who doesn't connect with others like Howard does. Of course Seabiscuit himself fits this mold.<br/><br/>Yet their flaws only make them more real. Together, as Ross notes on the commentary, these unlikely partners help heal each other and the broken down racehorse. Scorsese would be lost with these characters.<br/><br/>The film tells the consummate American success story. Just glancing at titles of message board entries, I see that many are quick to pick up on this and dis the film for it. I suppose for those who dislike America, capitalism and/or underdog stories, the film WOULD be a bit disagreeable. Howard, apparently true to his real-life persona, is a kind, caring, fatherly figure of a capitalist. True, not all US business moguls were gold-hearted Daddy Warbucks', but Howard typified the best of this breed. He really believed in the American success story after arriving in San Francisco with twenty-one cents to his name.<br/><br/>Promoting Seabiscuit was more an act of spreading his personal gospel of determination and self-worth to a beleaguered country than it was a money-making or ego-enhancing venture.<br/><br/>While many readersboth American and foreignmay not want to hear this, this was a story that COULD only have happened in America. And, as we know, it really DID happen there."

","What a heartwarmer! Seabiscuit is the ultimate underdog picture with no less than three tragedy-stricken ""losers"" making comebacks in racing and life.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is intensely sympathetic as the hard-knock jockey dealing with more than his share of tough breaks (though that thick shock of blindingly red hair takes a little getting used to); Chris Cooper's understated performance as the softspoken trainer with a magic touch keeps ""maudlin"" out of the reviewer's vocabulary; and Jeff Bridges is - well, Jeff Bridges in his ""power of positive thinking"" mode. William H. Macy nearly steals the show as a gimmicky sportscaster who speaks for the common man. Period touches are satisfying. Unfortunately, the only interesting woman in the film, Valerie Mahaffey as Bridges' first wife, departs about forty-five minutes in, leaving us with paper dolls (Bridges' bland second wife) and stereotypes (Macey's bored blonde wife.) Still, if you're looking to lift your spirits, Seabiscuit is the movie for you."

","I saw this movie and was extremely disappointed.  Seabiscuit is a fantastic story, and as I was reading the book I imagined the movie the whole way through.  Unfortunately, the movie did not reach expectations.  Nowhere in the entire film was it evident we were in depressed times, or, at least, clear of the hardships people were facing.  I felt detail was glossed over in favor of generic events that could have happened to any person or animal at any time.  The stakes were too low in this movie.  They showed Red Pollard vomiting to try and make weight, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.  Jockeys went through a lot worse at that time to get their weight down.  I thought performances were decent, and Chris Cooper stole the screen as Tom Smith.  Other than that, if you would like to see this movie, I recommend that you view Rudy or Hoosiers instead.  At least Rudy has a great soundtrack and Hoosiers has Gene Hackman.  Or just read the book."

Valerie Mahaffey is on hand as the owner's wife.<br/><br/>Based on the real story, ""Seabiscuit"" (2003) is reminiscent in tone of another timeless historical drama starring Bridges, ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream"" (1988) by Francis Ford Coppola. I prefer the underrated ""Tucker"" because it's snappier and less vague, but ""Seabiscuit"" ain't no slouch.<br/><br/>Like the historically-based ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) the manner of storytelling respects the intelligence of the viewer to sometimes read between the lines. One of the best parts is the build-up to the race with War Admiral and the thrilling race itself. Not knowing the real-life events, a couple of the twists were surprising.

","Until I saw movies like ""Secretariat"" and ""Seabiscuit"", I never considered that horses, or any other animals for that matter, would have a competitive racing spirit in them apart from a 'fight or flight' syndrome. That's an idea that comes out loud and clear in this picture, and only appreciated by a virtual handful of insiders like trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and jockeys Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) and George Woolf (Gary Stevens). They take their knowledge and understanding of horses and have the ability to turn them into undisputed champions on the track. With the lazy Seabiscuit, Tom had just the right prescription - ""He just needs to learn how to be a horse again.""<br/><br/>Set during the Depression era of the 1930's, Seabiscuit became an unlikely champion and symbol of hope for many Americans, just like boxer Jimmy Braddock did during that turbulent decade. Even today, the idea that forty million people would halt in their daily routine to 'hear the call' of a match race that transpired on November 1st, 1938 seems simply incredible. <br/><br/>For anyone who wants to take it a step further, the 1949 film, ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" contains the actual archival footage of the race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, along with the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap in which Seabiscuit made that dramatic comeback from a severe leg injury. It may not be as polished as this more modern day telling, but that in no way lessens the inspirational value of the story it tells. As an added bonus, the movie also contains an appearance by Shirley Temple in her next to last film."
"CubsandCulture","10","0","0","21 August 2018"," The pathos ages well...
","I saw this film when it first came out in 2003 and thought it was a rousing, slight underdog story, nothing more or less. But I recently re-watched it and I was struck by how much more I enjoyed the film the second go around. Yes the movie is a slice of Americana, and maybe a bit corny but there is darkness and surprising amount of depth here. A lot of it comes from irony and self-awareness of the screenplay; the use of narration debunking myths of that era encourages us to maybe not take everything that happens at face value. Likewise, there is a some undercurrents of cynicism about Howard's populism. In any case on the second watch I saw a lot more contradiction and humanity behind the rousing sentiment.<br/><br/>The film is extremely well edited. The racing scenes are very exciting but the film covers a lot of ground economically and there is a ton of interesting juxtapositions. A lot more dramatic weight is covered by how the events are put together. I must also say that the cinematography (and production design) is glorious. The rich hues of autumn infuse the film and it really looks like the depression. It was very striking to see this again as a it was no where near over saturated as I remember it. It's warm but not bright. Really top of the line work.<br/><br/>Lastly, I don't generally like Toby Maguire but he's really, really good in this film. He's period, harsh but decent, tough but kind and he's really sexy with red hair. I think Red might his best character. In the end this is a fine film, maybe a bit old fashioned, maybe a bit too PBS but enjoyable, moving and more complex than people give credit for."

","I don't usually rate movies with a 10, as 10 means this is as perfect as it can get and I don't see many of those, but this movie definitely fits the bill. This is an astoundingly great movie.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially about 4 people, plus a horse, who, against all odds somehow find each other.<br/><br/>Mr. Howard is a self-made wealthy man who, nonetheless, has had to try and overcome excruciating heartbreak in his life, to include the death of his young son, and the abandonment of his wife. Trying to live his life, but undoubtedly walking around in a funk, he somehow has the good fortune to meet a woman who brings him back to life. Add to that the chance meeting of a rather eccentric, but effective horse trainer in Tom Smith, a character who no one thinks much of but knows his horses. Finally a hurt, angry, rather overgrown jockey named Red Pollard, who is searching in vain for someone to believe in him, and give him a chance. Then there is the horse...Seabiscuit. Another mistreated, misunderstood animal who, nevertheless, has a competitive spirit and a longing for somewhere to belong (yeah, so I'm describing what a horse thinks and feels, but, so what...it's my review).<br/><br/>What struck me the most is the actors performances. You could see and feel that these characters all genuinely seemed to like each other. This brought me so close to the film and the characters. I cared for each of them, and I wanted them all to succeed...and succeed they did.<br/><br/>This was a pitch-perfect film. Everything about was just about perfect IMHO. Top rate direction, beautifully photographed, a look and feel of the times. Jeff Bridges was just perfect as Mr. Howard (he didn't overdo it, which he does sometimes - ""Arlington Road""; ""Blown Away""). His character was perfectly understated, but you found yourself caring a great deal for him. Chris Cooper gave an on-the-money performance as Tom Smith. Tobey McGuire was a great Red Pollard, and Elizabeth Banks perfectly rounded out the quintet as the second Mrs. Howard, who brought Bridges' character back to life.<br/><br/>The racing sequences were perfectly done, and thrilling to watch. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie played with my heartstrings, but it hit all the right notes. I still can't watch this without tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>Exceptional movie...Highly Recommended."
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","0","10 April 2017"," Tale of Four Underdogs
","Horse racing is one of a number of sports which, although immensely popular, only rarely serve as the inspiration for feature memorable films; other examples include cricket, rugby, tennis, golf, track-and-field and even soccer. ""Seabiscuit"", telling the story of a famous American racehorse from the 1930s, is one of the few exceptions. (Another film about Seabiscuit, which I have never seen, was made in the late forties).<br/><br/>Although Seabiscuit had a distinguished pedigree, he was at first regarded as an unpromising prospect. He was unusually small for a thoroughbred and had a difficult temperament. His owner Charles Howard and trainer Tom Smith, however, saw his potential, and eventually he became the best horse on the West Coast. In the thirties, however, this was little more than the equestrian equivalent of being a big fish in a small pond, as most of the great racing stables were in the East. Determined to prove Seabiscuit's status, Howard desperately tried to arrange a race against War Admiral, undoubtedly the greatest racehorse on the East Coast at this period. The media seized upon the story and started promoting the proposed race as a David-versus-Goliath clash, with Seabiscuit as the underdog, a champion of the little man in the days of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>The film is, in fact, the tale of four underdogs, the others being Howard, Smith and jockey Red Pollard. On the face of it, Howard, a millionaire car dealer and one of the wealthiest men in San Francisco, seems an unlikely underdog. He was, however, a self-made man and rather looked down on by the big East Coast owners, who tended to be old-money aristocrats like War Admiral's owner Samuel Riddle. He also faced problems in his personal life such as a divorce and the death of his son in a car accident. Smith, a man with a deep love for and knowledge of horses, is a virtual down-and-out before Howard hires him to manage his racing stables. Pollard is the son of a once-affluent Canadian family ruined by the Depression; he uses his skill as a horseman to make a career as a jockey, but at first has little success. He also tries his luck at boxing, but enjoys even less success at that, being left blind in one eye after one fight.<br/><br/>The film's main fault is that it is too long at both ends. Seabiscuit himself does not actually make an appearance until about forty-five minutes into the film; the early scenes are taken up with a rather leisurely exposition of the back-stories of the three main human characters. By rights, the climax of the film should be the duel with War Admiral which established Seabiscuit's claim to be the greatest racehorse in America. There would, however, be a problem with making this the climactic scene. Pollard, who had been injured in an accident shortly beforehand, did not actually ride Seabiscuit in this race. (He was ridden by George Woolf, a highly successful jockey whom it would be difficult to portray as an underdog). Now some scriptwriters would have had no compunction about rewriting the record-books so as to consign both Woolf and Pollard's injury to the dustbin of history, but this is a film which is more respectful of historical fact than some I could mention, possibly because it is based on a non-fiction book. The film-makers therefore obviously felt compelled to insert a lengthy coda dealing with Pollard's battle to return to fitness and with his victory in Seabiscuit's final race, and this coda inevitably comes as something of an anti-climax.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this is a visually attractive film and the racing scenes are exciting and well-handled. There are no outstanding acting performances- the human characters are generally outshone by the horse- but also no particularly bad ones. Overall, ""Seabiscuit"" is an enjoyable, heart-warming feel-good movie. Had it been a bit shorter it might have got a higher mark. 6/10 A goof. Riddle is confident that his horse will beat Seabiscuit because of his ""superior breeding"". In reality, an experienced owner like Riddle would have known that Seabiscuit came from the same illustrious bloodline as War Admiral. In human terms they were uncle and nephew, War Admiral being the son and Seabiscuit the grandson of Man o' War, one of the greatest American horses of all time."

","Seabiscuit is a heart warming story bringing together a team of underdogs who were given up on at one point in their lives. Millionaire owner Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) recruits horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), jockey Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire) and a horse named Seabiscuit to complete his horse racing team to fulfill a need in his life. Bridges, even though financially set, has his own demons after his son dies early in the film. Chris Cooper who was thought to be no longer a trainer of value and Tobey McGuire, thought to be too big in size for a jockey are the perfect metaphor for the people of the United States during the Great Depression. Many people were without and no future in mind. This true story shows no matter what life puts in front of you; never give up on yourself or others.<br/><br/>McGuire seems almost effortless as his portrayal as Red who was sent away by his family in a better life. Before riding Seabiscuit he had to fight literally in order to make money and live. McGuire's character has his own disability yet shows how the heart of a person outweighs all the negatives. McGuire bonds even more with Seabiscuit when accidents take them both out of racing for a short stint.<br/><br/>Writer and Director Gary Ross pulls Seabiscuit to life with his brilliant color choice and camera angles. He shows with bright beautiful colors the country before the depression and then the dark and gloomy outlook once the market crashed. Ross uses the colors black and white to emphasize good and evil between the rival horse War Admiral and Seabiscuit. Using red as a predominant color the movies show what a fighter McGuire's character is.<br/><br/>Also by using low and high camera angles Ross helps support the theme by showing how the team of Seabiscuit is not as strong as that of the War Admiral, including the owner. Ross shows the passion of Seabiscuit with close-ups of the horse's eyes.<br/><br/>In my own viewing experience, one of the only other movies that gives your heart such a roller-coaster ride as Seabiscuit is Rudy (1993). Both movies showing that size of an individual nor what gets thrown in front of you matter as much as your perseverance and never give up attitude.<br/><br/>All in all if this classic of the nineties does not make you believe you can do anything, I do not know what will."

","""Seabiscuit"" tells the inspiring tale of the most famous racehorse of all time. In this story, the fabled horse comes into the possession of mogul Charles Howard (played by Jeff Bridges). The man then assembles a team around Seabiscuit, with aging cowboy Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) as trainer and disabled but feisty jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire). The story builds up to the famous race in which the horse goes up against War Admiral, a larger champion horse. During the Depression, this horse race made a big splash as a ""David and Goliath"" contest. The cast turns in fine performances, and the story serves as a parable about overcoming all adversity and obstacles. It was a great message for the Depression, and still is today."

Charles Howard was in San Francisco by 1906 and helped with the earthquake showing horses can, at times be impractical. The fact he had more children was omitted. The movie opened with Howard in New York in 1910 and that's wrong too.

I'm sorry for being such a stickler for details, but it is my job. Also, there was a scene where Seabiscuit pulls the shirt off a jockey, which is an identical scene from the Australian movie-Pharlap-as a matter of fact some of the music from Pharlap was used-briefly in Seabiscuit.

","Fresh from his role as Spiderman, Tobey Maguire delivers his best performance he possibly ever gave in his career. Along with Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, he rules the screen as a horse jockey with incredible talent. Fans Of the book by Laura Hillenbrand will not be disappointed. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is a young man who would settle for any job offered to him in the Depression Era, and decided to be an exercise boy and stable cleaner. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a carmaker that has a knack for business, and after financial loss in the Stock Market as well as a personal loss, decided to change directions and train racehorses. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a trainer who liked to heal sick horses so he could let other trainers have a chance to train them. These three men all come together to train Seabiscuit. Seabiscuit is structured like your typical sports film, and it seems to move very slowly in the beginning. They introduce the areas and the times quite nicely, yet excessively. But as the film moves on, it runs much more smoothly as Seabiscuit's tale begins to unfold. Seabiscut himself is a small horse with an immense appetite. He has had many owners in the past, however they all gave up on him thinking that he would never be any good as a racehorse. They lowered his self-esteem tremendously by making him lose to other horses that they were breeding to gain their self-confidence. But this was all before he met three men who would care and love him and help make him a nationally loved sports figure. Since his self-esteem was lowered tremendously, once Red started to express his love and loyalty to Seabiscut, it almost seems as if Seabiscut has an inability to loose, even (and especially) when he is the underdog. (err underhorse?? Is that a word?) The race scenes are absolutely thrilling. Astounding. Spectacular! Pick any word you like! Cinematographer John Schwartzman gets amazingly close to the actors as they ride towards you. It's almost like being right at the gate at the races. Who knew Spidy can ride a horse? An inspirational tale of determination and a strive for perfection, in a direction style that's not unlike Frank Capra {""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) and ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" (1939)}, Gary Ross's stunning work is should not have been overlooked at Oscar-time.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations and violent sports-related images.

"FilmOtaku","8","0","0","2 August 2004"," A decent, `feel-good' film
","Just about everyone has their own personal corny `feel-good' movie, regardless of their level of cynicism.  For 90% of the male population, that film is `Rudy', starring Sean Astin.  My sole feel-good film up until a couple of days ago was `Erin Brockovich'; I always thought it was a `feel-good movie with an edge'.  However, after seeing `Seabiscuit', directed by Gary Ross and starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels and Chris Cooper, I can add it to my personal short list.  <br/><br/>Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>`Seabiscuit' is the true story of a racing horse, its jockey, trainer and owner, all who overcome some form of adversity in order to succeed. Seabiscuit himself was a horse that was `trained to fail', a horse that was of small stature and, when we first see it, highly temperamental and walking with a slight limp.  Tom Smith, (Cooper) who becomes Seabiscuit's trainer, is a failed rodeo show performer who is naturally a loner and prefers the company of horses to just about any other human.  Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, (Maguire) is taller than the average jockey, blind in one eye, and during the depression, was basically sold into the horse training/jockey life by his parents, who saw a gift in him.  Finally, the eventual owner of Seabiscuit, Charles Howard, (Bridges) is a former failed business owner who finds success in the automotive industry, and after experiencing personal tragedy, finds a faith in this motley group that he may not have previously had. <br/><br/>Under Ross' direction, `Seabiscuit' is very well done.  While nothing is overly dynamic, there are no glaring errors or rough spots either.  The film is well paced from beginning to end, and the production values were quite good.  All of the principals are good actors, so there were no surprises there.  Probably the neatest thing that I personally found about the film was the narration by David McCullough, the great author and unmistakable voice of PBS' wonderful `American Experience' series.  While `Seabiscuit' is obviously a dramatic representation of the true story, and liberties were probably taken in order to `Hollywoodize' the script, McCullough's voice-over by virtue of reputation lends a credible documentary feel too the film.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the film `Seabiscuit' is certainly its inspirational story, whether it is completely factual or not.  It is a film that the normal, cynical me would normally grow at and immediately eschew, were it not for its simplicity and genuinely good spirit.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","I would never have thought about watching this film in a million years...

However, I've been quite impressed with Tobey Maguire in the Spiderman movies and thought perhaps that it would be worth a look. <br/><br/>Overall I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works and how beautiful it looks. It does take a while to get going but when it does, it is a wonderful story of friendship, loyalty and personal triumph. Okay, it does play hard and fast with the facts but nobody expects any ""less"" from Hollywood. At the end of the day, I think it works for me is because it isn't a film about a horse but about people. The horse is the catalyst, the centrepoint from which the events transpire. There is something almost Capraesque about it.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is an example of classy Hollywood film-making. I love the way Gary Ross explains by implication and believes in the intelligence of his audience to follow the intimate, emotional moments without expending words or time. There are these wonderful scenes where the main characters are sitting down to dinner and so much is said that is not spoken. There are probably so many wonderful moments but one of my favourite is when Red goes to Howard and asks to borrow money because in reality he doesn't know where he stands after messing up his first big break. This and other scenes like this are what makes this movie one of my favourites."

","The first third of `Seabiscuit' is quite good--though writer/director Gary Ross' cops Ken Burns' documentarian style to illustrate the deadening despair of the Depression (he even appropriates historian/PBS host David McCullogh for narration)--with an earnest attempt at creating an interpersonal family drama between father-figure horse owner Jeff Bridges and tempestuous surrogate-son jockey Tobey Maguire. But then Seabiscuit appears and the film loses whatever momentum that's been generated. Starting out as a perceived underachiever, the horse's personality quickly evaporates as Ross insists on building it into some sort of crowning symbol of hope for the downtrodden. The director seems barely able to contain his glee in discovering an obscure American icon (at least until Laura Hillenbrand's biography, unread by this reviewer) he can exploit for his movie in order to create a myth he hopes will deliver it into classic status. But the resonance just isn't there for the modern audience. It's a modest entertainment with good performances by a gracefully aging Bridges, Maguire, Chris Cooper as Seabiscuit's trainer and an underused William H. Macy in comic relief as a goofy radio announcer, but tender though it is, its measured grasps for profundity come up short. The film does feature an outstanding sound design with excellent sound effects by Christopher Assells."

","Seabiscuit is a movie about a famous horse.  For me, this is a handicap to be overcome, since I am not nuts about horses or horse movies.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one, mostly due to the efforts of Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper.  Bridges underplays the rich and basically decent Charles Howard just right:  the audience can forgive him his wealth, even in light of the depression all around him.  He is fair and reasonable, yet a risk taker and huckster.<br/><br/>Cooper's character, trainer Tom Smith, is perhaps even more interesting. The stereotypical cowboy whose time has run out as the range became fenced and organized, Smith becomes a trainer who works primarily on instinct and his rapport with the animals.  The movie allows that instinct to err occasionally, bringing out the simple humanity of the man.<br/><br/>Less interesting is Tobey MaGuire as jockey Red Pollack.  Born to a wealthy and cultured family gone bust, he is farmed out by his desperate parents who never return for him.  It is hard to tell if the problem here is Maguire or Pollack; either way, the character is not too likable (unless you're a horse, apparently).<br/><br/>Production values are high in this period piece, and cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a few little things prevent  this good movie from being a great one:  The Depression documentary narration is cornily inspirational and out of place, too preachy.  Some during-race jockey banter is just silly!  And shots of Pollack cheering ""the Biscuit"" from his hospital bed should have been omitted even if true; its just been done too often.<br/><br/>One other sort of annoying aspect is the editing.  The movie tends to cut away from scenes just as the points are to be delivered, and the cutaway from the start of the 'Big Race' is just plain arrogant!<br/><br/>Having said that, it was an enjoyable two and a half hours, and I'm glad I saw it.  I give it a vote of 7."

","I haven't read Laura Hillenbrand's book but have heard nothing but good things about it. What is it that goes on between women and horses? Well, let's stick with the movie.<br/><br/>Basically -- without repeating the story, which everyone already knows -- the movie shows four losers being brought together, by MacFate, and forming one winner. It's the depression in America and everyone is suffering. The owner (Jeff Bridges) has a high-need for achievement and has money, but has lost his son in an accident and his wife for reasons that got by me. The jockey too has tried several careers and failed. The trainer (Christ Cooper, in the Wilford Brimley/Richard Farnsworth role, and excellent)has run out of open range land as a horse wrangler. The horse is ugly, ungainly, and stunted. Basically, the weaknesses of all the participants -- or the bad luck, rather, since nobody seems to actually HAVE weaknesses -- are overcome and everyone wins.<br/><br/>A viewer feels good watching all this, and the period detail is nicely done.<br/><br/>The direction too has its moments -- if something dramatic does not need spelling out, the director and the editor do not spell it out. I did lose some of my suspension of disbelief when two jockeys in the midst of a race started exchanging greetings and bon mots.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is interesting for any number of reasons without being outstanding. I like David McCullough, his sympatico features and sonorous voice, distant but not unengaged, but his narration evokes PBS, especially Ken Burns' ""Civil War."" It's a little demeaning to hear his voice behind such a commercial enterprise, talking about ""the forty-thousand hot dogs"" sold at one of Seabiscuit's races. I had trouble with Randy Newman's score too. I like his score for ""The Natural,"" derived from Copeland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man,"" and especially the interpolated rinky-tink contemporary tunes. But this music sounds positively generic. When something important is about to happen, the music cues our tension. When it DOES happen, the music takes off heavenward with triumphant trombones and chiliastic overtones. <br/><br/>The acting's pretty good. Jiff Bridges never fails. (His new wife is a pretty blank.) Gary Stevens, a famous jockey, has a neat face for movies. And Chris Cooper is fine -- a soft-spoken and candid rube, a bit of a mystic. <br/><br/>And it's always uplifting to see a Comeback Kid, even if the kid is a horse.<br/><br/>But a movie about overcoming flaws and bad luck is kind of easy to do. Everyone leaves the theater aglow with warmth. For every winner there are thousands of losers. I enjoyed the original ""Rocky"" because Rocky LOST THE MATCH! If this is a movie that's not about winning but about doing your best, then why does the damme horse WIN? There's nothing wrong with upliftingness. On the contrary, it feels good. That's why they're so easy to do, and so popular. And I don't mean to tout despair as the most suitable philosophical tonus for a flick. But I'm reminded of a professor of mine who gave his class an assignment and advised them to ""do your very best."" Then he paused for a moment and added, ""Suppose you really did your very best and the results turned out to be pedestrian?"" Never mind Seabiscuit, when are they going to make a movie about the rest of us who come in second?"

And considering how no one cares about watching horse racing today; it is hard to imagine millions of people following the races of a horse back in the day. The story follows the concept of the little engine that could. We have a horse, jocky, and owner who all rise above what people think they are capable of doing.  The best part was the race against War Admiral, who was so much bigger than little Seabiscuit. Of course, the way the movie sets it up, it was fate that Seabiscuit wins.  Then, the horse and jocky both get injuried and each one over comes them to win another race. The movie ends there; but it never tells if that was Seabiscuit's and Red's last race.

","The nation was battling the Great Depression.  Broken lives struggled for survival, struggled for better times.  What possibly could an unwanted, discounted racehorse do to add even a spark of hope to such difficult times? This incredible story about a racehorse named ""Seabiscuit"" is a historical treasure that taught a nation about beating the odds.  The disappointingly small grandson of the champion racehorse `Man-O-War' sparks the attention of a horse trainer named Tom Smith (Chris Cooper).  Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a struggling jockey much larger than the average jockey, also catches Cooper's attention.  Millionaire Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) looks on with intuitive eyes, and the financial means to take a chance.<br/><br/>
The story is about much more than just watching horse racing. It chronicles the lives of these three men who come from different walks of life, and as the rest of the nation, are dealing with their own unique losses.  I enjoyed the way the Director Gary Ross lets you slowly appreciate the differences, and talents of the characters that bring them together to accomplish a shared goal.  Would this journey force personal losses to be faced?  `Do you throw a life away just because it's banged up a little?'  Would it transcend the race to bet the odds?  Would lives be made better?  It reminds me of ""The Love of the Game"", (1999) when it becomes more than just pitching a winning baseball game for Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) as he recognizes the importance of having others in our lives.<br/><br/>Let me not discount the horse racing though!  The viewer is given the opportunity to eyewitness up front and personal how it may feel amidst a thundering brood of horses running at full speed literally side by side! The colliding of one horse and rider against the next!  It is a privilege to see through the jockey's eyes what a thrilling (and dangerous) sport this is, one the spectator can only imagine.  The job at hand must absolutely be the only thought in mind, for horse and rider if survival, and ultimately victory are to be had!  ""Seabiscuit"" reminds us that odds are just that, odds, not absolutes."
"bridge01","Null","0","0","18 March 2004"," This is a story of how dreams can become realities to achieve success.
","Director Gary Ross gives an excellent account of a movie based on a true story as narrated by David McCullough, about how a small mistreated horse was instrumental in bringing together the rebirth of spirit and future in the lives of three men.  This small, under-dogged horse who became world famous is named Seabiscuit and is also the title of this amazing film. Seabiscuit is a story of how negatives can be turned into positives to give a bright outlook for the future showing that the sky is the limit in becoming successful for anyone achieving a dream.   The setting of Seabiscuit takes place during the 1930's Depression era narrated by McCullough who speaks of the changing times from bicycles advancing to the successes of the automobile.  The story evolves around the lives of three men existing from different backgrounds who suffer set-backs on their road towards success as a result of the Depression and how their deflated dreams have become successful realities. Jeff Bridges (Charles Howard) is an individual with a vivid imaginative dream for the future who desires to turn his dreams into success.  In spite of the tragic death of his young son in a truck accident he has become a self-made prominent businessman selling automobiles and a horse-owner. Tobey Maguire (Red Pollard) suffered tragedy after his family lost everything during the depression, resulting in the separation from his family at an early age to pursue life on his own. His dream to become successful as a horse jockey leads him on a rocky road of misadventures to finally recapture the spirit of life. Chris Cooper (Tom Smith) unlike Bridges and Maguire did not loose very much of material items during the depression, but felt a loss of freedom and detachment from society.  This is evident in the scene showing a close-up shot of Cooper's hand touching the barbed wire fencing that conveys the separation of land by no trespassing. However, in spite of his feelings, he maintains the gift as a horse whisperer (the taming of horses), and a keen eye for training to recapture the lives of castaway horses.  His travels lead him to work as a horse trainer for Bridges and to train Seabiscuit and Maguire the jockey to become one of the most successful teams on the race horse circuit across America. The men equally come together through the bond of their horse Seabiscuit and share the new found joys of life successes with their champion horse. Understanding the negatives that life has dealt allowed the men to focus on the positives and to feel that success is derived out of fulfilling the spirit of dreams and to show compassion for mankind.  The message and the joyous feelings of success are shown in another scene with Bridges attending a news media conference to promote Seabiscuit. Bridges states `He is a little guy, but he just doesn't know it. He thinks he is larger than life'. This not only refers to the success of Seabiscuit winning races, but also to himself, Maguire, and Cooper as they individually achieve their dreams of success for their futures. The horse trainer Cooper brought forth calmness in executing his talent to train unruly, wild, and castaway horses just as in the movie The Horse Whisperer (1998) starring Robert Redford who also had the gift to calm and train horses for the betterment of humankind.  Both of these actors played roles that connect humans with the nature of animals, namely horses requiring a special talent that goes above and beyond regular everyday expectancies. The director's usage of wide angle and close-up shots throughout the film while filming Maguire riding Seabiscuit during the horse race sequences were very alluring to give one the excitable feeling of being apart of the race. These shots also captured the expressive feelings of facial and body movements showing the energy of defeat and success.  This also allowed the viewer to experience the energy of the highs and lows associated with the drive to win.  Cinematographer John Schwartzman captured the essence of colors by dominating the scenes with reds, purples, and hues of browns to give a low contrast emphasizing depression, power, control, and wealth. The light variations in contrast were used to symbolize security, truth, and the joys of achievements after the win of a race - by horse or by humanity.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit was an excellent film that I would recommend for individuals and families to view.  The wholesome feeling of compassion for your fellowman and the will to strive in spite of all odds makes one appreciate what life has to offer no matter how big or small.  Director Ross executes a fantastic job at capturing actual and realistic events that occurred during the 1930's Depression without losing the focus of the film.  Ross conveys the message that Americans, in spite of crippling odds can still unite together to form a bond of togetherness for the betterment of humankind that will allow one to achieve their dream of success for the future."

It It is a real pity that this movie was up against the giant that was Return of the King at this years Oscars for Best Picture, as I think it deserved Best Picture just as much as King did. A wonderful, heart warming film. If you feel low down, this is the film to cheer you up. Magical."

","Good, heartwarming story. I enjoyed it a lot. But having read the book first, I missed some of the tone of the book. The book spends several chapters here and there explaining horse racing to us non-fans, and the explanations are just as fascinating as the plot. If you see this movie, read the book anyway.<br/><br/>The film did a nice job of moving time along without bogging down in details. We leap from ""now"" to ""later"" with a few scenes that have music only. This is not a new technique, but I thought it was very well done in this Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>I felt there was a slight disconnect between the close-ups of the jockeys riding and the longer shots.

This treatment of the Depression-era saga is well-worth the time and rental cost but I found it to be a bit hard-to-believe that no one substntially ages in the film's elapsed time.  Maybe it is the case that an 8-yr.-old race horse in peak running shape isn't necessarily visibly aged but I don't think that seems at all likely.  I believe the David McCullough narration would have been better alloted to a different voice actor - - I kept thinking I was watching PBS-TV.  I come to a feature Hollywood film with some different entertainment parameters.  All in all, it is a solid ""8"" star film.  Its stunning art direction and set decoration impress detail-watchers like me.

","Seabiscuit is a really good film with an amazing message; sometimes the best way to succeed is to keep trying. This is a film that centers on the lives of three very different people. Together, they take a horse that is destined to lose and turn him into one that fought all the odds to become a winning horse. I didn't think that I would like a film about a horse; in fact when it first came out I didn't want to see it. But once it started getting the entire Oscar buzz, I have to admit that I wanted to see it. I know I shouldn't judge a film on its Oscar buzz, but I did on this one, I'm so sorry. Set during the depression, Seabiscuit is a film that will have you cheering from your seat. At first I was not a fan of Tobey Maguire, I don't know what it was about him but I didn't see anything that separated him from most actor's his age, yet in this film he is on his way to becoming one of the best younger actors around. I think that he deserved a little more attention for his performance of the semi- blind racer. I found myself rooting for all of these characters; they are ordinary people who are placed in some pretty big challenges. Jeff Bridges turns in one of his finest performances ever. I think that he is one of the most underrated actors in the world, in the same boat is William H. Macy, I think that every performance that he does is great. He can really step into a character and run with it. I think that for such a small role he did a fantastic job.  I do not think that this is one of the best films of the year but it's a good movie. It kept my interest all two hours; I do however feel bad that there are people who treat horses like that. I truly believe that this film has a big heart; I love movies that have bigger messages. I like movies that take characters that are ordinary and put them in some of the most breathtaking situations. If you want a film that will make up feel good, and root for the underdog then this is a film that you should check out. Final tally 2.7 out of 4 stars and the letter grade  B."

","""Seabiscuit"" is a movie about horse racing.  Yeah, yeah, it's about ""a long shot becoming a legend"" and ""the future"" and other corny stuff like that, but when it all comes down to it, ""Seabiscuit"" is about horse racing.  It's about small people who ride horses around in a circle.  That's the main plot of the movie.  It's all about manager Harris (Jeff Bridges), trainer Smith (Chris Cooper) and jockey Red (Tobey Maguire) trying to improve their horse for the next horse race.<br/><br/>And it's nominated for Best Picture of the Year in the 2004 Oscars.  That is really the biggest problem I have with this movie.  Sure, it's good, the actors and a good script redeem it's cheesy premise, but you really have to ask yourself what the hell the Academy was thinking when they nominated this movie over ""Big Fish"" or ""The Last Samurai"" or ""In America"", or many other great films released in 2003 that exceeded this hundred and forty-one minute horse race.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm coming down too harsh, after all, the actors did well.  There is a certain amount of star power in this film, which saves it from the fact that the majority of the characters are about as interesting as fingernail dirt. Bridges' role isn't anything special, but it is Bridges, so him being on the screen made me happy.  Chris Cooper knocked me out of my seat in ""American Beauty"" and ""Adaptation"", and did nearly as well in this movie.  Of course, the protagonist is played by Tobey Maguire - the worst actor ever - so it loses major points for that.<br/><br/>Overall this is an average film saved by it's performances and script, but if it wins tomorrow I'll be a very unhappy man, 7/10."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","0","24 February 2004"," i can see WHY it got an Oscar Nomination, although I'm unsure if it's worthy
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>First things first, I'm not an animal person. As a result of years of limiting myself to goldfish for pets, I'm not the best person to talk to about species on this planet other than humanity itself. As a result of this, when ""Seabiscuit"" was at the cinema, I made jokes about horses breaking legs & being turned into steaks to a friend of mine who adores the animals. Looking back now after watching the film on DVD, I regret it all. Whilst this film might not be the ode to joy that so many others have stated, it's still a moving, passionate film about the underdog (underhorse? doesn't quite work, sounds like some sort of household appliance) fighting back.<br/><br/>In ""Seabiscuit"", we are introduced to Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), a man who makes his millions from the latest craze of automobiles, but who suffers a life destroying incident as a result of these same contraptions. His life begins to collapse, yet just before it folds in on itself, he rediscovers a love for horses. Hiring Tom Smith (played with the expected high standards of Chris Cooper) to train ""Seabiscuit"" and Johnny ""Red"" Pollard (played with a truthfully surprisingly good performance by Tobey Maguire) to ride it. The four (three men and a little horsey perhaps?) bond and unite as this true story unfolds and the American people, coping with the Depression, begin to see this horse as inspiration in a world of misery.<br/><br/>So what's right with this film? Well for one thing it really is quite inspiring. It reminds us that anything is possible if you work hard enough and it drags us all out on a limb and makes us smile.<br/><br/>Technically as well it is a superb film. Direction, sound, cinematography, set design, all features range from above average to excellent.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, I do have one flaw with ""Seabiscuit"". It is perhaps slightly too long. Whilst unsure of the length, there are times in this movie which I found to drag considerably and which were dull. It's a shame as whilst I can appreciate these scenes for why they were there, they did have a negative affect on the overall state of the film.<br/><br/>Despite the one criticism however, I can see why the Academy gave ""Seabiscuit"" an Oscar Nomination for Best Film. Whilst it won't win, because with four days or so until the big day, most bookmakers have understandably ended all bet taking because of the ridiculous ammounts of people putting money on ""The Lord Of The Rings"", ""Seabiscuit"" is a film which inspires and reflects the true American spirit of success.<br/><br/>So, to summarise, ""Seabiscuit"" is not a film to be avoided by those people who don't like the idea of a horseracing film. This film is one which everyone should watch, simply to give themselves a good feeling at the end and sense of pride. It is not hard to see the Academy's decision to reward this film, but truthfully, I question it's eligibility."

","Many filmgoers are fetching on to the biscuit!  That is the horse race film `Seabiscuit'. It is quickly becoming one of the top DVD sellers of all time! Yes folks! I am not horsing around! Tobey Maguire, who himself is a jockey-of-all-trades I mean jack-of-all-trades actor, reached new heights by superbly playing rangy jockey Red Pollard. This motion picture is based on the triumphant true story of an undersized racehorse named Seabiscuit who touched the hearts of Americans during The Great Depression. The film also centers on Seabiscuit's impact on two other prominent figures: Horseowner Charles Howard & Trainer Tom Smith. Jeff Bridges' commanding & endearing performance as Howard will not burn any bridges. It hits high on the gallup poll. Chris Cooper's work as Smith was admirable but it did not adapt to the beautiful supporting work he contributed in `American beauty' & `Adaptation'. Gary Ross' spectacular direction was a winning run in the day of the Rosses, I mean roses. Ok! I will cut these horseplay puns.

How much money did he win for his owner?  How long did he live after he stopped racing and was he put out to stud to manufacture other ""little Seabiscuits?""  A truly great film about a certain character whether it is a war hero, sports great or even a famous horse should both entertain and teach us about this character's life and times.  We should come out of this film knowing a lot more facts about this character than we did before we saw the film.

","Spoilers Herein:<br/><br/>The jockey (Tobey Maguire) who has lost his sight, the rich man (Jeff Bridges)who has lost his son, and the stereotypical Westerner (Chris Cooper) who has lost his lifestyle.  They all find their solace in Seabiscuit, the horse given a second chance.<br/><br/>For a true story, the story is a striking allegory to the resurrection of America amidst the Great Depression.  I was leery of watching a 2.5 hour movie about a horse, but instead the plot, as an allegory, shows how Seabiscuit is the embodiment of America.  He is given his second chance, and he rises from the ashes like the Phoenix.  America too will rise from the remains of Wall Street and the dust of the Midwest to become great again. Furthermore, Seabiscuit is the average American.  He is not Carnegie, he is not Rockefeller-he is the man with a quarter in his pocket who watches the race from the inside track.<br/><br/>The story also plays on some themes reminiscent of The Great Gatsby, which can also be seen as telling the story of America.  Seabiscuit is the West, the nouveau riche, who is trying to find equality amongst the old aristocracy of the East.  Jeff Bridges, as Seabiscuit's owner, almost blatantly says it in one of his speeches in the film.  Seabistcuit is the best horse in the West, he says, while War Admiral is the best of the East. However, Riddle, the owner of War Admiral, refuses to race this, as he basically claims, nag.<br/><br/>The acting from the main cast was good, but perhaps the best and funniest performance is from William H. Macy as the radio host.  The cinematography, however, is what truly makes the film.  I hope that Seabiscuit wins this Oscar, for it is truly deserved.<br/><br/>Overall, a 10/10.  For something that I was afraid would be a fluffy film full of feel-goodness, I was pleasantly surprised."

","As you watch Jeff Bridges early rise and fall in the dawning moments of Seabiscuit, the absolute radiance of a natural story shines through until your body is engrossed in goosebumps.  The scene where Jeff Bridges holds his child in utter agony (without any music or noise) shows just how loud a powerful moment like this could be.  And I personally thought I was about to experience a motion picture film that will delve into the deep riches of the human spirit and show how much an underdog victory can change the way a person feels, let alone change the feeling of a nation.  But, however strong the story of Seabiscuit seems to start, the movie gradually gets worse when in fact it should be getting better, just like the horse itself.  At the beginning of the movie, Gary Ross pulls at the heartstrings, showing the down and out lives of three men in the early 1900's:  1)Charles Howard, the successful business man (played by Jeff Bridges) who went from producing bicycles to motor engines; 2) Red Pollard (played by Tobey Maguire), the poor young jockey of Seabiscuit who had to leave his family because of the Great Depression; and 3) Tom Smith (played by last year's Best Supporting Actor, Chris Cooper), who seems to be the most naturalistic character I've seen in a while.  Each of the characters lose something close to them, each face personal agony and loss, and each seems to be down for the count. They meet through one unsuspecting star, the horse Seabiscuit, which gives Howard a new business venture, Smith another horse in which to relate, and Pollard a new best friend.  They pull together, winning various horse races throughout the country, trying to show the whole United States that a horse whose jockey is too big and whose horse is too small can beat the odds. But down the stretch run, Seabiscuit the movie is left in the dust of Seabiscuit the actual horse.  The movie's narrative clanks and clutters along the last 40 minutes or so, and the great final finish wasn't that great at all. The acting is par at worst.  Jeff Bridges brings delightful attitude and color to his character.  He also gives an emotional depth that is only seen in bits and pieces.  As the movie wanes, Bridges doesn't seem to do much. He's just there to look pretty next to his pretty wife.  It seems his down and out luck turned for the best halfway through and that he has nothing else to do for the rest of the movie.  I don't know about anyone else, but I was just waiting for Tobey Maguire to pull out his Spiderman costume.  And what's the deal with not giving Chris Cooper anything to do.  I know he's supposed to be a natural kind of guy, but isn't he human?  Doesn't he know how to talk?  I think he may have had a few lines of any importance. Maybe the writers were letting him give a subtle performance, but he had nothing emotional in which to hook himself or the audience for that matter.  The star of the show (which really doesn't mean anything) is William H. Macy, who plays a sportscaster who uses weird noises to show off his colorful personality.  Macy is energetic in the role; however, the role doesn't merit anything award-winning.  Same could be said for the movie.  Hardly a photo finish. Final Grade: B-"

","Some of the most enjoyable movies are the ones that can please a crowd. `Seabiscuit' is most certainly that. Even in the face of it's own fumbling clichés and pace the film is able to rise to the occasion, much like the very horse himself.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know the story or have read the book by Laura Hillenbrand from which it was adapted. I don't know how much of it is true or Hollywood exaggeration but as a film, standing on it's own, it works extremely well. At the core of `Seabiscuit' is the down and out tale of adversity we have seen a hundred times before but it's the characters themselves and writer/director Garry Ross's approach on the subject matter that keeps it from going stale. As a screenwriter this is only Ross's second directorial picture following `Pleasantville', and he is definitely finding his knack for the medium. <br/><br/>And so, with a film like this it becomes a vehicle for human drama. Casting is exceptional. To begin with we are introduced one by one, with narration by David McCullough, the three major players and their stories. Jeff Bridges as the down and out auto tycoon Charles Howard, Tobey Maguire as the homeless, uncharacteristic, half-blind jockey Red Pollard, and lastly Chris Cooper as the archaic horse trainer Tom Smith. Together they share a common thread. All have been hit hard during America's Great Depression and all get there mangled sprits restored by a lazy horse that can't ride straight, sleeps all day and loves to eat.<br/><br/>`Seabiscuit' is just another sappy feel good movie but darn it, I felt good having seen it. In a similar approach to this year's `Finding Nemo' this movie is light entertainment that seems to hit all the right buttons. In the end it's so upbeat that you let the maudlin bits slide. It's not perfect (far from it) but it's a reachable movie for audiences to enjoy without worry. It's a film of strong working parts. There is not one aspect that carries it alone, not acting, directing, or editing. It's the whole shebang. And you definitely get enough bang for your buck as this champion races on for a lengthy 2 ½ hour running time. Yes, it can get a little sluggish during the middle but don't let this obstacle keep you from going because it's a sure triumph when you reach the end.<br/><br/>Score - 4 out of 5"

","This film came highly recommended to me and it didn't disappoint. At the very beginning of the film, there is nothing about horses and I began to wonder when the horses would come into play. Eventually, of course, they did. And once they did, this film becomes positively engrossing! Cast, acted and shot perfectly, this film tells the old story of the underdog in triumph at the same time that the nation was on its knees. The great depression figures prominently and is certainly a character in this film in and of itself. This is a story not of just a horse, but of the people who own, love and race this horse, from the owners to the stable hands, the trainer and the jockeys. But it's also the story of how this (unlikely) little horse and it's (unlikely) huge jockey brought hope to the US citizens in their time of great need. Jeff Bridges as Seabiscuit's owner and Tobey Maguire as the main jockey both shine in this film. But I believe the best performance was turned in by Chris Cooper as the eccentric trainer Tom Smith. Cooper is doing his best work to date recently and he really does a great job in this film."

","There are certain names that have become almost a part of the English language which most of us have heard of, but few rarely know the story behind the origin of the name.  Seabiscuit is one of them, along with names like the Gipper Knute Rockne, The Bronx Bombers, Murderers Row, Man-o-War, Dan Patch.  All of these names are associated with legends in their own respective sports.  I can remember as a kid growing up in the seventies hearing the name Seabiscuit but never knowing who or what it was.  This movie not only presents who Seabiscuit was, but it shows us a time capsule of the way things were in pre world war II America.  Presented in a docu-drama style nararated by David Mccullough who is a noted historian in his own right and is also a very recognizable voice over talent for historical dramas, Seabiscuit presents a world which few surviving Americans can remember, a world where the automobile was a novelty and locomotives were the main mode of cross-country transportation, not airplanes.  A world where entire families were glued to the radio in the living room listening to the nightly news or the latest new commercial radio show.  A world that was still struggling to make it's way out of the depression.  This was the world into which the famous racehorse Seabiscuit was born into.  This was the time when horseracing was almost as popular as baseball when baseball was the number one spectator sport in America. The movie Seabiscuit does a remarkable job of painting a beautiful picture of an otherwise dark time in America, sometimes using glossy colors to show a gentler America than what the history books show, it does use documentary photographs throughout the movie to aid in dating the times when the events of the movie were occurring. Tobey Maguire puts in a remarkable performance as the down on his luck feisty and angry too-tall horse-jockey Red Pollard, and yes, even with red hair, Tobey Maguire still looks like your every day next door neighbor. Jeff Bridges plays the sentimental haunted owner of Seabiscuit Mr. Howard. Mr Howard is sentimental and haunted as a result of the death of his only son and the resulting dissolution of his marriage.  Chris Cooper again shows why he is one of Hollywoods best supporting actors putting in a Horse-whispereresque performance as the too old Horse trainer who sees beauty in the otherwise underwhelming Seabiscuit and sees the heart of a champion inside the horse just waiting for someone to coax it out.  These three men help shape the unlikely championship career of a horse that everyone said was lazy, too small, rebellious and angry. The movie uses period imagery that is very convincing, and while there are a couple of somewhat fake looking scenes with Tobey Maguire seated in the saddle of Seabiscuit overall, it does not detract from a well done movie. As the movie ended I was left with a tear in my eye and a warm feeling in my heart.  Done in the tradition of movies like Rudy and Field of Dreams, this movie is sure to go down as a family classic to be loved for many years, and to be watched over and over again.  This is a movie that young and old alike will enjoy and I would recommend it to anyone."

","I thought the film was a wonderful transfer from book to film of the three people who came together over a horse called ""Seabiscuit.""  Leads were all exceptional, especially, Jeff Bridges as the owner of Seabiscuit, and Tobey McGuire as the jockey, Red Pollard.  The time and place were caught up beautifully and the film was exquisitely photographed.  I do hope this film is an Oscar contender, if for nothing else, but for the cinematography, and photography.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","0","6 January 2004"," Predictable but hugely entertaining.
","I use the term predictable above, as you'll soon see, in the most respectable and positive way, of course. Seabiscuit is a film based on a novel and is a true story. You know pretty much how the movie is going to end, if only simply because of the fact that it is a story about which a book was published AND a major motion picture was made. That being said, it's not too hard to hypothesize about what the ending will be like, but along the way the film takes you on a wonderful journey through the hardships suffered by a particular family and especially a particular boy during the Great Depression.<br/><br/>(spoilers) I also have to admit that there were times during the last quarter of the film that I was not sure that my initial theory of a happy, underdog ending was in store for me, especially having seen and been immensely impressed by films like Rocky and Mystery, Alaska. In a film like Seabiscuit, a huge success is not necessary in the final race for the film to succeed. In some ways I actually think it might have been better had Seabiscuit lost the final battle. And by the way, I don't even know for sure that I should be required to mention `spoilers' above, given that the very tagline of the film gives away the ending. But just so you know, there are much more substantial spoilers to follow, so if you haven't seen the movie you might want to stop reading my review now (but make sure to come back and read the rest after you see the whole movie!).<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is obviously the underdog from the beginning. He's too small, he has completely the wrong temperament, he would rather lounge for hours in the sun in the afternoon than run around a track, and probably the worst of all, his jockey (although pretty much a lifelong jockey) is too tall, too heavy, and in a lot of ways, also has completely the wrong temperament. But these things, as the movie progresses, are the things that I think the film should be more concerned with correcting, instead of having such a heavy emphasis on winning that last rematch.<br/><br/>Having Seabiscuit win the final race is certainly one of those big jump-out-of-your-seat-cheering events, but consider how the film's message would have been different had he lost. Seabiscuit had already lost to War Admiral and his arrogant owner once, which only served to intensify the desire to beat him. Much publicity is made of their desire for a rematch, which is ultimately granted, although entirely on the conditions and to the advantage of War Admiral and his jerk of an owner. <br/><br/>Seabiscuit and the rest of the team arrive, and there are thousands upon thousands of people there to watch the race, plus countless more listening to this immense race over the radio, even though Seabiscuit and War Admiral are the only two horses racing. The tension is increased by the fact that Red Pollard (played by Tobey Maguire with charming red hair) has a leg that was broken in 11 or 12 places and is barely holding together (although aided with a home-made leather brace, which must have provided plenty of support!). It is the reason that he is barely able to get permission from his manager (intent on canceling the race because a fall could mean he would never walk again) and his doctor (visibly impressed by the home-made brace) to ride Seabiscuit in the race.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit wins, of course. You know that, otherwise the tagline wouldn't be talking about a long shot becoming a legend. So it's a true story, which provides the main reason for not ending with a loss, I just think it's interesting to consider how the film would have been different had it not ended with a huge victory. <br/><br/>First of all, the reason that Seabiscuit was so immensely popular and managed to completely fill up the stadiums was because the movie takes place during the Depression and symbolizes the working man, beaten down but, as Seabiscuit symbolically states, not defeated. Millions look to Seabiscuit for inspiration and hope, so his victory/loss has a huge effect on the will of all of these people, many of whom have lost everything because of the Depression, to go out there and actively seek to get back their lives and livelihood. <br/><br/>But to me, Seabiscuit winning the last race is not pivotal as to whether people would have derived hope from his success story, which I suppose is a testament to the meaning of the Seabiscuit story itself. The most important thing is that Seabiscuit and his team put themselves out there at great risk in order to make an achievement, and winning or losing that last race is, ironically enough, not the determining factor as to whether or not they achieved what they set out for. It actually runs the risk of having the opposite effect should someone strive for success and fail. On the other hand, given the ultimate success in the final race, Seabiscuit encourages people not to give up. As Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) says, you don't just lay down because of a defeat, you have to keep fighting.<br/><br/>But like I mentioned earlier, I think that the main goal for them all was to overcome the adversities operating against Seabiscuit and Red, and they did that with huge success. I obviously have never had an experience even close to what people suffered during the Great Depression, but I think that Seabiscuit and his team setting out to overcome their own challenges would be enough to inspire people to do the same about their own lives. But I digress. This is, after all a true story.<br/><br/>So Seabiscuit is a huge success, but there were certain things about the victory that I think were contrived and overdone. I could have done without the conversations out there on the track, for example, I just think that riding a horse going that fast and that close to other horses would simply not be an atmosphere conducive to conversation, both because of noise and the demand on the jockeys' concentration. The final `See you later' was a little too cocky and cheesy, too, illustrating that all of the tension that the audience had been experiencing through this whole race was fake because Seabiscuit was only going at maybe 60% until that last corner. And I don't like false tension. <br/><br/>But Seabiscuit as a whole is a fantastic film, historically accurate and with a definite purpose, whose success and meaningful application to modern society as well as that of the 1930s is a testament to the relevance of the story. Jeff Bridges delivers yet another wonderful performance (illustrating his adaptability, since he was also fantastic in his performance of The Dude), as does Chris Cooper (who, I think, is one of the finest actors working today) as Seabiscuit's trainer. Tobey Maguire captures the heart of Red Pollard, and William H. Macy, another of the finest actors working today, provides wonderfully appropriate comic relief as the breathless Tick Tock McGlaughlin, a radio host who shouts his commentary along with a startling array of strange sound effects, the occasional meaninglessness of which suggest their main purpose of gleeful effect rather than to further illustrate the meaning of anything he's talking about at any particular time. <br/><br/>Set against the background of one of the milestones in American history, Seabiscuit is a smashing presentation of a true story that inspired the downtrodden of the time and also has the capacity of inspiring the downtrodden of today, as well as the affluent, who might be able to stand to display a little bit less heartlessness and arrogance. But rather than speaking against mean-spirited and self-righteous people like War Admiral's wealthy owner, the movie speaks positively to people looking for not only some great entertainment, but some inspiration as well, whatever their founding needs for it might be."

","In a movie based on the true story of Seabuicuit and the humans who helped bring him fame, the character who is least likely to be real and the actor playing him is the most outstanding in the film.<br/><br/>Maybe because I live near Saratoga, NY, the home of one of racing's best known racetracks, I found the story of Seabuscuit fascinating before seeing the movie or reading the book.  The PBS documentary was a big help in getting me even more interested  The movie is well written and well done. I expected that and was not disappointed.  William H Macy did an outstanding job as an announcer and radio racing personality.  They call him Tick-Tock and most likely is a conglomeration of raido personalities of the day and was written for Macy.  He is funny and when he is on he is a hoot.  Do not miss him!  He certainly derserves his recent Golden Globe nod."

","I really wanted to like this movie, maybe the book ruined it for me... but I don't think so.  I realize that going from book to screen is difficult but Seabiscuit the movie never captured the personalities(except for Smith), the excitement, or the drama that the book did.  My wife watched it with me who had not read the book and her feelings were the same.  The movie was just flat.  The movie had none of the soul or spirit that the book did.  Which is really sad.  <br/><br/>I never felt the anguish or struggle of Pollard, I never felt the fatherly feelings Howard had toward Pollard or for that matter the love Howard had for Seabiscuit, I never really sensed how HUGE Seabiscuit's races were in the late 1930s.  This should have been an enormous emotional movie. Unfortunately it just never connected with the emotions or spirit of the story.<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of 10."

","Gary Ross's 2003 film `Seabiscuit' is a nice, albeit long family tale with little redeeming value beyond filling a much needed void for family movies when the children are too old for Disney cartoons, but too young for older fare like the `Lord of the Rings.'<br/><br/>The story is filmed in an entertaining way and is exciting at times, particularly during the nicely filmed race sequences. At other times the movie plods along quite slowly and really avoids some of the major issues that are surrounding the main characters, namely the need to deal with loss and abandonment.<br/><br/>Two actors truly shined in this movie Â– William H. Macy and Chris Cooper. Macy portrays a wondrously nervous and alcoholic racetrack announcer while Cooper depicts the talented and quiet horse trainer, Tom Smith. Jeff Bridges and Toby McGuire did not harm the film, but either through their own means, the directors or the scripts they add little to the films potential depth and merely just move the plot along.<br/><br/>Not a great film, but worth a look on video especially with pre-teen children."
"Doghouse-6","Null","0","0","1 January 2004"," Pretty Movie, Lovely Story
","A few months before I saw this feature, I watched a PBS documentary (American Experience, I think it was) about this remarkable horse (and the people who recognized his potential), and it was one of the most moving hours I've ever spent. I couldn't help but think, ""If a screenwriter had invented this stuff, no one would have bought it for a second."" Well, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, and unless you're completely hollow, I don't see how you can fail to be moved by the story this film tells. That said, I honestly can't say whether my viewing of that documentary enhanced my enjoyment of SEABISCUIT, or detracted from it. I found myself reacting emotionally to events before they were presented, simply because I knew they were coming.<br/><br/>I suppose mythology, by definition, can't be fact; this story is nevertheless given the same ""mythic"" treatment as THE NATURAL (right down to the Randy Newman score). Gary Ross is a very thoughtful director (obvious from his commentary on the DVD supplements), and has sound reasons for the choices he makes here. Though this story may deserve such treatment, I wonder if - this being factual rather than fictional - it isn't a bit of overkill.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: it's a beautiful, well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable picture. Ross' use of narration (by David McCullough: perfect) and putting events in historical context (as in a documentary) are excellent devices. Toby Maguire continues to demonstrate his range and versatility, Jeff Bridges gives the kind of solid performance we've come to depend on from him and, speaking of versatility, Chris Cooper is a standout; at times, he seems almost to be channeling Richard Farnsworth (and this is in no way meant as a criticism).<br/><br/>Aside from my questioning if the style of this film was the best way in which to present this story (and that's all it is; a question), the only real quibble I have with SEABISCUIT is the portrayal of the horse as an object, rather than a character. I don't mean in the sense of the kind of anthropomorphizing of Lassie or Flicka, but in the lack of being given the same emotional access to the horse as we are to the humans. Sure, we're shown behavioral traits and such, but we just don't get to connect with Seabiscuit in the same way we do with Howard, Smith or Pollard. And, believe me, this horse (as I learned from the PBS documentary) had character!<br/><br/>But I nitpick. It really is a great movie. It's just that it might have been a really great movie. Nevertheless, set aside your cynicism, remember that the basic events are true, and allow yourself to get choked up at all the appropriate moments."

","Seabiscuit is one of those movies where I know it's a good, high-quality film, but I just can't really get into it.  It is a long movie, but I've enjoyed long movies before as long as they remain interesting throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>I think my complaint, and somewhat of a compliment, is that the film spends a lot of time on character building.  The first hour seemed to devote itself to slowly introducing the characters and the setting of the Depression. It's a rich introduction and makes you appreciate the characters, but man, it kind of drags.  I kept wondering, ""Is this Tobey Maguire's character,"" and ""Where is Seabiscuit?""  The last stage of the movie also seemed to drag. I know they needed to finish the complete story of Seabiscuit, but I was ready to end the movie an hour ago!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, those are my only complaints.  The huge strength of the movie lies with the flawless acting.  Everybody committed something to the film and they all did it perfectly.  My particular favorite character was played by Chris Cooper.  His character is very unique, kind of odd, but most importantly, very interesting.  He plays sort of a horse whisperer who sees something in Seabiscuit no one has ever seen.  He did a most excellent job and should probably get another Oscar, even though it seems unlikely that the Academy would want to give consecutive Oscars to anyone nowadays.  Darn those Oscar politics!<br/><br/>So all in all, this is a very good film.  Others may appreciate the story more than I did, particularly those interested in horses or American history.  I can see why the actors are so passionate about this movie.  Give this horse a chance and you may feel the same way, or you may end up bored. But hey, this movie is worth that shot!<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)"

","When it comes to sports themed movies, there are more strikeouts than touchdowns.  For every Field of Dreams, there is a Major League; for every Brian's Song, there is an Unnecessary Roughness; and for every Slap Shot, there is a Slap Shot II.  So when Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) seeked $80 million plus to bring the true story of a race horse in the 1930's to the big screen, studio execs must have been squirming in their seats like a Buffalo Bills fan before the SuperBowl.  There was some comfort to be taken in the casting of Toby McGuire (hot off his Spider-man) role and Chris Cooper, who nabbed an Academy Award for his role in last year's Adaptation, playing both jockey Red Pollard and horse trainer Tom Smith, respectively, but would a mass audience have a desire to see a story about a Depression era horse?  The answer is a simply, yes.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is one of those rare films that tells a remarkable story of achievement against the odds and does so with precision writing, extraordinary camera work and just the right dose of character quirkiness and humor to keep the audience rooting for the underdog.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit begins with the obligatory introduction of characters.  Red is introduced as a hotheaded young man who has a knack with race horses, but as jockey's go, he is probably about 2-feet too tall for the job.  Tom Smith is a countryman who has a sheer admiration for animals, and soon, both men meet stoic Charles Howard (played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges), who buys the underachieving horse Seabiscuit and employs the help of Red and Tom in efforts to turn the horse into a competitor.  And boy, do they ever!<br/><br/>It doesn't take long before Seabiscuit is setting records at the local racing track and seeing the marketing possibilities, the ever-opportunist Charles Howard sets his sights on a race with the Triple Crown winner in eastern America named War Admiral.   After repeated dismisses, the owners of War Admiral finally agree to a match race on their terms, but a freak accident breaking the leg of Red Pollard leaves the race in jeopardy. But as if Red knew that someday a movie would be made of his achievements and life decisions, Pollard requests that the race proceed with an adversary jockey at the reins, and history was now in the making.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is one of those unique sports themed, character driven movies that really works, and can be appreciated by anyone - even those that know nothing of the sport or have never attended a race.  Director Gary Ross keeps things simple and uses constant voice-overs to keep the audience in tune with what was happening in the world around them at the time of Seabiscuits rise to stardom.  The camera work during the individual races scenes are astounding and audiences will feel like they are on the track with the jockey's racing Seabiscuit to the finish line.<br/><br/>But what is most surprising about the film is that the horse is really a secondary character.  Seabiscuit is filled with warm and rich performances from everyone involved, most notably the supporting turn for William H. Macy who plays Tick Tock McLaughlin, the host of the racing journal.  Macy's character brings great laughter and energy, and it is in excellent contrast to Jeff Bridges' character that is more mature and in constant mourning over the death of his young son years earlier.<br/><br/>With the screenplay also written by Gary Ross, he had an incredible story to work with.  There is the loss of a child, the revelation that Red is actually blind in one eye, the triumphant victory at Pimlico, and the subsequent injury and return to glory for America's favorite horse and jockey, all packed neatly in under two hours.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit captivated audiences in the summer of 2003 for the tune of a $120 million domestic gross.  Surrounded by loud over-bearing summer entries, people clamored to see a move about a horse that was too small, a jockey that was too big, a trainer that was too old and an owner that was too dumb to know the difference.  Big thumbs up."

The only shortcoming of this movie was the overuse of vulgarities which were very uncommon in the 1930's For one who grew up during the depression the movie took time to show how brutal the depression was. And there were many poignant moments. One scene was of a group of people standing around a car listening to the race on the car radio. It was common in the late thirties for that to happen. One example I remember were the Joe Louis fights. Rarely have I seen a movie that so realistically depicted both the scenery and the moods of the times. One exception was the scenes taken in the Los Angeles Union Station. In the background was a lighted sign. That sign is in the present  Union Station but it was not in the Station during the 1930's and 1940's.<br/><br/>Viewers who did not grow up in the Great Depression might not appreciate this movie as much as they should and Seabiscuit, the horse, was a great symbol to the common person in the US in those days and the movie brings this out quite well.<br/><br/>The acting while not spectacular, was more than adequate.

","Deliciously nostalgic and, because of the sweeping arc of the story, necessarily episodic, Seabiscuit is a hopeful remembrance of a nearly hopeless time.  Set in the Great Depression, Seabiscuit weaves an almost magical tale of how a horse, thought to be worthless, found its true worth, and in so doing, inspired the men around him to do the same.<br/><br/>It is no coincidence that the movie bears a striking similarity in theme, mode and tone to The Natural.  The scores of both movies were done by the incomparable Randy Newman.  There's even a specific composition that appears in its entirety in both movies.  It would be easy to draw the extended comparison that The Natural, with its baseball team called The Knights, was really a retelling of the  Arthurian legend, complete with a magical ""sword"", and so is Seabiscuit.  Why not?  The knights in this movie ride on mighty steeds and bear their colors like armor.  They even joust once in a while on the tracks, so this really is a tale of knights and knaves, of horses and armor, and of triumph in the face of failure.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is quite simply the finest actor of his age, a Stradivarius among rented band instruments with a tone that can only be coaxed out by the finest maestro. Who better to play this instrument than Gary Ross?  He directed and wrote Maquire's beautiful performance in Pleasantville, and also gave us Tom Hanks in Big, directed of course by Penny Marshall, the most underestimated director in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges deliver beautiful standout performances, and we expect nothing less of them.  Cooper has become one of the best character actors in the business.  Also present is perhaps Cooper's only peer in the realm of character acting, William H. Macy, who, coincidentally, also worked with Maguire and Ross in Pleasantville.  Paging Six Degrees.<br/><br/>
In the end, this movie isn't quite the movie that either The Natural or Pleasantville is, but it is nuanced and inspiring and gives us a fine chance to see Maguire work."

","""Seabiscuit"" is a very compelling film about one of the greatest race horses of all time and how he overcame adversity during the roughest of times to capture the hearts of America.  <br/><br/>There's so much to tell about the horse, the people surrounding him, and the era in which he raced, but the movie concentrates on two events in Seabiscuit's life, his victory in a match race with the reigning Triple Crown winner, War Admiral, and his comeback from a ruptured tendon to win the Santa Anita Derby.<br/><br/>Along for the ride are ""Red"" Pollard, the horse's jockey, who is a story in and of himself.  Abandoned during the Depression by his parents, he becomes a jockey of minor importance until he connects with Seabiscuit.  He also comes back from an injury to his leg and rides the horse in his triumphal return.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit's trainer is Tom Smith, a fringe player at best, who loves horses and knows how to communicate with them.  He's asked to pick out a horse for Charles Howard, a wealthy car dealer in California who wants to get into the business.  He selects a small one who's ornery and hard to train, but who he thinks has a lot of heart.<br/><br/>I didn't think there was anything special about the directing in this movie - the story is so good it kind of tells itself.  The scenes involving the races themselves were better than in most films of this sort.  There's a built-in problem of filming a horse race because of the impossibility of placing a camera in the right spot and capturing all the action in one take. Plus, there's no way to really capture the huge crowds that followed Seabiscuit by using a few hundred extras and some clever camera angles. Still, the action was exciting.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges did an excellent job of playing Seabiscuit's owner, Charles Howard.  He too has faced adversity - the Depression hurts his business, his son dies in an accident, and his wife leaves him.  His speeches championing America's horse and his support for ""Red"" Pollard and all the other underdogs in life are heartwarming and frame the story.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper is very good playing Tom Smith in an understated way.  He's the old pro who doesn't get excited very much, and his role in the film is to support Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire, who plays the jockey, ""Red"" Pollard. Maguire seems a little out of his element in this role but he does alright with it.  The real surprise is Gary Stevens, a real jockey, who is excellent as George Woolf, maybe the most famous rider of his time and who takes over for Pollard when he's injured.  Stevens has several important scenes and handles them like a real pro.<br/><br/>Definitely a film worth watching even if you're not a horse racing fan. It's a real feel-good story and the producers were smart to put it out right before Christmas."

","Being a fan of Seabiscuit the horse, I was very anxious to see this movie for the first time. I was even more anxious to purchase the DVD because it contained so many interesting special features. But when I purchased the DVD I found that the insert was nothing more than a blank sheet of white paper with a security device, and one of the ""Special Features"" (not listed on the DVD jacket) was a 3-minute long commercial for Buick cars, pretending to be a 1930's ""documentary"". I was so offended that I immediately returned the disk for a refund, and had to make quite a scene to get it. I'm sure the filmmaker's put a lot of work into this film, but I'll never know the results because commercials have no place on a DVD--that's the reason I don't watch television or go to the theater, for Heaven's sake!

","It seems slightly pointless. Maybe I'm so used to quirky offbeat movies which are dramatic or fx-ridden to some degree, but Seabiscuit was just so straight-forward that I was left wondering whether I enjoyed it or not. It is an old-fashioned tale based on a true story about a horse called Seabiscuit who gave America something to cheer about when it was experiencing strife at the beginning of the 20th century. I mean yes, I guess it's worth telling the story, but it seemed such a sanitised and hollow portrait. Maybe that was all they could do with the story, but I was left wondering where the punchline was. This movie didn't seem to have a message, or anything to drive home to the viewer. I am probably alone in these criticisms, but hey. It *was* well acted, very well directed and the overall narrative was certainly good, with appropriate humour inserted every so often. It just seemed to lack a purpose, with very little twists or turns. Even if it's based on a true story, they can use dramatic licence to excite things up a little, but I reckon they didn't here.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie, but just lacking a bit of depth."

After that, the story started to come together, but I still can't say that the first 30 minutes really enhanced the rest of the film. It did give some insights into the characters which explained their actions later in the film, but still I don't think it was entirely worth it.<br/><br/>Then we come to the later part of the film, where things start happening. Where we actually meet Sea Biscuit and such. It was interesting, though somewhat predictable.<br/><br/>I think one of the things that I liked most about this movie was the abstracted parts. It's based during the Depression and Sea Biscuit becomes a symbol of picking yourself up and continuing. Because if you don't, you won't go anywhere. If you do, nearly anything is possible.

","I don't normally enjoy sports movies and I have no interest in horseracing, but you'd have to be emotionally stunted not to be engaged by this old-fashioned, uplifting tale of a small, ungainly racehorse which galvanised 1930s America at a time of deep Depression. The account has been told before on film in 1949 with ""The Story Of Seabiscuit"", but it is Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book that has led to this big budget treatment from writer and director Gary Ross. <br/><br/>What lifts the film above most sports-orientated films is the social and political context that it provides, reminding us of the grinding poverty that followed the Wall Street Crash with one in four Americans out of work. The familiar narrative tones of historian David McCullough, the use of contemporary photographs, and the excellent costuming and sets give the movie something of the feel of a documentary. In a a very real sense, Seabiscuit's unlikely success was a metaphor for the hope that still burned in every little man's heart. <br/><br/>The seal on the work's success is its uniformly fine acting, especially from those portraying the three men who were as much healed by Seabiscuit as the horse himself was nursed by them. Jeff Bridges, as the millionaire owner Charles Howard, fits the role like a glove; Chris Cooper, fresh from his success on ""Adaptation"", gives another carefully measured performance as the unconventional trainer Tom Smith; while Tobey Maguire - who worked with the director on ""Pleasantville"" - is much better cast here than in ""Spiderman"" as the jockey Red Pollard. If one needed more, then a cameo appearance from William H Macey (another veteran of ""Pleasantville"") is superb as a manic-mannered radio commentator."

","In the tradition of overtly sentimental and feel-good movies from Hollywood, Seabiscuit makes a good stab at becoming the ultimate horse movie (if ever there was such a thing). It appears right that sentiment is consigned to stolid lip-biting and mute scenes of grief but less pleasing that any feel-good factor is replaced by only small doses of excitement and wisps of knowledge from the spin-king Bridges. Having said this however, Seabiscuit is a very credible movie cheapened only by the narration that appears to gloss other great swathes of the history of the horse. There must be more to know about this seemingly amazing horse? What we get instead is the lives of the jockey, the trainer, and the owner. Each in their own way moving, but each also in fits and starts. Bridges and Maguire's lives are covered in depth but Chris Cooper's admirable part is left to hang in the wind and we never really know what motivates him. The result being that too many strands are forced together. Admittedly, most of these work very nicely but they contrive to give the film an extended running time. Happily however, the film does not peak too early and leaves enough for a pleasing dash down the final straight."

","I saw this movie today expecting big things because of the 7.7 it got on the website.  I thought it was a good story to adapt to film, but was not done properly. The movie did not push the theme of the film enough, the theme of hope in hard times.  It did touch on it in the narration, but was not thorough enough.  I also thought the races were a little far-fetched (the jockeys talking during the races), but I know nothing about horses so maybe i'm wrong. The film tries too hard to become an epic.  Probably more than half the film has an orchestra in the soundtrack, which gets annoying over time.  Also, so much of the races were shot in slow-motion with the orchestra, instead of the race commentary. On the other hand, I thought the acting was very good, especially Bridges. The film had barely any references to gambling, which was good as this would have made the film more superficial. The movie probably goes for 10 mins too long in the first half, but is made up for in the second half. Overall, 8 out of 10 (very good, but not great)"
"portia-1","Null","0","0","9 November 2003"," Sorry that this is a criticism - could have been brilliant.
","I was itching to see this film because I love racing and also this period of US history but it should have been better. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to racing fans but Gary Ross could have done a far better job, he had so much to work with. The horse was far tougher than the film shows. Seabiscuit set 13 course records on eight separate tracks over six different distances, those achievements are a gift for a movie maker and Ross did not exploit them enough. The horse was an icon of his era. There is always a danger when making films about animals that they become too sentimental or really 'cheesy', happily Ross just about avoided this although some of the humour was a bit banal. Seabiscuit was a horse that the public adored, he was like a horsey equivalent of David Beckham and again the movie did not show this. Toby Maguire is  not  strong enough in the role of Red Plummer, he appeared to be holding back something. This talented young actor was wasted. I thought Chris Cooper would have had a more dominant role as the trainer and yet again he too was not given enough to do with the part. Jeff Bridges was solid as always and was the least disappointing and most plausible of the human protagonists. The best part of the film without doubt are the excellent racing scenes, very well handled by Chris McCarron and Rusty Hendrickson the horse wrangler. These are as realistic as they can get and that pleased me because I felt racing people would have appreciated the care that was taken in producing such well orchestrated scenes. Go see the film, you will enjoy it but like me you will probably feel that it falls short of being a great movie, such a pity because Ross had it all there for him to put together, particularly as it is a true story. In fairness people who rarely go to the cinema but love racing will thoroughly enjoy it, but if your are like me and a bit of  a purist at heart where movies are concerned there is much to criticise. Perhaps I see too many films and am being unkind or ultra fussy. I feel that all concerned wasted a wonderful opportunity to score a massive hit. This is not worthy of Oscars which is sad because for once it would be great for a real family film to scoop the awards.That said, it will do better in USA than UK because the horse was American and  means so much more to the American people."

","It is hard to deny that Seabiscuit is a well put together and well directed film, and analytically it falls foul in few places- it has character development, decent camera work, engaging direction and sturdy acting. Yet, when it comes down to it, few people will be able to enjoy a film about a racehorse. It's never going to be exciting as aliens invading or gladiators or films with bigger, greater storylines. That said, I am only 17 and to be fair i believe this film would be appreciated much more by older people who are looking for a truly decent heart warmer. And, despite my usual detest of feel-good-films, I did find the race scene between Seabiscuit and The Admiral incredible, it was built up fantastically and undoubtably the best patch in the film. In conclusion, Seabiscuit is a fantastic film in terms of logical analysis. Yet simply by its subject it has condemned itself to be a film which will never find great amounts of support or praise since it is a film aimed at such a narrow margin of cinema-going audiences.

","Ignore the odd ludicrous comment that this was a propaganda movie--it's nothing of the kind. It never made me think of 9/11 in the vaguest fashion (and the book it was based on was published in March of 2001), Jeff Bridges' character doesn't resemble George Bush in any conceivable way, Christianity has nothing to do with a non-religious hero who sleeps with a hooker down in Mexico, and the view of America is pretty bleak and poignant, nothing like the glowing triumph depicted by a certain commenter who enjoyed making political remarks rather than actually reviewing the movie. The film has basically nothing to do with America; it is just set there. The underlying themes underscore human dreams, and the history lessons (admittedly a bit dry, but interesting) were rather obviously not intended as ""the way we should be"", but rather, ""the way they were"". The movie looks back on a more innocent time, when people were brave and exhilarated... and destitute, and sometimes tragically foolish, believing in black-and-white ideals which didn't fit their reality. This America is full of poor people, unpleasant people, silly people, simple people, kind souls, fools, and ruthless bullies.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't possess an irrational hatred of America--to the point where they think every American movie is right-wing propaganda used by the evil government to infect the thoughts of a populace which has no ability to think for itself--will probably not regard this movie as anything but a film about hope and bittersweet, broken victories, well-acted and well-scored. The message I got from it was that you can't have a perfect life, but if you keep working at it, you may at least come out of it with something. Obvious, but meaningful nonetheless.<br/><br/>It may seem amusing or naive to those who wish to feel superior, that some of us enjoyed this film... but anyone with a good head on their shoulders, no matter what country they're from, will realize that this is actually a true story.

","Director Gary Ross clearly wanted this movie to tell the story of the time in which the great Seabiscuit ran almost as much as he wished to tell the story of the horse itself; indeed, to him it would seem the two stories are inseperable.  That's laudable and though at times some of the scenes that focus on and tell us about the epoch the horse ran in don't jell with the ones they sit between, I nonetheless appreciated getting that sense of those years.  It's unfortunate that in a linear manner, this story, the real one, which they seemingly slavishly stuck to, has some dramatic moments in places that don't serve films well.  It seems like the movie is over, for example, when Toby Maguire is hurt, replaced by another jockey, and then they win the big challenge race anyhow.  But it lunges forward from that for another 30 minutes before ending with stuff that is not nearly as dramatic or interesting as the stuff surrounding the challenge race was.  Also, knowing horse racing a bit, did they really need to have extended dialogue with the jockeys during races?  It don't happen, sure a few words here and there but riding a thoroughbred race horse is a tough, dangerous and physically demanding job and you don't got time for anything resembling real conversation.  And no jockey is gonna be off for a year or more and then ride in a huge race for BIG money with no other races to get him back into riding shape mentally and physically; to expect us to believe that is a real big stretch.  The acting isn't bad but both Bridges and Maguire seem hardly needed, there's not much room for them to shine.  Chris Cooper, on the other hand, is wonderful, he's understated and strong, with loads of integrity. Seabiscuit on the whole is a wonderful story about a wonderful horse in a difficult time that, against big odds, triumphs over a lot of adversity.  I can see why Ross wanted to marry that story with the time in which Seabiscuit ran, and that decision alone makes the movie worth seeing."

I was convinced she would not sleep through Seabiscuit - and sure enough she was wide awake to the end.  I then went and read the book.<br/><br/>This is one case where the movie and the book are equally good, i.e. I am not going to say how awful the movie was in comparison with the book. They have the same effect on the reader or viewer.  The screenplay deviates from the book, but one understands why one would do it, to make a Hollywood movie and get information across efficiently. (For example, in real life the owner had more than one son, whereas in the movie he has only one child. In real life War Admiral was a stunningly beautiful classic looking racehorse; he was taller than Seabiscuit, but he was sleeker - Seabiscuit was the heavier, more solid horse. In the movie the message was that Seabiscuit was ""small"" and War Admiral was ""large"".)<br/><br/>I read some of the more recent reviews here and don't understand the negative ones.  The ""documentary"" voice? It was great, had just the right sound to give you the history lessons.  ""Political"" content?

","""Seabiscuit"" is a beautiful looking movie, but ultimately feels like a tableau reenactment.  The only element not static is the frequent, of course, horse races, which I zoned out of with repetition and slo mo's. <br/><br/>
With David McCullough's narration and integration of black & white photos of the period, it feels like an extended version of the hour-long ""American Experience"" episode on PBS, which also included excellent interviews with book author Laura Hillenbrand, whose book I have not yet read. <br/><br/>
Every emotion is visually telegraphed then repeated with writer/director Gary Ross's script.  For example, at the moment before jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is introduced to the horse, we see trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) look at Seabiscuit reared up fighting against stable boys and see him comparing that to Red fighting off attacks from fellow jockeys.  Then again.  And again -- hey, we got it, they share something, thanks.  And, oh yeah, they need each other. <br/><br/>The opening panorama as we are quickly introduced to the background of each character, and the final section when each rises to deal with calamity are the most moving.  <br/><br/>While it looks like all the period recreation is authentic, the sets and people seem to be playing more dress-up than fully realized people, though Maguire puts some liveliness into his portrayal.  <br/><br/>Real life jockey Gary Stevens was quite good, though the guy behind me, who offered commentary throughout the film, kept complaining that there was no way the jockeys could be having those extended conversations during the races. <br/><br/>Yes, you'll tear up, as every melodramatic element in this story is hammered home, supported by Randy Newman's uncharacteristically maudlin and incessant score."

Forget the underdog connotations and what-not, for the real pleasure of the story was how it unfolded. From the effects of the Great Depression and the need for national stability, the force of an icon like Seabiscuit was quite interesting to see on the silver screen. Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges were especially good in this film, making their opposing dynamics work with charm and realism. However, Tobey Maguire was especially good, putting on his game face for a movie that required one, not the opposite (like Spiderman). Watch the movie for the great race sequences, and enjoy the heart-felt simplicity of the story."

","Writer/director Gary Ross has made a triumphant film out of Laura Hillenbrand's beloved bestseller.  Like the original author, Ross gathers the strands of his story slowly, showing how the lives of three initially unrelated people  an owner, a trainer and a jockey  converge at a single point, the racehorse phenomenon known as Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>Both Hillenbrand and Ross have conceived of Seabiscuit as a metaphor for his time, a beacon of hope and inspiration for a despairing, Depression-ravaged nation.  He is certainly that and more for the three troubled men whose lives he touches, providing each with the opportunity to overcome immense odds, achieve some form of redemption, and put some meaning back into his life.<br/><br/>Given its `inspirational' subject matter, `Seabiscuit' could easily have dissolved into little more than a sappy `feel-good' movie.  Luckily for us, the low-keyed approach Ross has taken towards the material purges it of sentimentality.  The movie is upbeat and heartwarming, yet we rarely feel as if the film is pushing our buttons in any obviously manipulative way.  Much of the credit goes to Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire, three superb actors who know how to underplay their parts to achieve maximum effect.  William H. Macy provides a wonderful comic turn as the hilariously overwrought and corny racetrack announcer who reflects the gee-whiz tone of a nation captivated by this amazing animal.  <br/><br/>Visually, the film is superb, thanks to John Schwarztman's lovely cinematography, which imbues the bucolic 1930's setting with a kind of nostalgic glow, as well as to the handsome art direction and costume design that perfectly capture the look of the era.  The horserace sequences have been masterfully staged and edited and rank with the best ever put on film. <br/><br/>
`Seabiscuit,' clearly one of the best mainstream movies of 2003, is a true first place finisher."

","Having read about the movie and having seen the trailers (which were very well-done, by the way), I expected the film to be an absolute thriller and a runaway Oscar nominee but when I did see it, I felt it fell short of my expectations...<br/><br/>There is enough controversy about the 1940 Santa Anita race, where Seabiscuit won the elusive title on his third attempt, but I think director Gary Ross really botched that part.  I am not talking about the controversy surrounding owner Charles Howard's other horse, Kayak II in the race but about the way Ross ends the movie without showing the actual ending of the race.  Quite a few of the people in the theater were wondering if Seabiscuit won that race, or if he was just able to participate in that race.  Only those who had done their homework knew that jockey Red Pollard did ride Seabiscuit to a win that day.<br/><br/>Also, a fact-based movie like this one should have an ""afterword"" or ""epilogue"" section saying a few words about the future of the lead characters.  But there is no such epilogue here, and to me, that is simply unconscionable.<br/><br/>The one part of the film that comes out really well is the famous Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral showdown.  Seabiscuit's victory over War Admiral was indeed authentic, and so is its depiction in the movie.  No doubt the portrayal was realistic because the riders of the two horses in the film are both Hall of Fame jockeys in real life.<br/><br/>Overall, I went to the movie expecting to see an Oscar contender that would leave its opponents in the dust, as its title character Seabiscuit often did.  But now I am not so sure.  In terms of class, I would put this movie a lot closer to ""Amistad"" than to ""Schindler's List"".  And we do know that while the latter ran away with several Oscars, the former hardly made any news."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","0","0","28 August 2003"," The Movie that could...
","Gary Ross's ""Sea Biscuit"" is the best movie of the year, and moreover, it is simply a great movie. Written and directed by Gary Ross, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand ""Sea Biscuit"" is a wonderfully woven fable-like tale that moves, touches, and inspires. What ""Sea Biscuit"" is about is greatness-- having heart. It is unmistakeably sentimental, and I love sentimental done well. <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges is solid as Charles Howard, a depression era millionaire, who becomes the owner of Sea Biscuit. Biscuit is a descendant of Man of War, but he never seemed to reach his potential. The horse is ""a little banged up."" And so is Howard (Bridges). He tragically lost a young son, and soon after is divorced from his wife. Howard slowly creates a new life. He marries a young wife, Marcela (a strong and beautiful Elizabeth Banks). After buying Sea Biscuit, he assembles a team of seemingly misfits around the horse. Chris Cooper is effective as the horse whisperer like trainer, Tom Smith. Tobey Maguire captures the spirit and charm of Red Pollard, the ""too big"" jockey for this small horse. Howard ends up challenging the best bred and trained horse of that era, in what was deemed the race of the century. <br/><br/>I initially wrote off seeing ""Sea Biscuit""-- how interesting can a movie about a horse be? Then a dear friend, John, recommended that I see it, because he said that the movie is really about perfection versus greatness. Both live in the realm of excellence, but are distinct. And that definitely interested me. Perfection is like the horse Sea Biscuit races (I don't even remember the name). He is the biggest, the strongest, has the best genes and the best training. Red (Maguire) says that what makes Sea Biscuit great is that he has heart. Bridges say at a pivotal point in the movie, ""You don't put someone 'down', just 'cause they're a little banged up."" At some point throughout the entire movie, every one of these characters is down whether it is Red or Biscuit. And there is always someone to give them a hand up. Perhaps greatness lies in community and family, and perfection is a lonely pursuit. All the racing sequences are breathtaking. I was truly moved and touched during the final sequences of the movie. Yes, I was cheering. ""Sea Biscuit"" is truly great-- It has heart."

Great hats, especially the Panamas.  I liked Bridges' Optimo style.

","Oscar material?<br/><br/>Play the Oscar game? Why not? This is as good a way to assess the merits of a film as any.<br/><br/>Best supporting actor? If it is written (but who wrote that?) that a performer cannot win an Oscar in the same category two years in a row, and if history itself could be rewritten, Chris Cooper should receive that award this year, instead of having received it last year, for his role in ADAPTATION, an intriguing, but lesser film. His performance as Tom Smith is unique : he invented a special way to talk, a special way to be for his character. That is what acting is all about at the highest level, the level of a Laughton or an Olivier, which is precisely what we are talking about here. But he will certainly be nominated. The Academy has but little choice in that regard.<br/><br/>Best supporting actress... Although she is unlikely to be nominated, Elizabeth Banks fully deserves to be recognized for her achievement in insuring a strong and attractive feminine presence in a film set in an almost exclusively male world.<br/><br/>Best actor? Jeff Bridges would deserve a nomination, but is unlikely to get the prize, unless the Academy wants to make a gesture, and reward him both for his performance in this film and for the rest of his worthy career, as happens sometimes.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire could also be nominated, but I would be surprised if he got anything, if only because HollywoodÕs mind is not yet made up about his unusual approach to his craft. This film, in which the young actor breaks new ground for himself like in none of his previous work (which is to say a great deal), constitutes one more testimony to his extraordinary potential. But this is ensemble work, and, fine as his performance may be, the script, as is, does not allow him to stand out in the way that he did in both THE CIDER HOUSE RULES and WONDER BOYS.<br/><br/>If Gary Ross were to receive an award, it should be as director, rather than for his screenplay. At the same time, as a foreigner who has always admired American ideals, I cannot but be charmed by the refreshing simplicity of his patriotism, apparently innocent of the tacky and at times aggressive nationalism that is all too common in Hollywood. No flag-waving here, because no flag-waving is needed : this is love and country pure and simple.<br/><br/>It would be a shame if SEABISCUIT, which is so magnificent to look at, were not nominated for best cinematography, and there would  need to be a very strong contender emerging over the next six months to beat it in that category.<br/><br/>Finally... Best picture? SEABISCUIT is likely to be nominated for that award, but just as likely not to get it, regardless of its intrinsic qualities and those of the competition, as there will be pressures on the Academy to recognize the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. That will be its last chance to do so, by design, as it were, inasmuch it seems to have waited until the third year to make that almost inevitable move. Unless THE RETURN OF THE KING is markedly weaker than the previous two instalments (which is improbable), it is almost a shoe-in for best film."

"slimjack","8","0","0","19 August 2003"," A well told tale
","Seabiscuit is the true story of how a small, crook-legged thoroughbred became a champion and one of the fastest horses ever to run a track.  It is also the story of how this horse brought healing into the lives of three stricken men and became an inspiration for Depression struck '30s America. Sounds a bit gooey, doesn't it?  I mean, just add Shirley Temple and you'd have a movie capable of tripling the national glucose level.  Don't let the description scare you. This is an excellent movie that won't rot your teeth.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of Seabiscuit has been criticized as its main flaw. The film is paced at an amiable ramble rather than a gallop. It takes its time, gives each character a leisurely introduction and lets the viewer soak in the depression era period. The movie trusts that its story is strong enough to hold the viewer's attention. It must be said, however, that if you don't think the adventures of a loveable car salesman, a crusty horse-loving bum and a half blind kid entertaining you might find the first hour or so before the introduction of Seabiscuit rough sledding. Look at it this way, while the set-up might seem long and slow, when you get to the racing sequences you get a huge payoff for your investment. Not only do you have the thrill of watching Seabiscuit's rush to glory, because the movie takes its time in introducing you to the protagonists and milieu you appreciate what the horse's success meant to these men and the country.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have of Seabiscuit is that it feels remote at times. It takes a reserved, glossy approach to the subject matter. The 1930s come across as a beautiful museum exhibit with everything lacquered to the highest possible sheen. As much as I loved the look I couldn't help wondering if the actual thirties horse track atmosphere weren't a bit more ragged around the edges.<br/><br/>The acting is somewhat of a mixed bag. Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, a man who achieves all he could wish for and then experiences the worse of personal tragedies. It is he who buys the unpromising colt and gives him the chance to succeed. While Bridges has played the go-getting businessman before he doesn't bring much depth to his character this time around. He has the car salesman side down pat but stumbles when suggesting Howard's emotional scars. Likewise Tobey Maguire, playing Seabiscuit's hard-knock jockey Red Pollard, doesn't begin to embody the scrappy youth Pollard must have been. Like most of his generation of actors Maguire is better at summoning emotional moments than building a character. While we buy him as an emotionally damaged yet determined young man it is very hard to accept him as a jockey.  While both Bridges and Maguire are likeable in their roles they rarely seem more than the movie stars they are. Not so Chris Cooper. Cooper plays horse trainer Tom Smith, the strange loner who brings out the champion in Seabiscuit. Cooper is fantastic. You'd swear he'd wandered onto the set after spending a lifetime riding the high plains with only horses for company.<br/><br/>As undeniably fun as explosions, car chases and shootouts are, there is something about seeing a movie that actually boasts characters and a plot. Seabiscuit tells a fascinating story that truly earns its emotional moments."

","I'm typically pretty OK at having an objective view of a movie as far as its quality, and then I can separate out my personal attachment to the movie itself. I say that because I LOVE this movie to the extreme -- and for those of you that know me well, it's mostly because I just dig horses. I think they are the absolute coolest, most noble and beautiful animals ever, and they totally have their own personalities. Therefore, if you remotely like horses at all, you'll dig this movie.<br/><br/>However, it's not just about horses. I think Gary Ross (director) did a great job of not only depicting the story of the horse Seabiscuit, but also correlating the stories of the 3 men that played a huge part in his fame, and how their stories paralleled where the country was at that day and age. It's a 2 1/2 hr. long movie, but it successfully maintained my interest. Tobey Macguire did his typical excellent acting job, but this role was a little different for him -- he got to play more of a man than he ever has before, and a complex one -- a big mix of rage & bravado versus his sensitivity and need for recognition. Chris Cooper played the rather silent but intuitive horse trainer, a good foil for Tobey's character ""Red."" Jeff Bridges was great, and played your general likeable guy who was kind of the anchor & motivator for the horse and the other 2 characters.<br/><br/>Anyone remotely interested in history will like this movie because periodically, as the characters entered different phases of their story, the movie would depart briefly into a History-Channel-documentary style of black&white photos and narration that illustrated where the country was at that time also, with Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, and then the comeback after that.<br/><br/>All in all, I really dug this movie. I was way moved by it, and plan to see it again in the next week. And just to blow a possible ending for everyone, the horse does NOT die at the end of the movie -- something I have been scarred by in other horse movies!!!<br/><br/>And guys, if you feel like it's not a manly thing for you to go see this flick, don't go there -- there are basically 2 women in a cast full of men, and if you need to feel some testosterone for your viewing pleasure, Tobey Macguire puts off enough male angst to satisfy your needs."

The beginning starts out slowly, carefully, introducing the characters and giving them humanity and depth.  The viewer who pays attention will be richly rewarded later on. The race scenes are exciting, especially up close, and give the viewer the chance to experience what jockeys may experience.

McCullough's earnest narration accompanied by that feel good music was the first thing that turned me off: if there's something to be felt or said, does it have to be so saccharine?  Then it seemed like the characters had no individuality, esp. the 2nd wife, who seemed to just be there and look pretty.  I really didn't think there was any plot development over a really simple story.  <br/><br/>The one character I was amused by was Tick-Tock.  Besides that, the talk about the horses' personalities was more interesting than the humans'.  Of course the action shots were nice, but beyond these examples I didn't feel too much interest. <br/><br/>The last watered-down thing I wanted to mention was the rags over riches theme, or ""class-warfare light.""  There were good rich people (Jeff Bridges) and bad rich people (the rival) and good poor people.  I understand that Seabiscuit captured the common man's imagination, and that's great.  But, if only Jeff had some kind of foot fetish, I would have been more satisfied.<br/><br/>I guess it could be summed up by saying what I said to myself in the theater:  ""Okay, this is a tearful moment, and I feel the emotion, but I feel like I'm being manipulated into that emotion.""

","The experience of reading Laura Hillenbrand's SEABISCUIT is one of those rare instances where the right author and subject converge to give the mass readership an unforgettable interpretation of a famous historical character and the events that surrounded his life. The fact that the main protagonist is a diminutive Thoroughbred race horse whose nascent racing career was nearly ended by trainers who misunderstood the beast, and the resulting triumph of that beleaguered animal and his human cohorts who brought him to glory makes this Depression Era Saga all the more compelling. Hillenbrand's great narrative gift was to immerse the reader in another time and place, in this case the gritty, vivid world of America's Depression years. Spanning the entire decade of the 1930's, this true tale of a ""little horse that could"" becomes much more than just another horse story.<br/><br/>SEABISCUIT is really an Epic, covering the sweeping changes in the transportation industry as well as the dramatic events that shaped the first half of the Twentieth Century in America. How those industrial changes and social events are tied to the main characters in Hillenbrand's story makes for indelible reading.<br/><br/>SEABISCUIT has a narrative drive and epic sweep not unlike Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND.<br/><br/>In transferring this modern American Classic to the to the screen, director Gary Ross took on a daunting task. As Hillenbrand wrote it, the book covers an awful lot of ground. It starts with a young man on a train trip West with 21 cents in his pocket and ends 44 years later in the high country of California. It is peopled with unforgettable characters: Charles Howard , a former bicycle repair man who became an enormously wealthy automobile dealer ; his beloved second wife, Marcela, who turned Howard's life around after a family tragedy and became a savvy business partner in her own right ; Red Pollard, a down and out jockey who traveled the amateur racing circuit looking for his big break ; Tom Smith, a taciturn, tight-lipped horse trainer who had a secret communication with the equine world ; and George Woolf, the colorful, dashing jockey who raced into the History Books<br/><br/>The movie of SEABISCUIT is a horse of a very different color. Director Garry Ross has made a staid and stately film of Hillenbrand's book. Technically the movie is very impressive, with its beautifully composed panoramic shots, authentic sets and costumes. The acting by the main principals is hard to fault. Tobey Maguire, a master of understatement, does some real stretching here ; his Red Pollard is a scrappy, moving performance. Chris Cooper offers a more amiable take on the Tom Smith character.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard with a sad eyed countenance. As for Seabiscuit , whatever alchemy created this equine character for the screen, it's a great portrayal. The nag is captured in all his moods, from stubborn and rebellious to cunning and victorious. Unfortunately, Ross's film is terribly disappointing. As impressive as the picture is in its physical recreation of the times, it trips up in what should be its most important element : the screenplay. The dialog spoken by the main characters is reduced to cliché ridden bromides. It's understandable that certain dramatic licenses are taken to make a filmed story work dramatically, but in this case there doesn't seem to be the ""ring of truth' to the verbal exchanges. As a result it undermines the movie's authenticity and what emerges is a larger than life historical pageant that only occasionally moves and thrills. Nevertheless, SEABISCUIT does offer a glimpse into the American Past. It's an earnest and honorable effort but It's no substitute for Laura Hillenbrand's saga, a story teeming with the sights and sounds of The Depression and Thoroughbrd Racing on every page. And that is the great difference. The movie has no life of its own."

","This is a film that requires some patience while viewing but its well worth the time because when the final credits start to roll you fully appreciate the invested time it took to get to know each of the characters. This true story starts out with Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) who first starts a bicycle shop and then goes into selling automobiles and becomes very rich. He's married and one day while out on business tragedy strikes when his only son dies in a traffic accident. His wife leaves him and now with the depression going on Charles must figure out what to do with his life. He decides to get involved in horseracing and looks for a trainer until he discovers a poor man named Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) who shows an unconventional knowledge of horses. Smith comes upon a horse that is both lazy and mean but likes his heart. He also needs a unique jockey that can ride him and this is where he meets Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) who is a down in his luck stableboy with a temper. The three men form a bond and slowly get Seabiscuit trained to race. He starts winning all the West Coast races and now Charles wants to have a big race with the East Coast horse War Admiral. The owner Sam Riddle (Eddie Jones) at first says no but Charles keeps winning and the press and public force Riddle to agree to a race. About a week before the race Red breaks his leg and instead of cancelling he tells Charles and Tom to get George Woolf (Gary Stevens) who is a very good jockey. They of course win the big race which has the largest radio audience ever but the doctors tell Red he will never race again. Later, Seabiscuit hurts his leg and the vet says she will never race again either and that he should be put down. After time passes Red wants to race Seabiscuit again! Both have healed legs but how well healed? This film is directed by Gary Ross and its only his second job at directing a film. His first was ""Pleasantville"" which also starred Maguire. In both films Ross has shown a knack for heartwarming dramas without allowing the story to get to corny. The performances are top notch and everyone seems well cast especially Cooper. He's become one of the more effective character actors and he has the ability to transform himself to whatever character is needed. I wouldn't be surprised if he receives another Oscar nomination. Bridges again demonstrates the maturity needed for this film that has many quiet moments and he seems very comfortable during these scenes. Maguire who has worked with Ross before gives arguably the best performance of his career. He displays both the resentment of being left by his parents and the gratitude of becoming someone important with his gift of riding. All three actors play off each other well and its because this film clearly defines each character. This is a film that is very patient in the way it tells its story but it does a beautiful job of allowing the characters and situations to become understandable to the viewer. When the film finally ends you can't help but have a strong connection to it because you've invested so much time to get to know the characters. Not only is this good filmmaking but its good storytelling. A winning combo!"

","I found ""Seabiscuit"" to be a simple, endearing little tale whose sweetness and sincerity compensates for its questionable plotline.  The film would have faired well to included a small little epilogue stating Seabiscuit's impressive record (he one 33 races) and when he passed away.  I would have also been interested to see what happened to Red Pollard.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the performances in this film, especially Chris Cooper's. Cooper, who plays an aging cowboy/horsewhisperer bealleaguered by the rapidly industrialized landscape of the early 1900s, delivers a charming account of a scrupulous, decent man, whose expertise on horse racing is based almost purely on instinct and faith.  Tobey Maguire displays great versatility in his role as jockey Red Pollard.  In what may be considered a demanding role, Macguire deftly shifts his emotional makeup during different stages of Red Pollard's life, showing a gradual erosion of Pollard's embittered rage as his relationship with Seabiscuit and Charles develops.  Perhaps what is most amazing is that both Macguire and Cooper actually develop a chemistry with the horse who plays Seabiscuit, which shows just how souful and verstaile both actors can be.  Jeff Bridges delivers a fairly ""Tucker by Numbers"" performance, which fits well with his role as the risk-friendly, benevolent entrepreneur Charles Howard.<br/><br/>Gary Ross is to be commended for making several painstaking efforts to make the race scenes in ""Seabiscuit"" appear to be to envigorating, energetic, and most important, genuine to both the spirit of the film and the sport of horseracing.  Indeed, the race scenes are the best part of the movie; however, these scenes would not be so enthralling if it were not for the tapestry of fine performances and endearing dialogue that surround them. What distinguishes""Seabiscuit"" from most other sports films is that the film's success does not so heavily depend on the subject sport.<br/><br/>I award the film *** 1/2 (out of four) only because I disagree with Ross's usage of black-and-white Great Depression scenes throughout the film. Ross should have been confident with the simple and beautiful story itself, without painting such a overtly broad stroke of Americana across the film; this technique, ironically, took away from some of the more unique, subtle depictions of the beauty of the American dream that the film otherwise amply portrayed."

","Seabiscuit is the kind of movie producers love.  It will make the more emotional in the audience cry, and even well before it comes out, it is said to be the first Oscar contender of the year.  This IS a true story, but it is packaged in such a way that audience members are supposed to clutch their tissues to their chests and shake their heads because they have been so touched.  That being said, this movie succeeds spectacularly at manipulating an audience.  I came in with a very cynical attitude, but i must say even I got the chills when Seabiscuit beat War Admiral.  Where this movie fails is after they have got the audiences hearts beating with exciting race scenes. They let it drag to much and soon after the races your heartbeat has settled and then you are struck with another exciting race.  By the final race, I was just too tired to care anymore.  Tobey Maguire was his usual self in this part, which is not that bad.  I was pleasantly surprised with Elizabeth Banks in the lead female role.  She had a quiet awe about her through the whole film which was very effective.  Chris Cooper and William H. Macy were their usual flawless selves in parts written for them.  I could have done without the voice-overs about the Depression, i thought they were not tied together with the rest of the film well enough to stay relevant.  This was a good movie with a few minor flaws that, if corrected, could have made it great.  7/10"

","WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!  DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN SEABISCUIT!  SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Did I mention that there are spoilers here?  Don't read any more of this if you haven't seen the movie.  Really.  I mean it.  I'm not joking around here.  I'm going to be giving away major plot points like they're candy canes on Christmas Day.  OK.  You've been amply forewarned.  Here's the first spoiler:  In this movie, Seabiscuit wins most of the races you see. In fact, (MORE SPOILERS) after an early race, which he loses by a nose because (HERE'S ANOTHER SPOILER) his jockey, Red Pollard, is blind in one eye, he doesn't lose another race.  <br/><br/>Have I spoiled it for you?  I'm sorry.  I tried to warn you.  I promise not to give away any more Seabiscuit spoilers today.  And yet I don't feel like I've spoiled anything because of the way the filmmakers have made it almost irrelevant that anyone familiar with what really happened already knows the plot of the movie.  Catch Me If You Can did it (OOPS! HERE'S ANOTHER SPOILER!) by molding the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. into a story of a young man losing his identity when his family disintegrates, and his struggle to regain it by trying on a lot of different identities, before finally finding himself accidentally when the FBI man who has been dogging him shows him the way to his authentic self.  In Seabiscuit, the stories of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner are told as parables of redemption.  The action takes place during the time of the Great Depression, and as America comes around, so do the lives of the characters in the movie, all of whom have suffered through adversity for reasons mostly unrelated to the economy. The movie's conceit is that America is coming around at least in part because of Seabiscuit's success, which gives hope to the downtrodden. Whether in real life following Seabiscuit gave people a reason to hope or people's need to hope was the reason they followed Seabiscuit, I don't know. I suspect there was a little of both going on, among the people who were aware of Seabiscuit, at least.  Though the movie may like us to think that everyone in America was riveted by this equine underdog, most people are indifferent to horse racing now, and I suspect it was much the same back then.  Regardless, they did a beautiful job of drawing the parallels and making a movie -- where you know the heroes are gonna win the big race  that is satisfying nevertheless.<br/><br/>There are lot of things in this movie to like, including good performances all around by a solid cast -- topped by Chris Cooper once again playing a believable and utterly unforgettable character, lots of period atmosphere  this is a great looking picture and a visual depiction of the depression I had not really seen in the cinema before, and a score that I didn't realize was by Randy Newman because it fits the period so perfectly. Much has been made of the groundbreaking photography of the horse races.  People wonder how it was done.  I don't know how it was done, but it never occurred to me to wonder because I was so caught up in the story. <br/><br/>
PERSONAL NOTE:  I like this movie for two reasons that are entirely personal.  One is that I have had some vision problems in my left eye and was able to see the movie through only one eye, so I identified with Red Pollard for that reason.  The other goes back a lot further.  When I was 15 a carnival came to my neighborhood for the first and last time in my life. There was an empty lot where some buildings had been torn down so there was a place for a carnival to be.  Town homes and a strip mall have since replaced the empty lot.  They had a horse race game there that my friends and I loved to play, and did just about every day it was there.  The horses in the race were named after real horses from history, including Secretariat, who had won the triple crown that very year.  My friends were usually Man o' War and War Admiral.  I was usually Seabiscuit.  I chose him because he had a funny name.  I never knew how he'd gotten that name until this movie came along.  Seabiscuit's father was named Hardtack.  The military ration that armies call hardtack, navies call seabiscuit. <br/><br/>
HISTORICAL NOTE:  This wasn't mentioned in the movie but War Admiral  the überhorse that was Seabiscuit's adversary  was Seabiscuit's uncle."

I think that Toby did an excellent job as Red, and Jeff was very convincing in his role, as well.  It is definitely a feel-good movie, in that the whole audience were cheering when he won races during the movie.... its not very often you can get that much emotion out of an audience....  and this movie does it WELL.<br/><br/>I think that there is a pretty good chance that this may get nominated for a few Oscars, if it doesn't get buried by movies coming out late in the year, like I've seen so many times with some really good movies.

","This movie was about a horse, named, SEA BISCUIT.  However, the REAL HERO of the movie is William H. Macy's announcer character.  It is through the magic of Macy that we come to appreciate all of the harsh realities that Sea Biscuit faces.  Macy tells the story as it was meant to be told in the early part of the last century.  He did get the great scoop (with hot fudge and a cherry on it) when he learned that Sea Biscuit was going to run the 6 furlongs.  I was amazed at how well Macy captured the essence of an announcer, complete with a gap in his mustache!!  The woman that Macy was with was never explained, neither was how Macy came to be invited over to Jeff Bridges house.   But whenever we feel that the country needs some cheering up, it's not only the horse who comes to the rescue, it's William H. Macy.  I really anticipate an oscar nod for his stellar performance.

","---Seabiscuit is a horse for the broken, downtrodden people of the 1930's to give them a champion to root for.  He overcame abuse to become the great horse of the era, and in the process, gave a jockey his last great chance, his trainer his only great champion and his owner a way to overcome his great sorrow at the death of his only son.<br/><br/>A great story has been lovingly made into a very good film with some fine performances.

It shows him  getting the actual race results off the wire and then doing all the sound effects as he does the live broadcast.  This is how baseball and almost all sports were done back then.  The guys were rarely at the events they were doing but they made you think they were and made it all very exciting for those at home listening in.  And that is how the film shows people, sitting around their big radios at home, or crowds of men listening on car radios parked on dirt farm yards.<br/><br/>My two daughters and I just had a great, laughing, lump in the throat, good time at the movies.

"Mandraxx","9","0","0","10 August 2003"," Compelling rendition of the novel
","Seabiscuit, an adaptation of the novel by Laura Hillenbrand, works well by not straying too far from the original storyline. Jockey Red Pollard, played by Tobey Maguire, is the assumed protagonist of the film, suffering hardships which set him back yet never prohibit him achieving the American Dream.  Red's story, the story of a man overcoming all odds to achieve his goal, is enhanced by the era of the Great Depression upon which most of the film operates.  The facts presented, one can relate better to the story of Red than the fairytale of a handsome prince who, by birth, happened to own all the horses on his father's ranch and then one day decided to race. Indeed, Chris Cooper's portrayal of an eccentric trainer and   rendition of the middle-class man who toiled to become a successful enterepeneur, are particular and vivid, and add to the realism of the time frame and story. The transition from the gaudy era of the 1920s to the virtual ghettos and slums which pillaged much of America during the 1930s is not as clean as it could have been but, overall, is still nice.  The backdrop of a narrator helps smooth things over during the movie, providing some nice statistical data for the history-buff and novice alike.  Some of this narration is joined by movie stills, which give the audience a very clear picture of what might be happening during the 1920s and 1930s.  As with all artistic gimmicks, some work and some don't -- in this case, the still frames serve well for some scenes but can spoil others, as if insulting the audience's intelligence by saying 'you're not smart or creative enough to provide any pictures by yourself so we have to give you photos.'<br/><br/>Gimmick or not, Seabiscuit is fresh in that it is a faithful adaptation of a novel with excellent actors.  Tobey Maguire truly shines in this film and, if he has done no other excellent work to distinguish himself, this film will surely make his reputation as a serious actor.  Jeff Bridges turns in a sturdy performance, complementing Tobey Maguire's character very well. Chris Cooper is also great in a supporting role, and fans of William H. Macy will be glad to see his mug on the screen delivering some funny parts."

","Reading through the reviews here, I note several that are thoughtful and insightful.  Of course, there are those ""This movie did nothing for me...,"" comments too and one can expect such in a public forum such as this one. However, as an older reviewer whose mother was a racehorse maven who could give the genealogy (the ""blood lines"") of any major race horse, who could name every jockey and his record, and who could recite statistics better than the Racing Form, I was raised with Seabiscuit and my views are somewhat different.  To begin with, one must start with Lauren Hillenbrand's book on the horse.  She recreates the era that made this horse the legend that he was with all the moles and wrinkles but she also makes the point that it was the combination of horse-- a questionable nag with good bloodlines but a poor showing from the beginning, trainer-- an out-of-the way ex-cowboy who had the 'feel' for horses, the riders-- Red Pollard and Georgie Wolff-- two great jockeys who understood how to get the best out of this amazing animal, and Charles Howard-- entrepreneur, adman and promoter par excellence.<br/><br/>The movie gives us all of this.  Bill Macey's comedy-relief newscaster becomes the clarion for the awakening of the awareness of a new hero born in a time of utter desperation.   The cast is great and the story never gets maudlin.<br/><br/>There may have been a few liberties with the facts but nothing is sacrificed for drama.  The story ends where it ought to end, leaving the viewer with a sense of departing nostalgia.  <br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of a potential classic.  Whether it has legs or not, time will tell.  However, it is definitely worth the price of a ticket to see it on the big screen."

","I went in to ""Seabiscuit"" very optimistic. With nothing else out in theaters other than mindless drivel, ""Seabiscuit"" was sure to be a well made, fulfilling film. I've never yearned for death more than the three hours ""Seabiscuit"" held me in it's icy grip. I'm not going to waste finger strength typing out the story of the movie, and thats for a couple of reasons. Number 1: if you've seen the trailer, you already know all you need to: horse is too small, jockey is too big, trainer is too old, and Jeff Bridges is too dumb to know the difference. Number two: trying to find a definite narrative in ""Seabiscuit"" is like looking for love in all the wrong places. From the get-go, you know the ship is sinking. The movie opens with a 'History Channel' clip about Henry Ford and the automobile. I tried to remain objective, and thought, ""Well, I'm sure that this all has a place in the plot."" And at first it does, but it goes nowhere. The movie is chock full of these black and white vignettes which inform the audience on such useless tidbits like the fact that nobody commited suicide on the day of the stock market crash, and many families owned a radio. The movie is painfully predictable, all around. Not a single surprise. And I knew the closing monologue word for word before it was said. Honestly. Editing is unbelievably bad, there is a lot of potential to have tension and exciting moments, but all the buildups to the many horse racing scenes are excruciatinly boring. So what about the good? Cinematography is fair, but nothing notable or original. Acting is all good, but such horribly written characters. Everyone speaks in cliched, life affirming one liners that plucked the heart strings of everyone in the theaters to my dismay. Applause after the movie's conclusion. Everybody totally bought into this sentimental monstrosity that was clearly genetically engineered to play with the emotions of audiences. Bottom line? Go see ""Seabiscuit"", you'll like it. Just dont leave the theater thinking that the movie is anything more than a shameless waste of celluloid made as an Oscar grab, very much akin to 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind""."

","An unusual film in that it features five performers in equal leading roles: The owner, the trainer, the jockey, the horse, and the times.  I would give first billing to the 1930s, as it took me three days to get my mind out of the scenario.  Among the human actors I thought Jeff Bridges gave the strongest performance.  The best actor in the movie was Gary Stevens, the professional jockey who had never acted before.  Elizabeth Banks reminds me of Brooke Adams.  This is not a good omen for Banks, since Adams's career has gone essentially nowhere in the past 30 years.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the movie was with Pollard's accident before the big race.  The scene gave me the impression that the incident could have been a deliberate act of sabotage by the rival owner, and it left me hanging.  This may not have been the fault of the writers.  The accident actually happened in real life, and it was too important to the plot to gloss over.<br/><br/>I had never planned to see ""Seabiscuit.""

","I went to see Seabiscuit not expecting it too be that good. So I was very pleasantly surprised that it was as great as it was. It is definitely worth the price of admission to see it on a big theater screen. DO NOT WAIT TO SEE IT ON A TV SCREEN! You need the big screen to appreciate the beautiful cinematograpy, the beautiful rural sceneries, and the exciting horseraces that cry out for a giant screen to see the horses really up close; it is like you are riding on the very next horse over from Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>I have read the reviews by others here and agree with most of them. The actors were all very good, Tobey McGuire was better than I expected. Jeff Bridges WAS very Tucker-like, but this was good, it was his best film role in a while, better than the recent KPAX. The philosophy of the film was 1) You don't throw someone (or something in the horse's case) away just because they are bruised or broken. Don't give up on them. 2) It is bad for someone to lie & do bad things, but you give them at least ONE more chance to redeem themselves, especially when you see the potential they have inside them. 3) Just because a country is down and out, and things are going bad, DON'T give up on yourself or your fellow citizens, if you all get together and work as a team, complimenting your strengths with your teammates strengths, and be observant of what each team members strengths are, YOU WILL SUCCEED!! (This is what the four lead actors of the film did: 1) Tobey M. had a never-give-up attitude combined with a ""I may be beaten, but I'm not destroyed attitude. 2)Jeff B. had a quiet fatherly figure, confident ""I know we will win in the end if we stick to our plan & don't give up"" attitude AND he felt like we must give others a second chance inner philosophy. 3)Chris C. had an ""I see great potential in the downtrodden"" attitude combined with ""I know what I know, I know horses, and horseracing better than anyone"". And 4) Seabiscuit's attitude was ""I've been abused, mistreated, and people act like I'm not worth anything, BUT I'll show THEM"" attitude. If they would only give him a chance, he would prove to everyone he was a winner! If only Others would see his potential & BELIEVE in him, HE WOULD SHOW THEM!! (Yes, I know, this sounds crazy, but the horse in this movie really did have this attitude!! You'll have to see the movie to believe it.)<br/><br/>When all four were combined, they were an unbeatable team in the horseracing world. A world I didn't think I would care about at all. So, I was SHOCKED when I found myself caring ALOT! I had not read the books or seen the documentaries that others had, so I did not have any preconceived notions that the film didn't live up to like some of the grumpier other reviewers on IMDB had. My opinion: The film was great! I didn't think it was PERFECT like ""Finding Nemo"" (which is perfection) or as exciting as ""Pirates of Caribbean"" or ""Terminator 3"" with their nonstop action AND humor, but I thought ""Seabiscuit"" definitely should be seen by everyone IN A THEATER WITH A GIANT SCREEN (this would be a wonderful IMAX movie I think).<br/><br/>
Emotions: It was almost as emotional a movie for me as ""Finding Nemo"". I was never scared like in Nemo, but my heart was uplifted seeing those who are down, pull themselves up with the help of others who cared about their fellows creatures who were all put on this Earth by God, reaching their potentials and becoming winners and heroes. (This movie sorta reminded me of the inspirational film ""Chariots of Fire""-which does not feature chariots with horses in it By The Way. I recommend that film to everyone also!) Also, I did have tears in my eyes I am ashamed to say, just like with the movie Nemo, when both horse and rider had their miraculous comebacks.<br/><br/>I gave this film a rating of 10 even though I should have only given it a 9, because it made me feel good. For all the reviewers who insist that this movie and the people associated with it win Oscars, I have bad news for you. I hate to tell you this, but Hollywood looks at box office before they give out nominations AND ESPECIALLY AWARD WINS! Any movie that grosses more than $100 million and is in the top 5 for the year, HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF BEING NOMINATED FOR THE GOOD AWARDS, AND NO CHANCE OF WINNING AN AWARD. The fact that the public likes it, means to Hollywood that it can't be that good. If you want to see ""Seabiscuit"" win an Oscar, then everyone would have to stop going to see the film now, before it reaches the top 5 & $100 million gross. But that would be foolish to do so, because this film deserves to be seen, IMHO. So don't be getting your hopes up that it will win lots of awards, OK?"

The actor that replaces Red Pollard as jockey on board Seabiscuit should receive greater recognition. I was told that in real life he is a jockey. If this is the case he missed his true calling. He is extremely photogenic, strikingly so and when he is taping the whip for the upcoming big race ( in the locker room ) his manner and movements left no doubt in my mind that this man was not horsing around.

","Seabiscuit tries to be Chariots of Fire on four legs.  The racing scenes are spectacular.  Randy Newman (in his The Natural mode) has composed a stirring score.  The writer/director, Gary Ross,has simplified Laura Hillenbrand's wonderful book.  Charles Howard now has only one son.  The first Mrs. Howard conveniently disappears.  Howard meets the second Mrs. Howard ""cute"".  The most disturbing thing to me was David McCullough's narration.  I hate narrated films (unless they're documentaries).  A good screenwriter/director should be able to tell his/her story without having a faceless voice read to you.  I got the feeling that Gary Ross felt that without David McCullough telling us, we wouldn't know that in 1929 the US went into the Great Depression or that this was a depression that couldn't be fixed by Prozac.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie.

Kudos to the team who put together such incredible sequences. I'm also glad to see Tobey Maguire follow up a huge hit like ""Spiderman"" with a moving drama such as this film. Other notable actors follow up on commercial hits with more commercial (and mindless) movies that may make them richer, but lose their credibility as great actors. I also like to comment on the fact that rarely have I sat in a movie theatre where the audience applauses at the end and when the actors names appear on the screen. Obviously we all loved this movie and appreciate a great film. I loved the character development and the theme of the story.

","Seabiscuit is one of those typical sentimental flicks that uses moments of heroism from either the characters or circumstances in order to gain audience approval.  If I had a dollar for every time I ran across such scenes whether in this, Forrest Gump, or Braveheart I could retire right now.<br/><br/>What I cannot figure is the narrative structure.  The creators send us a flurry of images in the style of watching ""The American Experience"" on PBS, then revert back to a 'typical movie.' If they wanted this to be a history lesson, emphasize the former, if they want drama, then the latter.  I am happy that they kept an even balance.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is the new Matthew Broderick, but he lacks the ability of expression that Broderick had already mastered.  In other words, his performance is no different than in Spider-Man or Pleasantville.  It's the writers that make his backstory that form our sympathy for him, not his acting.<br/><br/>Patriotism is a poor substitute for intelligence, but this movie knows that it isn't smart (Hollywood self-awareness? amazing!) so it doesn't try.  It reverts to the old 'class war' motif, so change ""patriotism"" to ""pride"" instead.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice film that is at least halfway decent.  My only major criticism is the amount of money they spent on it.  Did they really expect to get a profit out of this?  3.5 out of 5 stars."

I might have<br/><br/>seen the wonderful little runt, but I don't remember.  I read Laura<br/><br/>Hillenbarnd''s book in 2001 - what a surprising literary work of art<br/><br/>and love!

Howard family showing Seabiscuit with<br/><br/>his 7 little ""Biscuits""- his first babies (weanlings). I also finally won a bid for the original  COME ON SEABISCUIT<br/><br/>book by Ralph Moody, a teen agers' book but great for me, too, and<br/><br/>I'm now 77.  -----I went to the movie on the first day, July 25, in my<br/><br/>hometown, Ann Arbor, Michigan.  A lot of seniors had the same<br/><br/>idea.---- It is a fabulous movie - the love that the 3 (4 if you count<br/><br/>jockey George Wolff beautifully played by a real jockey) main<br/><br/>characters feel for the horse and its ups and downs, many of them<br/><br/>serious downs, comes through the screen right into your heart. C.S. Howard's wife Marcella(Elizabeth Banks)  is the 5th lover of<br/><br/>Seabiscuit. and a convincing loving wife and lover of Seabiscuit. <br/><br/>The little horse meant so much to our country in a sad depressed<br/><br/>time, and now in the middle of sad wars, we have a reason to fall<br/><br/>in love again with the inspiring horse.  If you don't cheer during the<br/><br/>Match Race with War Admiral, you are not  really an anmal lover. <br/><br/>Wm T.Macey is no Clem McCarthy, but he is so funny as a<br/><br/>commentator that for a few minutes we can relax with the<br/><br/>diversion, then back to the high drama. Seabiscuit died young at<br/><br/>age l4 in 1947 at the beloved ranch of his owner C.S. Howard<br/><br/>having received enough love to almost make up for the early<br/><br/>abuses the little horse suffered.  C.S. Howard is played with gusto<br/><br/>by Jeff Bridges.  Tom Smith, the original horse-whisperer is<br/><br/>academy award material  played by  Chris Cooper., Tobey McGuire<br/><br/>as jockey Pollard  is very good, better than in ""Spiderman"" and <br/><br/>Marcella  Howard (played by Elizabeth Banks) is  terrific.  I would<br/><br/>have preferred a shorter depression story at the beginning, less<br/><br/>telescoping later, and the inclusion of jockey Red Pollard's<br/><br/>romance and marriage to his nurse.

","(Possible SPOILERS!!)This is in no way a poke at Seabiscuit itself.  This is no doubt one of the best films of the year.  However, my problem is not with the movie itself.  It's the class of people that go to see this.<br/><br/>When my wife and I go to a movie I expect certain things.  Especially a historical, true-to-life movie.  When I go see Pirates of the Carribean or Grinch I expect laughter, kids, and talking throughout the movie.  This is normal.  However, when I go to see movies like Seabiscuit, Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot I expect SILENCE!!!<br/><br/>There was nothing in my mind humerous about Seabiscuit.  There may have been some cute parts or clever scenes, but not laugh out loud humor.  So if this is the case with movies why are there people that insist on laughing at non-humorous parts?  Why are there people that insist on giving thier input on the movie to the person next to them?<br/><br/>My problem with Seabiscuit was three particular ""Blue Hairs"" that sat behind me and my wife.  Three friends that wanted to go see the one movie this year that they can relate to and ruin the experience for anyone in the same theatre as them.<br/><br/>William H. Macy was spectacular as the radio jockey.  So spectacular that the moment he came on the screen these three bags started laughing so hard that they almost started choking.<br/><br/>It got so bad that they started laughing in the scene where Toby MaGuire was anorexically eating meger meals to stay light for his job as a jockey.  I was going to laugh when he had the accident with the horse and couldn't ride again just to prove a point.<br/><br/>This goes back to when I saw Saving Private Ryan in theatres.  This old woman would laugh at the oddest most horrible times in the movie.<br/><br/>I felt like this instance with the old people in Seabiscuit ruined the whole experience for me.  Do yourself a favor, wait to see this movie on DVD or video when it is released to save yourself annoyance.  This is because we all know the type of people seeing Seabiscuit, people that only go to one film a year.  The same people that laughed at the intense scene in Saving Private Ryan where the German girl is reunited with her father and begins hitting him for giving her up to the Americans.  The same people that laughed during the whole first part of Full Metal Jacket until the ""fat"" recruit went nuts and shot his DI.  These people infest our theatres and don't belong here.

"buildbiz","Null","0","0","5 August 2003"," How Powerful The Editor
","Deft touch, the orientation by David McCullough.  His historical voice soothingly assured us of the story's honesty.  In the early scenes the actors did so well to act out the narrator's quasi-documentary assertions, in a manner superior to the camera's common combing through still photos, ala American Experience.<br/><br/>
Melodramatic film techniques are employed for character development, reminiscent of the film's period, which followed by only a few years the overacting required by silent films.  Maguire and Cooper take the dramatic direction well and the script is thus fulfilled.  As Jeff Bridges takes to playing his assigned part, we wonder about his wandering about with his scowl or look of perplexion.  Suddenly, right before our eyes, Bridges transcends the docudrama's regulatory schema and we find ourselves in awe of a skilled promoter, while we enjoy the sets blossoming behind him, sets that reflect the growing value of his character's accomplishments.<br/><br/>
If only the scenes of Seabiscuit's achievements could have been as linear, expanding, and inspiring.<br/><br/>
Seabiscuit's McCullough-described emergence out of a fog and into the picture promises to endear us to him but such feelings are dissipated during the efforts to derive humor from his feigned, and often off-camera, frustration.<br/><br/>
Finally the four roles are known and the common thread is a common cliché, `you don't throw a whole life away just 'cause it's banged up a little.' We're now ready for a journey of 'boy meets girl (horse), boy loses girl,' and etc.  But we are denied.  There are fits and starts, as though behind the camera a committee agrees to keep in all shots.  We know what will happen, but when will it happen?<br/><br/>
There are races and fascinating angles and interesting jockey experiences and promotional material, interrupted or interpreted by a wonderful actor, William H. Macy, playing a local radio clown's role while apparently and unbelievably popping up at venues across the nation (making one wonder how long IS his microphone cord?), and it all should add up to our emotional investment in the men and their steed.  But it doesn't.<br/><br/>
And the reason is editing.  A great motion picture is believed to be hidden in the footage.  One hopes a future editor will be empowered to search for it."

","I thought it was kind of bland. Forgive me, but I felt like it was a McFilm. If Adobe had software for making Oscar-style movies about horses, and you simply had to plug in all the variables, a big rich horse owner with a good heart, a poor little feisty jockey with a good heart, a big poor wise horse trainer with a good heart, a feisty little horse with a good heart, a big fat other horse owner with not such a good heart with a big black horse to beat, and a lot of fall foliage, this is the movie that it would pump out. But software is only as good as the data that goes into it. I'm sorry, but I feel like robots could have made this film. It was lovely to watch but I wasn't moved. Perhaps if the humans had been allowed to have frailties and foibles slightly more complex than the horse's, I would have gotten involved in the film, but I didn't shed any tears despite all the obvious cues by the music, camera shots, and script that were asking me to have specific moments of catharsis.

","Spoilers<br/><br/>Sorry duplicate bridge enthusiasts, this is not your kind of tournament. It's rather about a team that makes horse racing into a dream. I know the movie is fact based and also adapted from a best seller, but I'm going to confine myself to only what the movie shows.<br/><br/>The first member of the team is the horse with the title role, one abandoned for a loser until its potentials are recognized by the other three members, each of whom has his own story. <br/><br/>Of the trainer (Chris Cooper) we know little about, but all we need to know is that his profession is his whole life. A loner, always cool and absolutely focused on what he is doing, he is however not without his human side. Angry with the jockey for not revealing his handicap of one blind eye, he nevertheless yields readily to the owner's appeal to his good nature.<br/><br/>The jockey (Tobey Maguire) suffers a drastic plunge in fortune as his affluent family is financially wiped out by the Great Depression. Separated from his loving and understanding parents, he goes through a few very rough years until both trainer and owner see in him the same talent his parents saw. <br/><br/>The owner (Jeff Bridges) has everything financial success can bring, but lost his most beloved son in an accident and his wife in a subsequent divorce. Remarriage to a wonderful second wife and discovery of Seabiscuit brings back his zest for life.<br/><br/>These four members of this team are drawn together by their mutual recognition of each other's potentials and when they finally converge, we have a most uplifting story. <br/><br/>There is no shooting or explosion, no fancy action and not even one swear word. Oh yes, there is something you might call a sex scene. What it really does is only to reveal that the jockey is blind in one eye, and he gives the prostitute more respect than he might have given to his grade school teacher!<br/><br/>What is most significant, however, is that there is no villain. The conflict is against what can be broadly called `destiny': unexpected misfortunes and accidents, as well as fair competition by and large. I for one think that this is wonderful and we should have more movies like this.<br/><br/>The music is effective and in right proportions. The cinematography is equally winning. I'm particularly impressed with splendor of the opening scene with Chris Cooper riding in the big country and really glad that I saw it on one of the gigantic `Silver Screens' in Toronto."

","Any moviegoer who is missing Seabiscuit because they believe it is just a film about a race horse, should open their eyes, open their minds, and open their hearts to one of the most moving films to grace the multiplex in a good long while. This is not just a film about a horse, it is a film about survival, redemption, and how when things may seem as bleak as they possibly can be, one is able to overcome the toughest of circumstances and the worst of adversity. After an endless summer of moronic sequels with an endless supply of car chases, gun fire and explosions, Seabiscuit stands out as a true gem in an endless sea of summer motion picture muck.<br/><br/>Some people may find the first forty-five minutes or so of Seabiscuit slow going. That was my response, as I,like many people, wanted to hurry up and get to the horse racing scenes. As the story developed though I realized it was these early scenes in the film that made it so much more than what it would have been otherwise.  Without them, it could very well have been just a story about a horse, and many things that happen later wouldn't have had near the emotional impact that they possess.<br/><br/>It is in the early stages that we meet Charles Howard, (Jeff Bridges who has his best role in many years), a millionaire who seems to have everything, until one day his son is killed in an accident, and his wife leaves him. Then there is Red Pollard, whom we meet as a young boy (Michael Angarano) that is sent away by his parents after they have lost everything during the depression.  Later, as a young adult(Tobey Maguire), we see him give up being a jock, become a boxer where he loses the sight in one eye and then become nothing more than a stable boy walking horses.  Next there is Tom Smith(Chris Cooper), an out of work mustang breaker, who basically wonders around the West with little to do, out of a job and down on his luck.  It is after Howard meets up with Smith, that on Smith's advice he purchases a horse called Seabiscuit that most experts thought would never win anything. Later, after watching Red Pollard walking a horse (in a very funny scene), Howard hires him also.  From then on we are totally engrossed, as these three men and a horse, overcome all odds to not only find their own souls, but likewise rally a nation that had been beaten down by the depression. They give a country hope at a time when many people did not know if they would have a meal from day to day, or whether they may ever work again. They gave them something to cheer for, and us as a film audience, to cheer along with them.<br/><br/>I cannot praise highly enough the work of director Gary Ross and the three main actors in Seabiscuit.  Ross, who also gave us the wonderfully underrated film Pleasantville, has done exemplary work here also. Maguire, Cooper, and Bridges are perfect in their three roles.  These are the most difficult kind of roles for many actors.  There is no scene chewing going on here.  They stay within their characters the whole film, which requires a more subtle approach then the kind of over the top performances that usually win Academy Awards.   The only role that requires any outlandishness is that of Tick Tock, the track announcer, wonderfully played by William H. Macy for comic relief.  Also on hand is Elizabeth Banks as the second Mrs. Howard. She isn't given much to do in this film, but shows she is every bit as capable as the men.<br/><br/>There are times during Seabiscuit when you will laugh, times when you may find your eyes moistening just a bit, and times when you will applaud and cheer as the audience did when I saw it. Best of all, when you leave the theater, you will leave with a sense of warmth and appreciation, for easily the finest film of not only this summer, but of a lot of summers."

Well-acted and beautifully scored, the cinematography is at times breathtaking and intimate. A fascinating look into the story that so few of us knew. I had heard of Seabiscuit but never knew anything much about him. Now I'm sure I was born to love him! There are messages here for everyone -- about living a good life and being true.

","Seabiscuit is a ""feel good"" movie. Great pains have been made to adapt the book to the screen. Gary Ross proves he has what it takes to make the translation, as the final product is very good, indeed!<br/><br/>This is a story of an underdog becoming a surprise winner, which is a theme that runs underneath a lot of American films. Seabiscuit is rescued from being a mediocre horse into the winner of very important races.<br/><br/>It also reflects on an era of Americana when the Great Depression hit the country. Seabiscuit is some sort of paradox of how can losers become winners because there is a great team behind it to make it come true.<br/><br/>Being this a historic picture, it has been given a great treatment by the people behind the film. Jeff Bridges, a great, if somewhat under estimated film actor, is the personification of Charles Howard, the self made millionaire who is instrumental in buying a has been horse and turning it to Tom Smith, played with conviction by Chris Cooper, to make it a champion and a winner in the racing circuit.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire, as Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's jockey, is very credible as the man whose life has dealt him a bad hand, but encounters his true calling as the person who can lead Seabiscuit to fame. <br/><br/>The production has a 30s look that is very well captured. The costumes, the clothes, even the race tracks ring true and that's the beauty of this film.

","There is no doubt that 'Seabiscuit' is a feel good movie.  This is probably the most simple film in terms of its storytelling and execution since 1990's 'Dances with Wolves'.  It benefits greatly from having its three main characters (Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper) come together in a totally accidental twist of fate.  As the owner (Jeff Bridges) of an underdog horse, a seasoned horse trainer and frontiersman (Chris Cooper) and a jockey (Tobey Maguire) make their way through the trials and tribulations of the sport of kings, their horse Seabiscuit manages to win at almost every turn once all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. <br/><br/>
Written for the screen and directed by Gary Ross, this is a simple old fashioned story that makes the film industry respectable in this time of degrading sex comedies, computer overkill on special effects and empty dreadful slasher films.  <br/><br/>Hollywood needs more films like this to bring back an audience of the finer generation who have stayed away from films in recent years and who have contributed to the overall dwindling number of ticket sales that continue to fall year after year.

Also, in the Hundred Grander, near the film's climax, Red spoke to George in the starting gate as if he was surprised to see him there.

","Seabiscuit.  Who knew that a one word title, and strange word at that, could hold such a powerful, moving drama within itself!  This is the kind of movie that others should try to be like.  It's the kind of movie that so much of hollywood has forgotten how to make.  Seabiscuit hits all the right emotions, whether you are a fan of horseracing or not. You will laugh, cry, be shocked, get excited and cheer, and it all fits like a beautiful puzzle. Mind you, I am a big horseracing fan, so maybe I am a bit biased, but this true story of four down and out individuals who come together and succeed together is one that will grip you like so few movies do today.  There is no extravagant special effects, just a good story, acted superbly by all the actors, and held together by the wonderful soundtrack that hits the emotion dead on.  This is definitely oscar worthy, and Jeff Bridges, Tobey Macguire, and Chris Cooper should all get nominated as well.  William H. Macy delivers one of those performances that surprises you and makes you talk about long after you leave the theatre, he should walk away with the supporting oscar for sure.  So I obviously recommend this to any movie goers who love a great movie, you will not be disappointed!"

","I nearly always like the book better than the movie, and this was no exception.  The story of the author and her fight with disease also is deserving of an extra on the DVD.  All that said, the movie stood well on its own.  The cinematography was great, but those jockey-mounted cameras or whatever they were sure made for some jerky race scenes.  Having been one of those pre-teen girls that were crazy about horses, I recognized that statue of Seabiscuit in the paddock scenes, and kept wondering why they didn't CGI it out.  I found that distracting.  When I heard Tobey M. was cast as Red Pollard, my reaction was ""What the. . . ."", so I was pleasantly surprised that he did such a good job.  Casting the younger version of Red with the boy from ""Will and Grace"" seemed unnecessary.  He did just fine, but really didn't look much like the older version of the character.  Seems some makeup and lighting tricks on Tobey M. would have been more seamless.  Jeff Bridges did seem a bit ""Tucker-like"" in this, but portrayed his character well. There was quite a bit missing that was in the book, but I guess time limits make that inevitable.  Hope the DVD includes some of the obviously deleted scenes."

","This movie was Good, BUT it could of been GREAT ! My biggest problem with this film :<br/><br/>1. Wasted too much time explaining the backgrounds of the men and the depression, and nothing about Seabiscuit for the first hour of the movie. 2. Bored the audience using numerous scenes and film time to explain what a great salesman Howard was. 3. Too many unecessary scenes that should of ended up on the cutting room floor. 4. I don't think we needed to go that FAR BACK or that IN DEPTH into each character's life and heartbreak, expect for Red Pollard's.<br/><br/>NOW for what COULD OF MADE this movie GREAT !<br/><br/>1. MORE focus on the rise and fall of RED POLLARD. 2. MORE focus on SEABISCUIT....after all, the movie is named after him, isn't it ? It wasn't called ""The Lives of Four Men who struggled their ways out of hardship"" which must of been the working title for this film judging from the direction they took. 3. LESS focus on the lives of the men....I mean, did we really have to see what they did day to day ? I think we got the picture in the first five minutes. 4. LESS still shots of the depression....again, we get the picture. 5. A HELL OF A LOT MORE HORSERACING.... 6. MORE INTENSITY IN THE HORSERACING....when the director did get a chance to make up for the boring scenes with the racing action, he completely blew it. Just when the action was starting to make you tingle, he cut too a dining table scene or something boring like that....wtf ??? Give Seabiscuit his due !!! Was the director a War Admiral fan or something ??<br/><br/>Finally, to Seabiscuit, what an incredible horse....to Red Pollard, what incredible determination. This film did not give these two the credit they rightfully deserve. I far more enjoyed the A&E special they did on Seabiscuit, and that was FREE.<br/><br/>The movie was called ""Seabiscuit"" for a reason. It should of been focused around....guess who ? SEABISCUIT....and it's jockey Red Pollard, that's what this film should of been about. Way 2 much focus on characters that should of stayed in the background."

But to my surprise I liked him in Seabiscuit, he did an excellent job, and proved to me that he was casted as that part not to sell tickets, but because he fits it well.<br/><br/>Speaking of casting, Chris Cooper plays his character perfectly, and was casted accordingly, one of performances I've seen in awhile I'd say. While Jeff Brides fills the role superbly, it's hard for me to imagine him as anyone but The Dude, because I am addicted to The Big Lebowski, but that's just me. He also does an excellent job, Dude or no Dude.<br/><br/>Now there was one other thing this movie had going against it, the title character is a horse, not exactly the most charismatic animal, but this film gave Seabiscuit tons of character, and made me feel emotions for him.<br/><br/>The actual filming and special effects of Seabiscuit were excellent. The extensive use of high speed film made the details of the races come out, and never could you tell when dumby horses were used. The whole movie was filmed photorealistic, or however you say each frame was like an individual photo...<br/><br/>If you're thinking you might not like this movie because it's about a horse, you must realize that the movie is not about a horse, it's about America, and giving people hope. Sounds stupid, but really its awesome.<br/><br/>I give Seabiscuit 9 out of 10. Excellent movie."

","Every summer, there is one movie that captivates audiences and critics alike. Last year, it was `Road To Perdition.' This year, it's the adaptation of the beloved book `Seabiscuit.' `Seabiscuit' is more than just a film. It proves that big-budget cinema can still release motion pictures with absolute integrity. Like the marvelous independent film `Whale Rider,' `Seabiscuit' is about broken people. These people somehow find a way to pick themselves up and start over with something new to give them meaning in life. Although this idea of a feel good movie is not new, most people can't get enough of them-they are inspiring. In `Seabiscuit,' we are not only moved by the delicacy of beautiful filmmaking, but also by wonder of its story.	 The film centers around three lost men. The first is that of Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), who has spent most of life in the hands of jockeys that treated him as inferior. This turns him hardy and pushes people away from anything that could be meaningful. The second man is Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), the developer of Buick automobiles who looses his only son during a car accident. Afterwards, his wife, distraught with grief, leaves Howard to escape the memories of her son and the lifestyle that Howard's fortune has created. The third character is that of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a cowboy, with an affinity for horses, whose world is quickly changing. The three men meet together at various points and form a friendship when Howard purchases a racehorse in desperate need of training named Seabiscuit. Ironically enough, Pollard who has been abused and rundown equally as much as Seabiscuit is chosen to be the jockey. Smith said it best-`you don't throw a whole life away simply because it's banged up a little.' But it will take more than hard work to break the horse. Through their trials and pain, the men find the strength to pick themselves up and find something to believe in when their original dreams were shattered. 	Beyond the aspects of great filmmaking, the film reaches its audience in extraordinary ways. You find yourself routing for Seabiscuit during onscreen races as if you were actually at the track watching a real race. In fact, you feel the urge to applaud when Pollard and Seabiscuit win.<br/><br/>It goes farther than betting on the horse-the real Seabiscuit and Pollard were an inspiration to the working class during the depression era that they came from. They reminded people that hope survives in the depths of any kind of depression, be it personal or economic. 	Director Gary Ross (`Pleasantville') has done a superb job in translating the book into a screen story. There are several parts of the film where the cinematography is absolutely lush from the fall foliage at Saratoga to the Palm Trees of the South. Some of the shots in the film were so well done that they were a reminder of `Ben-Hur' and the astounding chariot race that director William Wyler brought to life in 1959. Slow motion shots of the horses racing show utter grace and beauty for the majesty of these animals.<br/><br/>	Performances in the film range from good to excellent. After all, `Seabiscuit' stars Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper-need I say more! 	Even people who don't really enjoy this film will be hard pressed to find anything truly negative to say about it. Point in fact; `Seabiscuit' is a modern classic that certainly will not be forgotten. ***1/2"

It takes something like an hour and ten minutes before Seabiscuit is even introduced.  Some of the characters' back stories really could have been trimmed heavily.

","First of all, let me say that I read and absolutely loved Laura Hillenbrand's book of the same name. In addition, I had seen the A&E documentary only the night before I went to see the movie, as well as the PBS documentary. The point is, I was quite familiar with the events portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>Further, I had heard and agree with one review of the movie on PBS, in which the reviewer said the movie was lacking one central character--the horse. That is, Hillenbrand did a marvelous job of recreating the personality of a really interesting horse, Seabiscuit, and this was not done in the movie, which focused on some of story behind the three central humans--the jockey, trainer, and owner.<br/><br/>All that said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. For what it was and tried to do, it worked for me. Do I think it was as good as the book? Of course not.<br/><br/>
Do I think it was even as valid a recreation of the story of Seabiscuit as the A&E documentary? Nope.<br/><br/>I do think it was a lot of fun to watch, however, and would urge anyone going to see it to take it for what it is, nothing more or less. Don't expect it to be faithful to the real story of the 'Biscuit, which actually turns out to be a heckofa lot more dramatic than what was on the screen.<br/><br/>

I still can't believe the craftsmanship of Laura Hillenbrand in telling this story. So going in to the movie, I was wary. But the previews choked me up and I thought the selections of the actors were dead-on (although Jeff Bridges resonated a little too close to his ""Tucker"" character.)<br/><br/>I don't want to come off sounding like one of those literary purists that say that Hollywood can't pull off adaptations, but Gary Ross let his ego get in the way of telling this story. He wanted to speak, instead of letting the material do the talking. It wasn't what he ""left out"" that I have a problem with, it was what he ""added.""<br/><br/>It was ""the perfect story,"" already unbelievable, even by Hollywood standards and yet, Mr. Ross felt the need to dumb it down for us.

","This is a slowly-paced, but grand tale of the 'washed-up' horse that became a source of inspiration to America during the Depression. It is, more importantly, the story of three men, who, through their involvement with the horse, find meaning in tragedy-filled lives. <br/><br/>The jockey, Red Pollard, sensitively played by Tobey Maguire, was 'sold' to a horse owner as a teen, as his family lost everything and was reduced to a migratory life. Hot-tempered, Pollard turns to prizefighting (getting beaten so badly that he loses sight in his right eye), and riding, to make ends meet. <br/><br/>The trainer, Tom Smith (played by the always wonderful Oscar-winner Chris Cooper), loses his job in a Wild West show with the Depression, and is considered a crazy old man; he is a horse whisperer, one of the unique breed of people who CAN actually talk to horses, and heal them. <br/><br/>The owner, Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges, who should FINALLY get his Oscar with this role), starts off as a Preston Tucker-like entrepreneur with an expanding car dealership, a loving wife, and an adoring son...then his son dies, and his wife has a breakdown and divorces him, leaving him dazed and crushed, emotionally. Finding happiness with a beautiful, understanding new wife (Elizabeth Banks), who suggests buying a horse, Howard first hires Smith (finding in him a kindred spirit), and Smith chooses the undersized, physically abused, temperamental Seabiscuit as the horse to buy (for nearly nothing; nobody gave the broken-down horse a chance). In a beautiful scene, Smith sees Seabiscuit fighting it's handlers, as Pollard fights a mob of angry stableboys, and realizes the two were 'meant' to be together. Howard 'adopts' young Pollard as his jockey, and the legend begins... <br/><br/>The film has two climaxes, which dilutes their impact, somewhat, but is absolutely necessary, as each actually happened. First is the running battle to get a match race between the 'little horse that could' and the 'Horse of the Ages', the gigantic stallion and Triple Crown winner, War Admiral. The Admiral's owner, Samuel Riddle, played by veteran actor Eddie Jones, does not want his never-beaten champion to race the tiny horse he considers a sideshow freak, and to have the press turn the contest into a 'David and Goliath'-style headline. Public pressure finally gets him to concede, but he demands that the race be held at the Admiral's home track of Pimlico, three thousand miles away from Seabiscuit. Howard agrees, but then tragedy strikes; Red Pollard, in a freak track accident, has his leg crushed, and is told he will never race again. Another jockey rides Seabiscuit, in what would go down as the greatest match race in history (need I say who won?) <br/><br/>In the next regular race, Seabiscuit's ligaments in one leg exploded, and he collapsed on the track. Despite pressure from the track vet, Smith refused to have the horse put down, and the horse joins Pollard in being 'put out to pasture'. But neither horse nor rider are ready to quit yet, and a miracle is about to happen, which is the basis for the second climax! <br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent (watch for William H. Macy's very funny turn as a radio race announcer), and the final race for Seabiscuit actually had me in tears, and the theater audience applauding, things that seldom happen during movies these days! That the story is true makes it even more meaningful, and should serve as a lesson to anyone who thinks that disabilities means giving up hope. As both horse and jockey prove, the heart of champions can never be vanquished. <br/><br/>SEABISCUIT is a champion!"

Seabiscuit won the race against the War Admiral and 2.  At the end of the movie.  The end speech of the movie that Tobey says isn't even that corny.  There was good acting all around, especially from McGuire and Bridges.  This story is definately a great underdog story as well as a great coming-over-obstacles story.  I was really surpised at how much I liked it.  Even though it was slow in the beginning. it picks up a lot.  I was surprised how much it got more interesting.  I was also surprised at Tobey's acting.  He's pretty good for a guy who was in Spiderman.  So...Run!!!

"keithanddeenie","Null","0","0","3 August 2003"," Doesn't quite reach the finish line
","The makers of `Seabiscuit' were advantaged with a great story and a great cast, yet failed to find the magic that ought to have arisen from this film. <br/><br/>A movie about a horse, or any animal, suffers the handicap of its main character being unable to deliver dialogue (unless it's Mister Ed), but the writers have woven this story into the fabric of the Great Depression, and of the human lives that were adversely affected.  Despite a great start, however, the characterization dries up after about an hour, and the film devolves into exactly what the producers and director should have been trying desperately to avoid, namely, showing us a bunch of people watching a horse race.<br/><br/>`Seabiscuit' is about twenty to thirty minutes too long.  Part of the problem is that there are two climaxes, and far too much time is spent dramatizing the first, which is actually the least important because it strays from the film's main theme, uttered both by Jeff Bridges' and Chris Cooper's characters: (paraphrasing) `You don't throw away a life just because it's a little bit broken.'  At least five to ten minutes can easily be cut there.  <br/><br/>The racing sequences could also be pared down by eliminating some of those close-ups of the main characters.  These also weaken those scenes by taking the audience's attention away from the horse. <br/><br/>I'd also like to see a little bit less of some of the characters, especially William H. Macy's `Tick Tock McGlaughlin' (Who provides needed comic relief, to a point) and Elizabeth Banks' `Marcela Howard,' not that I found fault with Ms. Banks' performance.  A romantic triangle involving her character and those of Mr. Bridges' and Tobey Maguire's is intimated, but never developed.  This is another distraction that director Gary Ross should have eliminated.<br/><br/>And why did they bother casting an actor to play young `Red Pollard'?  Tobey Maguire looks young enough to pass for fifteen, given proper lighting, so the presence of the other actor, who looks nothing like Mr. Maguire, added an element of confusion.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper gives a fine performance as `Tom Smith,' Seabiscuit's trainer. When the subject is horses, he gives one the confidence that he knows exactly what he's talking about.  I enjoyed his low-key handling of the role, and he elevated his energy in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast performed with wonderful restraint.  Given this sort of movie, where the horse is the focal point, I think it's pretty hard to qualify for an acting Oscar because the roles simply aren't juicy enough. It must be a sore temptation to burst out and show audiences what you can do, but this group of actors held the line very well. <br/><br/>Real-life jockey Gary Stevens, as `George Woolf', gave a likeable performance, but I'd also have preferred seeing a little bit less of him; nothing to do with his acting, more with the pacing of the film.<br/><br/>The story of Seabiscuit is an amazing sports legend (some of the audience actually cheered when the hero won a race), but `Seabiscuit' doesn't get to the finish line ahead of the competition.  The film editing crew certainly won't have to worry about who to thank at the Oscar presentations next year, but at least the director left us with a classic closing shot, of Seabiscuit seeing the finish line with no other horses in front of him, as the screen fades to black."

"JAKastner","8","0","0","2 August 2003"," The Moose Hole - Review of Seabiscuit
","The end of July always seems to be a bit of a drag at the box office and no more so then this year. The summer of 2003 has been a very disappointing season with most sequels failing to live up to their predecessors and potential blockbusters falling hard just as they get out of the gate. The only highlights would be Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, both of which belong to the Walt Disney Company. Disney is leading the way as they seem to be the first studio this year to reach the $1 billion mark and could potentially win the year despite competition from The Matrix Revolutions. Though Universal is pretty far in the back of the pack (#4 at time of publication), they hope to make it up by grabbing some Oscar gold instead. The late July release date for the film may be weird choice if you want your film to be `Oscar bait' but the studio is hoping that the film will generate the same amount of buzz at last summer's Road to Perdition so when it comes to nomination time, the film will remain somewhat fresh in the mind of voters. And with the deadline for consideration pushed up this year, Seabiscuit has a lot better chance at getting a couple of nominations then 2002's Perdition. Will this `little horse film that could' impress the regular movie-going public or will too many be blinded by the shimmer of Oscar potential to notice a well based historical film?<br/><br/>The story of Seabiscuit is based on the true story of the `little horse that could' which was depicted in Seabiscuit: An American Legend, written by Laura Hillenbrand. The film follows the events surrounding the lives of Red Pollard, Charles Howard, and Tom Smith in the 1930's. Around this time the country is desperately trying to pull itself together after The Great Depression of 1929 but nothing seems to going right for any of the main characters. Charles Howard, who made a fortune by introducing the Buick automobile to the American West, has lost his son in an automobile accident and, in event, loses his relationship with his wife. Tom Smith loses his purpose performing in the Wild West show thanks to the introduction of the automobile in the West and so goes into seclusion. And Red Pollard, who was given up by his parents during the Depression, stumbles from horse racing to boxing just trying to make a living. These three very different individuals come together after Howard purchases a gangly horse named Seabiscuit in 1938 and decides to race the horse despite overwhelming odds. With `a horse that's too small, a jockey who's too big, and a trainer who's too old', Seabiscuit gathers the attention of the public and raises the hopes of a struggling nation. The story of Seabiscuit is very well put together as there is a great blend of humor and drama, which is so rare in `Oscar bait' films. The film also does a good job of providing historical backgrounds for certain scenes by jumping outside the central story and showcasing old film reels and black & white photos. The way this is presented allows the film to set up background information that doesn't distract from the central story.<br/><br/>The cast of Seabiscuit is the real reason why the film may have Oscar potential. Tobey Maguire, who starred in Oscar nominated Cider House Rules, became famous for his role as Peter Parker in the smash hit, Spider-Man but he is truly brilliant as Red Pollard. Maguire showcases a lot more emotion in Seabiscuit then in the role that made him famous in the mainstream and shows that he can still perform at the level of Oscar potential dramas. Chris Copper, who won an Oscar for his role in Adaptation, is wonderful as Tom Smith though his character isn't shown as much as the other three lead male roles. Elizabeth Banks, who also starred in Spider-Man with Maguire as a secretary at the Daily Bugle, receives her first lead role and does a pretty good job with it. The problem lies mostly in the fact that there is so little information given on her character, like where she came from and such, that you don't feel for her character as much as the three main leads. One of the biggest highlights of the cast is William H. Macy, who is right on target with his performance as a 1930's radio announcer. Macy rambles on with crazy one liners while being accompanied by sound effects which makes the historical background all the more engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, Seabiscuit is a good drama that out shines the rest of the trash that clutters the local Cineplex. There are very few problems but those problems, as few as they are, hurt the film the most. The time length, which stands at nearly two and a half hours, seems to be about twenty minutes too long. The last twenty minutes of the film seem to drag on a bit longer then it should have and hurt the overall flow. Another problem was some of the transition scenes especially the area where they show Howard's son dead and then quickly move to where Howard's wife leaves him. The problem is that the musical score is played above everything else eliminating the dialogue, which doesn't seem to work at all and just causes confusion amongst the audience. Despite those problems, the film does play out better then most sports related. What makes the film all the more interesting is the historical background sequences. The scenes feel like they are straight out of a Ken Burns PBS mini-series. Another highlight is the literary quotes and references made by Red Pollard, which brings intelligence and charisma to this sports drama. Though not an absolute classic, Seabiscuit could grab some Oscar nominations that may be well deserved for an interesting story and a good old time at the box office.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)"

She's a sensitive, smart, cool kid but I've never heard her express the slightest interest in horses.<br/><br/>Ava, Mary and I watched the movie intently, almost reverently as the irresistible story of determination, courage, optimism and open mindedness flickered on the screen. The picture was in crytal clear focus, each frame lovingly composed every actor perfoming with earnest, artistic intensity. I enjoyed every minute of the film but in the end left the theatre feeling somehow disappointed. Seabiscuit suffers the fate of all films taken from great books, particularly books based on great sporting phenomena.....it's nowhere near as exciting as the real thing and every attempt to ratchet up the heart and excitement of the film begins to border on pathos and schmaltz which Seabuiscuit avoids by a nose.<br/><br/>True I had tears in my eyes a couple of times and yes I applauded at the end of the film like about twenty other audience members in an audience of about seventy five on a Friday matinee.<br/><br/>Afterward, I asked Mary if she had any interest in going to the race track to see some real thoroughbreds run...she said ""I guess so Dad"" and went back to her game boy as I drove home feeling the kind of vague disappointment that a nine film engenders when I want and expect a ten."

","This movie was an 9.5 and should garner some Oscars. I would definitely put Chris Cooper in the running as well as Cinematography and Music. I also liked the acting from Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire and William H. Macy. It has been a while since I have heard clapping in a movie and in the middle of it mind you.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is good for America and the family. This at a time where we need to be seeing something that has a good meaning to it and not all the shoot'em up violence.<br/><br/>I do not feel it was portrayed to be politically correct like others who have not already seen the movie. I really don't know why someone would put their 2 cents in when they haven't seen it.

","My rating: **1/2 out of *****. I almost walked out of this movie several times during the first hour, as I was bored. I did not read the book before seeing the movie so I would not have any expectations. Maybe I should have, as the movie leaves so many unanswered questions. This film is a major disappointment for me. I had looked forward to seeing this movie after hearing all the hype and the great story. The story of Seabiscuit and the men around him has all the ingredients of a great movie. Unfortunately Gary Ross, the director and script writer, screws everything up, except the casting, which is great. The music is inappropriate and irritating. The editing is lousy. The cinematography swamps the story and is uninspired. The script is mawkish and portentous. I felt like I was watching a comic book. All the scenes are short and framed and beautiful, like pages in a comic book. Is this a documentary of the depression a la Ken Burns TV projects? An epic film a la Dances With Wolves? A human story of three wounded men who find redemption? Or a story of a mistreated and badly trained horse who finally wins? Gary Ross attempts to combine all these stories into one movie. He consistently chokes off emotional climaxes leaving me teased and frustrated. And the ending is uninspired and maddening. Mildly recommended, after all it is a great story and the lead characters are great. I watched Michelangelo Antonioni's Red Desert that evening. What a difference - a director who knows how to use the camera, set scenes, camera angles, who creates deep complex characters, and knows how to use color in a film...and this film is from 1964!"

","The film introduces us to three men and one horse who greatly impact each other and the American spirit.  But the introduction is sloppy and uneven, choosing some highly undramatic moments to make no point at all.<br/><br/>Only Randy Newman's score could overcome the lazy use of Voice Overs and still photos, and bring out the emotional sweep this story deserves.  And still, the film comes to a strangely flat end.  The Voice Over insists on telling us what we already knew - that the whole of these four fragile entities was far greater than the sum of their parts.  The closing shot gives us no sense of Mr. Howard's beloved Future, nor a forlorn sense of past.  Just dirt and credits -- once again rescued (but only barely) by Mr. Newman's understanding of pathos.<br/><br/>Note to the art department:  The books and furnishings were not old at the time.

","Seabiscuit is a film that will find a lot of appraisal from critics and audiences, and for good reason:  It was bred for that exact purpose.  It's the kind of film that is a by-the-books ""How to Win An Oscar"" film.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, but it leaves the door open for a lot of problems to come.  And quite a few slip through in Seabiscuit.  The screenplay dances between being melodramatic and corny to thoughtful and well-written.  It's the kind of story that says ""Okay, be inspired....Now"". It tries to force the hope and inspiration aspect on the audience instead of letting it flow naturally.  This results in a few too many hokey scenes. And I know this is based on real events, but all the characters and their trials and tribulations are presented in a very drab and generic manner. There wasn't a real great character in the story.  <br/><br/>Gary Ross is a good director.  There is some very good cinematography in the movie.  Okay, at times Ross pulls out the old slow motion during the races, but it's forgivable.  Ross is obviously a better director than he is a writer.   <br/><br/>The film's strongest factor, and the only reason it was as good as it was, was the excellent cast.  True, they don't have too much to go with, but each does an exceptional job.  I'm not the world's biggest Tobey Maguire fan, but I was really impressed with his performance.  Cooper seems to be walking through his role, but an actor of the caliber Chris Cooper is can do that and make it look great.  Jeff Bridges is provided with the most challenges emotionally, but he graces through them all with the performance of a true craftsman.   The real story, and single best element of the movie, is William H. Macy's vaudeville sports caster.  H. Macy fits the role to a T, and brings to a life a truly fun character.  A scene stealer, indeed.<br/><br/>The movie features very good cinematography, and a phenomenal cast.

"argv","Null","0","0","30 July 2003"," Yes, this beautiful docu-epic drama is good... but not THAT good.
","Seabiscuit, the true story of a knobby-kneed racehorse and three men down on their luck, is the latest Docu-Epic from Hollywood, beautifully filmed in California, with its signature late-afternoon golden light, close-up intimate shots of emotional facial expressions, and the freedom-like feeling anyone gets when watching a horse run freely in a pasture. It's the telling of an American dream: a depression-era drama about down-trodden misfits and an unlikely animal hero who overcome the odds. Yes, this two-hour and twenty minute cinematic masterpiece is sure to grab the public by their little heartstrings, and send them tearfully home with hankies and sniffles, proud to be a member of that great expanse of land between the oceans known as. America.<br/><br/>Ahem. Ok, the more sober description goes this way: Laura Hillenbrand's wonderfully-crafted book about the race-horse, Seabiscuit, is going to be this year's mid-summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible movie by the home stretch of the imagination, but like my early characterization, `Seabiscuit' is a huge glorification of a documentary intended only to show the best side of an otherwise ratty bunch of well-meaning characters. Jeff Bridges leads the pack as Charles Howard, the flamboyant bicycle repairman-turned-millionaire, who purchases Seabiscuit at the behest of his recently hired trainer, Tom Smith, played by Chris Cooper. Smith, a sort of horse whisperer who was known for his quiet nature and his ability to get along with horses better than people, meets Red Pollard, the infamous jockey, played by Tobey McGuire, who reportedly lost 25 pounds to fill the part. Seabiscuit and the three men, all down and out underdogs with their independent and wretched pasts, all helped revive each other through Seabiscuit, and give the American people a reason to hope during the Great Depression.<br/><br/>The movie is another retelling of a timeless theme that always wins with audiences: good-guy losers beating the odds. When you mix a sure-fire premise with gorgeous cinematography, you can't lose. And this movie won't lose either. But that doesn't mean the movie is as good as the reviews  or the box office  will claim it is. The main problem with the film is that it tries to serve two masters. That is, it's both a documentary and a dramatic Hollywood big-screen Epic. The movie's `documentary' aspect leaves a lot of things out, and ends on a great, wonderful, victorious event, despite the real story ending quite differently. Consequently, the film's `drama' suffers, because it leaves out the deeper and more disturbing character flaws and relationships that truly fleshed out the characters. The film does manage to stir emotions about a profoundly difficult era with historian-narrated commentary and photos, but the context doesn't translate well to how the characters think or behave. In short, the movie's parts are all great, but they don't tie together well-enough to deserve the praise the movie is receiving.<br/><br/>All in all, Seabiscuit is a really good-looking film, with great lighting, epic-like proportions, terrific acting,, but there is nothing really interesting about the film except for the story itself, which is better told by Hillenbrand's book."
"Rob/SMCA","7","0","0","30 July 2003"," Very good (but not great)
","Compared to the usual summer dreck in movies, Seabiscuit is most welcome. But, if you like storytelling to impart something fresh, new or unexpected, this movie is only so-so.  I found it way too telescoped and foreshadowed, albeit well set up and performed.  It's basically calibrated to tell you what you want to hear, with almost no complexity or nuance.  People will like it as much as they want to root for the underdog -- and believe the underdog sometimes wins (weighted to your being over or under 40 years old...)"
"Rybo98","10","0","0","28 July 2003"," Stirring, deftly crafted film
","I was so impressed with ""Seabiscuit"" that I saw it twice in three days. And I never do that. This is one fantastic flick. Most of what makes this a winning movie is the story: it's a sincere, warm-hearted tale that seems so perfectly wrought it's difficult to believe it's true. Each character is somehow an underdog that battles the odds and miraculously always comes out on top. Director Gary Ross has done an excellent job guiding the film away from its story's natural inclination towards soapy sentimentality. There's one misstep: the intercutting of several black-and-white depression era photos accompanied by David McCullough's snoozy narration in an attempt to utilize Seabiscuit as a metaphor for the nation's economic ills. I believe that this unexpected champion of a horse who beat the odds gave inspiration to people who hadn't any--but I wanted the film to speak for itself, to tell me this without making a documentary. Doing so takes away from a certain cinematic theatricality that is a real strength in the rest of the film. Why Mr. Ross chose to do so is a bit inexplicable. Still, it is not in large supply, teetering off in the film's final third, and in no way causes harm to the picture. The performances are truly something to marvel at. The three actors at the center of the story, Jeff Bridges (the owner), Tobey Maguire (the jockey) and Chris Cooper (the trainer) breathe such luminous life into their characters that we understand them perfectly and find ourselves caring about their successes and failures as much as they do. Elizabeth Banks is pitch-perfect as Bridge's wife, taking what might have been a sketch-pad role, flashes her eyes at us revealing a complexity behind them, and we find it impossible to ignore her when she's on screen. Always-reliable William H. Macy has great fun with motor-mouthed broadcaster Tick-Tock McGlaughlin in a deliciously vociferous performance. It's also beautifully shot and the racing scenes are some of the most stirring cinematic sequences I've ever seen. Applause broke out numerous times during both screenings, and seemed entirely appropriate. I've found the term crowd-pleaser attached to this film a few times, and not in a complimentary way. My question is--why not? When did Hollywood become so smug that it forgot to inspire its audiences? The most assuring thing about unabashedly cheering in the theater is that you don't feel taken advantage of because it's a true story. I enjoy all sorts of films and can see the merit across genres, and found Seabiscuit to succeed cinematically in every way in its own right. But so what if it also leaves its audiences with dopey grins and life-affirming attitudes. That's the magic of the movies."

Through stunning but unshowy photography, a moving but miraculously unsappy script, and three performances which can only be described as superb, the audience is taken from the frenetic frenzy of modern life (and the fractured fraudulence of the standard summer blockbuster wannabe).

","I love the ""against-all-odds"" American period pieces when they are based on true stories. In the same vein as ""October Sky"" and others, ""Seabiscuit"" (after reading the book and watching documentaries on PBS) delivered the old ""lump in the throat"" just fine. Although our opening day audience averaged over age 50 and barley filled half the theater, it's not often a movie receives a very big round of applause at the end, which ""Seabiscuit"" did.<br/><br/>Although we were rather distanced from the raw emotions of the characters throughout the storyline (Jeff Bridges mostly ""mugs"" his way through the closeups, Tobey Maguire lacked the intense tenacity of Red Pollard, Chris Cooper looked quite bored most of the time and Liz Banks seemed more like a prop), whatever lacked in characterization was more than made-up for in our knowledge of the subject, the time period itself and the sheer anticipation and excitement of watching Seabiscuit race. Those sequences were ""up-front and personal"" and just a delight to watch. William Macey's ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin was the perfect comedic break and the narration moved the story along nicely.<br/><br/>Although a bit glossed-over, all in all, I think ""Seabiscuit"" was a great ride for my money and the perfect summer break from the ""smash-em crash-em"" technological bloodfest that Hollywood has become. I gave it a ""9.""<br/><br/>My name is Barry and that's ""My Take On It""."

","My sister and I saw Seabiscuit on its opening weekend in a packed theater occupied primarily by folks in the 55+ age range. We were flanked by older couples in their 70s, which was a refreshing change from the teenager-dominated crowds at so many movies these days. We found it surprising, though, that the audience was very vocal during the movie, responding to onscreen incidents with sighs, hearty laughs, and running commentary (""Oh, that poor boy!"").<br/><br/>Such commentary usually would constitute a huge annoyance, but it only added to the warmth and charm of Seabiscuit, a well-executed if necessarily abbreviated ode to the underdog.<br/><br/>I have never been horseracing fan, but I loved Laura Hillenbrand's entertaining book, which provided the source material for the film. The book gave almost equal place to four characters: owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith, jockey Red Pollard, and Seabiscuit himself. The film concentrates more on Howard (Jeff Bridges) and Pollard (Tobey Maguire), leaving the mysterious Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) less fleshed out. The necessity of trimming several events also shortchanges the heroism of the horse himself. The book featured more focus on the obstacles Seabiscuit had to overcome -- from chronic bad luck to unfair weight assignments from track officials -- which accentuated his underdog appeal and put his victories in context.<br/><br/>That said, I loved the movie. True, the beginning is mostly exposition, but I loved the David McCullough-narrated history lessons. From beginning to end, there are many heart-rending moments, and Jeff Bridges is wonderful, making the rags-to-riches salesman Howard as endearing, warmhearted, impulsive, charismatic, yet flawed as the real Howard must have been to try -- and pull off -- so many grand schemes. Tobey Maguire is good but far too tall. (Why couldn't he have been resized by the magic of f/x, as with the Hobbits in LOTR?) Chris Cooper is, as usual, very good (his stoicism in contrast to Bridges' hyperactivity exemplifies acting with restraint), but the script too often makes him use his even drawl to deliver straight-faced punchlines.<br/><br/>Ah, but that's quibbling. It's a fun movie; enjoy it, and if you want to get a deeper, broader and just-as-moving version of the story, read Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit."

"psefcsik","Null","0","0","28 July 2003"," Whatever you do, don't see 'biscuit!
","I recently saw this movie and was very disappointed. First and foremost, the acting was terrible. Hopefully Tobey Maguire still has his Spidey mask, because he will need to hide behind it after this film. His performance was more pathetic than Red's character. Jeff Bridges was unconvincing in his role as a rich car salesman as well. The horse trainer wasn't too bad, but that is probably because they stole his whole schtick from ""The Horse Whisperer"".<br/><br/>The storyline was approached from the wrong perspective, as there was insufficient horse footage in most of the movie. No one cares about the depression or the dawn of the car industry, especially people who ride horses. There wasn't even a glimpse of Seabisuit for the first hour. When they stopped spoon feeding the audience symbolism, and finally showed some decent horse footage, there was glaring errors in it. Wild horses usually don't have shoes, and why were they using year 2000 tack in 1930. The scene with Red and Jorge having a casual conversation while engaged in a heated race was so fake it was putrid. These careless mistakes served to alienate the only audience this film would have had, the true equestrians.<br/><br/>It's a shame they butchered this film as the Seabiscuit history is quite fascinating. When Seabiscuit hurt his leg in a scene that should have been heart wrenching, all I could think was that the only thing lame was this movie. Leave it to Hollywood to sell out and ruin a decent story."

","We read the book, we know horses, it's a wonderful story.  And our opinion is that the movie does fair justice to the story.  Naturally the film cannot be as rich in amazing detail as Hillenbrand's work, but the right elements are included ... most notably, the relationships among the amazing comeback of this horse, the humans he owned, and a beat-up American people.  The emotion generated by the race scenes is breath-taking.  Sure, it is possible to see that race footage has been sliced, diced and repackaged, and that mechanical horses are used for close-up shots.  Still, the race action and the film overall have considerable impact, not a small feat when dealing with a true story of such proportion."

","Hands down, this film is a winner by several furlongs, just like its four unlikely heroes, C.S. Howard, Red Pollard, Tom Smith, and of course, the horse, Seabiscuit.  Scrappy is the first word that comes to mind when describing both horse and jockey.  Set in the depression of the 1930's, we see a synopsis of each person's background to be able to really connect with the whys and wherefores of the film.  I love the excitement of a horse race and I definitely got my fill watching recreations of each of Seabiscuit's history changing runs.  Jeff Bridges is not rehashing `Tucker, A Man And His Dream'; Tobey Maguire is not doing an imitation of Mickey Rooney or Elizabeth Taylor in `National Velvet', and Chris Cooper is not doing an imitation of anyone, but the real trainer.  William H. Macy gives a great turn as the voice of a radio sports announcer whose opinion reflects the feeling of the country as Seabiscuit rises to fame.

"MoonBird","8","0","0","27 July 2003"," Goes the distance and then some...
","Like most screenplays adapted from a literary source, this one loses a little bit in the translation. It's very good on its own merits -- the acting, direction and cinematography are strong (Oscar buzz, Oscar buzz). It stumbles slightly out of the gate, so to speak, but catches up in time to deliver the big ""winning"" climax. Starts off with a quasi-documentary-style with narration by the always-soothing voice of David McCullough. The first hour concentrates on developing the three human factors in the story (Charles Howard, Tom Smith and ""Red"" Pollard"") and the converging paths of their lives that bring them all to the little racehorse that could -- Seabiscuit.  Those of us who have read the book know that getting that match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral was not as simple as it is portrayed in the movie, but I can accept the condensation because the resulting race we get on film is well done. There are other things that weren't even touched upon in the film: In real life, for example, Seabiscuit almost always had to race with a tremendous weight handicap for such a small horse, especially considering he was already running with a fairly large jockey on his back.  There's also some poetic license in the completely-fictional ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin character, but again, I realize this was a necessary device to help the narrative move along smoothly.  There is genuine emotion in many of the scenes and the racing sequences almost put you in the saddle. Tobey Maguire finally gets to play a grown-up. Chris Cooper does his usual best in character. Real-life jockey Gary Stevens is spot-on as George `Ice Man' Woolf.  I recommend reading the book BEFORE seeing the film, but even if you don't, the film still works.  If you've read the book, see this movie to give the story more life; if you haven't read the book - see this movie because it truly is a nice piece of filmmaking.

He couldn't lock his legs and some thought that it might have been this that helped with his endurance.<br/><br/>And what about the Sr. Pollard who started his own brick factory from scratch but lost it in a flood...rescuing his very large family but unable to rescue his equipment. Was not homeless, was not because of the depression like the ""docudrama"" feel would have you believe. None-the-less high drama.<br/><br/>
Oh, well...I can't remake it...but it could be saved on an editing room floor.<br/><br/>Please let Ms. Hillenbrand write a new narrative, George Woolf's character (or the race announcer) narrate a voice over, cut out all the ""documentary"" crap that does nothing to feed the story of these three characters or horseracing (and ruined the feel of the story, most notably when they cut to black and white pictures of the beginning of the race with War General) and could have been handled with well written dialog and images (like Tobey walking by a soup line...a picture is worth a 1,000 words!) and you might have had the movie that I was expecting and might have been an Oscar contender.<br/><br/>Denise"

"mrchaos33","Null","0","0","29 July 2003"," A movie for adults
","In a summer brimming with high flying angels and gravity defying archaeologists comes a movie designed to appeal to that most neglected segment of the movie-going population, adults. Nothing blows up and there isn't a flaming helicopter or open running wound anywhere in sight. In an attempt at counter programming Universal has scheduled Seabiscuit to go mano-e-mano against drunken Caribbean pirates, scantily clad adventurers and three dimensional spy kids, hoping to bring in the parents of the kids who have been dropping their allowance money at the box-office all season.<br/><br/>
Who knows, it just might work.  The last time I checked people over the age of fourteen enjoyed movies too.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is the inspiring story of a horse who became an American folk hero during the depression years. Everything about this movie screams prestige, from the Academy Award winning cast to the narration by PBS regular David McCullough to the sumptuous art design. Hell, screenwriter / director Gary Ross even used to write speeches for President Clinton! The result is a predictable, but likeable movie that demands nothing more from you than to feel better when you leave the theatre than you did when you came in. <br/><br/>Based on a book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand, Seabiscuit reintroduces us to one of the great sports stories from the early part of the last century. There was a time when everyone knew the story, he was so famous in fact that on one occasion hundreds of businesses closed for half a day so their employees could tune in to hear Seabiscuit race against Triple Crown winner War Admiral on the radio. These days, though, because Seabiscuit didn't endorse Nike or Pepsi, his story has been largely forgotten. <br/><br/>The film begins in the heady days before the stock market crash of 1929. Businessman Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) made his fortune selling cars, and promoting his vision of `the future.' After the tragic death of his son, the future doesn't seem so bright anymore. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is an outsider, shunned by most horse professionals because he believes in healing, not killing wounded animals. At a head taller than any other jockey on the horse racing circuit, Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire) is considered a fringe player, but he loves horses and prefers this life to the alternatives  starving on the streets or getting the tar knocked out of him in underground boxing matches. <br/><br/>Seasbiscuit, an undersized horse of good breeding but little in the way of talent is the center around which each of these men revolve. Through hard work and care Seabiscuit is transformed from a candidate for the glue factory into a champion, and basking in the reflected glory are Howard, Smith and Pollard. <br/><br/>Seabiscuit picks up speed in the middle stretch, after a slow first hour. Much of the opening of the film feels like a history lesson, disrupting the flow of the story. Not that you could easily derail this story. Ross has played fast and loose with the facts  for example, Pollard was actually a mean drunk, not the nice guy presented here  cobbling together a story that sometimes feels like Chicken Soup for the Equine Soul.<br/><br/>
Inspirational messages tumble from everyone's lips, as though pearls of wisdom flow from their mouths as easily as turning on a facet and watching the water coming pouring out. The script overuses several of these nuggets  ie: `Sometimes when the little guy doesn't know he's the little guy he can do big things'  which only reinforces their corny sentiments.<br/><br/>
If the dialogue seems stilted, the racing sequences certainly do not. Ross puts the viewer directly in the action in a series of beautifully realised shots that seem to be taken from the horse's point of view. In those days racing was a brutal sport where jockeys would punch and shove one another in mid-race. Seabiscuit does an admiral job of recreating the tension and aggression involved in the races with long shots that give the viewer the opportunity to follow the action without confusion.  <br/><br/>In the end Seabiscuit is clichéd and predictable, but good work by Bridges, McGuire and Cooper coupled with the movie's indomitable spirit make it a pleasure that is hard to deny."
"deanofrpps","7","0","0","29 July 2003"," good horse sense
","Seabiscuit is three stories in one: the biography of his owner, a short history of the US depression and recovery and the pedigree of the horse. Though slow and plodding at times in its knockoff of the 1949 version, the movie gives great insight into the never-say-die spirit that once infected the country (and certainly is utterly lacking these days) and good social comment on the rise of the parvenue West and its rivalry with the staid East. Good show Mr Howard who persuaded the white shoes at Pimlico to open the infield to the average Joe and Jane. Rich and poor alike should have had in the pre-OTB days equal opportunity to lose money gambling. I never thought much of any of the Bridges as actors but Mr Bridges renders a marvelous performance. Well worth seeing!"

","I very much enjoyed this film, it made me laugh and cry, what more could you want. I am a big fan of Tobey Maguire but I am not sure he was the best choice for Red Pollard. He lacks an edge that people have when they have been beaten up by life. That aside, every thing else was wonderful, except the ending. After struggling with these people and these characters I would have liked a little more excitement in the end. I think if they had kept the original narrator and shown the film clips of the real Seabiscuit in the winners circle, it would have been perfect. But that's just my opinion."

","I just came home from seeing it, and it was great! All the racing scenes had my heart pounding like mad, and when Seabiscuit was going in the gates for the Santa Anita Handicap (the ""comback"" race, the final race of his career), I started to feel the same way I felt when Funny Cide was loading into the gate for the Belmont... even though I already knew the outcome of Seabiscuit's race.<br/><br/>Gary Stevens was great! Whatever critic said that he was ""neutral"" might as well eat his words. I loved him in here, and can't wait till he shows up in more movies... even though I will miss him racing even more... Loved his new hairdo, though! hehehe!<br/><br/>All the actors were perfect for their parts, even Tobey (I first panicked, thinking he wouldn't quite be right for the part). I loved the temper parts too! (""He FOULED me!!"")<br/><br/>I haven't read the book yet, only because I can't find it, or it's been rented out to someone at the library. I'm hoping to get it for my birthday, next month. I'll definitely be getting the DVD, and maybe the VHS too, in case the DVD gets scratched up... that would be a worst nightmare, but you gotta be prepared, unfortunately...<br/><br/>4/5ths of my family actually came along. Everyone but my dad, only because he only likes movies from the 50s and stuff... At first I thought I'd be the only one going, but then my sister says she wants to see it... then my mom decides to come too... then she asks my brother if he wants to go, and the answer is ""yes."" Everyone left the theatre satisfied, considering that none of them could tell you what color Seabiscuit is (they think ""brown"" when I say ""bay."")<br/><br/>I'm already thinking of going back next week! It had great humor, all the ""Seabiscuit's"" looked the same (every last one had the right amount of color in the right spots), War Admiral looked georgeous, Chris McCarron did a brilliant job with making sure the racing scenes were exactly like the original (and his selection of the horses couldn't have been better.)<br/><br/>I couldn't find a thing wrong with this movie. It may not have had everything from the book, but if it did, the movie would have to be 5 hours long, even I know that. And I have yet to read the book... The accident scene where Red was injured was thrilling, my heart was racing, and nothing looked fake. There was no nudity, only some swears that a kid could handle just fine.<br/><br/>The newspaper today rated Seabiscuit, along with Tomb Raider. I think the ratings are out of 5. Tomb Raider got 2 stars, and Seabiscuit got 4 stars. The highest was 4 1/2 stars... I would have given it 6 stars, if it was possible. The theatre tonight was nearly packed! Someone behind him, though, kept talking to a friend about whether or not the white haired guy was the trainer or not (he was), but they were quiet for most of the movie. When the first Santa Anita Handicap was running, everyone reacted the same way as the audio in the movie when it showed the photo finish.<br/><br/>All in all, I would totally recommend this movie to everyone!"

","This movie was one of the best major films to come out this year. It offers everything most people would look for in a movie. It has action, great acting, great cast, an amazing and true story, and holds up one of the most influential times in our American history. Chris Cooper and Jeff bridges were the first two things that made me want to see this movie, but when I walked out I realized how truly amazing this tale they told was. This story was not just a some old gag about a boy that grew up away from home and found his way through racing, but really it was a story full of determination and strength. I think Tobey Maguire did a great job capturing the role of a ""Rudy"" sort of character. One that would not give up no matter what the chances were and how many times he was let down or he lost. Because of this story focusing not only on action-packed scenes, but also on the heart that it took to pick yourself up after losing and to keep fighting for that finish line, it made the viewers in the theater feel what the characters were feeling. In my eyes it deserves at least an 8.5 and definetly pushed it's way into the top 5 movies of the summer."
"elocs","8","0","0","25 July 2003"," The build up was better than the movie (spoiler).
","I have looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time since I ""listened"" to the book last summer and I am a fan of Tobey Maguire's work. I have the American Experience episode about Seabiscuit that was on PBS and have recorded 2 of the specials about the movie that have been on so far with another to go on A&E this Sunday.  So I had high expectations for this movie considering the Oscar hype it is getting. I did enjoy the movie, but overall I feel that all the previews and ""making of"" specials led me to believe that it would be more about Seabiscuit and Red Pollard than it was.<br/><br/>It did take nearly 45 minutes before Seabiscuit is shown and I feel they spent too much time trying to weave together the stories of Mr. Howard, Red, and Tom.  Although the movie is titled ""Seabiscuit"", it is definitely center around the 3 men.  There was such a wealth of material in the book about Seabiscuit that I wish the movie had been centered more around him.  I completely understand the difference between a movie and the book (being a LOTR fan), but with the compromises needed I wish this movie had taken a different direction.<br/><br/>William H Macey's role was small, but good, and got laughs from the audience.  Also, the audience did cheer when Seabiscuit beat War Admiral. But the movie ended so abruptly after Seabiscuit's final victory at Santa Anita that is seemed to take the audience by surprise with kind of a ""oh, it's over"" reaction.  Overall, the audience did like the movie and I did as well.  Tobey Maguire may get some nominations for his role, but I don't think the movie will for itself other than technical things.  I may need to see Seabiscuit again to form a better opinion of it.  I had to see The Two Towers 3 times before I got to liking it."

","I just finished reading a previous review lambasting the liberties the script takes with the facts of this true story. Well,  we can't have a six hour movie (as much as I'd like to). Characters have to be trimmed and scenes are often changed to heighten the drama.<br/><br/>Other characters and scenes were left on the cutting room floor as well. I myself wondered why Pollard has no wife and Charles Howard has no other sons. It is a flaw to not mention that Seabiscuit often carried 130 pounds in weight while other horses in the field often carried much less. I guess handicapping is a thing best left to horse enthusiasts. To be fair, there is a quick shot listing the entries in the last race shown and the weights assigned to each horse. But, you can't see that Seabiscuit is carrying the most weight. So, maybe this ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>(Can you tell I wanted a longer movie)<br/><br/>Each character is fully realized and the time is taken to develop them. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey McGuire are all superb, as is the comic relief character ""Tick Tock"", played by William H. Macy. The film beautifully captures the flavor of the book and by the end, I had a big lump in my throat. For once,  a movie about characters instead of explosions and mind numbing violence.<br/><br/>Hoorah for a job well done. My only quibble is the excessive use of documentary footage and still photos, especially during the big match race, which broke up the flow of the scene. I guess the producers felt they had to include such footage because audience members younger than forty would need to know when this movie took place. Sadly,  how many teenagers actually know when the depression was? I would have preferred to use the characters and dialogue more to bring the era to life. I'll give this movie 9 out of 10."

It would be hard to hate a movie like Seabiscuit anyway.  It's inspirational and America loves the underdog.  And every character in this movie is an underdog.  The makers want you to feel sorry for the leads and they do a good job at it.  <br/><br/>I think the real winner in Seabiscuit is Tobey Maguire.  Everyone KNOWS he is Spider-man, but he is also something more.  I really hope that his career doesn't typsecast him as Spider-man for the rest of his life like Leonardo Dicaprio is always associated with Titanic.  Because like Dicaprio, Tobey was having a smooth career with criticly aclaimed independent films and then came the big blockbuster and that's all they get credit for.  Dicaprio has been wonderful in a few other big movies but we still associate him with Titanic.  Hopefuly Tobey will rise above that.  I really think he can with this movie.  His performance is strong and touching and pretty much Oscar-worthy.  Even if he doesn't win, he deserves a nomination.  Speaking of Oscar Chris Cooper gives a nice performance.

","This is the best film I've seen in 2003, and it's set a very high standard for others in the Oscar competition.<br/><br/>The racing scenes were the best ever filmed.  That's not saying much, since there haven't been very many movies about horse racing (Phar Lap and Let It Ride come to mind).  But the director made us feel as if we were in the midst of the race, watching jockeys hurl insults at each other and then guide their mounts around the field.<br/><br/>The movie starts slowly, braiding three separate threads -- the lives of the main characters -- into one string; woven into the string is the narration. Eventually, the three threads are inextricably woven together into one, and woven around the horse that brings them together.<br/><br/>The main character represent far more than the lives they portray.  Charles Howard is the epitome of optimism, never losing his hope for the future. And he is singularly serendipitous, finding value in unnoticed things: first automobiles, then Tom Smith.  Tom Smith is the individualist, the loner, the go-it-your-own-way outcast; he is uncomfortable among humans, almost resentful of their intrusion into his wide-open West, and you can see his discomfort in his face in every scene.  Red Pollard is the out-of-place fighter; he struggles for acceptance, for respect, and he never stops fighting even when badly outmatched.  He is beaten again and again, and still comes back with a stronger resolve each time.  The three men together represent America itself, and their coming together with Seabiscuit as their catalyst represents the beginning of the nation's emergence from the Great Depression, the beginning of hope.<br/><br/>The match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral is more than a race between two horses, it is a quest for legitimacy.  And it seeks legitimacy not just for Seabiscuit (whose owners want him recognized as the great horse that he is), not just for West Coast racing, but for the West Coast of American society, for this is the age when the West grows up and takes its rightful place.<br/><br/>Some movies are merely about sports.  Some movies, such as Chariots of Fire and Seabiscuit, transcend their settings and come to mean more than any sport.  Seabiscuit is not just about a great racehorse and the lives he touched, it is about the indomitable American spirit, defeat and triumph, failure and redemption.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Some of the criticism I have heard directed at this movie centers around a couple of issues; not as good as the movie, too long, should have been better, mixing of documentary style with film does not work. Well, for me that is what made this movie as close to perfect as I have seen in a long time. Now granted, surrounded by the bloated, stinking, yellow teeth competition this summer has had to offer, Seabuiscuit may seem better then it is just because it tries to entertain. The rest of the movies out there this year seem to be almost laughing at you for 2 hours for spending your money. But I contend that even in a year where film after film raised the level cinema as we know it, this movie would be right up there with them. First, the length. By my last check, which was last night, I spend now almost $10 to see a movie and subsequently pay Julia Roberts $20 million per film to play the same, flighty, annoyingly stupid person she appears to be in real life. Money well spent. So if I am going to spend that kind of money, I want it to be worth it. Seabuscuit is worth it. The first 45 minutes is horse free, which seems strange considering the movie is based on the animal. However, without that setup the movie would never work. You have to care about these characters, hope that they win, hope that they make it out of the hell they are currently under, and root for them the entire time you are staring at the screen. You have to see them go through the hard times so that when the good times come, you are happy for them. The greatest failure a movie can make is to create characters no one cares about, or cast Kevin Costner. Either one is death. Its not as good as the book. Well, I have not read the book, but I am sure this is true. Books are ALWAYS better because a writer has an almost infinite amount of space to work with. As far as Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit, she had 448 pages to work with to tell the WHOLE story. A movie cannot do that. They have to stay true to the tone or message of the book rather then to every detail of it. In this case, the message stays true to heart. Three men, beaten, battered, almost destroyed, find a horse with similar life qualities and together they come alive again. They become a part of society again, and as they become uplifted by this beaten animal, so too does the rest of a tired country, if only for a moment. The message is not lost. The intermingling of documentary style film with the cinematic movie. I personally loved this. I thought it was somewhat unneccessary during the War Admiral, Seabiscuit match race but even there it was done nicely and still recovered quick enough to account for one of the truly touching moments of the film. Besides that, I LOVE David McCollough, who narrates this film. He is not only one of my favorite historians, he is also one of my favorite narrators. His voice just makes you take things seriously. And being a history geek, the ken Burns like interludes are wonderful for adding to the atmosphere of the picture. I loved it.<br/><br/>So, for me, this film worked on every level. The acting is incredible all the way around, and Oscars should be handed out to either MGuire or Bridges who are incredible. Cooper is great as well, playing a horse lover who has a knack for helping the less then perfect animals. To me, this is everything movies should be. Beautiful to look at, beautiful to listen to, and just a pleasure to watch. I hope Hollywood takes a cue from this movie and makes more like them. Movies that uplift, that inject a sense of pleasure in ones heart and make you feel like you $10 were well spent. Few films over the last several years have evoked that type of emotion."

With an elongated second act that squeezed every last bit of footage out of the B&W-to-color gimmick, it still managed to provide a foundation on which Joan Allen and William H. Macy could turn in some A-game performances<br/><br/>This time Ross rears his salt-and-pepper all over head to bring us Seabiscuit.  Perhaps I should have sensed trouble when I discovered he turned to this Depression Era horseracing story only after Universal sent his Jim Carrey/Nicole Kidman Ghost rip-off to an early grave.  Or when he fought tooth and nail to have Charlie Mitchell's name removed (Charlie did a previous draft which my sources say Ross borrowed heavily from) so that he would receive sole credit - (interesting how Mitchell's name suddenly disappeared from the film's credits on various movie databases).<br/><br/>But still, I figured Seabicuit would be a beacon in the summer s**t storm<br/><br/>No such luck.  Gary's most ambitious directing attempt to date (out of 2) leaves the audience wanting more.  Or perhaps less, as Ross tries a bit too hard to be too faithful the source material - no doubt hoping to avoid following in the footsteps of his 1949 predecessor David Butler.  The result however is more docu-drama than narrative film.  More a glimpse into, rather than a guide through, a certain time in American history.  But true story or not, the subject matter is reminiscent of a fairytale and Ross' overly researched fascination with the Depression undermines this and is all too evident, as our famed horse doesn't rear his long face until almost an hour into the film.  I thought this was a story about a racehorse.<br/><br/>Like Pleasantville, Ross has rounded out his cast with gifted performers who turn in moderately worthwhile performances.  I even once again accepted Tobey's goofy thousand-yard stare as real acting, although even with his Spider Man physique still intact, I'm not sure I buy him as a prizefighter.  Bridges brings the same genial oddball-next-door charm to this role that he did to Tucker, and from Cooper's character we get exactly what we'd expect - a quietly intense, wounded by inner demons kind of profundity that may take up too much screen time but is nonetheless admirably portrayed.<br/><br/>But when you reach for a star, there's a long way to fall, and Ross' self indulgent attentiveness to detail and cut-n-paste, molasses-in-January-slow first act pushes the viewer right out of the picture and the attempt to reign (get it? - reign) us back in is too little too late.  Gary's overly didactic style (complete with B&W photgraphs) had me thinking I was back in high school history class.  Is it a reprieve from Charlie's Angels 2?  Not as much as one would hope - I did say history class.  Do I feel any better spending ten dollars on Seabiscuit than I did on T3?  Absolutely not."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Yes I am one of those who love Laura Hillenbrand's book, but I will not bash the movie.  It is impossible for a 2 hour movie to get all the details accurate for a 10 year story.  I was a little disappointed that the filmmakers chose to go the route of a feel-good, rah-rah film and totally ignore some of the darker aspects of this fascinating story ... but I do understand.  Terrific acting by Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard, Jeff Bridges as Mr. Howard, Chris Cooper as Tom Smith and Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man) as Mrs. Howard.  Really thought Bridges captured the spirit of Mr. Howard in both pain and happiness.  He is a tremendous talent, and quite underrated.  Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens as George Woolf was nice casting, but again the emphasis on the ""nice"" part of the relationship left me a bit empty.  Some of the race scenes were breathtaking, but a bit too much slow-motion and way too many cut-aways.  I am no horse expert, but it appeared they used a few horses for Seabiscuit and the bobbing head did not match any of them.  Overall, a nice movie going experience, but I suggest everyone read the book!"

","Saw SEABISCUIT tonight at a Universal screening.   And, it was good.<br/><br/>The first thing about these screenings, is that the audience is all industry people, and it's a jaded audience.  They'll laugh politely, but there is generally no jeering, no cheering, and no heckling. Consequently, audience reaction is usually kinda low-key.<br/><br/>SEABISCUIT may be touted as being a Tobey Maguire vehicle (no pun intended) but Bill Macy owns this picture through and through.  The audience responded to him audibly throughout the film. By his third or fourth scene, there was a surge every time he appeared - as everyone snapped to attention to soak in every nuance as he made a truly classic character shine in this portrayal of the hardboiled radio sports commentator Tick Tock McGlaglin (sp)<br/><br/>I  was looking forward to this one because I 'd had a chance to see Gary Ross's film Pleasantville theatrically, and it had touched me in a lot of places. Now, seeing Seabiscuit, I'm getting a fix on him as a director.  He loves the 20th century, pop images, black and white, great effects, and he understands and seems to yearn for that elusive Frank Capra-esque sense of the greatness and splendor and wonder of what made America great.<br/><br/>With so many of the same faces as were in Pleasantville, I can only hope that this is the makings of a great ensemble cast that we'll have another chance to see in yet another vibrant and visionary vehicle. (Read that with the booming intonation of an old time carnival side show pitchman)<br/><br/>Like, this was good, but I'm already looking forward to his NEXT offering.<br/><br/>The characters in this story are almost allegorical. We get almost too much setup and backstory, but at the same time, much of their histories are glazed over completely.  For instance, we don't get any backstory on Elizabeth Banks' character at all.  But, no one in the theatre seemed to care.<br/><br/>People were practically on their feet with excitement during the exciting final race, and there was applause during climactic moments, and also when the credits rolled.  Another mark of respect, tonight the audience stayed seated through the tail credits, and gathered outside to share their appreciation with friends and coworkers.<br/><br/>I've seen speculation that people are hoping Tobey Maguire's presence is gonna bring a young audience to this pic.  I could be wrong, but my guess is that the 16 - 25 set (yes, I cut the age group off differently than most) is gonna go ""ho hum"".  I think they're gonna say Seabiscuit sucks.  I think it will turn the blockbuster action crowd off. But then, this is a film for the rest of us. *smile*<br/><br/>A film for the whole REST of the family.  One that people will want to see again and again -- and then bring home on DVD.<br/><br/>Bill Macy's a strong contender for Best Supporting Actor. I think everyone, everywhere, is gonna be as smitten with his character as this jaded room full of industry professionals was tonight.<br/><br/>Art Direction, Cinematography, Effects, Costumes, and Best Adapted Screenplay. At least six nominations that I can think of. I don't know what else's coming out yet, but it'll probably get a nod toward Best Picture too. But then again, this is only Gary Ross's second film, and it's not always about the film at hand, as anyone knows around here at least.<br/><br/>Some really nice incidental touches and  a great score from Randy Newman too...<br/><br/>Yeah OK I give this one 8 1/2  smiles.  Go see, go see.... you will not regret it. I promise."

","I saw this film based on the great trailer and earlier in the year I saw the PBS documentary so I this was one movie I really waited to see.<br/><br/>I was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>I sat there watching the movie and the problems were obvious. Gary Ross, the director, tried to touch all the bases but in doing so ended up with only a good movie. He had the classic Hollywood dream of a the little guy beating the odds, people who get a second chance, and how Seabiscuit was a great symbol and metaphor for the times. Those elements were there but in trying to cram the whole story into the 2 hour plus running time, Ross didn't execute it well.<br/><br/>The photography was excellent. The racing scenes were great, but the overall film missed for me.<br/><br/>If I were making the movie I would condense as much as possible the human character's back story. I really didn't need to see the scene of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) catching the wild horse and sleeping under the stars at the beginning of the movie. A much better scene was when Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) first sees Smith in Mexico. There were quite a bit of stuffing in the beginning that added nothing to the story or to the true story.<br/><br/>The David McCullough narration at the very beginning was a nice intro but after that it took away from the flow of the film and in fact would mislead those who don't know the real true story. The black and white montages also seemed to hit one over the head about how bad the economy was. It wasn't important to have those points explained explicitly. It should have come from what was filmed and through the characters. This was suppose to be an entertainment film not a documentary.<br/><br/>We also are mislead by the War Admiral match race. It is built up through a good portion of the film but then we learn that isn't the end as it should be. We get a large portion of the rest of the story. For a documentary that is great but for a dramatic film it was anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Ross could have had a great film if he had picked the scenes he filmed with the tried and true dramatic arc that make films entertainment. I would have ended the film with the race against War Admiral.<br/><br/>My ""Seabiscuit"" would have started with Howard going to Mexico and meeting Smith. Then Seabiscuit is purchased and all the problems with that. Then Smith sees Red and gets him to be the jockey for the horse and the final part of the film would be the match race."

","This is the condensed true story of the legendary racehorse, Seabiscuit. As most films based on real events things are left out for reasons of length and to make a smoother flow. This is no exception. However, the things left out here are not crucial to understanding the story. The vents and people depicted were real enough. The makers of this film did a wonderful job of bringing this story to the screen. The small town audience I watched the film with applauded at the end. That's rare enough.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me watching the film as the story built was the wonderful period look of the film. High praise to the art/set designers/directors, costume designer and cinematographer. It is a wonderful film just to watch. I even liked the locations. I would love to know which of the locations listed had such beautiful fall colors that Pollard and the Biscuit rode through in the country-side. That was wonderfully beautiful.<br/><br/>The actors were all in great form too. Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard gave a great standout performance as the often beaten, broken and tormented man who rode Seabiscuit to stunning victory so many times. A fun part went to real jockey Gary Stevens who has won the Kentucky Derby several times and is one of America's great living jockeys; a hall of famer. Who knew he could act? He did a great job playing George Woolf, Pollard's friend and mentor. 3 cheers for casting for getting him for this. Jeff Bridges did a wonderful job as the horse's owner Charles Howard. He was near-perfect here. I think this is the best performance I've seen him in. Michael Angarano did a wonderful but short turn as the young Pollard, I hope we see more of this fine young actor in the future. He's done a fair amount of television but this clearly showed him in a much more favorable light. Elizabeth Banks was very enjoyable as the 2nd, and more important Mrs. Howard. She has talent and should be one new actress we see more of too. Finally we have the wonderful talent of Chris Cooper as the trainer Tom Smith. His was a masterful performance; bringing warmth and humanity to a character of few words; no small achievement. It was teriffic to see him on screen as he molded the emotions of this complex man. He seems to get better with each new movie. His is clearly the standout dramatic performance here, with Maguire and Bridges tied for a close second. The movie was nearly stolen by the outrageous and comical character played by Bill Macy; ""Tick Tock McGlaughlin"". He was more than teriffic, maybe an Oscar nominee for this one. Drama it wasn't, but brother, was it ever great.<br/><br/>I could list some faults with the film; like things it left out, or which parts of the story they dwelt on, or the things missing such as facts that the real Howard raced more than one horse and employed more than one jockey, but none of that would really add anything if they had been included. This was story telling pared down to it's most basic element and masterfully done. Bravo to all involved and thanks from me for making it worth the price of admission. I'll remember this film for a long, long time."

","Jeff Bridges will get the long over due Academy Award as perhaps the movie shall too.  Even though there may be a few contenders in the fall releases that might change my opinion.  Clearly the ""Biscuit"" is the leader in the club house for the gold statue next March. Chris Cooper, as trainer Tom Smith, is wonderfully understated and frankly should also be considered in supporting role honors.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire handles the role of Red Pollard wonderfully.  This is a complicated role. Maguire plays the troubled and broken Pollard but I have got to tell you if anyone is better than Bridges it just might be Toby Maguire.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks is well cast and excellent as Ms. Charles Howard.<br/><br/>But maybe the one to steal the show is William H. May as Tick-Tock McGlaughlin the radio show host of a horse race program.  His is a small but really funny part and it adds a wonderful counterpoint to more serious fare.<br/><br/>So please don't get caught up in anything other than the plain facts about this wonderful show...the plain facts are it is warm and funny and uplifting and should be seen by the whole family.<br/><br/>I've  seen it twice and both times I joined the full house applauding the effort.<br/><br/>Just go see it and see why."

","Many have hailed this film as one of the best of the year.  Though it may well be, that is a sad comment on the films this year.  The fact is that many directors seem to be afraid to let their films fly, and apparently Gary Ross is no different.  There is no doubt that this is a technically superior film (and it is a pleasure to watch Chris Cooper, Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire do what apparently comes naturally to them).  But what differentiates a good film from a great film is that those involved with the great film show confidence while those involved with a good film hedge their bets at the last second.  This is a film that screams ""let me fly"", but Mr. Ross simply will not let it.  He holds back right at the moments where the audience wants him to let his film loose.  <br/><br/>Those involved with the real horse showed the confidence necessary to win. It is unfortunate that those involved behind the cameras on this project did not learn that important lesson."
"jessfink","8","0","0","27 July 2003"," Loved it, sue me
","I grew up riding.  I had a horse, a former pacer named Harvey Patch who had retired from racing. I was raised reading Marguerite Henry's ""Misty of Chincoteague"" books.  There wasn't a book about a horse I hadn't read to the point of memorization by the time I was ten.  I regularly go to the track. I went on vacation to Assateague and Chincoteague Island a few years ago. Oh, and I know film, and am the most cynical and jaded person I know about it.  <br/><br/>Yes, I loved the film.  <br/><br/>It isn't without its flaws.  Hillenbrand's book, frankly, left me wondering what all the fuss was about.  Many superb and even superior books about horses and racing have been written before, and as I read the book a year ago, I found myself trying to understand what it was that made people so excited about it.  What I realized was, it was made to be a movie.  People smelled advertising campaigns and box office dollars when they read the book.  It practically screams ""crowd-pleaser!"", and we know how much marketing executives love to be able to use that in a capsule review on a poster.  Personally, the idea of seeing a crowd-pleasing movie always makes me want to stay away, but that's another story.<br/><br/>In any case, that's what's wrong with the movie.  It's so in love with the organic, inherent, movie-perfect drama of the reality, it can't leave it alone to speak for itself.  Instead, this truly magical little fable is drenched in gorgeous technicolor...Seabiscuit thunders past sumptuous shots of the northern California autumnal leaves, we luxuriate in the rainbow of the vibrant silks the jockeys wear--heck, even the ham and peas Maguire's Red Pollard eats one evening for dinner are as glowing and rich as rubies and emeralds, photographed as only Gary Ross (""Pleasantville"") can compose a shot, saturated with well-composed period images, and the whole box of Crayolas is topped off with a warm, rich voice-over narration that is one step removed from a Ken Burns film.  After all the hard work of everyone to make this the definitive movie about the triumph of the little guy, at the end of the day, it's a Ron Howard film.  You're guided, step by step, from feeling to feeling, without having any say in the matter.<br/><br/>I love melodrama and I love Hollywood epic films, and I love movies with Jeff Bridges, and by God, I love horses.  I loved this movie in spite of itself.  For a movie with the central message of having faith in the little guy, though, ultimately, the message of ""Seabiscuit"" is that Hollywood has no faith in us responding to a movie on its own terms;  instead, draping this in every manipulative technique there is, and pounding us over the head with them."

","Hollywood makes movies for all sorts of reasons...their own pretentiousness, to make money, to win Oscars, etc.  Why they made this movie I don't care...I went for it HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.<br/><br/>Some directors make an ordinary scenery look good, some waste natural beauty, and others either are great directors or let our country's beauty speak for itself.  Whether it was absolute direction and cinematography skill or not overstepping boundaries...I think our director Gary Ross has ""the touch"" in Pleasantville and Seabiscuit.  The rugged mountains and beauty of the rolling plains are awe-inspiring, either direction or lack of over-directing are gifts I won't bother labeling Mr. Ross with.<br/><br/>This is the best ensemble cast I can remember in a long time, understated roles and excellent portrayals.  I can't label any LEADING ACTOR roles, honestly.  Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper both deserve Best Supporting Actor nods in my opinion.  Neither role was as dynamic as usually necessary to win, but you can't help but believe THEY ARE THE CHARACTER.  William Macy gets a lot of laughs and some critical acclaim for his radio broadcaster role, and I really like the guy.  The other two males are better. <br/><br/>
Please don't ignore Randy Newman's beautiful score either.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is good playing a fairly dark character that fights his way out of a bad situation time and time again, literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>I promise that you will laugh, you will cry, you will clap, you will sigh, you will do everything that excellent cinema demands of you or you need to drive straight to the emergency room and have your pulse checked.<br/><br/>
I think a lot has already been made of the Depression era and the symbolism of the rise of America parallel to the characters in the movie, so I won't bore anyone with retelling the story.  I can't help but like a story of America overcoming obstacles.  SORRY!  I'm a proud American.<br/><br/>This movie, quite frankly, has SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.  I was in a packed theater and saw as big a variety of our population as you could get, all thoroughly entertained by a movie that succeeds even more than I anticipated going in.   I'll admit it...I thought it would be GREAT before I saw it.   I underestimated it in a large way."

I guess we can draw some historical parallels even now. We are in the midst post 9/11; an economic turndown;high unemployment and ostensible victory in Iraq that's claiming lives of our guys on a daily basis.

","What are the three words that strike fear into the hearts of men everywhere? Those three little words: `A true story'. Usually when a story is Hollywoodized, it loses its dramatic impact and adds on sap. Although I have not read the book by Laura Hillenbrand, it's evident that the story of Seabiscuit was not jazzed up much for the theaters. It's not bubbling with sentiment, such as based-on-true-story movies usually are, and it has an authentic feel to it that makes Seabiscuit seem levelheaded, not conceited, and therefore tells a long, interesting, and predictable story that takes place in the Depression.<br/><br/>For the first third of this three-part film, we see Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) become a great car salesman, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a trainer who can calm the wildest horse, and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a literate, well-to-do boy who becomes a jockey. Then all of them meet and raise a horse, Seabiscuit, a wild and untimely horse whose backstory we find out but don't really care that much about. Although rather large for a jockey, Red rides Seabiscuit, who is rather small for a racehorse, trained by Tom, who is rather old for a trainer, and owned by Charles, who, as he says, is `too dumb to know the difference.'<br/><br/>In many ways, Seabiscuit is 2003's Road to Perdition. Both are early Oscar contenders, and are widely critically acclaimed, but probably won't bust the box office. Both have Oscar-winning actors in its cast. However, Seabiscuit is also different in many ways. Mainly, I found the first part of it almost boring, not very exciting. The subplot with literature in Red's family wasn't executed as well as it could have been, and, frankly, didn't like Red in the beginning simply because of his family. Of course, he grows on you, and soon you're rooting for him.<br/><br/>Bridges, yet again, acts greatly, and will probably be overlooked by the Academy, simply because he isn't in an `Oscar movie', a movie made just to win Oscars. Although he probably shouldn't win, at least give the man a nomination! Cooper proves once again that just because he has an Oscar he's a great actor. He was superb in American Beauty, but just acceptable in Adaptation., and here he's also just acceptable. He, thankfully, is not in many scenes. Maguire doesn't act, instead his badly dyed hair does. It's scarier than your great-grandfather without his teeth in.<br/><br/>Yet, of course, the best parts of Seabiscuit are the racing scenes. Although it's obvious that a camera was just hooked up to a horse or something behind them, with the Surround Sound and everything, it really seems like you're in the action. It's extremely predictable what's going to happen, but even still I was so excited, I was surprised. I was just about ready to jump up for joy! It's great filmmaking (from Gary Ross, Pleasantville) that can make you feel that: predictability and yet excitement. Seabiscuit's pace ebbs and flows, but overall you won't be disappointed if you take a trip out to your local multiplex.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations and violent sports-related images."

But don't be fooled: it stinks. There IS a great movie in Laura Hillenbrand's book, but this isn't it, not by a long shot. Ross falsifies the story at every turn, garbling and changing facts for no good reason. <br/><br/>A few examples (POSSIBLE SPOILERS if you don't know what happened in real life):<br/><br/>Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) was not a bicycle repairman in New York in 1910. He moved to San Francisco in 1903 and soon branched from bicycles to Buicks. He struck it rich in 1906 when the great earthquake left him with the city's only reliable transportation. By 1910 he was a wealthy San Francisco automobile dealer.<br/><br/>Tijuana was a mecca for Prohibition Era racing fans in the 1920s, but not in 1933; by that time, Prohibition was on its way out and racing had been banned in Mexico. <br/><br/>Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) was not kicked out of the house by his poverty-stricken parents.<br/><br/>Charles Howard and his first wife had five children, not one.<br/><br/>Howard's son Frankie died in 1926, not 1931. He was 15, not 10. He was with two friends, not alone. He swerved to avoid a rock in the road, not another truck. <br/><br/>Howard did not pick up his second wife, Marcela, at a Tijuana racetrack in 1933; they were introduced in San Francisco by his son Lin, who was married to Marcela's sister. <br/><br/>Pollard lost the vision in his right eye in a riding mishap, not in the boxing ring. He kept it a secret from everyone, except possibly his wife, all his life. He knew that if word got out he would be banned from racing. He certainly would never have shouted it out to Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) in the jockeys' locker room. <br/><br/>Tom Smith did not see Seabiscuit for the first time at five o'clock on a foggy morning; it was on a `sweltering' June afternoon.<br/><br/>The fictitious Tick-Tock McLaughlin (William H. Macy) describes Seabiscuit as `the hottest thing on four legs since Hope and Crosby' presumably sometime in 1937. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby made their first movie together, ""Road to Singapore,"" in 1940, after Seabiscuit retired.<br/><br/>McLaughlin, again, refers to jockey George `Iceman' Woolf by saying, `The Iceman cometh'  a clear reference to Eugene O'Neill's play. This is in 1938; ""The Iceman Cometh"" didn't appear until 1946. <br/><br/>Pollard suffered two near-fatal spills from a horse, not one. The first, not shown in the film, was during a race and was by far the worst.<br/><br/>
There was never any question of Seabiscuit being put down over a ruptured ligament; no one with any knowledge of horses will buy this scene. At worst he would have been retired from racing and put out to stud.<br/><br/>
Tom Smith, not Red Pollard, took charge of Seabiscuit's recovery.<br/><br/>
END OF SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>All of these points (with the possible exception of Pollard's first spill) could just as easily have been correctly filmed, at no greater expense or trouble. Instead, Ross shows a complete disregard for the letter AND spirit of Seabiscuit's story. What one commenter here called the film's ""eye for detail"" is, in fact, nonexistent. <br/><br/>(And spare me the ""dramatic license"" lecture. By using historian David McCullough as narrator, Ross is clearly -- and fraudulently -- pretending to be as accurate as a documentary.) <br/><br/>All of this MIGHT have been acceptable -- or at least forgiveable -- if the movie simply MOVED. But it lumbers, for two-and-a-half endless hours. Ross lingers over scenes with hushed reverence, as if they were stations of the cross. <br/><br/>And the racing scenes are almost totally botched. Ross resorts to slow-mo too often, for too long, and at the worst possible times. In the great match race with War Admiral, Ross inexplicably cuts away from the start of the race to show a succession of anonymous Americans huddled around radios; the race is half over before he comes back (to be fair, the film does justice to the wonderful ""So long, Charlie"" moment as Seabiscuit pulls away in the stretch). Worst and most inexcusable of all, in Seabiscuit's other great triumph, the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap, Ross ENDS THE FILM AND DISSOLVES TO THE CREDITS BEFORE SEABISCUIT EVEN CROSSES THE FINISH LINE!!! What kind of idiocy is this? The man must be mad. (And let me chortle, just in passing, at those ridiculous patched-in closeups of Tobey Maguire on his darling little bobble-head hobby horse. They don't even match the horse in the long shots.) <br/><br/>Laura Hillenbrand called the 1946 THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT ""unforgiveably bad."" This one may not be as bad, but it's even more unforgiveable. Don't bother with this bloated, leaden travesty. Read Hillenbrand's great book instead -- or see the PBS ""American Experience"" documentary, which gives you more of the story, gets it straight, and is less than half as long."

","Jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) quotes Shakespeare to describe his 1938 `Horse of the Year': `Though she be but little, she is fierce.' Such is also the quality of a relatively `little' film, released in mid summer after larger disappointing films like `Hulk'. <br/><br/>See `Seabiscuit' if you want to see the best American movie this summer. This is what American filmmakers do well-a rouser with messages, bigscreen chases, sentimentality for the little guy, depression-era caring. `Seabiscuit is `Rocky' for horses. <br/><br/>Director Gary Ross (`Pleasantville') has written and directed a classic American film with stars Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper, and William H. Macy, all of whom contribute enough character and charm to overwhelm all other Hollywood films this summer and any shortcomings of this film itself. Chris Cooper (`Adaptation') is so believable as a horse whisperer that he may win another Oscar. When he says, `You don't throw a whole life away just because it's banged up a little,' the thought resonates for almost everyone in the film, a tribute to unity of theme and expression of actor. <br/><br/>The true story of Seabiscuit's triumphs reflects the spirit of the 20th-century depression, when people salvaged their lives and a government cared to help them (compassionate conservatism defined!). Though Bridges' auto tycoon and horse owner never really suffers the losses of the masses, he seems to represent President Roosevelt's beneficent stewardship by resisting layoffs in his factories and encouraging everyone to look to a brighter future. The death of his son, however, symbolizes his share in everyone's losses. <br/><br/>Today I also saw my favorite French film of the summer, `Swimming Pool,' which lingers on the beautiful mind and body of a middle-aged woman (Charlotte Rampling) as it explores her as writer-that's what the French do well, subtle and sexy. America and France have bright futures separate and together, in film and the world. <br/><br/>Viva la difference!"
"Sinisalo","9","0","0","22 July 2003"," Theme of second chances gives race horse story added depth.
","I went into this movie not knowing a thing about Seabiscuit and little about horse racing.  I expected and got a story of triumph over adversity with a few bumps in the road to make it interesting.  This could seem like familiar stuff, like Rocky, The Karate Kid, The Natural, and any number of other sports movies.  Fortunately, the movie deals with the theme of recovery and not just winning.  At various points in the movie we see characters loose their livelihoods, family members, are abandoned, suffer physically, and as a country, during the Depression, loose hope for the future.  The story is used, in part, as a backdrop to drive the themes of second chances and a personal and national recovery from despair.<br/><br/>If that sounds a little heavy handed, Seabiscuit doesn't play that way. The race scenes are exciting, the landscapes and cinematography are beautiful, and the bond between man and animal is suitably explored and remains mysterious and humorous.<br/><br/>This is also very much an actor's film.  Jeff Bridges turns in another fine performance. Is there another actor that can do so much with appearing to do so little?  This guy is a national treasure. Very under rated.  Chris Cooper gives his horse trainer the ability to keenly observe both animal and human nature.  Toby Maguire has the plum role of the jockey who has to overcome his self destructive inner rage over his past and limitations.  His relationship with the horse is really the core of the film.  Finally, Elizabeth Banks, plays the wife of the horse owner, who seems to just get what make her husband tick and derives great pleasure from the racing of the horse.<br/><br/>I suppose some will find the film painted in too many broad strokes, reaching for some great truths about the human condition. or find the landscapes too pastoral or the tone too nostalgic.  For me, the whole picture is very well balanced including the Randy Newman score and even the broadest character in the film, William Macy's sportscaster, lifts the mood after various darker moments in the story.  Great pencil thin!"

","As a docudrama, Seabiscuit plays wonderfully.  Here are reenactments of the most important moments of the horse and the people who loved him.  As a piece of cinema it lacks slightly.  It's interesting and even compelling at times, but never gripping nor engrossing.  You could watch the same thing on the History Channel and still be just as entertained, which is not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>It's the story of the rise and fall and rise again of a race horse that no one cared about until Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) takes a chance with not only the horse, but a trainer most think is crazy (Chris Cooper) and a jockey who is a down-and-out loser (Tobey Maguire).  The result is history as the film spells out all too well.<br/><br/>Although today's economy is not as bad as it was during the early 1900's, it's still an interesting parallel that helps the film.  You know the pain and anguish they are going through and so start to root for them despite knowing that everything will turn out all right in end.  How else could the best-known underdog story of that generation turn out any other way?"

"aliciadipesto","Null","0","0","18 July 2003"," Nice!
","Seabiscuit is based on a true story - always a dubious start since you never really know where fact stops and fiction takes over.  This is a NICE film really, NICE in all sorts of ways; cinematically it's pleasing on the eye, the attention to detail is gratifying, the acting is fair, the story has a NICE happy ending. NICE, innocent, good clean family fun.<br/><br/>
I think that's what did it for me really. The characters played by Jeff Bridges, Elizabeth Banks, Chris Cooper and Tobey McGuire are all so benevolent and kind to each other it's really not that believable, considering the knocks some of them have had on the way up and how different their backgrounds have been.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the impulsive investment by millionaire car manufacturer Charles Howard (Bridges) of a very ruined and battle-scarred young racehorse and his bid to make the horse a star. Cue Tobey McGuire, equally ruined and battle-scarred as budding jockey desperate to prove himself, just like the horse, funnily enough. Uncanny.<br/><br/>The story is set against the backdrop of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Depression, which is admittedly beautifully illustrated with grainy monochrome photographs of soup kitchens, the American migration west, the Dustbowl phenomenon, desperate-looking 'Hoovervilles' and a sensitive voiceover. As a history lesson it's impeccable, but the over-emphasized metaphor of Seabiscuit representing the American people struggling to the top in the face of overwhelming odds is clunky in the extreme, it's just so naff. Maybe that's how Seabiscuit's fortune was viewed at the time but we are a much more cynical audience 70 years later and a more subtle approach would have won more people over.<br/><br/>William H Macy's cameo role as eccentric racing radio jock complete with in-house sound effects (coconut shells, gongs, xylophone etc) is highly entertaining and is the film's saving grace during its more schmaltzy moments. He steals the show.<br/><br/>The other key point is that horseracing, however you look at it, is far from a mainstream sport and as a topic for a film it will have limited appeal. The characters come from a variety of hard-bitten backgrounds - Tom Smith (Cooper)for example, a mustang breaker from the wild west, monosyllabic, living rough, who has a remarkable affinity with horses. Red Pollard (McGuire), prodigious rider abandoned as a child by his destitute parents - whom we fully expect to see cheering him on at some point in the future, but they never appear again. Then there's Charles Howard - automobile tycoon - loses his son in a car accident; what a fascinating start, but all we see is his wife leaving and a remarriage to a beauitiful young girl. Even their wedding day is literally one scene lasting a few seconds. The film is crying out for more character development, and they have so much to offer. The camera spends more time gazing into the vacant eyes of the horse than it ever does examining the enormous potential of the characters around it, which is a shame and this will be a huge disappointment to anyone who isn't a horse nut.<br/><br/>However, the action around the race track is filmed brilliantly, and the sound excellent. It's exciting to watch even if you'd be happier watching championship darts over horseracing, and makes the most of one of the world's duller sports. There are some tense, rather laboured moments but after the first 20 minutes we all know we'll sleep soundly after these credits have rolled, they aren't really too bothersome.<br/><br/>Yes it's a true story, but not many people know about it, so did it have to be so predictable? But then the film is American owned, directed, funded and produced so no loose threads here, no interpreting the ending over coffee and cake afterwards, no moments of doubt or uncertainty; it romps home to the finish line with everyone a winner, the economy restored, the future secure, the skies blue, the sun shining, cheers from the ecstatic grandstand and, like countless other feelgood movies, the narrator pressing home the tired old chestnut of believing in oneself. How very NICE."

Was this a movie about an underdog and his horse or a 7th grade social studies class?! An hour later, the movie was interspersed with other historical facts ""a la Ken Burns"" style with footnotes and still images about the New Deal, etc. The studio must have assumed that the audience was stupid and did not know that the film was set in the 1920s/30s/40s. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the sets were top quality and most of the lead actors were good, albeit they did not have much to tell us.

At the same time, I knew nothing about Seabiscuit going into the film and therefore had no preconceived ideas - and I'm sure i'm not atypical. On balance therefore, this should make it easy for the Director to build a plot with turns and twists that keep the viewer engaged. What we ended up with was 'He had no chance, then he won some, then he won big, then something bad happened then finally something good happened' which is standard Hollywood fare. <br/><br/>The acting was so-so and even the usually excellent Chris Cooper (Bourne Identity, for example) was wooden.<br/><br/>But what make me dislike the film even more were the leaden references to the 'What Made America Great' worldview of the little guy making good. we've had this rammed down our throats by Hollywood for years and I thought the public would sick of it - I certainly am.<br/><br/>In the race for the best action movie of the year, SeaBiscuit doesn't even place.."

","I can understand ""Sea Biscuit"" being very popular in the United States, a country where the people are taught to be aware of the events in their history that have combined to turn the nation into what it is today.Memories of the Great Depression are still deeply etched into the psyche of Middle America and the country is rightly proud of the superhuman efforts that were made across the board to get it back on its feet.Any movie set in that era showing the ""little guy"" winning through against tremendous odds has a head start at the box office.Courage,resourcefulness and resilience were the qualities required both in life and in art.Fine movies have been made about the Depression,"" The Grapes of Wrath"",""Sullivan's Travels"" and,more recently,""Paper Moon"",that have skirted the edge of sentimentality,but ""Sea Biscuit"" slides over almost into bathos in my opinion. We Brits have a reputation for being a bit stuffy,repressed,uptight or whatever you like to call it,although you'd never think it if you'd ever been to a soccer match in this country,and national outpourings of emotion are not our thing despite the completely atypical frenzy over the death of Princess Diana in some quarters which,in any case,was largely media - induced.So perhaps it is not such a surprise that some of us find the emotions roused by the exploits of a racehorse and its entourage a little strange.The same incomprehension extends to the praise given to a perfectly adequate - but no more - movie of the same subject. Mr Cooper and Mr Bridges are fine,giving thoughtful and understated performances,but I found Mr Maguire unsettlingly like Huntz Hall of ""The Bowery Boys"",both in appearance and performance.which was an unfortunate distraction. Mr W.H.Macey was a positive dynamo of energy in what was otherwise fairly lethargically paced movie,his character wouldn't have been out of place in a ""Batman"" comic of the era. But the sentiment was laid on with a trowel,the metaphors blindingly obvious and repetitive and the semi - documentary style employed for parts of the movie disrupted the flow of the narrative. In the end I found I was rebelling against its manipulations in the same way I refuse to shed tears when 13 year old boys sing ""Pie Jesu"" on ""Britain's Got Talent"".

","Seabiscuit wasn't a mustang, he was a thoroughbred. His dad was Hartack, hence his name.

I seem to recall reading elsewhere that ""Sunny Jim"" said that the way her treated Seabiscuit was the one thing he would like to do over, if he could. That is kind of like Phillie Scout Red Murph telling the team that a left-handed pitching from a small town in Louisiana was not tall enough to make the major league. ""At that time,"" Murph said in later years, ""I thought a left-handed pitcher had to be at least 6-2 to make it in the majors."" The Phillies took Murph's advice and let the Oakland A's draft Vida Blue, who was only 5-10, and the rest is history. It was a really lovely movie.

","I'm not the least bit interested in horse racing, although I will watch the Kentucky Derby, and I'll usually watch the big race after the Kentucky Derby to see if a horse is on its way to the triple crown. I would get horse racing forced down my throat at work when I worked with the old timer there. He loved horse racing, and he would watch the most trivial and meaningless races. So, of course, when ""Seabiscuit"" came out on DVD, he'd be watching it and I'd have to suffer through it too. What could I do? He had seniority, hence he had the T.V. rights. I guess I could have worked, but how does that look? One guy watching T.V. with another guy working, I couldn't do that to him. <br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what a seabiscuit is, but the movie sure was good. An owner, a horse, a trainer, and a jockey were the main ingredients to the movie ""Seabiscuit"". Each character was compelling in his own way. The owner, played by Jeff Bridges, was a wealthy risk taker that didn't mind running his mouth. He was very similar to ""Tucker"". The horse was gutsy and determined, just like his rider, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire). The trainer was an even tempered, soft spoken guy who everyone respected.<br/><br/>The movie centered around these four, but it focused mainly on Seabiscuit and Red Pollard. I'm a sucker for the underdog story, so I think the overcoming-all-odds, David v. Goliath aspect of the story fascinated me the most. It was great to see an undersized horse and an over-sized jockey go out there and win. It was even better to see them win against the likes of War Admiral. Seabiscuit and Red were given the chance to show their heart and determination again after both of them suffered a broken leg and faced the possibility of never racing again. If having one round of glory wasn't enough, Seabiscuit and Red did an encore to cap the movie off nicely."

He gets a divorce from his wife (quite common when a child dies, actually), and lives a melancholy life until he ends up at a horse track in Tijuana. He meets a nice young lady there, and they marry.

It makes you feel good, it really does. But the whole time, I kept thinking I was cheering for a horse. Oh yeah, apparently horses are people too. I guess I should have watched Black Beauty one more time. At times, they try to be philosophical, and the whole time they're working on the ultimate underdog story. The horse is about half the size of War Admiral, the jockey is too tall, blind in one eye, and broke his leg (for a minute I expected him to wind up with leukemia or something), and the trainer was a loner. But they had spirit ... American spirit. They do make this quite an American film, full of American underdogism, American pride, and the American dream. But, really, this is a great movie.

True, some parts of the movie tug at your emotions a little, but the important thing is the Depression-era setting and how the horse was an inspiration to the country. As jockey Red Pollard, Tobey Maguire creates a character to whom we can look up as much as we can Spider-Man, and Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper are equally good.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Seabiscuit"" is certainly a movie that I recommend.

I'm sure the horses they used couldn't compete close to what the actual Biscuit did decades back...but the powerhouse attitude and performance of the horse creates a make-believe environment beyond the realm of the other characters.Hats of to the Horses' Trainers/Handelers and the Director of the movie for this piece of work.I felt the Direction was excellent and the movie deserved much more recognition,fame and fortune than it got. Kudos to the whole team and hope more ""Seabiscuits"" are delivered in time..."

","What Seabiscuit doesn't fully achieve is give the topic of the movie a 100% credibility. This is something very common in Hollywood movies portraying a specific era or person. ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Cinderella Man"" anyone. But this is a minor problem, the movie as a whole is a solid accomplishment. It has a hell of a lot more virtues than debilities, the strongest of the former being the editing and storytelling. We are left to fill many pieces in for ourselves, always a sign of a smart movie that doesn't underestimate it's viewers, and the editing made sure that certain scenes stay in the viewer's head (a particular one being the first race Seabiscuit wins, or the very ending of the movie). The ensemble of actors works great and even Tobey Maguire (whom I usually find unsatisfactory given his abilities of emotional span) shines. Overall apart from being too much of a crowd pleaser this movie will stick around for a long time as being a beautiful addition in movie-making.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Recommendations: everybody!"

","The story of three men and one horse who beat the odds, surprised everyone around them, and made history. The nice thing about this wonderful film is that it's based on a true story -- a story that captivated depression-era America to the point of obsession. Based on the best-selling novel, my only real complaint is that, out of necessity, so much was left out. Jockey Red Pollard, in particular,was a marvel of guts and determination. The sad little rider and the plain-looking horse with the crooked legs, were a perfect match who set astonishing records. Couple this with the intensely human stories of Seabiscuit's amiable owner and his quirky, misunderstood trainer, and you have one incredible story. I don't want to give any plot points away...just see it -- it's fantastic."

","Seabiscuit is an incredibly moving film based on a true story that is the epitome of the strength and resilience endured by the human spirit against what might seem as unbeatable odds.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit begins with three stories, Chris Cooper is a wrangler on the ranges of the west, herding and breaking mustangs is his life until the depression comes and he becomes a roamer. Jeff Bridges is a self made millionaire who has endured unbearable hardships in his personal life despite his success, and Tobey Maguire is a young boy who had a very bright future with horses until the depression sets in and his fate seems to be sealed with disappointment after disappointment. The racing industry is up and coming and is what blends these three lives together in a spectacular show of spirit and heart.<br/><br/>The movie is set at the time of the depression when people desperately need something to lift their spirits and to help them forget about their lives not so long ago before the depression. Then along comes Seabiscuit, a long shot abused racehorse and the three men's paths are joined. They not only take the racing world by storm but also they challenge the great thoroughbred Triple Crown winner, War Admiral. This movie is the ""Rocky"" for the racing industry.<br/><br/>It is no wonder that the film was nominated and won several awards, especially the American Society of Cinematography (ASC) award for outstanding achievement in cinematography in theatrical achievement. The continued proxemic patterns of the depression laden era and the heart break that was experienced throughout the faces of the many people in the movie in relation to as well as within the characters, and then the spirit that was captured by the camera of the people listening and watching during many of Seabiscuit's races only heightened the theme of the enduring human spirit and draws the audience into the same heartfelt spirit and feelings of conquering any obstacles that might come along.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit, the little racehorse that could, captures the audience and draws them into feeling the strength and heart of the human spirit and is a general feel good movie for the whole family."

","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I love it but having said that I want to critique it to share one disappointment with the movie. It is the beginning, the way the stories of the characters are brought together. It felt cluttered and disjointed to me to the point that when the characters finally do come together the emotion derided from those stories that should have been there just was not present. The stories do not effectively pull you in and the cultured artsyness of the beginning may have unfortunately bored some to turn it off but the story they wanted was just ahead if only they knew. It seemed the separate stories impact was muffled but then that highlights the power of this movie, that is from the moment the principle characters do come together it becomes such a great story in itself there is no need for the first part of this movie but then oh how much more powerful this movie could have been. Despite that this movie is in my top 10 of all time. Right now it looks like the best underdog movie out there. There are so many fundamental things happening in this movie that relate to our lives and culture that when it all finally comes to a climactic peak it is emotionally wondrous . The characters as they are cast is a masterstroke and I have to say as to the casting of the George Wolf character, and although it is a small part, BRAVO! So perfectly cast here for the intensity and sympathetic sober tenor to the buildup of the climactic moment that I'am just amazed. Excellent! This movie is about what makes America great and more now than ever we need to remember that."

","There are several problems with ""Seabiscuit"". It most certainly wasn't the movie I expected it to be. I expected something way more dramatic and 'epic'. The movie was a bit of a disappointment for me but fair is fair, it still is a good movie! <br/><br/>Main problem for me were the characters. I couldn't really relate to any of them and therefor I didn't got emotionally involved with them or the story.<br/><br/>Also problem is, is how incredible predictable this movie is. Yes, I know, it is based on a true story so the outcome of the movie is already set but if they had paid some more attention to a few things they could have had improved the movie by making it more 'tense' and certainly less predictable. For instance every time you hear heroic music, you don't need a magic 8-ball to predict the outcome of a race and every time you hear dramatic music you know something bad is going to happen...there are no surprises in this movie really. It's almost like you are watching a documentary at times.<br/><br/>Still it's a movie made with lots of profession and passion, both in front and behind the camera. The actors are good but they don't really have got an awful lot to do since the movie is almost documentary like. A bit of a waste of a good cast. William H. Macy plays about the only interesting and enjoyable character of the entire movie. Visually there is nothing wrong with the movie. The costumes are impressive and the atmosphere simply great. Still the close-ups of Tobey Maguire during the races look a bit laughable since it is pretty obvious that he is not riding a real horse.<br/><br/>Not a movie that I got carried away by but at least I enjoyed myself while watching this, thanks to the professionalism the movie was made with.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Honestly, I've never thought I'd like this movie that's why I didn't see it at the theater or rent it on DVD, until now. (It's the only Oscar nominated film I skipped for 2004) To my surprise, it's a very high quality film and was lushly produced. I have to agree with many viewers, the cinematography is far more poetic and superior than the 'master and commander' which won the category eventually. It's far better as a film than the Oscar nominated 'finding neverland' last year as well. I have no slightly idea why such an ordinary movie like neverland was nominated, before the Oscar and after watching it on DVD. The only explanation is there were too many lame movies last year that they couldn't even find 5 decent films to nominate for.<br/><br/>All the characters are likable in the movie. That's different from the usual Hollywood predictable formula: got to have some villains for contrast! Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper both delivered a very fine performance. Chris Cooper especially stands out in every scene he was in. On the contrary, Tobey Maguire got most screen time but is the least interesting of the major leads (including the horse) to watch. He neither subtracts nor adds values to the movie. It's in fact kind of distracting to watch his red hair (we know why) when there are plenty of actors with red-hair can do the job.<br/><br/>Still, it is a solid and up-lifting film. Can't expect too much on a film nowadays, especially when you have to endure dozens of lame movies to come across a decent movie like this in a typical year."

","It's clear that at the time the real Seabiscuit was a major star in horse-racing, and deservedly so. Genuine rags-to-riches stories are always good fare for the movies. This film evokes the atmosphere of Depression-era America very well, and there's a feel-good factor that's hard to avoid being seduced by. Frankly this is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, with a solid cast providing solid performances. I don't think it's by any means the best work that any of the lead players have produced, but perhaps the corniness of the script is the main reason. The horses are uniformly outstanding however. The narration is unfortunately both distracting and irritating - I would have preferred captions or more newspaper shots. In conclusion it would be churlish to be too negative about this film, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid to see it in the cinema, rather than watch it at home as I did. I would recommend it as a family film."

"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","1","2","4 November 2004"," Hope Still Lives
","""Seabiscuit"" is a marvelous story of overcoming great troubles and adversities through hope, determination, and championship. It is a very simple and demure tale about a circle of acquaintances: a rowdy jockey (Tobey Maguire), a prosperous, yet disparaged marketeer (Jeff Bridges), and a humble, conscientious horse trainer (Chris Cooper), who team up to lead a scruffy, underdog racehorse named Seabiscuit to national victory, and to perhaps enhance their own spirits and relieve their own disparities in the process. Set during the Great Depression, and apparently based on actual events, ""Seabiscuit"" strives to create the uplifting and sensational impression that hope can prevail over adversity, and that high spirits, if even temporary, can obliterate those troubles prevalent in 1930s America and give those disparaged by the times something to cheer about: Seabiscuit provided just that kind of marvelous spirit and redemption for much of the nation, produced by determination and willingness. This message being recognized and respected, there are some succinct problems to be found in this film. For instance, it tends to deviate from theme to theme frequently: from sobering (e.g. when Jeff Bridges loses his son to an accident), to mild and curious (e.g. training Seabiscuit), to primitive (e.g. Toby Maguire ""duking it out"" as a wrestler in Mexico), and this amounts to much unevenness throughout the story, often times quite confusing or even irksome. Much is characterized of Seabiscuit being an flawed, underdog contender for a horse race, we hardly experience many notorious triumphs which led to Seabiscuit's national popularity at the time: we hardly follow any invigorating championships in horse races, yet they are consistently being talked about. Some failed efforts in captivating and sensationalizing upon its very inspiration- al and reverent theme greatly compromise what could have been a brilliant and beautiful cinematic experience. However, there are some marvelous technical aspects to be acknowledged: the cinematography is breathtaking and stirring, the music is sensational and dramatic, the set direction feels as if one were situated in a stadium in 1930s America, and the sound effects of the hoofbeats racing across the ground are rhythmic and powerful: a brilliant technical design. Toby Maguire is very compassionate and human with his role, as are Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, who provide just the maturity and confidence to keep their afflicted, yet emboldened characters alive. A sensational story, with sensational cinematic achievements, yet a rather underwhelming plot, ""Seabiscuit"" succeeds mostly as fresh, potent, entertainment, a real ""gallup"" of a winner. *** out of ****"
"departed07","10","1","2","12 August 2004"," A movie that adds hope and courage
","Seabiscuit is the kind of movie that indulges you to believe that no matter how bad the odds are in life, you can always get back on your feet and succeed. One of the best pictures of 2003, is also one of the best American movies ever made. The film takes place in the days of the depression era where money was lost, lives were changed and hope was lost. Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, a once bicycle salesman that can change alternaters in cars to run smoothly deals with the lost of his money,the death of his son in a car accident and the divorce of his wife. Tobey Maguire plays Red Pollard, a once smart boy that loved to read until the day his family gave him away to another family in order to stay alive. He is a jockey riding for cash and loses everytime. He boxes, and tells cockeyed stories to fellow Jockeys including George Wolfe played by Gary Stevens. Chris Cooper plays Tom Smith, a trainer who actually understands horses and is befriended by Charles Howard in one scene. What brings these three men together is a race track, and what no better way for gambling none other than horse-racing. The main star of the movie is the character's title, Seabiscuit, a horse that was abused by many of its owners and with the aid of Tom Smith, Seabiscuit is able to compete in many competitions with Red Pollard riding as they lead to many victories. I was touched in many scenes that these characters cared about each other and that Charles who was once down and out is back on his knees and considers Pollard as a son and Tom a partner. Seabiscuit also stars Elizabeth Banks as Marcela Howard and William H. Macy as Tick Tock McColguin a fast talking radio D.J. that gives updates about the race events. I know that many fellow users at IMDB considers this film a patriot movie, but it is not about the American flag, but about hope and the courage to stand up to what people once believed in."

","""Seabiscuit"" is a great movie for teenagers. It's a story of hope, the underdog, it will warm the cockles of your heart. I'll admit, it's fun to watch, especially if I saw this 20 years ago as a teen. Unfortunately as a male over 30, Seabiscuit is ends up wallowing in the dependency of a corny, over-emotional script blantantly devised to give you that ever-popular ""I feel good all over""- as only hollywood can do to sell. Anyone old enough and has a good 10-20 years of film watching behind them will no doubt sense this. I ended up feeling like a saw a very good made for TV movie or an after school special. The 3 main actors- Toby McGuire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper are really quite good and enjoyable to watch, which certainly helps this mush. I'm also in shock the makers left out an ending synopsis of the life of Seabiscuit and his remarkable history as we also NEVER find out what ever happened to him or his future. Instead, the credits just roll. This,to me, after watching the fluff for 2 and a half hours, was just more irritation. 6/10 for some fine acting, a nice story, and sheer harmless fun."

","Where did director Gary Ross come from? His limited directorial experience makes the accomplishment of Seabiscuit even more amazing. This is a film about people coming from rock-bottom rising to the top. Ross uses such unique transitions comparable to those of Orson Welles, using both visuals and sound. The never-before-used method of filming the racing scenes provides suspenseful cinematography, as well. It is a shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is not recognizing Ross's talent; if you ask me, Gary Ross definitely deserves to appear on the Best Director's nominee list. Nevertheless, Seabiscuit will mark the beginning of a great directorial career."

Jaws scared the water out of me. Star Wars gave me a sense of granduer. Raiders of the Lost Arc reminded me of A sense of adventure. Close Encounters of the Third Kind was just plain weird.<br/><br/>
Seabiscuit has all of the enjoyment of what I grew up with and it's much closer to what real people contend with.<br/><br/>It's a long story, a grand story about ""the lone plainsman"".<br/><br/>A story about a bicycle repairman who realized the American Dream.<br/><br/>How a fully literate prize fighter and horse jockey could only fully realize his potential in the saddle of the greatest horse who ever raced.<br/><br/>Horse trainers are the craftiest, most ornery and slickest beings to ever walk the earth.<br/><br/>Horse owners are best left out of important decisions and are only relied upon to deliver the tough ones.<br/><br/>Horse Jockeys were the bravest souls ever asked to deliver so much reward for so little personal gain.<br/><br/>Such was the times and Laura Hillenbrand's book delivers a long turn around a wide story. The movie strives to deliver the beating heart of a particular racehorse who ran into and right through the lives of millions of Americans. It is in this effort that it succeeds brilliantly.<br/><br/>This movie is the story of a select group of people and horses who came together at the right moment in time to prove to everyone that most people don't know crap about horse racing.<br/><br/>It is worth seeing because the actors involved delivered perhaps the finest ensemble performance of Oscar quality acting in film history.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges is the quintessential actor. His performance as Charles Howard is stunning. Chris Cooper's portrayal of Tom Smith should be studied by actors everywhere for many years to come. Up against this kind of talent you might think that Tobey Maguire might seem a bit intimidated. That might have been the case if Mr. Maguire had not delivered a tour de force on the part of his character.<br/><br/>Here is the rare movie. Or I should say the rare story told well.<br/><br/>

"Bill-478","7","1","2","7 August 2003"," Lame
","I cannot tell how disappointed I am with this movie.  I guess I should have known better than depend on a film maker to interpret an excellent book and translate that to film.<br/><br/>I understand the book was written and presented in sort of a choppy way. But thats life.  Life doesn't necessarily happen in a good sequence for plot points.  The book was written to reflect that.  This is not necessarily some authors way of presenting a dramatic story.  The book was written in the way life presents drama.  The story was one of America.  Depressed, struggling to survive and trying to find its way.  Seabiscuit is a story that mirrors America's rise to prominence.  Down and out, suffering and lost, because of a strange coincidence of fate, his path crossed that of three people, who through different sets of circumstances were in the same state of life, depressed, struggling and trying to find their way.<br/><br/>I know the movie tried to present these ideas.  I know its there.  But it is just touched on.  The movie makers introduce it but don't give us reason to care.<br/><br/>You don't really understand that Red Pollard's family was relatively wealthy until they lost everything in the depression.  That he never saw his dad after he left.  You see him fighting and you see him ""breezing"" horses but you don't understand how important it was to him just for survival.<br/><br/>You do see Tom Smith ride up to and examine a barbed wire fence and you get the impression he recognizes the end of life as he knows it.  But you don't really understand how he became the horseman he was.  You don't see a lot of what he went through to learn how to heal lame horses.  And you never ever see his efforts to thwart the reporters and people who tried to spy on his training methods.<br/><br/>You do see C S Howard's son die but you don't realize what a toll it took on his life.  Sure the man was wealthy and extravagant but he also had loss in his life that was not represented well.<br/><br/>Then the match race with War Admiral.  The movie makers don't make you care that much about it.  You don't see what a rivalry they had.  You don't hear anything about WA winning horse of the year over Seabiscuit in 1937.  You get an impression of Howards' struggle to get the match race but you don't know how many times it was scheduled and called off for one reason or another.  Sure the race is filmed well but you just don't care.  You know Seabiscuit is special, you know he knows he is special but you don't see how his spirit and heart crushed the spirit and heart of the horses who, in the racing world, were so much more superior.  Never in the movie is it explained that when Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita in 1940, he was too old and carried too much weight.  Only that he carried a jockey with a bad leg. And now that I think about it, Seabiscuit always carried too much weight.<br/><br/>This movie was not a story of rising above expectations and conquering, it is a story of profit.  They probably could have used Shirley Temple again and told the same story.<br/><br/>The movie is good for passing time but not if you want to know the drama and what made Seabiscuit so special.  Watch the making of the movie and you'll find out more than you will by watching the movie."
"dadedo13","6","1","2","2 August 2003"," The Most Overrated ""Film"" of the Year
","When watching ""Seabiscuit"" one has to ask, ""Is this a movie or a documentary?""  Writer/Director Gary Ross painfully blends photos from the past and modern day imagery to create the jumbled mess which is Seabiscuit. This problem becomes obvious right from the beginning with the films opening narration.  At first, the narrator is somewhat interesting as he offers a background to the story.  However, as the narration becomes more and more used, its presence becomes more and more annoying.  Especially, as it draws emotion from other scenes because it interrupts the flow of the movie. Eventually it became laughable.  Yes, I know the film takes place during the Depression, but this fact does not need to be reiterated throughout the film by a narrator.  I got the point after the first five minutes.  The photos used throughout the film also become annoying.  The film builds up to the big race, but when it starts it breaks away to photos of people listening to the radio.  This was completely unnecessary.  The filmmakers didn't need to convince us that the public cared about Seabiscuit because we already know they did.  The film tries to show us how America was brought together over this horse, but it does a poor job at it. The film is paced very bad. Seabiscuit doesn't come into the picture for 45 minutes or so causing the movie to become very boring.  The film tried to take too many paths, making it unfocused and messy.  The movie is overly long and has trouble finding an ending.  The only plus to the film is the horse races.  Most of these were filmed very well and allowed for some emotion.  The acting was above average, but got lost in the problems of the film.  Overall, ""Seabiscuit"" is not an American classic by any means.  Just because your heart pounds a little during the big races cannot save the fact that the film fails in other categories.  ""Seabiscuit"" is not an 8/10, but more like a 5 or 6/10."
"The Movie Buff","7","1","2","30 July 2003"," War admiral, the evil horse
","I'll first start off by saying that this was a good movie.  The first 40 minutes were close to unwatchable because they were boring and pointless, but the movie took off after that and had me glued to the screen.  The footage during races was as close to the real thing as it gets. The camera work was amazing, though sometimes it changed angles too often in a race and made you dizzy.  Cooper, Bridges, and Tobey were all well cast and did a fine job, Cooper especially. Now as far as the factual events of this movie, how they painted War Admiral was a disgrace. I know they wanted to do this because they felt it would add to the legend of Seabiscuit and make it a better movie, but when its supposed to be a true story, at least tell it like a true story.  Seabiscuit was a great, courageous horse with the heart of a lion but this could have been told with painting War Admiral as the evil, overrated, heartless horse. First off, War Admiral was 15.2 hands, not over 18 hands like the movie tells.  The two horses were basically the same size. Seabiscuit, in fact outweighed the Admiral. Those are the facts that the movie got wrong. Next are the things they conveniently decided to leave out. In the movie, it appears that War Admiral is ducking Seabiscuit for months and refuses to race him.  What they don't tell is that twice before the match race, both horses were scheduled to race each other (once in a match race, the other in a stakes), and both times Seabiscuit was scratched by Howard. The first came in a $100k winner-take-all match race at belmont park on May 30th.  After arriving at belmont on April 25th, Seabiscuit didnt train well after the long cross country trip and was scratched. Next came the Massachusetts Handicap on June 29, in which both horses entered and were weighted at 130. It rained the day of the race, turning the track into mud so 45 minutes before the race, Seabiscuit was once again scratched.  The movie also forgot to mention that after the match race Riddle asked for a rematch in the nine-furlong Rhode Island Handicap  at Narragansett Park in which both horses were eligible for. However, Howard once again withdrew his horse because the rematch would be only 11 days after the match race. The movie paints War Admiral as this horse that was born with all the skills and never had to work because of his god given talent. They don't mention that he was smaller than most of the horses he faced. They don't mention that he routinely gave up 5-15 lbs to horses that were bigger and older than him.  They don't mention that in the Belmont Stakes, War Admiral ripped off an inch of his hoof at the start, then proceeded to run a mile and a half, leaving his rivals in the dust, and breaking the track record in the process.  The hoof injury was not discovered untill his trainer spotted him in the winners circle standing in a pool of blood.  Talk about heart. Riddle also got the short end of the stick.  It wasn't mentioned in the movie how graceful he was after the match race, offering no excuses, only asking for a rematch which was not granted by Howard. The movie told a great story and elevated Seabiscuit to warrior status but did a great injustice to War Admiral that will probably never be erased. From now on non-racing fans and casual fans of the sport will remember the War Admiral that was portrayed in the movie, not the one in this review, which was the real War Admiral."

","I could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.<br/><br/>It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.<br/><br/>Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the ""size 2 women"" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.<br/><br/>The Chicago tribune called this film ""sleek and beautiful."" I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers ""get"" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?<br/><br/>Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it?"

","I saw this film recently on a American channel that, like so many, has more commercials then program. Usually that bothers me but in this case the ads were more of a relief than anything else. ""Seabiscuit"" isn't as openly reactionary as ""Hidalgo"" but is just about as bad in most other respects. Some commentators seemed to believe,yes, this a really bad movie that's nonetheless ""okay"" for people who happen to like horses. I don't understand why this should follow. I think of myself as one of the latter and it is for this reason I find this thing particularly annoying. Horse racing is not an especially noble enterprise although the facts aren't quite as bad as in decades past. Here some improvements are spin offs from the positive actions of individual owners and the general public (California's proposition 6 in 1998) not due to any help from Hollywood. The film industry seems to be on a crusade to inflict the ""Disney"" disease on almost every public issue or personal interest (or so it seems at times) and the rest of us have to work hard to undo the damage so caused. Anyway,as others have noted,""Seabiscuit"" is the product of the counterfeit post 9-11 "" Who Are We"" outlook coming more from the tortured minds of the chattering classes then out of any real need for ""interior"" revaluation on the part of joe public."

Some of my major complaints:<br/><br/>The build-up is incredibly slow and underestimates the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>There are countless scenes that should have been edited away. What on earth is the scene with race cars leaving the barn doing in the movie?<br/><br/>The voice-over is silly.<br/><br/>The characters and their internal relationships are underdeveloped.<br/><br/>The race scenes lack a good overview. Further, every race scene is so similar to the other races they could have edited the race scenes in random order.<br/><br/>The fact that the jockeys have a nice chat (without even having to scream at each other) in the middle of the race is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>If you want to see a movie about the depression, watch ""Of mice and men"".

","I love a good true story and having read the book 'Seabiscuit' I looked forward to watching this. It didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Set in the American depression it follows a no-hope small horse with knobbly knee's and a very poor record who slowly and incredibly becomes a champion and with it a national hero. <br/><br/>This is an extremely well told story and the race scenes are truly magnificent and believable and it's hard to see how they could have been bettered. This is at times an incredibly sad story and at other times uplifting. In fact even though I have now seen it three times I found it more heartbreaking the third time than the first maybe because I am older and now have children. It is one of the rare films, for me anyway, that improves every time you watch it. So much so in fact that I have been compelled to recently upgrade it's score to a 10. <br/><br/>The acting is solid rather than spectacular though I thought Chris Cooper did a brilliant job as the trainer Tom Smith and Jeff Bridges is also very good as the owner of Seabiscuit. <br/><br/>This is a film that's all about the story and what a great story it is. In the wrong hands this could however have turned into a sentimental bit of schmaltz but thankfully this is a pitfall that director Gary Ross avoids. For a long film it rarely drags and every scene seems necessary.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit is a must watch film and one of the finest sporting films ever put to celluloid. An unbridled (forgive the pun) success."

","Sports movies are notorious for being...off the mark...when it comes to the action. Here is probably the best ever sports movie. Artistic licence is taken freely, but who cares when the star of the movie - Seabiscuit - is seen as he really was: a broken 3 year old colt with the knackery waiting for him. There are many true lessons to be learned from watching (and listening) to this movie. Give losers a second chance is the most important. The Chris Cooper character is what we would now call ""a horse whisperer"". He has an uncanny ability to get into the psyche of horses. When he sees a horse with lots of heart (like ""The Biscuit"") he knows it. Seabiscuit was small, but a warrior who never gave up. (yet another life lesson). The highlight of this excellent movie is when Seabiscuit has a match race with War Admiral...a blue blood and the best horse in America. Because of meticulous tactics worked out by Cooper (now the horses trainer) the small horse beats the giant War Admiral by 4 lengths. If you are a reader of my reviews ...you will know i write one paragraph reviews. I mean who wants a blow by blow account of a movie..??? You may feel you have seen the film...and decide not to watch it. Anyway this is a superior movie (not only for horse racing fans). I am sure anyone with heart will enjoy this."

","An overrated and overlong compilation of fluff about people following their dreams and coming out on top during the despairing days of the Depression. The non-actor Tobey Maguire is ineffective in making us feel anything for his lead character named Red, who is forsaken by his parents and tries to make it in the world by becoming a jockey. Red becomes fond of a lazy and temperamental horse called Seabiscuit, and then works to tame him and turn him into a winning racing stallion. Jeff Bridges fares a little better as a salesman who goes from bicycles to cars to placing stock in Seabiscuit. His second wife is played by Elizabeth Banks, who takes the prize of being the actor who can't convince me she isn't actually from the 21st century (there always seems to be at least one in these things). Chris Cooper plays the always-sunken trainer, whose tired and down trodden persona grates on me after awhile. For such an emotional subject, I found that I was not interested in any of these characters. I place that flaw at the feet of the actors and director Gary Ross.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or more are haphazardly shot and edited, so it's difficult to keep up with what's transpiring, as many people and situations are flashed about at frantic pace to establish some kind of set-up. I was just hoping a moment would come where we'd settle down and linger with the characters, or at least have one protracted sequence where we could relax and take it in. The sappiness of the story is pounded into our heads through a climactic feel-good score by Randy Newman, inappropriately placed just about everywhere instead of saved for the climax. ** out of ****"
"thomasgilmore1962","9","1","3","10 December 2012"," A underdog success story
","What a great movie about being a underdog and beating all the odds. The battle between David and Goliath is prevalent through out the movie. You have Seabiscuit who is a horse who has been treated bad his whole life and is a small horse, Tobey as Red Pollard who is too tall to be a jockey and has a short temper among other handicaps, Tom Smith played by Chris Cooper an aging horse trainer not sure of his place in the world, then you have Charles Howard played by Jeff Bridges, a wealthy self made man who has suffered through life with the depression. With all these handicaps as we all know in the end they still somehow pull through it and win. This takes place during a depression and everyone is suffering. With a assembly line mentality independent spirit is being crushed and people are looking for a distraction. These situations are what makes this movie come together. Jeff wants to add another revenue stream by investing in horse racing, hires Smith to train the horse and Pollard as the jokey and Smiths persistence has Howard purchase the ill-tempered horse seabiscuit. Even when Seabiscuit gains favor with fans in the west the elite east coast look at him as some cheap novelty. With the disdain the east shows the west becomes a huge spectacle and Howard tries to use this to compel Riddle to agree to a match. While we know what the ending if the director did a good job taking a almost forgotten part of our history and still makes it suspenseful to where you might not know how it will end. This becomes a representative of a underdogs hopes and trying to create dreams, War admiral being of champion breeding and creation of the assembly line thinking. Seabiscuit being the the little engine that could with a big heart. The father son bond that is created between Bridges and Maguire is something both struggling men need. What seems to be a constant is Coopers performance who won a best supporting actor, seems to do this in his sleep he is able to bring such a stoic quiet depth to the character. This period piece is done extremely well capturing the broken people trying to recover their dignity and pride with the landscape looking so bleak. The battles are not fought in the traditional sense on a battle field but with horses on a tract and is personified in full effect with this film. Some may pass on this movie because it seems too artsy to be entertaining or they will choose any new DVD coming out. This would be a mistake some of the race scenes are very intense and its as if it becomes a work of art in motion."

","Despite poetic license taken from Laura Hillenbrands' account of American history where a horse is a metaphor for the rebirth of a country, I can only praise this piece. Maybe this is due my being a sentimentalist, weak on The Great Depression facts or just a fan of all the great things that come together on the screen. The regal and nostalgia of horse racing, the simplicity of radio days and the glorious cinematography help show this wonderful story of three men and a horse that won't give up just cause he's down smartly interwoven by a narrated historical perspective. Tobey McGuire, Jeff Bridges & Chris Cooper all deliver corny dialog and we soak it up like we've waited for hours in a soup kitchen line."
"nell_ward","8","1","3","12 March 2012"," Like Gary's movies
","Everyone must agree that the three men behind the most famous horse of his time are played by three of the best actors Hollywood now has to offer. Critics are in accord in saying Cooper's performance is the subtlest and the most real: he models the principle that Less is More. Tobey McGuire isn't given quite enough to do; his greatest accomplishment may be his lean look; he's barely recognizable, and as a former redhead myself I don't think the dye job is as bad as some have claimed. Bridges is, in his way, magnificent, but glossily iconic and therefore somewhat opaque. His resemblance to Franklin D. Roosevelt is pushed a bit too hard, as is the whole uplifting populist message - the 'we didn't fix the horse. He fixed us - and we fixed each other,' and 'sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance,' stuff. (It's pretty corny. But within the context of this beautifully made movie that believes in itself, we buy it.) It's important, anyway - if young people do come to see Seabiscuit - for them to get the simplified, but nonetheless just portrait of the times provided with authentic stills and footage, and the voice-over narration by iconic historian David (""The Civil War"") McCullough. The travelogue of the Depression and Prohibition years includes a quiet but heartfelt plug for FDR and that, too, is moving, especially in today's post-Yuppie mood of numbingly exploitive jingoism.<br/><br/>Indeed each of the three actors gives a powerfully understated performance - they're like thoroughbreds who're never given their head - whose litotes (a word schoolboys learned back then) enhances the movie's epic quality by never letting us forget that their triumphs were snatched from deprivation and adversity."

Seabiscuit becomes a winner and legend in a difficult period of the American life. ""Seabiscuit"" is a beautiful film with positive and wonderful messages. Charles Howard has the best lines, such as: ""When the little guy doesn't know that he is little, he is capable of big things""; or, ""Sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance"". The excellent and underrated actor Chris Cooper has probably his best performance along his career. Although having 141 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel time passing.

"compi24","8","1","3","23 November 2011"," Review Of ""Seabiscuit""
","""Seabiscuit"" is a 2003 biographical period drama about one of the greatest and most notable horses in American Horseracing History. The movie follows the story of a wealthy man (Bridges) who hires an unconventional trainer (Cooper) during The Great Depression to help him find an appropriate horse to enter into the races. They soon stumble upon a young man (Maguire) that they soon choose to be their jockey. I truly enjoyed this movie - there's just so much to really appreciate about it. First off, and most noticeably, is the wonderful cast of characters here. I know this movie's title makes you think this film is just about the horse, but it's also about the truly remarkable people behind him. Tobey Maguire plays Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's jockey, and his performance in this movie is really quite compelling to see. His character's stubbornness is something that you'd think you'd hate, but it's actually something I, and probably most people will, find to be his most enjoyable trait. Ross also does a really effective job of drawing parallels between Pollard and Seabiscuit. This, in a sense, helps solidify the relationship between the two characters. Chris Cooper does a really fine job of playing the unorthodox, yet effective trainer, Tom Smith. However, my most favorite character in this movie is Charles Howard, played by Jeff Bridges. There's just something about a guy, who's been dealt a bad hand of cards trying to make the best of his life do something good for society. I think It's through Howard's character and Bridges magnificent performance that we really get to see what Seabiscuit's presence throughout the Depression really meant for the American people - he was a beacon of hope. The screenplay is incredibly well done, as I find many lines of this movie to be memorable and quotable. After watching the special features, I was really impressed by the intense amount of preparation and work that went into this movie. Nearly every race was historically choreographed and rehearsed, and it really helps you gain a sense that these are the actual events as they transpired. One of the only problems I have with this movie is the length. Nearly an hour of this movie is exposition and I feel that a good amount of it could've been cut out. Did that hinder my ability to enjoy this movie? No not really, so I won't knock this movie much at all. In the end, I felt that ""Seabiscuit"" was a great underdog sports film with a truly inspiring tone that sticks with you."

","A fine combination of personal stories, American folklore and old nationalistic fervor, that updates the strategy of a Frank Capra propagandistic melodrama of the 1940s with a stronger sense of realism, provided by the historical facts read by narrator David McCullough. In many instances, Randy Newman's score overdoes the sentimentality, but the strong characters of the three men –Seabiscuit's owner, trainer and jockey, respectively played (very well) by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire, sometimes even jeopardizing their rapport with us, the audience– resist trivialization. Fine support by players Gary Stevens, Michael Angarano, and Eddie Jones, but Elizabeth Banks does almost nothing in an underdeveloped role, and William H. Macy is just comic relief. Also good work by cinematographer John Schwartzman, and the art direction department."

In contrast though the photography and the editing are done to excellent standards, which the poster may seem to imply, and tend to be the strongholds of this film.<br/><br/>If you're one who puts a good deal of weight to the cinematography in your viewing experience then you will certainly enjoy this film, if not for the great story behind it."

There is a thesis in this picture: I learnt something interesting and thoughtful while watching and, while not suspenseful, I was kept glued right to the ending! Casting has an impressive collection of actors assembled as well -- This is, very possibly, Tobey Maguire's best picture as we see him both visually and emotionally as a very different person.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges plays a very rounded character, one of the three most central protagonists.<br/><br/>And, Chris Cooper does a surprising turn as the third member in this mix.<br/><br/>Add to this, William H.

The ""look"" of the film - costumes and sets - is perfect; but, as is often the case, everything is so well taken care of, it tends to have an opposite, inauthentic effect. So, don't look for any stained hats, or cigarette-burned lampshades.<br/><br/>The story beautifully captures the ""American Dream"", from the obvious symbolism connecting ""Seabiscuit"" to the rebirth of the United States under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to the thinnest of subtleties discernible in the characters' relationships. Mr. Ross knows when to fill in the blanks, and when to let you read between the lines. Prepare to be clichéd and sidetracked. It's all there. A son who is aimed for the moon dies in an automobile wreck, and is reborn on a horse. The struggle was real.

Tobey Maguire plays a crabby teenager who befriends an equally crabby horse. We do not much like either of them; I personally could have cared less what happened to them (like I gave a damn about the big final race). Now Bridges' character, I cared about, I didn't want anything bad to happen to him. Chris Cooper plays a horse-wranglin' cowboy who basically becomes Bridges' little horse assistant.<br/><br/>There is excellent acting here by Cooper and Bridges, but this movie seems to have been made by crusty old men.

I only wish now I had read the book BEFORE I saw this movie! I could of saved $3.50 for the rental and $19.99 for the cost to buy it. Being a history buff along with both an avid reader and movie fan, I know that Hollywood tends to bend the truth in 99% of all (based on true story movies) but this one is pure bull*hit. Sure Braveheart, King Arthur & Troy take liberties with the facts but in these cases the facts are not really facts but what little history has let trickle down thru the ages. In Seabiscuits case we DO have ALL the facts, thanks to the superb book by LH. Yet somehow Hollywood let screen writer/director Gary Ross completely butcher what could of been a truly GREAT movie. There are so many inaccuracies that I lost count before the movie was half over. Shame on Universal Pictures, Dreamworks & Spyglass for going for the money and ruining what could of been a truly accurate feel good movie.

It's watchable, but it's a weak, uninteresting story that is poorly plotted and has a low success rate at tying said story into its historical context, as hard as it tries. I can take films about underdogs once in a while, providing that they're well done, but Seabiscuit wins, what, a quarter of the way through the movie and then its rich sponsor (played by Jeff Bridges) pesters the even richer owner of the Triple Crown winner War Admiral until he finally gives in, lest he be annoyed any further. The only actors who do anything nearing a decent job are Tobey Maguire as Seabiscuit's down-and-out jockey and William H. Macy, who plays a radio sports broadcaster.

","I was lucky that I got to see this movie for free. If I had payed for it, I would have walked out and requested my money back. Everyone was saying that this movie, despite being a Summer flick, is going to be up for Oscar contention. Plus the Dude was in it! So I thought, after hearing and reading such good reviews that I should see it. When I walked into the theater, there was a man sprawled out on the 2nd row, lying across the seats. I laughed, but this foreshadowed the evening. The movie starts off in good documentary form with a solid narrator. But after that it took what seemed like an hour for the main characters to meet. I realize that this time was used for character development, but they did a poor job of developing the characters. I cared very little for them. The only time I felt bad was when Howard's son dies, but it was done so poorly and the pain Howard felt was never fully (if at all) addressed. The editor for this movie should be put on display for public ridicule. The was so much excess in Seabiscuit that I was dumbfounded. In addition, there were many loose ends that were never wrapped up...What happened to Red's parents? Did this horse really save the nation? I thought that was an angle that should have been looked at more by the director/writers. They mentioned that 40 million people tuned in to hear Seabiscuit's race...that is staggering for the 30s or 40s. That should have been played more into the storyline.  It was a long movie that could have been great. But the editor,writers, and director failed to give us a product that inspired me. When the credits roll, I shouldn't be laughing at how absurd the movie was. I see movies in the hopes of buying them when they are released on dvd. But when I got up from Seabiscuit, I was depressed at the fact that I had stayed awake until 1AM when I could have gotten a decent night's rest for work this morning. Seabiscuit did not hold my interest. It was decently acted, but there were no performances to talk about. The shining star may have been Young Red (the boy from Almost Famous) and his goodbye to his father. That was good acting. Despite that heartfelt moment, Seabiscuit did not reach the winner's circle."

The actress playing her did an admirable job in the beginning. Then her character also faded into the shadows of the ""jockey with issues."" There. 10 lines plus."

","It is important for me to note that I did not read the source material used as basis for this film, and a good film certainly does not rely on its audience to be familiar with its source material.  ""Seabiscuit"" exemplifies what happens when what appears to be fail-proof material is mishandled.<br/><br/>There are certainly problems when the ""documentary"" breaks appear more interesting and deep than the main story.  For starters, the photographs used to show the state of the nation while this inspiring real story was happening are excellent, but they don't support the ordeals and triumphs of the horse and its supporting cast.  They distract because they appear more relevant and concrete.  It is hard to care for any characters whose disabilities or personal tragedies are constantly pounded into our consciousness.  The overused use of symbols to show the grief of a father (watch those birds burst from the foliage), the rather strange romantic interlude to show the jockey's view of the world, and the unbearable sensitivity that he appears to have with his constant references to high literature; as if this makes the material and his nature more special.<br/><br/>Another thing that troubled me while watching the film is how the races are filmed.  It is mostly close ups, and badly framed ones.  When one sees the race, the excitement is derived from watching all its participants struggle with reaching the finish line (anyone remembers ""Ben Hur"".  There is constant cutting and the camera appears to be mounted on one of the horses (where's Steadycam when you need it?).<br/><br/>Not all is wasted in this film.  Jeff Bridges reacts the best he can to some of the situation, and his magnanimity is demonstrated over and over and over by a rather stale remark.  McGuire doesn't acquit himself too well, looking miscast and rather one-dimensional, but it is Chris Cooper's quiet and insightful approach that raises the film from a total waste of time.  If only anyone had approached him and consulted him as to how to deal with material to make it transcendental.  When he quietly explores with a look and ponders how to help the horse, one wonders at what could have been. Unfortunately, most of the time people are gawking and overreacting at the wonders of ""Seabiscuit"".  Yes, the movie tells us to scream and support the underdog, maybe a little too loud.  This film does not respect its audience, it's a bit condescending.  At first, it might seem like an important and touching tribute to an American survivor, but I'd rather watch a sequel that does not pretend to be anything else, but 2 hours of fun.  ""Seabiscuit"" could have been a contender in the world of the Silver Screen.  Maybe someone will remake it and get it right... next time."

I was hoping that this 129 minutes movie would show me more relationship between Seabiscuit and Red. Besides, the title is Seabiscuit. I was disappointed because Seabiscuit was screened like almost in the middle of the movie. That's why I was a bit bored in the beginning.<br/><br/>So later I know that Seabiscuit and any other characters do exist! Sorry... I thought they were all just fictional characters. Then I see why I have to see Howard's life much as well. I like him. I like how he started his business from zero to hero. That was amazing. Anyhow, I kind of disagree with how the movie made.

","Gary Ross's Seabiscuit (2003) tells the extraordinary true story of an undersized racehorse that lifts the spirit of all Americans during the Great Depression and while I was watching this movie I felt like I was alive during that time period. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's book called Seabiscuit: An American legend, though I didn't read the novel I felt like I did read it long before I saw this movie. The movie stars Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard the man who rode Seabiscuit through most races, and after his leg gets injured he is persistent to get back on the track and that is one of the most inspiring parts about the movie, another inspiring part of the movie is the supporting cast members performances mainly from Oscar winners Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges who make the film much better than I thought it out to be. Ross's direction for the film is just flawless and sometimes heartbreaking. Even though I have very little interest in horse racing this movie made me even more interested in the sport, and this movie counts as one of 2003's 10 best films."

He later remarries Marcela (Elizabeth Banks).<br/><br/>Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire/Michael Angarano) from a loving family is left behind to ride race horses as a child when his family couldn't hold together. He has to struggle to get through the cold world. Charles Howard decides to get into horse racing. He hires world weary trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper). Tom sees a small horse named Seabiscuit who has something in him. People have deemed him too small, too lazy, and left him to the trash heaps. In many ways, Red has also been left to the trash heaps and is angry for it.<br/><br/>It's an epic in its own way. It is old fashion but in a good way. It's uplifting. The sense of lost from the main characters are all well done. The acting is all great. Tobey Maguire is able to give voice to the pain that both he and the horse have felt over their lives. The story is so sincere that one must accept it or else. It's an underdog movie with feelings."

","Seabiscuit is a wonderful uplifting story how one single horse, named Seabiscuit changed the lives of many Americans who were suffering through the darkest period of American history: The Great Depression. This film is formatted as a sports story and in a way it is, but it is a character story and a story that show how good can triumph despite bad times. As one may expect, this film is a little saccharine at times, but there is no denying how this film will successfully play with your emotions.<br/><br/>Gary Ross's film, based on the bestseller by Laura Hillenbrand, tells the story on how the lives of a businessman, a trainer, and a jockey merge together to give Americans something to cheer about, and that is the talented horse named Seabiscuit who came out of nowhere to win the races that means so much to everyone.<br/><br/>The acting is really good thanks to the main three actors. Tobey Maguire does a great job as the young, hot-headed jockey whose horse is the only family he has got. Chris Cooper was very good as the weary horse trainer named Tom. Jeff Bridges was also excellent as the businessman who has grown wiser and kinder over time. William H. Macy was also entertaining as the quirky color commentator.<br/><br/>Overall, Seabiscuit is a moving story about the horse who defied all odds to become a standout in modern American history. It was dark times, and Seabiscuit only made thing brighter. The horse and his jockey, Red overcame obstacles to reach their high point and that is what makes this film so emotional. It's not a rags to rich kind of story, but it's similar to that. I rate this film 9/10."

","Watched this film mainly because of Gary Ross, who is a fantastic writer and director. He builds the relationships between characters like nobody else and in Seabiscuit he manages to capture the qualities of the people, their love for animals and beside that, a wonderful story about a horse. Also amazing performances all over, especially by Chris Cooper. A lovely drama full of twists and an awesome cinematography that brought many Academy Awards nominees, all were more than deserved and this is one of my favorite films of 2003, alongside Mystic River. I expected many more films from Gary Ross, he has an unique view over things and makes you friend and care for every character he creates, a gift that only some writers and director have, Gary Ross is one of them.

","Seabiscuit was nominated for 7 Academy Awards - with winning none of them. So was Shawshank Redemption, the other great film about hope I would like to compare Seabiscuit to. I remember when I left the theater from just watching Shawshank, I was so impressed, I uttered: Just cover these movie with awards! Well, we all know it came the other way. Every time I look up IMDb, I'm satisfied to see Shawshank on top, but where's Seabiscuit? Maybe it's due to his horse theme that this movie is not ranking comparably high.<br/><br/>I don't know the reasons why the Academy members decided in this way, but I do like the pace of both films, the bunch of characters, the narrator, the epic angle of the plot, the story and yes - the diligence the two movies are made with.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","1","7 October 2010"," A Second Chance To Live
","Gary Ross's 'Seabiscuit' is not typical sports movies. It does involve races and underdogs struggling to win but that's not what the movie's about. It's about second chances. All the key characters, Charles, Tom, Red and Seabiscuit have all lost something precious. Charles lost his son, Tom lost his job, Red lost his family and Seabiscuit lost himself. Since then they have struggled to survive until circumstances unite them. Now, with hard work, they have a second chance to win back a life of dignity.<br/><br/>'Seabiscuit' is beautifully shot. The cinematography and art direction are stunning. The lighting is very effective. The race sequences are gripping and energetic. The intense moments of drama are superb. For example the scene where Red's parents 'let him go' so that he can become a jockey. Ross also provides some subtle comic relief with correct timing.<br/><br/>The performances are nothing short of spellbinding. Jeff Bridges once again does an outstanding job with a restrained portrayal of Charles Howard. Cooper's minimalistic approach in playing Tom, a man who lost his job but never his passion for horses. Toby Maguire is superb as the fiery Red who aspires to be a jockey but has his own demons to deal with. Elizabeth Banks shines as she makes full use of her small role and William H. Macy is terrific.<br/><br/>Made on a large budget, unlike most summer blockbusters, there's nothing flashy and glossy about 'Seabiscuit'. Its subtlety is the strength. Subtlety in the layered story, in the way it's told, in the acting and in execution. At the same time it's beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>'Seabiscuit' is not only about second chances but it's about working hard to make that second chance rewarding. After their profound losses, Charles, Tom, Red and Seabiscuit were merely surviving until they discovered the opportunity to live. 'Seabiscuit' reminds us that passion and hard work pays off."

","I never thought that I would care about a movie about horse-racing. I saw this film by chance and I thought it was incredibly first rate and worthy of the Oscar nominations. Tobey McGuire is brilliant as is Jeff Bridges, the millionaire who loses his son in a car accident and his wife played by Valerie Mahoff in a divorce shortly later. The story about Seabiscuit is based on the true story about how America suffered through the Great Depression after the roaring 1920s. The film's art direction, costumes, and scenery is first rate. The narration by the wonderful David McCullough is somewhat appropriate but at times I felt that I was watching a documentary about the great depression which intrigued me more than the subject of horse-racing and how America survived the great depression. Tobey's character is an equestrian from a family who lost everything in the great depression. Before he would read Charles Dickens' classics with his parents and siblings at the dinner table, after the crash is where his parents made the ultimate sacrifice in leaving him with a man who owned a home and horse-racing."
"johnny-08","7","0","3","1 October 2007"," Wonderful story
","""Seabiscuit"" is wonderful story about horse who changed the lives of three totally different people. Seabiscuit is the name of the horse who was smaller then all the others racing horses. That was the reason why his owner often beat him and treat him badly. But three people saw something in this horse. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) and Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) are those people and all of them have their own reasons and stories. <br/><br/>Charles Howard had tragedy in his life. After he got rich on selling cars, his young son dies in car accident and soon his wife leaves him. Charles founds another woman in his life and her name is Marcela and she pulls Charles back to life. Then Charles decided to buy a horse. His name was Seabiscuit and after that never was same again. Of course Charles had too find a trainer and a jockey so Seabiscuit could race. Charles hires Tom Smith as coach and Red Pollard as jockey. Tom Smith is a man that spend all his life caring about horses but what he never had is opportunity to show how good horse trainer is he. Charles gave him that chance but that would never happen without Seabiscuit. The most complicated character is Red Pollard. His poor parents left him to another man so he can take care of young Red. But they never contacted him after that. That is shallow for me in this movie. Father and mother never contacted their loving son and I think that this scene should be added. Red also got chance to prove himself, just like Tom and that was very good shown to us.<br/><br/>Why this movie is good but not great to me? It's because of some ""deleted"" scenes (Red parents calling their son...) and mostly because of not convincing acting of Tobey Maguire. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and William H. Macy are great. So old school of actors did their job but young Maguire just couldn't do his. But even without Maguire's memorable role this movie is still very good and very warm story of life."

","I loved this movie! First off, I love movie's based on true stories, I love horses, and Tobey Maguire is one heck of an actor! To be honest, I've only seen him in the Spider-Man films and heard him in the Spider-Man games. He is Peter Parker and Spider-Man, and can't be replaced. The music was wonderful. The acting was unbelievably good. The story made a lot of sense. I only missed the first eighteen minutes of the film though. Oh well, it was still a great film. Reading about it on Focus On The Family, what kept it out of the winners circle was the use of God's name so many times. That crushed my spirit because I like Tobey, even though most of his films, (not including the Spider-Man films, and Seabiscuit) happen to be rated R. But, they showed it on FOX, and cleaned it up really well. Overall great movie. Spoiler: One actress in the film is Elizabeth Banks who coincedently played Betty Brant in the Spider-Man films along with Tobey. I though that was a real treat, especially considering Spidey 3 will be out this year. Tobey is hysterical and an absolute delight, he stole the show!"

","In the golden age of sports culminating in the late 30's, the three greatest athletes in 1938 were Joe Louis, Lou Gehrig and this ""small horse"" described by the narrator when he's first seen on screen.While there have been many outstanding films featuring animals in the title role (BIG RED, THE YEARLING, THE BLACK STALLION, to name a few), none have captured the era, the human characters and the four-legged star quite so well as in this warm and tender tale of the horse who ""fixed us, every one of us."" As a history buff, I'm distressed at how Gary Ross fixes the facts in this film, altering or deleting key elements. No mention in the film was made of Red Pollard's romance and subsequent 40-year marriage to the private nurse who cared for him in Boston while he recuperated from his leg injury. Ross admits that he changed the sugar cube given to Seabiscuit to an apple when he first meets Pollard, but he doesn't show the nudge of Red's shoulder which followed. Smith's training schemes could have been been detailed better, such as the use of an ""entourage"" of a cow pony, stray dog and spider monkey to help calm him.And the picture could have better explained how Red was blinded in a riding accident instead of an apparent boxing injury as this flick suggests. Perhaps Gary Ross made these changes to distinguish his work from the author's, to put his own personal stamp on the film. For all its faults, SEABISCUIT rates as one of the best feel-good movies of this or any other century. It truly deserves an honored place in any serious movie lover's film collection and is worth the effort to see it again on the big screen, as I recently did at my neighborhood Garland Theatre.

","I grew up in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s and even after 20 years, Seabiscuit remained a legend (horse racing was and remains a rather big deal on the East Coast and it is one thing I miss living on the West Coast). My grandfather saw the November 1 match race at Pimlico and he spoke of it often. George Woolf's ""So Long Charley"" comment was a commonly used cliché among the children my age. I'd like to clarify an important point: Seabiscuit was not a mustang. I own two mustangs and they are wonderful horses and make great friends but racing is not their strength (endurance, agility, quickness, heart, bravery, and intelligence are their greatest strengths). Seabisuit was a thoroughbred race horse but never looked it.<br/><br/>This movie is a horse lovers movie but the story is also compelling and should gain and hold the interest of anyone who enjoys historical narratives. The movie is based on the book ""Seabiscuit: An American Legend"" by Laura Hillenbrand (a wonderful book by the way) and although it frequently uses poetic license with facts it generally follows the threads of the book and historical reality. A few deviations from the book are worth noting: Howard was in San Francisco by 1906 and made a name for himself rescuing people using motor vehicles during the Great Earthquake. Red Pollard's family did not leave him with a horse owner but let him travel to race with a friend of the family. Pollard lost the sight in his right eye during a training race not a prize fight. There are other inconsistencies but none of them affect the quality and enjoyability of the movie, which focuses on the difficult times of the 1930s and how Seabiuscuit helped resurrect the self esteem and fortunes of those with whom he comes into contact. The elimination of the details is however unfortunate for anyone who enjoys such information but its inclusion certainly would have bogged down the movie and made for a less compelling plot line.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and Tobey McGuire give what are arguably the finest performances of their careers. The movie runs for 141 minutes but it never loses its pace. I challenge anyone to watch the final two races of this movie (the November 1 match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral and the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap and not be moved. Could the match race been made even more compelling? Some think it could have but I have watched hundreds of races and considering how brief they are, I cannot imagine how the director might have created greater excitement.<br/><br/>The movie ends abruptly after the Santa Anita ""Hundred Grander."" Seabiscuit lived out the rest of his relatively short life and Ridgewood Ranch just south of Willits off State Route 101 (the place remains open to the public and is sort a museum devoted to Seabiscuit). The horse died in 1947 at age 14 and his owner Charles died a few years later, many saw of a broken heart over the loss of his great horse. Blood-Horse magazine ranked Seabiscuit 25 out of the top 100 thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century (his grandsire, Man O' War, was #1 and War Admiral #13, Phar Lap 22, and Secretariat #2). I have am unfamiliar with award selection criteria but undoubtedly any list of this type represents arbitrary opinion."

"ray-280","10","0","1","24 August 2005"," Why so many love the track
","When I was very young, a long time ago, I bought a book called ""Come On, Seabiscuit!"" as a cheap, used paperback for a quarter. I was fascinated by the story then, and am just as fascinated by it now, as I am a lifelong horseplayer.<br/><br/>The lure of the racetrack is the potential, at any time, for the poor to rise above the rich, through merit, either at the betting windows or the owner's box. This movie focuses on the not-so-uncommon tale of a horse from the wrong side of the breeding shed to become a champion against all odds. For a movie based on facts from several generations ago, this one was more or less accurate, with a few liberties taken for the screen.<br/><br/>Seabiscuit, like his arch rival, War Admiral, was a grandson of the great Man O' War (the term ""upset"" in sports was coined after Man O' War's only career loss, to Upset, in the 1920 Travers). That is where the similarities end, however, as ""the Admiral"" was a majestic colt who was treated like royalty from the day he was born, while ""the Biscuit"" was all but abandoned as a serious racing prospect. Mistreated, he developed a temper that would later be focused towards glory on the track once he fell into the hands of owner Charles S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) and trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper).<br/><br/>As often happens when a horse hits a new barn, the new connections solved Seabiscuit's problems, and he did what I call ""presenting as a new animal"" once under their care. Like any former claimer turned stakes horse, Seabiscuit had to prove himself at every turn, but neither he, his jockey, or his owner and trainer, ever gave up. Everyone, including the horse, had their flaws, but they also had a key ingredient to the success story that would become this movie. Seabiscuit really was purchased for a rock-bottom price ($2,000 or $2,500), and once he was given a chance to develop properly, (he had been entered in several claiming races at the age of twenty months), he rose to the greatest heights of the sport. Once there, however, War Admiral was waiting for him, and the public remained unconvinced, as the odds in their match race showed.<br/><br/>The movie reminds us that most great things are accomplished by ordinary, even flawed, individuals, for we would never do anything great if we sat around waiting to become perfect before we tried. Even if our lives are in a shambles, the horses still have to be trained and ridden, and the bills still have to be paid. The star of the movie, the horse, just does what he does best and leaves it to his handlers to put it to use. All he demands in return is good food, a nice place to sleep, and some four-legged friends. To think that horses are not intelligent enough to figure out what is asked of them at the track is naive. Like all of nature's creatures, they are competitive, and they race even in the wild. Seabiscuit was a horse who enjoyed racing once he learned how to win, and who trusted his jockey implicitly once he found the right one.<br/><br/>Some trivia about the movie: <br/><br/>1. The match race was scheduled for the ""first day in November, at Pimlico Race Course, when the track is fast and dry."" War Admiral's connections refused to run on a wet track. (When the movie was released, Pimlico held a reenactment of the race in a driving rainstorm).<br/><br/>2. In the training sequence for the match race, Smith did not brush Seabiscuit's flank with a crop, but instead rode the horse himself and kicked him with spurs until the sound of the bell by itself caused Seabiscuit to jump into flight.<br/><br/>3. Pollard had recovered from his injury two months prior to the Santa Anita Derby rather than a few weeks, but it was true that his leg was questionable and that he was very vulnerable to injury.<br/><br/>4. The horses who portrayed Seabiscuit and War Admiral were California-based ex-claiming horses who were (IIRC) 11 and 6 years old. Neither horse would have run within a mile of the characters they played.<br/><br/>5. Pollard had taught Seabiscuit to stop whenever he said ""Whoa,"" but he could not tell Georgie Woolf (Gary Stevens) this before the match race, as it would have ruined Seabiscuit's chances in future races.<br/><br/>This was an excellent story that was well-done as a movie. Stevens was excellent as Woolf, and appeared more like an actor playing a jockey than a jockey attempting to act."

Seabiscuit was a smallish thoroughbred that would become one of the most remembered racehorses. A string of race track triumphs made possible for a down trodden populace to look forward to taking advantage any second chance. The beloved Seabiscuit would take part in the ""race of the century"" against the mighty War Admiral. Following a career ending injury, the horse of hope is groomed back to health to win again. There is a certain pride coming from behind to win.<br/><br/>Tobey Macguire aptly plays the astute jockey Red Pollard. Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, the horse's proud owner.

"philip_vanderveken","8","0","1","8 June 2005"," Not the average Hollywood movie, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good.
","People have always had a need for heroes, especially in times of crisis like for instance during the Depression in the late 1920's and early 1930's. And when their heroes are someone they can identify themselves with, than the bond between them and their idols is even bigger. But what if those heroes are a horse and the people that take care of it? It doesn't really make a difference as this movie, based on a true story, proves. <br/><br/>""Seabiscuit"" is a story of three men and a horse that haven't had a lot of luck in life. Charles Howard is a wealthy self-made man and a natural salesman, but he has suffered both personal and financial loss through the Depression. Tom Smith is an aging horse trainer, unsure of his place in the world, but loyally taking care of the animals that he has always loved. Red Pollard, abandoned by his parents as a child, is a short-tempered and half-blind ex-prizefighter who will be the jockey and Seabiscuit is an undersized mustang who has been mistreated his whole life. These aren't exactly the ones that you would choose to make a winning team with, but together they are unbeatable. And as soon as they start winning one race after the other, they become the most popular combination on the race tracks and the inspiration for the entire country...<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was the fact that it took its time to develop all the characters. Some will say that it was boring to get all that information about the characters, before the actual racing sequences began, but in my opinion it really helped to understand why these men and that horse were so keen on winning and why their performance was so special. They've climbed from great depths to incredible heights, but when you don't get to see from where they once came, you'll not be able to fully understand what a magnificent performance that actually was. <br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie was that it was spectacular in an old-fashioned way. For once they didn't need big explosions or some gigantic car chases to make it all look good. The most spectacular part of the movie are the races themselves, but they do their job well. This 'old-fashioned' feeling can also be felt in the use of sepia colored images, the 1930's 'radio' voice for the narration, the costumes, the cars,... It all gives you that feeling that you are in the 1930's and not at the present day. But not only that 'nostalgic' feeling is worth mentioning, so are the performances of the different actors. When it comes to their performances, it is very hard to say which one was the best. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire all fit very well in their roles, that seem to be written especially for them. I guess it all will depends on nothing else but personal preferences when you have to choose one of them, because in my opinion no-one of them deserves to be called the lesser of the three. <br/><br/>Anyway, despite the fact that this movie will probably not be seen by many people, because it isn't the typical Hollywood blockbuster or the average thriller, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth to be seen. Sure, it is only about sports and to make things worse, only about horse racing, but perhaps you should give it a try anyway. And even when you are a non-American, you'll probably like it. Yes, you could call this movie some fake patriotic American flag-waving, showing to the world how good they were and are at conquering all their problems and difficulties and no, most of us don't like that at all (including me), but I'm sure it will surprise you, just like it did with me. This movie has a lot more to offer and I really liked it a lot. That's why I give it at least a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10."

They are not complete but they did have a sense of love and foregiveness for one another. Listen up homeschool mothers...This is a movie that could be legitimately used as an educational tool to teach psychology, US History and Sports...this movie does demonstrate a good use of the ""fruit of the Spirit"" but unfortunately without giving God any credit...CAUTION...there is one scene with partial nudity (a prostitutes back)...but at least it was not gratuitous...however, it could have been shot with just the woman's voice and not actually have shown her. It was an attempt by the writers to explain how naive the hero is...He is so naive he hopes his prostitute friend won't want the money...Wrong...but a good example of how easily man's nature deceives us, when going in the wrong direction. With the exception of the prostitute scene I would let my 9 year old son watch this movie...and we are very protective. There are some so called family movie's we won't allow.

","This award winning film ""Seabiscuit"" is based on a true story in the 1920s during the Great Depression. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a dirt, poor man who repaired bikes for a living before he built automobiles. He becomes wealthy and buys a house with a horse stable in the back yard--when the stock market crashes. A boy named Red (Tobey Maguire) gains a job taking care of horses for a wealthy man. Red's family believes it is in his best interest to move in with the man. Charles wants to buy a racehorse, but he first needs to find a trainer, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and a jockey (Red). Charles buys an undersized horse named Seabiscuit who surprises the whole nation by wining race after race. Seabiscuit challenges War Emerald to a match race, the biggest sporting event ever. An accident causes Red to lose the pride of being a jockey for the rest of his life. Seabiscuit becomes lame just one race after the big match, causing the loss of his racing career. Director Gary Ross's intentions during this movie were to create a parallel between the American people and Seabiscuit. The people are suffering due to the Depression and the under dog Seabiscuit gives them hope. Seabiscuit never gives up even when life beats him. He still continues to race instead turning around and heading home. The American people must still keep fighting and never give up. Miracles can happen--just have the will power to make them happen. The critical techniques in the film which capture my interest include the back in forth picture from the present day color screen to the black and white screen pictures taken at the actual setting while the event was happening. Another is the way the suspense builds up until the viewer cannot wait to see what happens next. There is always something building up in the movie and sometimes I did not realize it until it happens. This is a breathtaking film that leaves me with an incredible feeling of achievement."

This later making him a little and slim jockey, he starts riding horses crazy and soon gets popular.

Beautiful acting and very nice directing adds a lots of nice overall feelings about this movie. Making a movie about horse-riding and stuff may not seem very entertaining, but this movie really had me on the edge of my chair, especially at the end though. It's exciting, it's catchy with its ambitious ways of twisting together raw horse-power and fine emotional pieces. Maguire does a good job, but it is Cooper and Bridges that's really fabulous watching, and there's a small character played wonderful by William H. Macy. SEABISCUIT may not be very original in many ways, but it does everything right as the drama motion picture it is. It doesn't fail, ever! But; getting into the movie is another thing, it's a sort of ""heavy"" movie. You don't sit down every Staurday Night to watch this movie for entertainment, but that I neither had expected. It's pure drama, and it's got about everything it needs except; the little magical influence. It never reached me and that made me sitting there with the feeling that I just had seen this movie, nothing more sort of.

","I'm surprised to see that this hit from the summer was able to make it to the Best Picture nominees. More of a great epic than a great movie. But the biggest surprise was that it was released in the summer and actually made it.<br/><br/>I've said before back in the summertime that it was a very good story of an against-all-odds claim to greatness as well it was nice to see it as a slice of American history as well. The script was very good, but there were a few times in which I felt it was too much more like a biography than a movie. I have no problem with story telling or narration in a movie as long as it's given just the right amount. And this one I felt there was more than necessary at times. Nevertheless it was still entertaining and thrilling. The camera angles of some shots added to it and put you into the race. The acting was very good although nothing was too standout-ish.<br/><br/>
One thing about this movie. Critics in entertainment normally trash escapist stuff or 'escapist froth': whether it be music, movies or television. But one thing this movie teaches is the value of escapism through this horse. Seabiscuit came around the time of the depression and almost all of America was down and out. But once Seabiscuit won and won big America came back to life. It's ridiculous to say the horse ended the depression but he did make people forget their problems and gave them something to cheer for. Sometimes a little pick-me-up is all people need. And escapism has been known to work, like in the late-70's disco music and Star Wars helped pick a disheartened America up after the Watergate scandal and the heartbreak of Vietnam. Whether a pick-me-up situation like this would work now, I'm a bit skeptical but it is possible.<br/><br/>I'll admit that there were times the movie was a little too feelgood-ish but it was still well-done. And goes to show how a little sentimentality can go a long way."

Well told by accomplished writer and director Gary Ross with a fine cast of Cooper, Bridges and Maguire in no particular order each contributing a piece, a bit slow, a bit inevitable, a bit didactic with all those narrator talking over pictures of the Depression Era - now I wonder what that was about ? obviously not didactic enough! Anyway the Marx brothers made a tribute film at the end of the 1930's called ""a day at the races"" and the horse featured was a certain Teabiscuit.

","""Seabiscuit"" has the worst-managed soundtrack of all time. This movie cuts back and forth frequently between whisper-quiet dialog scenes and jarringly loud action scenes. It's almost as if they intended to shock you with the sudden barrage of noise. Just as you adjust the volume level to hear the muted dialog of a quiet scene, suddenly you are assaulted by a blast of noise. Then, just as you adjust the volume again to make that sound level tolerable, back they go to a quiet dialog scene and the volume is too low to hear. This happens over and over again during the movie. It spoils any enjoyment you might have gotten from this movie. Compare this botched soundtrack with a well-made one, such as that in ""Out of Africa,"" where every word is clearly distinguishable, while the louder scenes are well-modulated and flow smoothly from the quiet ones. Whoever edited the sound of ""Seabiscuit"" needs to go back to film school, and this time don't skip out on those audio classes. ""Seabiscuit"" has the most amateurish hatchet job of any soundtrack I have ever heard in my 44 years of watching movies.

No. maybe the real life events were not EXACTLY as they were on screen, maybe certain things were given a bit more-(sugarcoating) and that is precisely why I said if this were not a true story I could imagine it being called :intentionally sappy etc etc.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is the plot IS based in reality and :WARNING SPOILERS COMING UP NOW!<br/><br/>The fact is that this ended on a good note because thats how the real story ended-unless there is something I don't know. Hollywood makes many movies about real life events that DON'T have happy endings-because they didn't in real life. This one had a happy ending because that's how the story of Sea Biscuit played out in reality. It pulls at your heartstrings but so what-the story IS incredible and is a great great story to make into a movie. And it is so easy to love Sea Biscuit, that tough little horse that changed so many lives and gave inspiration and hope. In addition the cinematography was lush and lovely and I was amazed by how real the horse racing sequences were, and how incredibly they were filmed. I never had an interest before in Horse Racing but the film pulls you in with it and gets you excited-the ending is one of the most richly satisfying I've ever seen, due a lot to the truth behind it and I don't think the ending was as Hollywood as people say-there was no racing to the finish line and hugs all around as people raced out of their seats and the news was swept all over the radio... etc etc etc. The camera just sort of fades out-with the audience knowing how it turns out. That was well done and CLASSY.<br/><br/>The acting was wonderful as well, especially Toby Mguire who really SHOULD get an academy award nomination for this. The beginning does drag a bit, Sea Biscuit doesn't even make his first appearance until about 45-60 minutes into the film-stay with it! You won't be sorry you did.<br/><br/>The best scenes, other then The horse racing of coarse were the scenes of bonding between Sea Biscuit and Toby Mguire. Everyone has hurdles in life and everyone gets banged around a bit by the quirks of fate. Sometimes, hope and inspiration are found in unusual and wonderful places. And that is what makes the story of Sea Biscuit so wonderful."

","For me seabiscuit was a perfect 10.  Not for the acting, the characters, the plot or even the story.  But for the spirit of the movie, the characters and the story.  Seabiscuit was a beaten losing horse as was the jockey, the trainer and the owner even.  But despite this, the spirit to win, to overcome shows through and they all succeed.<br/><br/>Another reason is I have 2 rescued racing greyhounds, one we have is a loving dog, and always loves everyone.  The other, ""mack"" was a lot like seabiscuit.  He was beaten, his spirit broken.  100 pounds of race dog with a broken heart.  He was scared of everything.  But we took him in, and over the years he has overcome all of that to be the best dog a man could ask for.  I have seen him do things that I would have bet he would never do. I know this is a dog that would die for me if he had to but yet be scared the whole time.  He hates water, but if I go to the lake he shakes out of fear, but still comes to be with me.  I just hold him then take him back to the beach.<br/><br/>This is why I think seabiscuit is a 10.  It lets us see those things and people around us and the achievements we can make if we just try.<br/><br/>So this is for my dog Mack, and the spirit that lives in him that brings Seabiscuit to life every time I see him"

","You know what I hate? Those cheesy reenactments they always put on television documentaries. You know, the kind where the narrator explains what's happening and we see bad actors trying to do the same on-screen. That's exactly what ""Seabiscuit"" feels like -- a two and a half hour cheesy reenactment. In fact, it's even narrated by David McCullough, who ironically did the same for Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"" -- only that was a documentary. ""Seabiscuit"" is...well...not.<br/><br/>I expected something really epic going into ""Seabiscuit,"" something strong and powerful. ""Seabiscuit"" is neither. It is a very, very corny movie, and very, very cheesy. I don't care if it's based on a true story or not -- ""Seabiscuit"" should be chopped into brisket.<br/><br/>I may sound ignorant. I'm not. I went into this movie with extreme optimism, and a quarter of the way through I rested my face in my hand and sighed. Yep, it was a stinker. (The film, that is.) ""Seabiscuit"" will be on a lot of critics' Top Ten of 2003 lists. It's going to be on my Worst of the Year list -- right next to ""Gods and Generals,"" right where it belongs.<br/><br/>Do you want to really know what's wrong with ""Seabiscuit""? It's as dysfunctional as the horse himself. You see, the film opens with McCullough's narration and b & w photographs from the Depression-era. It worked. But as soon as the film started to sink into the character introductions, it completely failed.<br/><br/>First, we have Jeff Bridges as a lowly worker who strikes big when he becomes a car salesman -- Henry Ford's automobiles were just starting to become the preferred route of travel, and so obviously there was big business for them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a young kid nicknamed Red is dropped off by his parents to live with some rich folk who will let him do what he does best: ride horses. Six years later, he has transformed into Tobey Maguire (a.k.a. Peter Parker), fit with red hair and everything, and he's getting beaten to a bloody pulp in boxing matches and walking around horses for low pay.<br/><br/>The best character, and just about the only likable one, is Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a horse whisperer who is confident that he can fix horses that may otherwise be put down. And so naturally, when he first sees Seabiscuit 1/3 of the way through the film, he fixes up the lazy horse into a warrior.<br/><br/>It's been done before in every single underdog film out there. This movie would have been shrugged off, if not for the fact that it is ""inspired by a true story."" That doesn't mean it should have been made into a film. In fact, if they were going to make it into a film, they should have at least managed to provide a sense of realism. There's nothing real here. It's based on a real story with real race outcomes, but everything -- including the cheesy introductions -- is incredibly mediocre Hallmark Hall of Fame-type stuff that you would expect to be in a daytime soap opera. In fact, if this were a daytime soap opera film, I'd praise it for all it's worth. But it's not. This is a whopping two and a half hour motion picture with absolutely nothing memorable whatsoever.<br/><br/>The problem is, though it may be a true story, all film has to take a few creative liberties along the way. ""Gods and Generals"" was good evidence that sometimes fact can be taken too far -- and despite the excitement of the Civil War, the said film didn't manage to transport the viewer there. I have no idea how correct ""Seabiscuit"" is, and for that reason alone I will not complain that it was too loosely based on facts or too strictly based on them. All I can say is that it's flawed.<br/><br/>I don't like when films change facts. But ""Seabiscuit"" could have used a few more creative liberties with its characters. Take Red, played by Maguire. He's incredibly unlikable -- I found myself wishing he'd fly into the guardrail along the side of the horse paddock he trains in. The film does everything it can to make him unlikable. And when it turns him into a brave hero, he gets up from the battle and insults those trying to help him.<br/><br/>
I realize that my review is making me sound pretty ignorant, but I'm fuming. I'm getting sick of this stupid Hollywood Oscar crap. Once and a while a rare motion picture gem comes along. 2002 was a great year for movies -- ""Road to Perdition,"" ""Signs,"" ""Adaptation,"" ""About Schmidt."" 2003, so far, isn't so good. And so after reading all the strong reviews on ""Seabiscuit,"" I had really expected it to be one of those gems. I was looking forward to it quite a bit.<br/><br/>Was it a gem? It wasn't. Not one little bit. Now, I know a lot of people liked it, I know a lot of people thought it was a welcome return to cheery feel-good movies (like they ever left?), I know a lot of people consider it one of the best films of the year, and you might, too. But ""Seabiscuit"" moved with such slow pacing, and when important plot points came the film completely skipped over them. (It takes its time introducing the characters, then suddenly throws them all together with the horse -- little explanation of how they all arrived upon the decision to train it.)<br/><br/>I'm adding ""Seabiscuit"" to my Worst of 2003 list because I despised everything about it. I know that sounds harsh, but the first thing I said when this movie ended was, ""What a horrible movie."" How could someone hate a movie like this with so much power? I don't know. I usually love these epic feel-good Oscar-targeted movies. I didn't love this one, though. And I'm not sure which is worse: My disappointment in the movie, or my disappointment in the fact that I found it so awful.<br/><br/>Peter Travers, from Rolling Stone, wrote: ""'Seabiscuit' is unabashedly hokey... Hipsters will be allergic; this is one for your inner sap."" I didn't like ""Seabiscuit"" because it was too sappy and too cheesy -- and I don't find myself to be a hipster. So I'll close with Travers' same statement. If you like hokey, sappy movies with corny feel-good moments inspired by true events but totally screwed up to make false uplifting moments...this one's for you. And I apologize in advance if I have offended anyone with my pessimistic views on this film. The end.<br/><br/>
1.5/5."

","I was disppointed with this rather sickly sweet film after reading the rather more interesting book by Laura Hillenbrand. However, I did enjoy the racing action and the sight of the irritating, syrupy-voiced Tobey Maguire being consistently punched in the head.  The book would have basically been fine as it stood, rather than being ""sexed up"" (""sicklified?"") Still, William H Macy made me laugh (a little), rather than his usual role of making me depressed, and the horse - or was it horses? - playing Seabiscuit were pretty impressive too.

"Ronin47","4","0","4","19 October 2003"," Boring, self-righteous Oscar bait (**)
","It's impossible to argue with the many people who will like this ultra-earnest, ultra-square true story about an undersized horse named ""Seabiscuit"" who ended up proving all the naysayers wrong and won Horse Of The Year back in 1938. It's a terrific, inspiring real-life story, it's well shot and has a great cast. The problem is, I just didn't get into it. Instead of being interested or inspired, I wound up just sleepy, especially with listening to David McCullough's bedtime-story narration.<br/><br/>
You definitely can't argue with the cast. Tobey Maguire, Chris Cooper, and Jeff Bridges all do nice work, but they don't do anything they haven't done in many movies before. Maguire as a smart kid with lots of inner turmoil, Cooper as the wise and benevolent guy to look up to, and Bridges as the over-confident but nice guy. They've all done this stuff before, and it all just feels kind of old, even if this particular story hasn't been told before. You can just hear everyone involved thinking ""Oh yeah, this is gonna get some Oscars"". <br/><br/>It's also hopelessly corny. Even though I almost always prefer at least a little grittiness in my movies, I do like apple-pie movies from time to time (""October Sky"" being an excellent example), but ""Seabiscuit"" just pushed the corniness too far for me. Maybe I'm cynical, but I was rolling my eyes half the time. <br/><br/>And whoever should have been there to tell the usually-great William H. Macy to rein in his annoying, gimmicky performance, wasn't."

","A period piece with an outstanding cast and what would seem to be an original plot, Seabiscuit, at first glance, appears to be a winner.  Who would have thought to make a modern production of a racehorse movie?<br/><br/>Well, appearances can be deceiving.<br/><br/>While I have few complaints about the actors or their roles, this movie is just another rehashing of the age-old sports movie about the underdog that somehow pulls through.  Is it great that the undersized horse and its oversized jockey wins?  Sure it is.  Is it wonderful that both of them overcome adversity and physical harm?  Absolutely.  Is it touching that a millionaire would take the financial risk to back what would otherwise seem to be a poor investment?  Of course.<br/><br/>Should an entire movie have been produced on the subject?  Nah. . .  A documentary, which would have forgone the typical overdramatisation and unlikely empathy of the characters, would have been much more entertaining, if not a more appropriate medium to tell the story.<br/><br/>In movie form, Seabiscuit is little more than the same story about the disadvantaged athlete that somehow overcomes all odds to be the best at what he or she does.  While one might be inclined to take the humanity of the story into account-- the disenfranchised jockey who seems to bloom with his ride-- the tale robs even that aspect from the audience by changing the rider near the end of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is about a horse who runs around in circles really, really quickly.  Really. . .  who cares?"

"howard.schumann","Null","0","1","1 September 2003"," Crowd pleasing entertainment that falls short of greatness
","I like anomalies, the things in life that do not fit, the assumptions that can be overturned. That is why I often root for the underdog in sports and why I am drawn to films like Seabiscuit, a film about a horse with a fighting spirit that brought three unlikely friends together to pick up the pieces of their lives. Written and directed by Gary Ross and based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand, the film chronicles the career of  Seabiscuit, the racehorse who rose from obscurity to capture the hearts of millions of Depression-weary Americans during the 1930s. I didn't go into the theater expecting a great movie and I didn't get one, but I did get what I wanted -- outstanding performances, an involving story, and a moving message about second chances in life. <br/><br/>As the film opens, the lives of owner Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) are introduced. Howard is a bicycle shop owner in California who becomes the owner of the largest Buick dealership in the West. A family tragedy and a subsequent divorce, however, leave him without the will to go on. Tom Smith is a laconic ex-cowboy and trainer who has a unique way with horses. The third piece to the puzzle is part-time jockey and prize fighter John ""Red"" As an adolescent, Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is cut off from his family in Canada and forced to make his way as a journeyman jockey and boxer. The director explains, `Red lost his family, Howard lost a son and Smith lost his way of life. How do you transcend that kind of pain, overcome the grief?"" By the second hour, they have come together to play out their joint destiny<br/><br/>Pollard conceals his blindness in one eye to ride a small colt named Seabiscuit, bought in Mexico by Howard with Smith's guidance. The horse is a grandson of the great Man 'O War but is considered lazy and difficult to manage. Under Smith's training and Pollard's assistance, the horse begins to realize his potential. Seabiscuit goes on to run in the Santa Anita Derby three times as well as competing in a match race with the Triple Crown winner War Admiral, owned by a wealthy eastern aristocrat. This is the race that captured people's imagination and allowed them to root for the democratic choice, the underdog like themselves. The camerawork makes us feel as if we are part of the action, riding along with the jockeys, listening to the thundering hooves. <br/><br/>While Seabiscuit is genuinely crowd-pleasing entertainment and I truly enjoyed it, it falls short of the greatness some critics claim for it. The characters lack dimension and the film takes too many liberties with the facts, for example, Smith had been working with racehorses for many years and Pollard had won 53 races on 300 mounts before Seabiscuit. Also, the film's feel-good messages such as ""relief made men feel like men again"" sound hollow after numerous repetition. Perhaps the wasteland of contemporary Hollywood cinema has made us grasp onto anything that is a cut above the average, but I feel that it has been over-praised. Yet Seabiscuit does give us something to cheer about and, with outstanding performances from the three leads and an off-the-wall comic performance by William H. Macy as radio announcer Tick-Tock McGlaughlin, it crosses the finish line far ahead of the summer pack."

","The time was never more ripe for a saga of a never say die group of individuals who all rise Phoenix-like from desperation to find glory. And the bulk of it is true. David McCullough of ""American Masters"" provides the Depression era context for the tale and the film is less concerned with the horse than it is with redemption. Seabiscuit is the catalyst for three forlorn individuals - already beaten up with the hand life has given them - to find the strength and the will to persevere.<br/><br/>As with its characters, the film transcends the literacy and monetary boundaries of the classes, it may appear to have the clichés of the typical sports movie but it does go much deeper than that as its athlete is not human. Thus it is forced to concentrate on its human characters, which is why it takes so long for the horse to appear. He's only the cog, it's the jockey, trainer and owner who are the spokes. <br/><br/>Whatever clichés it may have are only there because the greater part of the film is true - it can't be helped that David beats Goliath - history has already written this tale. <br/><br/>A bit of note for those who find trivia interesting - in the depiction of the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, the two jockeys involved are played by real-life jockeys, with Gary Stevens as George Woolf, Seabiscuit's replacement rider, and Chris McCarron as Charley Kurtsinger, War Admiral's jockey. For one who loves both thoroughbreds and film, this was a double bonus. The sports needs more representation on screen, that we waited this long for one of this quality was worth it."

Excellent adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's best seller about the Depression era racehorse legend by filmmaker Gary Ross embodies the era's hopes and dreams on a dark horse' of a contender in the sport focusing on three disparate (and desperate) men who found themselves (and saved one another) from one form of self-destruction or another: Maguire as the beleaguered jockey Red Pollard facing emotional and physical demons champions the film at redemption as does Bridges as the nag's owner Charles Howard, a self-made business success who more-or-less adopts Pollard after the tragic loss of his young son and finally Cooper as the aging cowpoke/trainer/horse whisperer who finds the true beauty in the beast (and perhaps a final moment of glory).

The cinematography was quite good and to my knowledge the only effective filming of horse races in movies. The fact that the story really happened as portrayed needs to be emphasized because, quite frankly, otherwise it looks like something that Hollywood dreamed up. The book is a better source for all of the details of the story but the movie is effective as only film can be in bringing the viewer an actual image.  A very fine book and a very good movie. The best movie I've come across in  quite a few years. Saving Private Ryan tried to be realistic, but when the plot is considered, it's an inane film that portrays D-Day in a way quite contrary to the facts.
