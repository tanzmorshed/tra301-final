"kamran_3012","9","52","73","29 September 2016"," The first half proves why Neeraj Pandey is one of the Best Directors in the country.
","""Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final."" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema."
"itzzjoy","9","27","37","30 September 2016"," An Indisputable Effort By Sushant Singh Rajput
","MS DHONI : THE UNTOLD STORY! AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT BY SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop for a few moments! And they have not been wrong. I'm not highlighting the plot in detail as I'm pretty much interested not to unfold the story line as many of you will go to watch it.<br/><br/>Let me talk about the best parts. First of all, Sushant's tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. Next Anupam Kher and Rajesh Sharma rightly have adjusted themselves to their spots. Herry Tangri (Yuvi) excellently has scaled himself with his character. Kiara Advani (Sakshi), Disha Patani(Priyanka) have given their best too. Well, now I must talk about the cinematography, here Santosh Thundiyil has done a brilliant job. Especially Dhoni's train capturing scene leaving his job and Dhoni's coming out of the dressing room scene during the World Cup (2011) Final help a lot to excel this film. Undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has. As a director Neeraj Pandey is of course successful but somewhere it has lacked a bit of his special touch. Though it doesn't matter because you will not find a single moment that can make you bore. The story has real gravity and it successfully has followed the tag line i.e ""The man you know... The journey you don't"". Truly it has focused on his journey- his struggle, ups and downs etc. The dialogues are very inspiring and heart-touching at many places. It is around 190mins' movie. You may think it's quite long but trust me after watching it you'll think if it could be of 5 hours that would have been perfect.... Even the Dhoni-haters can't deny that.. Actually there's so much to tell about. Anyway, let's come to the background sound... Truly effective though at some points it could have been better. Except that the editing has been done quite well but truly it's the place where it has lacked a bit. At few points it seems to be less glued... sudden turn of the movements and emotions is visible. And another important part is the story line which is of course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed. It would have been much more better if there's a bit more details about few facts like Wicket Keeping, Yuvi, Dressing Room situation after the WC2011 Final. But still it's fine as I have said earlier that it has focused more on Dhoni as a man.. especially his journey... Otherwise it is actually excellent... Or better to say super-excellent! And oh yes casting is just amazing.<br/><br/>So finally I would like to conclude like this. If you wish to watch it don't wait for the review just go for it. One thing I can assure you that you will not regret for a moment. But you may regret if you don't watch it or watch it by downloading from internet. If possible for you to spend some money please try that to give your respect to the hard works done by the cast and crew. I don't feel like giving marks to this movie as it may look disrespecting but taking it as a work of art I'm giving 9/10. Please don't listen to someone else if you feel like going then go...!!<br/><br/>P.S - I respect you, Sushant Singh Rajput... Your career is going to get a big hike after this. 'Excellent' is just a word for you.<br/><br/>Caution - You may find yourself in out-of-air-condition while the last scene happens, in spite of knowing the upcoming. ;) :)<br/><br/>N.B- If a second part of it comes out, I'll not be surprised. There are lot more facts deserve to get unfolded."
"anirudhgamer-53637","10","22","33","30 September 2016"," A magnificent movie of a Legend who is Magnum opus and an actor who portrays this Magnum opus on screen with an electrifying performance.
","I am a dhoni fan but this movie is beyond fans of dhoni or fans of cricket... For general audience this will be a movie that's not just a treat but also a complete package... Coming back to fans of cricket! This is India.. And we like to idolise legends... The very fact that we can see the demi-gods we worship on a 100mm screen is surreal. There are moments were the theatre here in Chennai goes berserk.. The kind of reception the demi- gods of Tamil cinema get! I completely had the feeling of a thalaivar movie ... Each aspect of dhoni's life brilliantly portrayed in a way respectable to the man and to his colleagues.The way the movie teaches us that hard work can only pave way to success is taken . congratulations to the whole team... It was an experience which cannot be worded in a 1000 words limit given by IMDb. For a movie to have an explosive climax the middle order is the setup point... That's y the director chose to pace the love scenes just around the interval and then the last scene where the earth shattering response is still being felt by me after 12 hours... A dedication to a Legend... The Demi God I shall say!"
"jay-techie2007","7","17","25","1 October 2016"," Great First Half but is Pretty Much Directionless After That
","M.S. Dhoni had a burden of expectations on it - not just because it is based on India's most beloved captain but also it had Neeraj Pandey as Director. The movie is well made but runs into too much of unnecessary stuff, especially in the second half. It is pretty much left on its own in the later part. Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions. <br/><br/>Story (7/10): The movie focused really well on the life of MSD before he became a household name. It focused a lot on the challenges, small town boys had been facing to get an entry into Indian cricket team about 10 years back when metro boys, especially Delhi and Mumbai, had a great influence on the team composition. What I also loved was the portrayal of Dhoni's work ethic - be it the scene of Yuvraj Singh or the booze. The first half of the story shows the tremendous amount of research done on the build up of MSD and the people involved in getting him into the Indian cricket team. Unfortunately, the story is left orphaned once it crosses that chapter. Too much focus on his love life was not just unnecessary but also slowed down the movie tremendously. I would have loved to see some focus on what exactly made him CAPTAIN COOL and at least some bits of behind the scenes portrayal of what happened in the dressing room in the 2011 WC Final. But the story just skips through that, which is a big let down. <br/><br/>Acting (10/10): Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. This would definitely go in as one of his best performances, arguably better than Byomkesh Bakshi. What I loved was the effort and the screen presence by the supporting cast - especially MSD's friend circle and also his school coach, played by Rajesh Sharma. The last time I saw such a level of presence by supporting cast was, perhaps, in Tanu Weds Manu series.<br/><br/>Direction (6/10): This was definitely below par performance of Neeraj Pandey, considering his reputation. While a lot of research and meticulousness went into the first half of the movie, it was equally misdirected and vague in the second half. The story pretty much ended at the point when MSD makes it into the Indian cricket team. I felt Neeraj Pandey tends to play safe and is compelled to add romance element irrespective of the movie genre, just like he did in Baby and Special 26 where, again, it wasn't required at all. And this is what takes down this movie. While three hours is pretty much expected in biopic movies, he didn't utilize it to the best. <br/><br/>Overall (7/10): It lives up to its tagline - The Untold Story - with some great research on the life of MSD in his early years but the movie just becomes directionless in the second half. But still, a good movie to watch, at least half of it."
"maulin5","9","14","22","1 October 2016"," So Far The Best Entertainer of this year
","After 3 films with Akshya Kumar as lead, Neeraj Pandey switched over to Sushant Singh Rajput and made this movie based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.<br/><br/>First of all, to make a biopic is not an easy job. As what the maker finds interesting, the person on which the biopic is happening may not! He wants something to show, but the maker is not convince with that. These are some basic differences. And after all this, a movie should be a true entertainer. So, the toughest part for the maker is to decide what to show & how to show. Because the maker has to give pure justice to the person's life without hurting his fans and followers.<br/><br/>Neeraj starts the film with the 2011 world cup final. And when Dhoni enters in the ground, Neeraj switches of to the flashback. From this point, the film picks up the speed. From the birth of Dhoni, to his schooling, to his relationship with his sister, to his caring mother & strict father, to his friendships, to his matches, to his practice, to his breakdown where he gets to know that he can't play Dulip Trophy, to his disregarding by selectors, to his job as a TC, to his hard work, to his self realization and getting into the train. Every single scene is running like a fast paced balling delivery. The 50% of the film is complete and than you realize that one hour and thirty minutes are over.<br/><br/>In post interval, love story starts with Ind-Pak series. Some beautiful tracks and little lighter moments are there in love segments. But as compare to the first half, this is not that much in speed. But you don't feel like boring. And than Sakshi's entry, Dhoni's marriage, and back to the first scene and completes the circle with winning six in the final of 2011 world cup.<br/><br/>Lyrics by Manoj Muntshir and Music by Amaal Malik are fantastic. Besabriyaan is my favorite along with the soulful track Kaun Tujhe. The entire album suits to the film. We have noticed in Neeraj's movie, that one background tune which has been constantly played throughout the film. In this movie too, one outstanding tune is there.<br/><br/>Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh & Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.<br/><br/>But the man, Sushant Singh Rajput is a true actor. After delivering a classic performance in last year's Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, he shines out this time too. As a lead, his dedication towards becoming Dhoni is fantastic. From gaining the weight as Dhoni to setting a hairstyle like him, he just delivered his best. His 150 days of cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes the ball with a helicopter shot. He is a real actor of today's generation.<br/><br/>Now, what to say about Neeraj! I love all his films. I've seen Baby and Special 26 more than 20 times. And I like this one too. So, whenever I'll get chance, will surely watch this again and again.<br/><br/>On the whole, after collecting 20cr on the first day, the movie will fly high at box office. Without any promotions on TV, without any major star casts, this film is doing well, and there are two reasons- Dhoni and Neeraj Pandey. Public is smart and they know on whom they can trust. So, just go and see the film. A pure entertainer of this year. Get inspiration from Dhoni's life and his hard-work.<br/><br/>And one more request, please cheer up the hall. As I've seen some snapchat videos where the hall is silent even on the winning stroke. I'm lucky that the hall where I went was so enthusiastic to see this film, that every single stoke of Dhoni or even Gambhir or Yuvraj got applause. Some glimpse of Sachin, Sehwag or any other cricketer also got appreciation by the audience. In my life, I've heard cheers on a six or four in the cinema-hall rather than a stadium. These things made my day. Best movie experience of this year so far.<br/><br/>By far, my most favorite biopic film is Bhag Milkha Bhag. And after that, I guess this film."
"brahmnoor","6","17","28","1 October 2016"," A Biopic Written by a MS Dhoni Fan
","As far as the story-line is concerned - this biopic feels like a MS Dhoni promotion. It just shows the positives of his life - leaves out all the controversies. In short - it feels like a biopic written by a MS Dhoni fan.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, the acting and direction are amazing. The cricket scenes feel real and you can feel the emotions. Yet, it does suffer due to bad editing. Some scenes are stretched too long, and the songs just drag the movie to the 3hr length.<br/><br/>Overall - it deserves 6/10 - for acting, direction, and lastly, for MS Dhoni!"
"dineshprakash","8","17","31","30 September 2016"," He has been impressing on field, now his story impresses on screen
","Director Mr. Neeraj Pandey work is very good. He chose the up to date way of narrating this story by designing continuous shots taking rather that choosing conventional and beaten way of long, mid and close . This new style was much needed for this sports drama film. This way you get the correct feel of on screen happenings but in starting half an hour camera work doesn't support director's vision well. It gets blurred while panning and soft while moving but after that it is almost good. Story is based on M.S.Dhoni real life so nothing to say about it. Screenplay by Director himself and Arun Jha is very good. They have never gone overboard or tried to dramatize the scenes unnecessary. There are so many cute and crisp scenes, like Dhoni talking on disconnected telephone and even this scene has a good culmination ahead. Another major plus point of this film is its unusual but sweet love scenes, like the intro of Priyanka, Dhoni first love interest, then intro of Sakshi, both scenes are too good. Sakshi talking to her roommate is also appropriate and cute, establishing and taking forward her character when Dhoni says that I knew you wouldn't come alone to meet me. This film has very strong emotional quotient too and after long time rain in emotional scenes didn't irritate me. Dialogues are very good. The way Khadagpur railway officer Mr. Ganguly, a very fine actor, describes aspects of life to Dhoni as reference of cricket is outstanding. Editing needs to be especially mentioned. Editor Mr Shree Narayan Singh has delivered a fine and seamless work. The way of blending the real footage and reel one is just amazing. Without showing all the stalwarts on screen you never feel that they are not present. All shots are so quick. Credit goes to Director too for his vision. Without taking any names in some disputed angle they ably make you understand everything. This film is full of performance surprises. Credit goes to casting director Vicky Sadana. Sushant Singh Rajput is mind blowing. You have to pay extra attention that he is not real Dhoni. He has not done this by imitating but adding fine dimension to his character so you think that if real one would be in this situation. He would have reacted in same way. Disha Patani as Priyanka is very endearing and acts well too. Kiara Advani as Sakshi is very good. She shines in an emotional scene. There are lots of great actors too. Anupam Kher (Father), Mother (good actress), Bhumika Chawla( Sister), Rajesh Sharma (Sports teacher Banerjee), Kumud Mishra (Coal mines officer), all are pitch perfect. Actors in role of his friends are also very good, like Kranti Prakash Jha as Santosh, Chittu shows his caliber in the scene when he conveys the sad news to Dhoni over phone. Actor who played Sardar ji is also perfect. Music by Amaal Mallik, goes well with film but lyrically all tracks are heavy. Manoj Muntanshir's lyric Like Mukhda 'Mal De Suraj Ke Munh Par Malai, Burbak Badal Par Kar De Chadhai', I liked it but Antra becomes preachy. I missed some simple lyrical melodious tracks, which scope was in film."

","First of all hats off to Niraj Pandey for selecting this story, as it inspires each and everyone who struggles in their life We all know dhoni as a successful cricketer, but if you want to know the reason behind his success, then this movie is must for you. Sushant shing has done a great job.<br/><br/>One of the best ever sports based films ever made. In fact, this film is not only about guts and glory, but dwells into topics much deeper than that. Neeraj Pandey delivers yet another masterpiece. <br/><br/>The duration of the movie is big let-down, and the director could have cut down on those unnecessary songs, which slow down the pace of the movie. The entire movie is capped off by a brilliant ending. <br/><br/>Sushant was absolutely brilliant and flawless in the movie, thus adding yet another feather to his already highly decorated cap. All the other actors too have played their parts. On the whole, this movie was not only an entertainer but also keeps you hooked to it for a good three hours. And rarely has a Bollywood movie been this good. Truly an inspiring movie... Hats off to the entire team for creating such a masterpiece !!!!"
"rajrad","8","15","28","30 September 2016"," Why to go and see MSDhoni - The Untold Story
","DHONI - The Guy and Within<br/><br/>A quiet winter morning, the sun barely able to make its presence felt through the haze. A small second floor flat in a building desperately asking for a makeover after the elapsed monsoons. A few pigeons eating out of the hands of a child hanging out in the balcony. This is a typical moment in the lives of millions who inhabit the so called 'small towns' in India. Yet, this was the start of a journey, for a person called Mahi.<br/><br/>An avid goal keeper in school, whose 'dodging the ball' skills were spotted and honed into a successful wicket keeper by his teacher. Every successful face has a story to say. Rarely do we get to know facets of people whom we idolize. M S Dhoni – The untold story, is an endeavor to try and unveil a few pages of his life and give a peek behind the face of Dhoni, into his heart and mind.<br/><br/>Many anecdotes we may know of and recall, but then so many we don't. Interesting to witness those. Not to forget all those who played such a vital role in shaping him as an individual, prodding him on as a sportsman and helping him groom and grow. The movie gives due credit to all those.<br/><br/>The movie tends to go back and forth a bit as if unable to choose whether to show his cricket prowess or peek into his personal life. Sushant Singh Rajput seems to have worked hard in impersonating him on field. And the ladies in his life showcased by two new faces have done a commendable job in this film. Am sure will be spotted by noted talent spotters after this. That's going out for Kiara Advani and Disha Patani. Wishing you'll the very best.<br/><br/>Anupam Kher, Rajesh Sharma (hehehe my name sake), Bhumika Chawla and others have done a good job. A good learning for all the kids. Perseverance, dedication and the will to succeed can get you places. And can make you who you are destined to be, not merely who you might choose to be.<br/><br/>Critical review of the movie am leaving to those who are best at it. Here are only highlighted reasons why you should see it. <br/><br/>Just 35 years of age. Yet so much to share. That's Mahi or Dhoni for you. Go see, feel, live a slice of his life, for that's what you will manage in about 3 hours when they try and capture a lifetime of experiences. <br/><br/>@rajrad"

Sushant Singh Rajput played tremendous match winning performance.He molded himself as middle class struggling young man to world conqueror. In first half, Neeraj has good grip on script but second half was slightly slow due to love stories and songs. Neeraj's favorite actor Anupam Kher was outstanding in the role of careful father. Anupam was part of each outing with Neeraj e.g. A Wednesday(Police commissioner), Special 26(P. K. Sharma) and last one Baby(Om Prakash Shukla).Disha looks cute in her role.

"saurabhcaptain","7","6","10","30 September 2016"," Pandey Plays it Safe and makes It a Told Story
","I was quite excited for the film, so much that I didn't wanted to read the reviews and went for the first day show. The reason for the excitement was to see the most celebrated Indian captain, MS Dhoni being played by a talented actor, Sushant Singh Rajput and Neeraj Pandey directing it after Baby. After leaving the Cinema hall, I wasn't bored but I was disappointed. The fact which disappointed me was that Neeraj didn't took any risk The Film covers the life of MS Dhoni from his birth to the day when he lifts the World Cup in 2011. The Teenage-Youth years are well portrayed and is the main strength of the film. Hats off to Neeraj for the details of 90's like Children carrying the rectangular shaped bags, Playing the video games. The locations are real and that's another positive of the film. You travel to the unseen city of Ranchi, visits Dhoni's real school and see the various grounds. Sushant's dedication to be Dhoni, to play like Dhoni, to look like Dhoni is outstanding. Yes, he mastered the popular Helicopter Shot. Another thanks to the Visual Effects team cause they beautifully shelved Sushant's body into a teenage one and to fit his face into Dhoni's Match Footage(Not 100 percent accurate but it's still good) The first Half is good as you see the character grow, the minor details and the help Dhoni gets from his friends, parents and coaches. But when you are really excited to see how Dhoni becomes a successful captain, the victories, the failures and the controversies, the screenplay let's you down. The shift changes to Dhoni love life which is still good but then then it misses what really the viewer want to see.We don't get to see Dhoni becoming the captain, his response to it and how he let a young immature team to win T20 World cup in 2007. You don't really get to know what makes Dhoni, An Amazing Captain. That's why film becomes ""a Told Story"" rather than untold cause you know almost everything. Also I wanted the answer to how he manages to be cool in tough situations and Why he put himself up in the batting order in the World Cup 11 final but at the end all remained unanswered. Performance's are good from the support cast too as Anupam Kher, Disha patni shines in their roles. So, what to do this weekend? You can still go, its not bad. The film has a heart and 180 minutes didn't let you to sleep. It's better than many biopics coming these days cause of the performance, research and details. But if you're expecting for a film that makes it into your favorite list,it isn't"

","It is said that leaders are not created rather they are born and such is the case with M.S.Dhoni. This real life based movie truly does justice to the hard work and commitment of Indian Cricket Captain and World Cup Winner M.S Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey has done a fabulous job to put up all the pieces in the desired sequence to create this masterpiece. Sushant Singh Rajput yet again impresses with his on screen performance and persona as everything about him is just perfect from head to toe in the movie. All the features starting from story, dialogues, cinematography, acting, music till direction is well knitted to form an impressive flick. However, the highlight remains Sushant Singh Rajput with his all the talent, skill and perfection doing full justice to the living legend of Indian cricket. It is quite visible that he has done a good research on Dhoni including his hair style, shyness, walking and famous ""Helicopter Shot"". The film outlines the struggle of M.S Dhoni from a railway ticket collector to the Captain of a World Champion team. It also highlights the issues pertaining to the changes made by him for transforming Indian Cricket team to a World Class Unit. The trend of making movies on real life events is gaining a lot of momentum in Bollywood and this one is the fresh addition to the list and probably the top of the line effort. M.S. Dhoni is already a star, living legend and a role model for cricketers all over the world and this film will surely add to his existing honor and prestige. A must watch film for those who believe in hard work, common man, fair play and M.S Dhoni!!!!"

"isabelladessalvi","1","9","21","2 October 2016"," All Out!!
","There is one, and only one cardinal mistake that Meerabai Not Out commits - it trivializes the national passion. Someone had a smart sounding idea of exploiting cricket as a plot device for a love story with the depth of half a soap episode. Mandira Bedi, after her sacrilegious cricket exploits on the small screen now does it on the silver screen as Meera Achrekar, the cricket fanatic who has a huge crush on Anil Kumble and is about to marry a doctor. But will cricket be the 'significant other'? That question almost wrecks a relationship, that going by the flow of the script, looked flimsy to begin with. And for those eagerly waiting to see Kumble's cameo don't even bother (Jumbo says to Meera at one point 'You look like Mandira Bedi!' - Did the writer lose his sense of humor there or his mind? Hard to tell!). Mercifully, unlike one of those drab days of test cricket on a dead subcontinent pitch, Meerabai Not Out is a short umcomedy, love story, sports movie, dramawhatever! And there are about 180 seconds worth watching. Pity, like stray deliveries from Anil Kumble, they are few and very far between."

","PLEASE DON'T GO TO WATCH IT.<br/><br/>Boring movie. Nothing special has been shown. That's all rubbish we already know. Plus the movie desperately tries to show that Dhoni is God. Looks like this is not a movie but a campaign to promote the declining respect and value of Dhoni. I couldn't tolerate it for 3 hours and got a headache after watching the movie.<br/><br/>People are crazy for cricket in India and that's the only reason they want to watch this movie. Otherwise I don't see a single reason why someone should watch this movie. There is no meaning. <br/><br/>The movie is pathetic. It's terrible and horrible. If you like cricket,you won't like it. If you like movies, still you won't like it.<br/><br/>Also the movie has not shown everything about Dhoni. It has focused only on his good things. The movie doesn't show how Dhoni played politics in the Indian team, dropped seniors, used youngsters, stole credit every time after winning, made excuses every time after losing, how he shuffled his batting order according to his ease, how he struggled on difficult pitches, how India started losing matches because of him in the end, how he selfishly didn't quit captaincy and remained shameless even after defeats and defeats, etc."

","It's a one time watch not very good movie which was not very well directed and according to me has a very mediocre screen play, you wouldn't get what you wanted to see in the movie which makes it normal Bollywood movie which it is. This movie focuses on life on Indian Cricketer MS Dhoni in which it tried to do so but failed. The things I liked about the movie was acting by Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Patani and people who were his coaches, the segregation of the story till the first half was critically fine and set up was good. The things I didn't liked about the movie were Actor placement because here well hell lot of actors who weren't relevant to the story but I don't know what they were doing there, the movie went of the topic as it doesn't shows what Dhoni is known for an simply shows the old Bollywood phenomenon of LOVE, so no marks should be given on screenplay and there was no cinematic artistry too which can be lauded and the cricket fans wouldn't even like it. BOTTOM LINE: It's a one time watch which don't focuses on the topic and shows irrelevant things, you gain nothing from this movie as it's a critical bummer."
"prateekhemdev","6","7","16","30 September 2016"," MS Dhoni-The already told Story!
","The movie is not good as expected and the reason is that the writer chooses to focus on the emotional nagging instead of the great content which could build a great story. Performance by Sushant Singh is truly brilliant and MS Dhoni's hard work and commitment towards his work is commendable but the loophole are the supporting actors. The two actresses Disha and Kiara have done average performances and Bhoomika as Dhoni's sister is not convincing enough. Too many songs in the movie spoil the screenplay. The only factor which makes the viewer going is his/her love for the real captain Cool and the sacrifices and efforts he takes to reach to the top. Overall I would recommend the movie as a one time watch but honestly Neeraj could have been much better"

","M.S Dhoni The Story finally told for unknown reasons. Running for over 190 mins. Starring Sushant Saingh Rajput as the Cricketer M.S Dhoni in this Neeraj Pandey biography tries... wants to tell the story of the man known to us Dhoni. But it clearly fails to do so. Everything from the very beginning that happens to Dhoni happens for a good reason. He is selected in school cricket team, Central Coalfield wants him in their team. Railways wants him in his team. There's less of character development then there's more of his glorious achievements. His friends always supporting him, father trying not approve his decisions, but then in the end supports him. Somehow everyone character sees the rising cricketer in Dhoni as the next big thing. The movie failed on so many infinite levels I wonder the makers just got handed Dhoni's secret dairy in which he mentioned all life's journey and makers just made the diary in to this never ending story. The editor lined up all the footage and forgot to edit the dull or irrelevant moments and just exported the file and then was released all over the world in 4500 screens. There was not a single moment I wanted to cheer in this movie for Dhoni for whom I cheered during many of India's matches. The length of the movie is like never ending. We get to see Dhoni's love life post interval and both the actresses are there for unknown reasons or maybe they are there just because they happen to be Dhoni's journey, so they are there. The movie was like having actual double root canal a never ending journey with CGI masking of Sushant Singh Rajput in the video clips where Dhoni hit big. Don't waste time here. We Indian/Bollywood filmmakers just know how make larger than life biographical stories not how to show or make a story about a character and his conflicts. Another failed opportunity after This years Azhar's."
"nadeemmubarak","1","9","23","1 October 2016"," just one word->boring
","there have been movies on sports .... i mean we have seen Awwal No,Goal etc (it's fine if u don't rmr these films because for many reason u are not gonna remember this film too) & there have been sports movies too like Lagaan & Chak De. Now when we go to spend 150 Rs on weekend we expect that at least this one will be a better sports movie, no matter in story but at least in treatment & presentation. But the same old story is repeated again. Although i didn't have any expectation from it yet i found it highly disappointing. All the film maker has tried to do is add spices to story. No witty dialogs & no moving scenes. The main reason why this film is so boring is just the treatment given to it. Which turned out to be so fake & unrealistic that people will find it hard to accept the film, even when the film talked about cricket & had some great international players. One good advice to the film maker is, my friend this movie would have been good & successful if it would have been released in 80's. Since India has gone under globalization, the Indian audience now has access to films which are being made across the world. So the old melodrama & unnecessary spices wouldn't entertain us anymore. Be innovative & offer something new, no matter it doesn't have any element of typical Bollywood film, still it will be a hit."

I felt sleepy and it didn't keep me entertained. I don't think this is a very good movie and shows how the Indian public can easily be made to believe that this is such a good movie. The only controversial thing I will say is that I would prefer to watch Suicide Squad than this movie, followed by its flop earlier this year. Finally, I would like to say is that this movie is like watching someone's life through their own eyes avoiding all the wrongs done by Dhoni in his career. I have absolute respect for him but this movie isn't as good as people say it is. After all, this is my opinion and I respect what others think."

It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. Right now maybe everyone should agree on this, Neeraj Pandey is one of the most talented directors of the Bollywood. He has made some outstanding films and this is also a very good film. His all of the films are thriller genre and he is right now a master of the thriller movie. His previous ventures ""A Wednesday"", ""Special 26"" and ""Baby"" all of this 3 movies are highly appreciated by the critics and the audiences. This movie is not a complete thriller movie, Moreover this movie is a biography. But just you think when biography meets with the thriller genre, what will happen? Exactly!!! A very good enjoyable movie. This movie has all the elements what you like to watch. Sports, Drama, Emotion, Action, Suspense and thriller. the perfect combination of all of this."
"repairlab","1","6","14","1 October 2016"," Laughed throughout the movie, but only at its stupidity
","An impressive list of cricketers make their debut with this movie though most of them can be seen only for a few seconds each. The story was PATHETIC. I didn't think Harman Baweja could sink lower than Love Story 2050 but he has managed to do that. The story simply did not make much sense and most of the cricket scenarios are extremely difficult in real life. Getting selected for the Indian team after just one national match is something even Sachin Tendulkar could not manage. It was as if every ball he faced would go outside the boundary which is nearly impossible in real life. Even the reasons why the mob attacks his house are flimsy."
"nairtejas","4","6","14","1 October 2016"," Hagiography 101 â™¦ Grade D-
","Director Neeraj Pandey has given us some good thrillers in the last few years, but this contrived biographical film about a cricketer raises the point that he should stick to thrillers.<br/><br/>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is a young man who is from an economically poor background and lives with his family in Ranchi. After having picked up by his school's cricket coach for wicket-keeping, Mahendra is exposed to the depths of cricket. When he realizes that he is good at it, Mahendra decides to take it up seriously, albeit at his father's (Anupam Kher) disappointment who thinks people who choose sports as a career are losers. The narrative then takes up a coming-of-age setup and showcases Mahendra's journey as he lands a job with Indian Railways and consequently plays for the national cricket team.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a combination of peacock sequences to entice a gullible fan. With more than three hours of running time, the stretches of sequences that outline Mahendra's ""journey of struggle"" are hardly believable, because it feeds its audience with content that they want to see. There's not a single uncomfortable moment in the film, and biopics are confirmed failures when they do not explore the entirety of the topic in question. The film bites off more than it can chew and tries to encapsulate the whole decades-long life of the cricketer, conveniently written to cover the topics already in the public domain. For instance, Mahendra's unenthusiastic bout as a railway ticket collector is sampled at length, when there were more interesting periods that could have been covered. Further, since it's also a Bollywood film, the romance quotient was high when the plot introduces Mahendra's love interests, simultaneously trying to induce sentimentality somewhere along.<br/><br/>A perfect example of how biopics, and not documentaries, are made is how Danny Boyle pulled off Steve Jobs' story in his 2015 Academy Award-nominated film. That film chronicled the man's life story in a peculiar way and succeeded at it. Here, the blame is on director Pandey who chose to chronicle the whole story and stick with a formulaic approach where the final product looks like a lavish gourmet dish. As an informed viewer, one wants to see the negative and positive sides of a star in the making, and this film offers neither, not even partially. It's only intention is to showcase a contrived and ridiculously manipulated life-story of a sportsman who is known only in a certain niche, as is also evident from the perspective of a notable character in the film.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is not a biography, but a hagiography created only to give a final adieu to the real life personality's fame which is inching towards its exhaustion. Additionally, one has all the evidence to prove that propaganda is at aggravated play here, because of the spotlight decipherment of the central character's alleged wrong notes with a colleague. So, is this a plot to hit the ice? Maybe, but a very wicked medium for that.<br/><br/>Rajput manages to maneuver his character with ease, but his expressions seemed to come in between the play. His hard-work is, however, ubiquitous, and that must be lauded. Leading ladies do not have much to say or play, as they are used as puppets, Bollywood style. Anupam Kher is the only person in the whole film whose actions come out as natural. The use of formula is apparent in almost all filmmaking factors, except for the terrible CGI. And if I start listing all the commercial brands mentioned in the film, I could write an essay and stand last in a competition.<br/><br/>Finally, the film only uses the good points so as to etch a spot in the cinematic history of a man who is assumed to be a rock-star in his field. Sure, the international cricket matches are a testament to that, but if cinema is used as a platform to blatantly advertise the enemies of Andy Warhol, then I'm personally sorry that it is doomed. No wonder the film slyly tries to compare another cricketer with an imaginary being, for there's a film about him coming up, too.<br/><br/>All said and done, the film is perfect for a cricket fanatic who puts his/her own life behind the game, only to revere the players. And, unless the people and the country decide to pay less attention to it and the dramatic madness attached, things WILL stay the same.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Neeraj Pandey's ""M S Dhoni: The Untold Story"" neither explores the untold territory nor goes into detail about the unpleasant attributes of the personality's life. It's a controlled account of a man who hopes to vindicate himself, make himself part of cinematic history, and salvage his dwindling popularity - all at the cost of mocking himself. Wait for TV premiere.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
"Rawal_Afzal","10","2","3","18 October 2016"," Your chance to meet MS Dhoni!
","As a huge fan of MS right from the time of very first substantial score that he made in 2005, there's this pretty much impossible desire to meet him, to get to know him a a personal level, even if for five minutes it may be. Having watched this film and to have through it got to know so many of the untold things about him and his life, it feels as if that wish has been fulfilled, right here at my own place. I was so sure of it being a good film that I got photos clicked of myself whilst the starting scenes ran on the TV. Just for the memories.<br/><br/>When Sushant walks in to bat in the very beginning, the film completely over-takes my whole being and from then on it becomes a journey, a ride, an atmosphere that you live with him. I thought Emraan did tremendously as Azharuddin in 'Azhar' (2016), but Sushant was equally impressive and in fact mind-blowing at copying MS' style, his stroke-play, the walk to the wicket and the trigger movements on the way. I noticed that black spot too below the left eye, that MS has. The beginning and the ending scenes themselves are worth millions and a piece of very intelligent film-making to evoke the emotions of the public.<br/><br/>It was very emotional, any angle you look at it from; whether from the hard-work that he'd to put in, the set-backs he's had to suffer on the way, or the achievements he went on to make. What stands above all is the the tragic death of his girlfriend in a car crash, whilst he was playing cricket in another country (there're differing reports as to when it happened. Some say it was whilst he went on a tour for the India A team).<br/><br/>The most fun part of course was discovering how and from whom he learnt the helicopter shot, a shot that signifies the man's unorthodox character. I find it very heartening on his part to have given someone else the deserved credit for his trademark shot.<br/><br/>Despite MS' request against it, some over the top glorification is always expected, given that films need heroes, and so too is the minor tweaking of the details and the timings of the events, but it remains overall a pretty solid film that I can watch again and again, and can't help but place it amongst my all-time favourites. So a big thumbs up to everyone involved!<br/><br/>Also, during his career itself, the film serves as a timely reminder for those of his critics who always credit his success as captain to him being just lucky. We may not like a sportsman, or criticise him, but we should respect the hard-work put in by anyone of them to have reached it to the highest level<br/><br/>Detailed write-up: http://textuploader.com/d5jx2"

","who gets selected to play for the Indian cricket team. His is an overnight success story. From anonymous newcomer to Next Big Thing, it doesn't take long for him to fall in the wrong company - in this case a cunning talent manager (played by Gulshan Grover) who lands him big endorsement deals, but also distracts him from the game and gets him addicted to wine, women and wealth. By the time our hero realises he's lost everything that's dear to him, it's a tad too late. But nothing that a lazy screenplay-writer can't solve by resorting to the oldest clichÃ©s in the book.Victory too is more predictable than the weather in Alaska.Victory, unfortunately, is a completely forgettable film whose scenes play out exactly how you'd expect them to. Sports films often follow the same blueprint; there's rarely any surprise in how a film about cricket or football or hockey will turn out - the hero's side always wins. You see, the trick is not in the ending, but in how you reach the ending. Think about it - were you surprised that the villagers beat the British in ""Lagaan"", or that the Indian women's hockey team won the match in ""Chak De India""? No, you knew that was going to happen twenty minutes into both films. It's the journey up to that expected ending that made both those films special. The problem with Victory is, there is nothing to discover, nothing to surprise you, and nothing exciting at all about how it reaches its expected ending. Amateurishly directed by Ajitpal Mangat, the film is laughable in its supposedly emotional scenes, and too long by at least twenty minutes. The climax, a real hoot, is inspired much from Indian cricket history, with creative liberties thrown in for good measure. So you have six sixers back-to-back, and one final one that smashes the floodlights. All this delivered by our hero who's bleeding profusely from the head, his vision blurred from the injury. Now the big question - has Harman improved since ""Love Story 2050""? Well, he's lost some of his stiffness, and his acting's a lot less labored for sure. But it's going to take a much better film and a less stereotyped character for him to show what he's really got. I would recommend, additionally, that he fire his make-up man instantly - the patches on the forehead, the uneven pancake really doesn't make much of an impression. Amrita Rao is wasted as our hero's childhood love; and Anupam Kher hams it up as Shekhawat's upright father, cracking you up with his rhythmic paralytical spasms. It is a film that reduces real heroes like Harbhajan Singh and Brett Lee to junior artistes in the background. Watch it only if you have a high threshold for pain."

","It begins with promise. Young Mahi is more interested in football, badminton and tennis, and tries to blow off his first coach (Rajesh Sharma) who spots his potential. The entire 'bachpan'-adolescence section, featuring the father (Anupam Kher) who thinks a job will take his son much further than sports, the mother who believes in her son, the sister (Bhumika Chawla) who is a solid support to him, his bunch of loyal friends who just know he can do it, has been crafted with heart and feels authentic. We see Mahi (Sushant Singh Rajput) trying and failing and trying again, despite all the roadblocks, to keep his eye on his goal: to be part of the Indian team and play for his country, and we root for him. Till then, bully for Neeraj Pandey and the film, even if it is already feeling stretched and repetitive. What works for the film in the first half is the lifelike re-creation of life in a small town (Ranchi), a family getting by on slender means and yet being able to find it in themselves to get behind a bright-eyed lad who dreams big, and is willing to work for it. In the way it shows Mahi's often herculean attempts to become visible to the powers that be (he can smash the ball all across the ground effortlessly, and wicket- keep beautifully too), the film becomes almost copybook in telling us that strokes may come easy but getting invited into privileged sporting enclaves is exceedingly tough. But, and this is the message that comes through loud and clear, that it can be done. You can be a small town boy, and if you have talent and a little bit of luck, you can be unstoppable. Up till here, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's story, the mostly untold part for most of us, holds us. It tells us that it is right for us to aspire, and that anyone can do it.<br/><br/>Then the curse of the second half strikes, and it goes into an irreversible slide. Two romances arrive in swift succession (Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, both sparkly, both reduced to sidebars). There are songs. There is a stab at the intrigue that governs selection processes at various cricketing bodies, including the mighty BCCI, but it is laughably feeble. The entire focus is on Dhoni who is shown as the sole match-winner from the Indian side. His teammates, which include Indian cricketing greats (Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and others), are seen in flashes, either from the back or in profile. There is no dressing room banter with his team-mates. No scenes, in fact, with other players, except for a couple of stray ones with Yuvraj Singh (Harry Tangri).<br/><br/>also the seen of ex girlfriend deatch his hearth breaking"

First of all, white people are made to look like hooligans and scum, with bad family ties and no moral codes. A white robber stabs an Indian dude because he saw a picture of him and his white wife. Then the white guys continue to be bad, undisciplined and ludicrous throughout the movie, his sister rejects him outright and even closes the window on him. The Indian guy is the hero throughout, no question the whities are badies. Then in the night club when he's dancing, all the white women are getting down and he ends up scoring with the blond later.<br/><br/>It's just really petty, sends all the wrong messages and is aimed at being racist over fair and telling a story. <br/><br/>I found a lot of scenes very distasteful and poorly executed, there was no need to write them and the context did nothing good but to show that some writers, and producers are distinctly insecure and actually quite racist. By portraying the white guys as bad guys, they unveil their true color and thoughts.

"Swapnilagarwal","6","2","4","1 October 2016"," MSD: Main story remains untold
","Bollywood has off late caught up fascination for Sports biopics ranging from Pan Singh Tomar, Milkha, Mary Kom and now Dhoni. The latest offering from 'Special 26' and 'Baby' fame Neeraj Pandey which raised a lot of hopes with its trailer, fails to live up to expectations. It's not out and out a bad movie but doesn't match the authenticity and detailing of neither the earlier films of this genre nor the past work of Pandey. Like always, let's discuss all aspects one-by-one:<br/><br/>Â• Plot: Most people feel it's the length (over 3 hrs) of the movie which makes it a tiresome ride. However, I feel, it's the content which makes the audience check their watches frequently, esp. in the second half. Yes, MS Dhoni, undoubtedly, is a top-class wicket- keeper batsman, but what makes him class apart are his captaincy skills and cool-as-cucumber demeanor. The movie fails to showcase both. Neither does it capture how MS was catapulted to captainship for 2007 T-20 world cup, nor it reveals his strategizing skills in dressing room and his composure in nail-biting match- moments. Rather, movie time and again illustrates him as a vulnerable emotional person. The first half has been authentically shot and aptly enacted. However, the 2 romantic angles post intermission off- track the movie, making it draggy and superficial. For making a biopic on an active player, out of the box and real untold stuff was required. The second half was a mere cut-paste of match-clippings and stories most of us know further wasted by avoidable brand endorsement clippings.<br/><br/>Â• Performances: Yes, Sushant Singh Rajput did work very hard to emulate the mannerisms, body-language and playing style of MSD and he is successful to great extent in this. He definitely showcases Dhoni's sincerity well. However, he still fails to match the fluent English of real MS. Support cast comprising Rajesh Sharma, Kumud Mishra, boy who played young MS, Bhumika Chawla, etc. delivered justified performances. Anupam Kher, though, looks a little more aged and utterly-wrinkled right from the word go. That reminds me of the unnecessary hospital scene in the beginning! And Harry Tangri literally brought Yuvraj Singh live on screen, with not just his similar looks but also carrying the same attitude. The 2 girls were mere glamorous add-ons. Disha Patani anytime scores over Kiara Advani.<br/><br/>Â• Music: A solid background score and a thematic anthem is enough for sports biopics. Sanjoy Chowdhury delivers average tunes and a couple of songs filmed on the 2 actresses add as fillers only.<br/><br/>Â• Cinematography: Sudhir Palsane scores it well especially in first half taking the audience from gullies of Ranchi to the crowded Kharagpur Station.<br/><br/>A lot of controversies associated with Dhoni were intentionally excluded from the movie, perhaps not to decimate the making of the MSD. That's justified! But exclusion of the main facets of the persona of a bio-pictured player is unpardonable. This fact, perhaps, makes this good movie stay short of becoming great and smart."

We always loved Dhoni because of his contribution to Indian cricket as a keeper, batsman and as a captain but I am sure after watching this movie we will start loving Dhoni as a person. This movie will definitely remind you the Dhoni's era between 2004 to 2011 and you will not regret for a moment. Dhoni...Dhoni...Dhoni.... Proud of you Dhoni.. (y) (y)"

","The story of a small town boy making it to the most toughest team India selection. A typical middle class family, bunch of exceptional friends, support from mentors who saw the talent and the unconditional love has made Dhoni what he is today. His story is inspiration for all those who want to succeed in life against all odds and losses. Truly brilliant performance by Sushant Singh Rajput, whose hard work can been seen in the way he copied the Dhoni swag. Some really nice songs. 10* for movie being true to the man and not showing any stupid heroic stuff. Neeraj Pandey has done the justice to the Captain of Indian Cricket Team M S Dhoni."

","As people say MS Dhoni doesn't emote much, yes he doesn't, but his movie will certainly make you emotional and make you feel proud as a Dhoni fan (if you are), as a Cricket lover (if you are) and above all as an Indian (which you are). The untold part is not absolutely untold for some die hard fans who have already done PhD on MS. But for many, yes it is an Untold story. Sushant Singh Rajput has undoubtedly given his career best performance (considering his performance in Detective Byomkesh Bakshy). He has managed to copy Dhoni's mannerisms with the utmost perfection. We have seen the real one finishing things off in style many a times, but here the reel one has finished things off in his own style and as obvious, has hit it out of the stadium. Hat's off! Neeraj Pandey once again proved why he is considered as one of the finest filmmakers of the country. M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, though not as good as A Wednesday!, Special Chabbis or Baby (which obviously were of different genre) in the cinematic point of view, but will certainly be regarded as Neeraj's one of the best works ever. Special mention to HERRY Tangiri, the man who replicated Yuvraj Singh perfectly. Boss you nailed it."

","The film is the best Hindi movie I have seen in the recent times and certainly one of the best biographies brought to the screen in my opinion, for its story and impact!<br/><br/>To me, the background music score is a highlight - heightening the movie experience. Songs are just right in its rhythm and tone and complements the story well! Far from boring, the movie around the intermission time just kept me craving for more. It has just the right mix of all emotions thrown in within the story and will keep you involved throughout the movie for which one should willingly recommend this to all types of audiences. You also realize the story brought out is a realistic one! Sushant's portrayal of the character which of course includes the fine gestures of the character he is playing and everything else.. does justice in keeping with the objective and we do not feel any wavering from the plot. And, certain subtleties will make you look to your neighbor and smile. All actors, without exception, have done a great job of portraying their characters and one must certainly and sincerely appreciate the selection of cast; plus, more than decent editing.<br/><br/>If this movie has done anything, it is primarily to instill faith that we can make great biographies (with songs!). Finally, one has to say, after watching Dhoni's story and the sacrifices of the people around him, my respect for him and his story has become many fold! A fabulous movie!!"

","Now, I know some of you might think that this movie is overrated but believe me this is a must watch. I myself don't love cricket( I used to but now I am busy so eventually I lost interest) but if you are a Indian you will relate with each and every moment in the movie, whether it be funny, emotional or motivating. The BEST part of the movie was the last scene when Dhoni hits the winning shot. The whole theatre went crazy when he hit that shot. Some of them even cried. In short, everyone had mixed feelings. You might download this movie and watch on your mobile phone but some movies are meant to be watched in the theatres. There are some scenes which personally I found useless but people were laughing/crying on those scenes too. Gosh! People have so much sentiments attached with cricket. Not only Sushant but others too did a commendable job. I want to rate this a 9.5 but we don't have a option so I'll rate this a 10 because 9 is going to be a bit less. Thanks for reading this. <br/><br/>P.S. I watched it at Elante Mall, Chandigarh."

","First of all, I am not a big fan of Dhoni. Due to the hype for the movie, I went to see on first day itself. As a biography movie, you can guess the movie twists & plot easily. This movie is mainly focused on M.S.Dhoni's positive side not the negative side, criticism and advertisement issues he faced which is disappointment. <br/><br/>But as a movie perspective, the casts are very good. Especially, Sushant nailed his role. And the supporting role actors are also done their job quite good. The cinematography and the background music engaged us this almost 3 hour movie. Songs are nice. VFX for the young dhoni and the main cricket matches are good to watch. <br/><br/>Since it's a biography, you can see a lots of dhoni's friends and real cricket players in the screen. It's really cheers the mood. That's where the director made us to travel with the characters.<br/><br/>If you are a cricket fan, it will be a big bang for you.

He did all the justice to the role. From his walking style, batting style, stunts everything is just pitch perfect. HE literally nailed it. Disha Patani is just epitome of cuteness. She overshadowed Kiera Advani totally. Although Kiera as Sakshi Dhoni was also very good.

"binducherungath","8","2","4","30 September 2016"," M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story hits a smashing Sixer.
","M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a biopic by Neeraj Pandey on M.S. Dhoni, one of the successful cricket captain which our country has seen. The film hits a smashing Sixer. Neeraj Pandey has a sure shot blockbuster in his kitty after his much critically acclaimed films A Wednesday, Special 26, and Baby. Neeraj Pandey has certainly made a very spectacular film on M. S. Dhoni's life, right from his birth to India winning World Cup in 2011. As the punch line of the film in the official posters is mentioned, this is a film about 'The man you knowÂ… the journey you don't). In spite of its 190 minutes long duration, the film keeps one glued to the screen with its fast-paced 1st half. The second half does become a bit slow, but overall the film is well- paced. Every frame makes you feel wanting to get M. S. Dhoni's journey to be unraveled on screen. The film does show almost all the major matches of M. S. Dhoni's life, which were decisive in shaping his career. One of the beautiful aspect of the film is that technically the real footages of these matches are very well merged with Sushant's shots. It appears as if, one is reliving all those moments of victories and pride once again through the film. Sushant Singh Rajput is incredibly convincing and excellent in his role as M. S. Dhoni. It is a film which will be loved by cricket lovers as well as cricket non-lovers. <br/><br/>The film begins with the footages of 2011 World Cup. The audience gets to see the back side of the captain Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) watching the live match on TV monitor in the dressing room. While he watches a wicket fall, he decides to promote himself up in the batting order to bat next, wears his Number 7 jersy and walks into the field amidst huge cheering from the spectators in the stadium. Yes, it was the final match of the World Cup between India and Sri Lanka, where Dhoni finished the match in style with a sixer and led Indian team to win World Cup after a period of 28 years. <br/><br/>Dhoni's story unfolds on screen, right from his birth in Ranchi. He used to love football as a child, especially as a goalkeeper and even when he was asked whether he would prefer to learn and play cricket, he shrugged the idea itself since he felt that what good sport it would be with small balls. His father Pan Singh Dhoni (Anupam Kher) is a pump operator, who as usual parents is very protective about his children's studies. Dhoni has an elder sister Jayanti (Bhumika Chawla). His mother is a simple housewife, mostly plays the role of a mediator between children and husband. <br/><br/>Rajesh Sharma essays the role of KR Banerjee, who sees the talent in Dhoni, when he watches Dhoni goalkeeping. He does persuade Dhoni to be a wicketkeeper and try cricket. That is where Banerjee's journey as a coach to master-striker Dhoni started. Although initially he gave Dhoni more opportunities to be a wicket keeper, later he recognizes Dhoni's potential in striking the ball. The film takes us through Dhoni's journey from playing for clubs to his matches as part of Junior Cricket Team in Bihar, Bihar Cricket Team, Jharkhand Cricket Team to ultimately playing for India. Both his ODI and Test Career are also part of this film. His journey also included his job stint as Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur Railway Station. <br/><br/>The film also shares how his friends Santosh (Kranti Prakash Jha), Chittu (Alok Pandey), Sandip Nahar and Jitin Gulati are there as great pillars of support. <br/><br/>The second half of the film moves to Dhoni's personal life, love, marriage. That is where, Disha Patani as Priyanka Jha and Kiara Advani as Sakshi enters the scene. Of course, the love story of Dhoni and Sakshi is known, but who is Priyanka, and how she is part of Dhoni's untold story is to be seen. <br/><br/>There are many moments in the film, which would give you goosebumps, be it Dhoni's smashing performances on-field, or his resilience off- field. He is shown to be very focused towards his sport and he also gets frustrated from within, but very much restrained in expressing the same, when he feels that he is neither able to do justice to his job nor to his sport. His mental strength at many occasions are shown in the film. <br/><br/>Dhoni's confidence reflects in one of his conversation with his school team's captain Shabbir Hussain (Ashrut Jain). Dhoni, while walking to the field and looking at the score board with a huge target to achieve, asks Shabbir, whether he can do it if he gives him the strike. Shabbir says that he would try. Dhoni says: If it has to be tried, I might as well try it myself. There are lot of moments in the film, which talks about Dhoni's persistence, focus, decisiveness etc. <br/><br/>Sushant Singh Rajput marvels in his role as M. S. Dhoni. He has done complete justice to the role. His mannerisms, his strokes, his attitude, his body language, trademark shots etc. clubbed with real footages would make you feel and believe that you are actually watching the real Dhoni on screen. Rest of the cast is also good.<br/><br/>M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story hits a smashing Sixer. Sushant Singh Rajput is incredibly convincing and excellent in his role as M. S. Dhoni.

"xpics","4","0","0","9 May 2020"," Painfully long with uninspiring and scattered story-telling!
","This is one of those films where you feel if you watched a different film from what the world had seen, since it unanimously got positive reviews and for me it couldn't even come close to an average watch. Writing a review almost 4 years after the film's release doesn't make much sense but since my views are quite in contrast to what the world thinks, I felt like at least penning my views for once.<br/><br/>This biopic has the regular trappings of a rise-of-underdog, rags-to-riches story. The conventionalism could still have been overlooked if the narrative was compelling. Alas what we get here is a repetitive series of montage sequences that makes for uninspiring storytelling of a cricket legend.<br/><br/>The film at one point very rightly says that life is full of struggles and you need to keep batting the bouncers being constantly thrown at you. This applies true to the film as well which keeps throwing repeated bouncers at you all through and you are supposed to struggle through it. Not quite a pleasant experience especially when you expect entertainment from a film. Just to point down some major boring aspects of the film.
<ul><li>the Dhoni-Yuvraj Singh face off that the film brings pretty early in the plot was a very interesting premise but is never addressed in the film eventually. This thereby ends up being a cheap gimmick of using an actor (Herry Tangari) who resembles a young Yuvraj Singh, just for the kicks without any contribution to the narrative.</li><li>the love story between Dhoni and his first girlfriend (Disha Patani) is extremely boring without any emotional gravitas</li><li>if that wasn't enough, another love story soon follows with Dhoni and another lady (Kiara Advani) and the track is, more or less, similar to the earlier love story. Even if the first love story really happened in his life, it could have been easily edited out of the biopic, like many other tracks were.</li><li>Dhoni's bonding with his friends could have been more riveting. They end up being some uninteresting characters in his life, whom we don't connect with much.</li><li>All his family members from mom, Dad (Anupam Kher), sister (Bhumika Chawla in a forgettable comeback), brother-in-law and his coach (Rajesh Sharma), selector (Kumud Mishra), railway head (Kali Prasad Mukherjee) don't have defining moments in his life other than being used as mere spectators in the montage sequences of his matches.</li><li>his life as a railway ticket examiner is a track that is overplayed beyond requirement making it protracted and monotonous.</li><li>on the contrary, his rise to fame with his entry in the Indian National team is one aspect which you wish to have experienced better and stayed with more. Alas that is just hastily treated in quick montages. Even his gradual progression to being the captain of the Indian cricket team is simply fast-forwarded. One doesn't quite expect the film to show his interactions with fellow cricketers (which would have been a logistically difficult task to achieve). But there are no tracks explored in his personal life as well, other than the insipid love stories.</li><li>the climax predictably set amidst the 2011 World Cup which India won, doesn't have the edge-of-the-seat moments either.</li><li>at a runtime of almost 3 hours, this film is painfully long with boring romance tracks, repetitive montage shots of his cricket matches and uninspiring storytelling.</li><li>at the end you wonder if the film was actually tracing Dhoni's dream? And what exactly was Dhoni's dream? If it was to make it to the National team, it is achieved by interval point. If it was to win the World Cup, that never comes across in the film! With the lack of a definitive pain-point, the film meanders aimlessly.</li></ul><br/><br/>Sushant Singh Rajput makes a modest attempt at playing Dhoni but seems one-dimensional after a point. The film very smartly edits and merges real life cricketers and match footage with the footage of Sushant Singh Rajput playing Dhoni. In the starting reels, it also shows a young Dhoni with Sushant Singh Rajput looking much younger and also shorter in height. But beyond these technical achievements, one expected better storytelling from accomplished director Neeraj Pandey."
"shyamsundarmitra","8","0","0","5 May 2020"," A film worth watching
","The film starts with 2011 World Cup finals with Dhoni entering the field to play one of the most crucial innings of his life. The story then goes to the flash back and film begins with the birth of Mahi. The story covers his family background, their aspirations and expectations, Mahi's childhood and adolescence years. What strikes the most throughout the first half is the way every character who has played even the minute role in making of Dhoni- the captain, has been depicted in the film.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you follow cricket or not as Mahendra Singh Dhoni's journey is inspiring, to say the least. The man comes from a humble background and defied all odds to etch his name in the history of Indian cricket. You'll also get to relive the two World Cup wins under Dhoni's captaincy- those moments will definitely make you chant 'India, India' once again. And you won't be alone!"

","Unbelievable movie, I have no word to Express what I feel after watching this movie,Well I love this movie a lot not only because it is based on life of M.S Dhoni but how much he had struggled to reach this landmark in his life.Even he had lots of problems and obstacles yet he never let himself down and loose his patience.This is not only reflected in his life but also on field too when even in intense pressure situations he has lead his team to historical wins
It's very emotional and motivational movie. They were so poor in early life seriously life is not so easy . His father was a pump operator. He was tc ticket checker .When he brought first bike with his own money he went in dhaba for celebration with his all time supporting friends. After achieving this all he was not satiesfied even he want many more from life and try to bloom his tallent in cricket. He continues his training in cricket. He play many many matches on the behalf of railways and state level. After the this all struggle he got the chance in a indian team.
After that we know Ms dhoni is best captain,player,finisher of in the entire world. Today in this world anyone cannot take place of ms dhoni . ms dhoni we love you a lot . you won the 2nd world cup for india.
It is having everything what we need in a movie fun ,excitement,lesson,motivation and it also teaches us the great support given by teacher and friends.

"superindrajit","8","0","0","15 June 2017"," A Captivating Biopic on Mahendra Singh Dhoni
","A biopic is incredibly burdensome as a great degree of research is involved in the creative process. Such real stories can completely falter if the actual realities are poorly replicated on the silver screen. In addition, if a biopic does not display key details it doesn't really explore the realities accurately. Biopics can also largely misfire if the actualities are severely distorted. Neeraj Pandey's MS Dhoni: The Untold Story is not a backfire because it does not fall prey to these aforementioned issues. Essentially, it accurately shows MS Dhoni's legacy without spending an overdose of time on needless content; this is no hogwash.<br/><br/>This film beautifully shows MS Dhoni's childhood, his passions, and his struggle. This film is several notches above Azhar(2016) because it has an eye for details. Dhoni's family's values are explored well through the initial scenes. In the initial stages, his slow and steady movement towards cricket via wicket-keeping is a delight to watch. His relationship with the Bengali coach is well portrayed with good use of light moments. In this phase, the best moments are when Dhoni gets to bat the first time. Instead of just focusing on his successful hits, the film focuses on the encouragement young Dhoni gets with each hit. The film brilliantly shows how one kid's passion for batting becomes a big hit in that local area in India. It was quite intriguing to see how Dhoni uses numerous cricket tournaments as a window of opportunity to take his game to the next level. However, Dhoni's journey to incredible success was quite arduous. There were no dearth of setbacks in this rocky road to becoming a legendary Indian cricketer. This untold story examines these lows and details Dhoni's reactions through these moments. It was increasingly fascinating to view Dhoni's emotions and how he emerges stronger after each major low in his life. In fact, it was quite interesting to see how calm MS Dhoni was during certain mishaps. For example, Dhoni's calmness during tense moments like missing the flight to the Dilip Trophy was brilliantly presented. In addition, the film splendidly recreates all of Dhoni's major successes including the 2011 World Cup. Ideally, it was increasingly special to view his family witness all his major matches via television. However, the moment that takes the cake is the grand finale which many Indians will love viewing. Basically, the 2011 world cup victory was a big moment and that finale by Dhoni is one that will touch many. <br/><br/>Neeraj Pandey (the director of exceptional thrillers like Special 26 and Baby) has proved that he can make great films outside the thriller genre. His direction, screenplay, and dialogue is quite good. He exits his comfort zone and helms a biopic which hooks the audience till the climax. The film has a proper flow despite some unnecessary comedy (which is definitely fun to watch). Essentially, the film works due to a lack of snags. This picture does score in several other creative elements but the director successfully collaborates every element together. Basically, this biopic is a ship which did not sink like other ships because it had a highly skilled captain. If Tony D'Souza directed this film, it would've been far less effective like his Azhar(2016). <br/><br/>Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an exceptional performance as Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He gets into the skin of the character and his enormous effort is clearly visible. This character has quite a few layers and Sushant demonstrates them with a high degree of success. In my honest opinion, his best scene was an incredibly difficult emotional breakdown. In this one moment, Dhoni is informed of his special someone's demise and it hits him really hard. Instead of hamming it up badly, Sushant keeps it real and portrays this heartbreaking moment brilliantly. The scenes where he has to juggle between exams and cricket are brilliantly enacted. In fact, you can actually observe the struggle period and his acting makes it more natural. Such moments make his triumphant victories even more beautiful. Disha Patani is sweet as Priyanka Jha and her importance in Dhoni's life is well explored. The beautiful lass underplays her role well. It is such a delight to see her genuine love for Dhoni and her demise is quite agonizing. Kiara Advani doesn't have a big part but she plays a pivotal role in Dhoni's life. Her romantic moments with Dhoni do distract a bit but they are beautiful to view. She has acted well despite the limited screen time; it would be wrong to deem this as a blink and miss appearance. Anupam Kher is excellent as Dhoni's father. His concerns for his son's future are realistic and he enacts these moments effectively. His best moments appear when he watches his sons highs and lows in the big cricket matches. However, his best scene is the finale in which we see his tears of joy for the grand victory. The rest of the cast are all effectively utilized as they all have important moments in the story. <br/><br/>Amaal Mallik's music is great with some beautiful songs like Jab Tak and Besabriyaan. Arijit's Phir Kabhi strikes a chord for its lyrics as well as the excellent singing. Chiefly, the music has been beautifully crooned by the numerous musicians involved. <br/><br/>On the whole, this is a great biopic which completely deserves all the love it got from the audience. It accurately presents the story of our Indian skipper and it does not shy away from the lows of his career. It is backed up by research and there is no major distortion of facts. Only a director of Neeraj Pandey's caliber could've pulled this off with such a great degree of triumph."

","What kept going for me to watch this movie and recommend everyone to watch this aspiring documentary is justifying the title of Untold Story. I have watched Dhoni playing in Kharagpur when he was working for Indian railway. Knowing his personality and the way he used to handle pressure even then to those in final moments of World Cup was a daunting task for any actor to match. Sushant did a perfect justice to such a legend. You won't feel that you are watching a movie rather you will feel getting involved in it. This movie depicted that you can make a perfect recipe of success by your determination and your clarity of thoughts irrespective of what kind of imperfections are there in your individual skills. Dhoni might be not the best batsman in world, not the best wicket keeper in world, not the best captain in world when you go by stats but Dhoni is someone who brings the perfect recipe of yielding a result which his fans expect from him for his team.<br/><br/>A would say it is a must watch if you want to treat it as a biography or documentary rather a movie."

","MS Dhoni:The Untold Story is a biographical film, based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.The movie starring SushantSingh Rajput ,Disha Patani ,Kiara Advani and Anupam Kher is directed by Neeraj Pandey. The Biopic is one of the most anticipated Bollywood Movies of This Year. If you are die-hard fan of MS Dhoni and cricket ,you are bound to love this film, which reverse its protagonist Spread over three hours, Dhoni: The Untold Story takes you through various events and places in the life of ""Mahi"", as everyone calls him in the movie. I have always been a Dhoni admirer. A movie on his life was an emotional, at times almost spiritual experience for me.Most importantly, the movie does not glorify Dhoni but shows him as a near-flawless character. Overall, it is an above-average performance if one looks at it in terms of accuracy and details. It is a simple story with an underlining message that you can be a small town boy but if you have talent and a little bit of luck, you can be unbridled. MS Dhoni:The movie follows the journey of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a budding cricketer from Ranchi, who became the most successful captain of the Indian Cricket Team. He was a ticket collector before he became a cricketer. The movie begins with the ICC Cricket World Cup Final (India vs Sri Lanka) in the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is watching the match live on screen. He decides to take the stand, and tells the authorities that he would go for batting if the wicket falls down. Dhoni takes up his bat and leads down the stairs interacted the roar of the crowd.The movie then goes into a flashback in Ranchi, Bihar in 1981, the year Dhoni was born. Dhoni's alleged rivalry with Yuvraj Singh and a few senior players also finds a mention in the film.The Untold Story shows Dhoni's love, struggles, rejections, luck, insights into his personality (including his most used words, definitely and process as well) and his rise in Indian cricket. Barring a minor glitch here and there, the movie manages to keep the viewers interested. The film has its flaws, misses here and there and falls a bit in the 'death overs'"

","Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.<br/><br/>Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport- biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.<br/><br/>So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.<br/><br/>If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.<br/><br/>In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.<br/><br/>I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.<br/><br/>Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.<br/><br/>When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.<br/><br/>We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.<br/><br/>I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.<br/><br/>The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.<br/><br/>Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.<br/><br/>8½/10"

"sameer-khan662","4","0","0","15 January 2017"," M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a typical Bollywood but liked the acting of shushant
","Well people let me tell you something very important about each one of you who comment or posted their reply<br/><br/>Good thing to know : 1. Every struggled person who realizes how hard he/she is been through his/her life will certainly make him/her tough and M.S. Dhoni is one of them but lets just admit he has a passion for cricket and so as everyone one of you has a passion for something, difference is if anyone has a guts to follow his passion and achieve all his goals. 2. Well it made me search too on google not because finding how she looks and all but because the girl in the movie acted simple which make us to think this is something sad has happened to someone who is good enough to follow his passion and bring glory to our country. Well i will not talk about human nature over here what people thinks or do at some situation which is what happening over here but if someone told you about it and no movie would have been made then I guess 70% wouldn't have been so sorry about it. 3. Lets just assume that happens 80% of what we have seen in this movie but the producers should have selected the wrong series where both met in 2005 in a flight and India vs Pakistan match was ongoing. Let me tell you the result India(2)- Pakistan(4). India lost that series. Now, quoting dialogue from a movie ""Don't bring anything for Valentine just win the series"". Well if this movie was to make someone inspired then at least producer should have thought about changing the series timeline. 4. My Thinking the movie: Movie was below average and was rushing as if director's or producer's main focus was to show ""There is always a woman in a success of every man"" but I didn't see anything if expand the facts(Losing series). 5. Overall : MS Dhoni for me is a man who made us proud by winning both format world cup. He is not some heart-broken silly person lets be real now. He has a passion for cricket and works hard enough for it. I am not only proud of MS dhoni but I am saluting to all those guys who has a passion and work for it really hard until they get it because I am not that person to have guts like that. His struggle and toughness made him so successful since he had to deal with lots of stupid selectors or Cricket Board. My real life story sucks more than this, the thing is there is no movie made on my life. Now see how following passion gifts you with delights. Go and follow your Dream! Your story will also be shown to the world. **Note **: Now when I say passion or dream this shouldn't had to be like ""I want to be best programmer in my company"" don't lie to yourself, i am not saying this can't be your dream but I know people lie to themselves sometimes and that's where you become the biggest failure more than me.

"rohancnaidu","6","0","0","13 December 2016"," Nothing You did not know about MS...
","I have been someone who grew into the enigma of MS Dhoni. It started with a lot off apprehension on his unconventional methods and unexpected tactical decisions as captain. But then luck can be once or twice, genius has consistency. But what set Dhoni apart was not his cricketing prowess. It was his mental strength while pulling of those last over rescue operations day in and day out. The nerves of steel shown while defending small scores. And the ability to bring out the best from young players. So as a fan of both MS & Neeraj Pandey what I expected was the movie would explore this inner journey of the Man. What he speaks to himself while chasing 19 off 6 balls. What does he tell his bowlers during the nail biting finishes. How does he make decisions? by elimination? by intuition? or something else? Something that Chak De India - Movie did brilliantly. It misses the crucial point of how he was appointed the captain. How did the selectors make that decision. No where did we get to see how the character evolved as a leader. The movie turns out to be plain vanilla in terms of its treatment. Borders on too much self indulgence at times. Is painfully long. And as rightly put by my friend Bharath Reddy Ravuru the second half seems like a highlight package of his popular innings. I somehow could not connect with the character and root for him which i did say in case of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Paan Singh Tomar or for that matter even Sultan in spite of knowing the obvious climax. Only saving grace are the honest performances. Otherwise nothing great."

","So finally Bollywood has entered big time in the biopic business with films like Mary Kom, Azhar and MS Dhoni. Clearly, ""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story"" stands much higher on the pedestal. The movie unfolds brilliantly in flashback with Dhoni's childhood innocence mixed with ambitiousness. His struggle to get ahead of the crowd in cricket, life's challenges, friendships and emotions beautifully depicted in the first part. The way Dhoni faced several setbacks depicted why he is considered ""Captain Cool"" in the cricket fraternity because it is not just cricket, it is the way Dhoni has lived his entire life. The way his school sports teacher supported him showed not only his passion but also the vigour with which an average Indian follows cricket. <br/><br/>Although, the second half was a bit of let down. The two love stories were stretched unnecessarily. Our directors need to understand that every movie does not need hero and heroine to sing and dance hand in hand. That part could have been curtailed. First half created a sound base with Dhoni's struggle and entry into national team. But Dhoni's skills, his thinking style, his handling of pressure situations could have been further explored. What goes through Dhoni's mind under crunch situations was not shown. The movie could have gone further in cricket technicalities and shown how Dhoni calculates a particular situation.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie. Movies like this will help boost sports in India and encourage youngsters to pursue career in sports. But our movie makers need to learn a bit on biopic making. This movie goes for a 8 rating but I have rated it 9 out of my passion for cricket and admiration of MS Dhoni as a player and I want more and more people to watch this movie."
"inforaza","8","0","0","6 November 2016"," Well-made film on the great MS Dhoni!
","I really enjoyed watching the biopic of one of the greatest ODI players that India has produced – Mahendra Singh Dhoni (lovingly called as Mahi). Since it is biopic one should not expect it to be presented in the same manner as a conventional film. I wasn't aware of a few things in his life which I got to see in the film.<br/><br/>The film captures Mahi's life from his childhood onwards. But it does not show anything on the goings-on in the dressing room or his relationship with team mates or his growth as a cricketer in the Indian team.<br/><br/>MERITS OF M. S. Dhoni:The Untold Story <br/><br/>1 – The pacing of the film & plot development is very good.<br/><br/>2 – The background music is thrilling.<br/><br/>3 – The special effects look absolutely real! Especially the special make-up effect of Sushant Singh Rajput who is shown to have a very thin physique (including a thin face) while depicting Dhoni during his school days.<br/><br/>More spectacular is Sushant's presence in real cricket footage shaking hands and embracing other members of the cricket team, after winning the 2011 ODI Cricket World Cup.<br/><br/>That to me looked totally real! <br/><br/>4 - Sushant Singh Rajput batting looked very convincing, esp. the Helicopter shot (originally called the ""thapad shot""). In addition, his imitation of the Dhoni walk and body language was perfect.<br/><br/>5 – The film has maintained authenticity in terms of the kind of locations in which Mahi has grown up in.<br/><br/>6 – Bhumika Chawla (played sister of Mahi), Kiara Advani (played Sakshi Malik) and Disha Patani are good actresses.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Disha Patani looks very much like Shradha Kapoor! Loved her gorgeous & infectious smile! <br/><br/>7 – Actor Herry Tangri who played Yuviraj Singh looks almost like Yuvi.<br/><br/>DEMERITS OF M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story <br/><br/>1 – For some strange reason the special make-up effect was not applied on Anupam Kher to make him look a young father during Mahi's childhood days.<br/><br/>All that he had was a black wig. But with heavy eye-bags he looked very old.<br/><br/>2 – The ad shoots of Mahi were shown arbitrarily without any link with the normal flow of the story. This did not look right.<br/><br/>3 – MSD was never shown to kiss or properly embrace the 2 girls he had fallen in love with. Very strange! <br/><br/>4 – May be the film was a bit too long (3 hrs 10 mins).<br/><br/>On second thoughts, may be it has to be; otherwise it will miss out on important things in Mahi's life.<br/><br/>PS: Sad thing is that I saw 8 people leave the cinema hall after 2 hours. I guess they got bored and left. <br/><br/>What were they expecting - Mahi bulldozing several villains and doing bike stunts?"
"Vivekmaru45","7","0","0","3 November 2016"," 2011 was a magical year for M.S. Dhoni and Indian Cricket.
","The film is about the life of cricketer Mahendra Singh as a boy, progressing into teenager and finally as an adult. It shows how he rose above all obstacles to achieve greatness. The film also looks into his personal relationships with the only two women in his life - one who he lost to a tragedy: the late Priyanka Jha and the other who he later met eventually became his wife, Sakshi Rawat.<br/><br/>The film starts with Dhoni's birth. Later we see him as a boy in school training as a goalkeeper. A teacher(who is also a school cricket coach) spots him and notices his goalkeeping ability and immediately realizes what a good wicket-keeper he would be, given the proper training. He calls Dhoni, who at first is reluctant, but then agrees for a trial. <br/><br/>At the trial, he impresses his coach and finally agrees to full-time training. Dhoni's father objects to his concentrating more on cricket rather than focusing his attention on his studies. He eventually goes against his dad's wishes to embark on a career that can only be described as ""magical"". <br/><br/>The film shows the hardships faced by Indian cricketers. We also see the choices faced by the I.C.C.(Indian Cricket Council) when choosing the right cricket player for the Indian team and the politics involved. M.S. Dhoni was among a batch of players that included another legend Yuvraj Singh. Eventually their partnership in cricket would be lethal and a key for the success of the Indian cricket team.<br/><br/>No doubt, a lot of other players contributed to the Cricket World Cup 2011 win: Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Harbhajan Singh and Ravichandran Ashwin among many others. (Full Lineup: http:// www.espncricinfo.com /icc_cricket_worldcup2011 /content /squad /497114.html)<br/><br/>Neeraj Pandey has already captured Bollywood's attention with films like A Wednesday(2008), Special 26(2013), The Royal Bengal Tiger(2014) and Baby(2015).

","Biopics are a different genre altogether. They cannot be classified as romantic, drama or comedy. They depict someone's life events which have different phases. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's biopic is no different.<br/><br/>As is said by one of the most respectable directors of Hollywood, biopics are the easiest way to cheat creativity. The very core of a creative piece is compromised by simply putting true events of a person's life one after another. But if the person is an influential figure, then the film is a treat to its fans.<br/><br/>M.S.Dhoni - The Untold Story, which had created hypes all over by its trailers, delivers an average output. The film depicts the highs and lows of the Indian skipper and clearly shows how captain cool was born. With non linear storytelling being the favorite of every director, Neeraj Pandey preferred a linear pattern right from school days to the winning moment in the history of Indian cricket. Some of the dialogues make an impact on the youth and influences them to take a strong hold on their decision about their passion. What fails to impact is the craft of film making itself. With Neeraj Pandey, donning the director's hat, the expectation for a better screenplay is high. Moreover, few important life stories seem missing (e.g. how he became the captain for the first time). Although the promos clearly say that the film is about the 'journey you don't' know, the missing links could have knitted the film in an appropriate manner.<br/><br/>This film clearly points out at the amateur level special effects that we have and at the same time hints at the potential of the same in a subtle way. Although I am no hair expert, but the wig of long hair,as shown in the initial days of Dhoni, is a bit annoying.<br/><br/>The cast of the film is apt. Anupam Kher is a perfect choice as this man is an institution of acting and can portray any role and can get into anyone's shoes. Bhumika Chawla and Rajesh Sharma acts quite strongly as the characters seem to be in Dhoni's life. I am gradually becoming a fan of Kumud Mishra, whose on screen presence and dialogue delivery is charismatic. And of course, a guest appearance by Kiran More as himself, is a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The biggest challenge of a biopic is for the actors whose creative freedom is curtailed as they have to enact a personality as close to perfection so that the audience is convinced. Sushant Singh Rajput's hard work is evident and shows how much he came close to Dhoni's body language. The scenes from the matches are clear indication of how far this actor has gone to prepare himself. The helicopter shot and the World Cup winning shots are as good as Dhoni himself. Disha Patani steals the thunder from Kiara Advani, long after her on screen time in the film ends. No wonder she has more projects lined up in the future. Probably the best cast in recent few years of Indian cinema is that of Henry Tangiri, as Yuvraj Singh. This actor was born for this role and I wished I had seen more of him in the film.<br/><br/>The music is pretty mediocre especially with Ae Dil Hain Mushkil, ready for release, which is giving away one hit song after another.<br/><br/>The story of the most successful captain of Indian cricket team is indeed an inspiration for all. Certainly things were not easy for Mahi, yet he made his way through. Although this is not Neeraj Pandey's best work, you will still want to cheer on many occasions in this film.<br/><br/>Probably the last clip is where you will want to shout out loud the most.<br/><br/>'Dhoni finishes in style...'"

","M.S Dhoni - the untold story - It seems as if the makers have not altered or exaggerated any element of M.S. Dhoni's life for the purpose of making the movie more viewer friendly, which makes it a genuine biopic. Something to be appreciated. <br/><br/>In terms of acting, I would say Sushant Singh Rajut did an extremely good work, and so did the young actor who played M.S. Dhoni as a kid. The director has convincingly captured the atmosphere of the place where Dhoni grew up. The middle class family, the city of Ranchi etc. <br/><br/>Things change as the movie progresses to the second half post intermission. In the second half, the director gets engrossed in linking the movie with clips of actual games in which Dhoni has played. A lot of screen time is devoted to filming the game on ground as it would appear in late 1990s when viewed on the television and they have also edited footage of the game so that it seems that Sushant Singh Rajput (who is supposed to be Dhoni) is on the field with players like Yuvraj Singh and Tendulkar (not actors playing the part, but the players themselves). In the attempt to concentrate on this, I feel the director missed out on some interesting and important bits. For example - I would like to see more about the process when Dhoni was selected to be the captain or when Dhoni was selected in the Indian team itself. As far as the captaincy is concerned, the movie does not dwell on it all - there is one scene when Dhoni is an player in the team and in the next scene he is the captain. At the time of his selection in the Indian team, there is about 2 minutes of screen time but no emphasis is given to the process of his selection. Also, there is the time when Dhoni is not selected in the team but Yuvraj Singh is because Yuvraj Singh is a much better player and Dhoni says that he needs to practice more - however, there is nothing about how he practices or the steps he takes to make his game better. I would have also liked to see more about his relationship with Sakshi or how his fame changed the dynamics between his friends back home etc. I would have liked to see why he took the decision to change the batting order in the World cup game which they finally won. The director spends less than 10 seconds to show the media created controversies between Dhoni and other players, I would have liked to see more about the implications of these rumors. <br/><br/>The movie is titled M.S. Dhoni - the untold story - but everything shown are common known facts about Dhoni's life - the untold story would be to show how Dhoni felt/reacted at the time he was going through these events, his strategy decisions and blunders.<br/><br/>All in all, at 3 hours and 4 mins, this is pretty long movie. Inspite of that, it seems the director kept on cutting sub-plots in the middle due to lack of time. I feel a little less screen time on filming/editing Sushant Singh Rajput in with real players and more screen time for the actual story would have helped. <br/><br/>In its current form, the second half of the movie feels more like a documentary. A good documentary, but a documentary nonetheless."

","M.S.Dhoni: The Untold Story is a film like many other bollywood films which has a promising first half and becomes disappointing in the second half. Its almost like we are watching 2 films before and after intermission. The first half is extremely well made which shows the hardships Dhoni had to face in getting selected to the Indian team. Sushant Singh Rajput does really well in presenting the character's determination as well as his frustrations in his journey in becoming a successful cricketer. I guess these parts really shows the dark side of being a sportsman in our country. The compromises one has to make in following your passions. It's only after the intermission that the film gets tedious and boring with nothing much to tell about what the character is going through besides his 2 love affairs. It's sad that the writing gets poor in the second half that even Rajput's potential is not utilized as well as in the early portions of the movie. My rating is 6/10"

"kumarvarun1989","6","0","0","10 October 2016"," India's poster boy is pitch perfect
","More five-day Test than Twenty20 blast, Neeraj Pandey's hefty Hindi biopic seizes upon the Indian cricket captain as a long-haired, motorbike-riding poster boy for the country's modernisation. This MS Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) strides out with logo-emblazoned bat on to a succession of pitches incrementally grander than the one his humble engineer father (Anupam Kher) struggled to water; even his erratic development – stuck checking train tickets after a promising student career – seems somehow tied to the state and fate of the nation.<br/><br/>Any Boycottian analysis would rule certain aspects a tad daft – there probably wouldn't be so many midwicket musical montages in The Andrew Strauss Story – and the tone is somewhere between understandably fond and fawning. Still, the on-field activity is convincing, and Rajput makes MSD a winning mix of eyes-on-the-prize focus, square-jawed stoicism and quiet humility.<br/><br/>Pandey holds this career up as cause for communal celebration, and his film has the big-match temperament to set us cheering – or, in this Englishman's case, politely applauding."
"vishal6245","6","0","0","7 October 2016"," Still Untold Story
","First half is about Dhoni's childhood and struggle to get a chance in ""Men in blue"". But in a second half, film disappoint us. It is more about Dhoni's love stories, rather than his tenure as captain of Indian cricket team. He has been honored by making biopic because of his success in cricket. And in a three-hour lengthy film, the director has hardly captured the soul of cricket. The scene, about his rivalry with Yuvraj Singh while under 19 team selection is really good. After becoming Indian Team Captain, his relations with senior as well as junior players, strategies behind big wins should have been given weight rather than his personal life. Dhoni is one of the best wicket-keepers in the world. He is known for unorthodox skills in wicket keeping, But in the film, the focus is on only batting tenure.<br/><br/>After watching the trailer, I had doubts about the performance of Sushant Rajput as a Dhoni. (Just intuition). But he has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly.<br/><br/>Sushant Singh didn't have to act for on-field scenes. Special effect team has worked very well by mixing Sushant's face to Dhoni's body in actual cricket matches. It is a shortcut for showing realistic scenes but worked well.<br/><br/>Hey Guys...

"samfox-956-519711","7","0","0","2 October 2016"," MS Dhoni - A Decent Effort
","My MS DHONI review<br/><br/>With so many great cricketers in our country, why choose Dhoni for a biopic? Well, he might not have the best technique or the best records but he has always been a natural. He is a gladiator, a smiling assassin, a cool headed general who is silently aggressive. True, he does not win all his gambles but he always dares and has been instrumental in changing the team's fortunes. It is his imperfection and iconic yet 'every-man' identity which has captured the imagination of a cricket crazy nation. Coupled with this is the fact, that his story from his very humble background when he was least interested in cricket to becoming one of the most popular faces in the sport is both interesting and awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>The first half is fresh and engrossing telling us about a young Dhoni's initiation into cricket as a boy, his simple life in a small, laid back town, how he started making a name for himself with friends and well wishers rallying around him, his missed opportunities, how he landed a job of a TTE in Railways (on the strength of his talent alone) and how he finally chucked the job to play full time cricket. <br/><br/>Sadly, the second half fails to sustain the momentum. One can clearly make out that the producers and Dhoni did not wish to court controversy when the names of senior players(suggested to be dropped by Dhoni) are muted in the conversation between Dhoni and the selectors. While some might say that it takes away the spice from the plot, personally, I am okay with it. A movie 'does not have' to be controversial to be good!<br/><br/>Having said that, not portraying any other major player, no changing room banter and no on field chatter are absolutely major flaws in the script. The slightly longer (than required) footage for both of Dhoni's love interests and the songs slow down the pace and distract the viewer. The ample use of real match clips with SUSHANT's face morphed on Dhoni's body is both good and bad. Good because it lends a certain air of authenticity to the script and Bad because beyond a certain point, it seems repetitive and documentary like. <br/><br/>SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT with his mild voice and average looks does not really fit into the conventional Bollywood hero mould but he manages to get by. Here as MS DHONI, he has essayed the role really well and this is by far his best performance. His unassuming dialogue delivery and controlled emotions are in tune with the character and he stays within the limits of his abilities. His well rehearsed accent doesn't sound fake and he has successfully replicated Dhoni's playing style, stance and mannerisms. <br/><br/>ANUPAM KHER can walk through such roles with his eyes closed. Needless to say, he does a good job as Dhoni's father but is so predictable that somehow he fails to excite.<br/><br/>RAJESH SHARMA follows up his wonderful performances in Ishqiya, Tanu Weds Manu Returns and Special 26 with another flawless act as Dhoni's first coach. KUMUD MISHRA delivers a swell performance close on the heels of his neat portrayal as Salman's coach in SULTAN. The actor who plays AK Ganguly, the Railways Boss (who is also a cricket enthusiast), is so much into his character that one cannot make out that he is acting. Both DISHA PATANI (as Dhoni's first girlfriend) and KIARA ADVANI (as Sakshi Dhoni) look pretty, do not overact and give fair performances.<br/><br/>The movie celebrates Dhoni's uplifting life story and the passion for the game without being in-your-face. It gives hope that even a small town boy can make it big given the talent and support (and timely luck, of course). The common man can identify with him because DHONI, the star, is 'Humanly' Superhuman. Had it not been for the flaws, the film could have been like Dhoni........calm and understated yet..brutally effective. <br/><br/>The movie is definitely watchable. Even as I am writing this, the weekend box office collection is crossing 60 croresAb(D)HONI ko kaun taal sakta hai !! <br/><br/>Sameer Singh Thapa"

","MS Dhoni - The Untold Story - My Rating - 3.5/5 As a Cricket fan, As a Dhoni fan and critic, you will absolutely love this movie and probably become a fan of Sushant Singh. But as a cinema fan and a Neeraj Pandey fan, its probably not his best movie, but best 1st half. <br/><br/>There are 2 movies in this 1 movie. Before interval, it shows Dhoni's struggle in cricket right from his childhood in an Indian middle class family where the only important thing is a ""Good Job"". 2nd half, its all about the actual Dhoni that we already know, Fast 100s, 2007 and 2011 World cups and love life. You'll feel goosebumps on key Moments, and its not just because of Dhoni, its because of Sushant. You can see his hard preparation for the role that he has actually played the exact replica of him. His batting style, his walking style, and even not showing emotion to anyone but you can feel that its there. Amazing Performance.<br/><br/>Of course, 2nd half winning moments made me feel nostalgic but it was just events after events happening, like they show the relationship with Sakshi and then marriage and then suddenly Dhoni hits a six and wins the World cup. There's no connection or lead up to the big event. Also, makes the movie tooooooo long, like 3 hrs 10 mins long.<br/><br/>Also, someone played Yuvi, Bhai ne leli Dhoni ki, ek hi scene me. Kiran More was there as Kiran More, and he is the worst actor ever. The two actresses did what they could, smile smile smile ""Dhoni I love you"" n stuff. Good use of CGI putting Sushant's face everywhere in all intl. matches.<br/><br/>Its a must watch for Sushant Singh, and for Dhoni of course."

I'll try to give the answers... but u have to read this post with patience.. <br/><br/>firstly i must let u know that i am a die hard fan of four famous persons.. & they are... 1. the god of cricket, 2. the captain cool 3. The king of romance & 4. The Mozart of madras .... & this movie deals with of my idols i.e. the captain cool(by the way i am the fan of the finisher & captain dhoni not a fan of lover dhoni)... so... as a die hard fan i know almost every damn thing about him whatever TV has broadcast-ed and internet has published all through these years... what i didn't know was the inside stories.... no no no... i m not talking about controversies... after watching numerous biopics i knew very well that there will be no controversial sequences in this movie also... i am a matured movie goer u know...!! By saying inside stories i meant what was running inside my most beloved captains head in numerous occasions like after getting sudden captaincy before 2007t20wc & how did he prepare himself mentally for that or what did he think before giving the final over to joginder sharma in the final of the same WC or what was going through his mind before promoting himself up in the wc2011 final despite having poor form throughout the tournament(i knew he promoted himself up because i have watched the match many times and if i want to revisit those priceless moments then youtube is there for me.... all i wanted to know was.. why did he do so?? How did he get the confidence?? What was he thinking at that moment??? I went to watch this movie only to find the answers of these questions & to live those moments once again as well) and of course i wanted to know about his struggles right from his childhood days... the first half of the movie has managed to answer my last question by showing his earlier struggles brilliantly... but the 2nd half fails to answer my other questions miserably... how he became the greatest finisher??? How he became captain cool?? What motivated him to do such wonders while finishing matches or how did he manage to make the boldest of decisions as a captain?? What made him one of the finest match readers???? These questions remained unanswered... may be the director also thinks that msd is the ""most luckiest captain"" may be that's why he didn't bother to show the inside stories & dedicated the second half to his love life entirely... but Mr neeraj pandey u should know that these are the things(not his love life) which made msd the best finisher or the captain cool... so neeraj pandey gets a big zero from me despite making a brilliant 1st half... i m totally disappointed with his work in the 2nd half & with this movie as well...!! <br/><br/>The only good thing of this movie is... the performances of all the actors... but among all of them the immensely talented sushant singh rajput shines and shines like the mighty sun... he delivers his 200% in this movie... got a role of a lifetime & nailed it completely... hats off to his dedication... he was more than perfect in each & every frame... enjoyed his performance through out the movie... in fact he was the only reason why i glued to the seat till the end... deserves 100/100 for his epic performance...!!!!<br/><br/>So the bottom line is... m s dhoni the movie provides ""untold story"" in the first half and ""told & exaggerated story"" in the second half... overall... a disappointing movie..!!<br/><br/>And to finish it off in style(like msd) i would like to add a few more lines... if u have read this damn lengthy post completely & still survived then its alright.... but if u didn't.... then i must say this movie is 3hrs & 15mins long which is much much much more lengthy than this one... how will you survive that?????? :) :)"

","First things first: How is the movie: Not good (When I compare it to the likes of Cinderella Man, Pele, Fighter and so on.)<br/><br/>We are presented with same old multiple times told story of a common man to exceptional man. Its portrayed as Untold Story with a label of a great player over it and VIOLA - People going gaga over it like its one of the best biopic ever. But its nowhere even close to what it should have been.<br/><br/>What is wrong with the movie?<br/><br/>LOVE SONG - The only thing that pops in my mind is ""WHY??"". Why there has to be a love song every time. Why can't it be a real life romantic situation where characters are more believable. Instead of wasting 5 minutes over a futile song, it could have been used for better character and situation development.<br/><br/>INNOVATION - It lacks innovation in terms of direction and cinematography. Portrayal of intense sequences limited only to Slow Motion camera work with a person standing in front of it and totally confused if he/she should shed tears (and look weak) or not (and look strong). Its accompanied with a typical Bollywood background score that desperately attempts to squeeze out a few teardrops, but fails.<br/><br/>THE UNTOLD STORY - As the title suggests, the focus of the whole deal should have never been a series of events that happened in the life of MS Dhoni. Its already known what events occurred in his life or one can simply google it. The real untold would have been - What crossed Dhoni's mind when he was hit by tough situations? How the world looked through his eyes when he was struggling? Unfortunately the movie fails terribly to tell this untold aspect of a great player.<br/><br/>REAL LIFE FOOTAGES - There is nothing wrong with footage (Apart from poor VFX), but the problem is that it gets extremely repetitive after a while. Its like watching 2 couples of typical Dhoni shots over and over again for some 40 minutes - which in my opinion is not very gripping.<br/><br/>After 3 hours and 5 minutes, when I came out of the theater with a minor headache, it felt like the Director Neeraj Pandey ran out of ideas pretty much in the early stages of the production and decided to juggle between real life cricket clips, love scenes and day to day events in Dhoni's life. Tragically the juggling din't go well and all the juggling balls got floored. All in all the movie deserves no more than 5.0/10.0"

","MS Dhoni movie had a great premise. The story of one of the most popular cricketer in India. MS Dhoni has struggled early in his career to achieve success. Dhoni had his mercurial success in a short span of time. And the records speaks of it. In his road to success, Dhoni had his fair shared of controversies. After all Indian Cricket is always front page news all the time.<br/><br/>As far as the movie goes, the first half captures aptly his struggles and frustrations in life. Unlike Yuvraj Singh,Dhoni had to work his way to the top. The first half is the best part of the movie and Neeraj Pandey nailed it perfectly.<br/><br/>The trouble started in the 2nd half where Dhoni enters Indian Team. The movie clearly stays safe away from controversies and conflicts with teammates. It does not give any any inroads to what Dhoni thinks in those controversial times. My guess is that Neeraj Pandey started with the right intent but end up making a superficial content to keep Dhoni happy and content. Also there might be objections from BCCI and players like Yuvraj Singh, Viraat Kohli, Virendra Shehwag etc. It is very difficult to make a biopic of a living legend. Hence it left the movie high and dry.<br/><br/>Also to make the matter, the unnecessary introduction of love interest ( 2 of them). The subplot of love life of Dhoni brought the pace of the movie to a complete halt. Neeraj Pandey is not good with romantic scenes ( its a Karan Johar zone), we saw the example in his previous movies like Baby and Special26.<br/><br/>Great performances from Sushant Singh Rajput( the best of his career till date!).<br/><br/>Finally the length of the movie was 3hr 5mins. That was awfully long.<br/><br/>The movie is a mass movie capturing the best cricketing moments of Dhoni in his career. They are memorable and people will definitely love it.

Coming to the film, the film starts with the world cup 2011 scene and then runs in flashback. The editing could have been a lot better but Sushant Singh Rajput definitely covers that up with a lot of hard work and a great performance. He looks like a perfect fit for MSD's role as if it was written for him. Everybody knows that he is a very talented actor and he truly shows that. Anupam Kher does a fantastic job too. Other actors also carry out their roles neatly and give a mind blowing experience. These were some of the high points but sadly there are a few negative points too which are: 1. The slow pace of the first half. 2. The run time is too long (186 minutes. approx.) 3. The editing is not that great. 4. The love songs add to the run time issue. Overall despite these negatives the film manages to entertain you and if you are a cricket fan, it's a must watch and in case you are not, it is a family film which includes sports, drama, comedy, as well as a romantic angle. Still the film is clean and is a family watch until you have too small kids as they might get irritated with a 3 hour long film."

His struggle is shown perfectly in the film but his success was not shown with the perfection. VFX work is excellent where technical team have put SSR instead of Dhoni in Cricket match footage. SSR gave performance of his life but variations in character weren't there so he's not my favorite to win Awards. Supporting Starcast is impressive as well. Music is let down, till interval music doesn't irritate you but after interval it does. Screenplay which is 184 Minutes long is bit boring and very stretched, film could have easily been trimmed for 30 minutes by removing songs and few melodramatic and some unnecessary scenes. Cinematography is good but not excellent. Thanks to VFX and Stadium scenes which are eye pleasing and enough to give you Goosebumps. My favorite scene from Film is When Child MSD asks his Mom to buy Sachin Tendulkar's Poster. Direction is let down, Neeraj Pandey is Class Director so even small mistake from him will be considered as big. And Considering his last 3 Films (Baby, Special 26, A Wednesday) this is his Weakest Film till date. Coming to the box Office predictions, Film will have great weekend and good run at Box Office. Film should join 100cr club and i don't expect anything less or more than this. Overall it is a Good and One time watchable Flick which had the potential to become a Classic but spoiled by couple of mistakes of Director. Go for it and you won't come back with a disappoint face. 7/10* Stars by me."

","It's a clear sign that a movie isn't working for you when you start looking at your watch. But when you start shaking your watch because you think it might have stopped, you know this film has failed.Meerabai Not Out is an excruciatingly slow-paced comedy about a cricket- obsessed school teacher, Meera, played by Mandira Bedi, whose as-yet-single status is blamed on the fact that nothing and no one gets her juices flowing the way the game does. Her middle-class family is committed to finding her an eligible groom, but because she can't seem to get her priorities sorted, it's become impossible to find a match for her. When she does meet her soul-mate eventually - a young doctor, played by television actor Eijaz Khan - and prepares to settle down with him, she finds herself confronted with the challenge of having to choose between love and cricket.Predictable every step of the way, Meerabai Not Out is the kind of film that expects you to sit patiently while the characters and the screenplay slowly arrive at the inevitable conclusion. What happens, and how and why, will be perfectly clear to any attentive viewer as soon as the plot lays down its tracks."

Everyone knows that dhoni can't bat he was there in the team or as a captain only because of politics in Indian cricket board.

","In recent year (2016), we have seen many biopics based on real life. Starting from Sarabjit, Neerja, Airlift, Azhar, Veerappan & Rustom, all movies are critically acclaimed, but some are rejected by audience on Box Office. Today's release M.S. Dhoni is the most awaiting movie of 2016. M.S. Dhoni is the untold story of Indian Cricket team Captain's journey from ticket collector to Cricketer. Currently these year we have seen Azhar- Movie based on real life of Cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin, which was rejected by the audience and flop on Box Office. Will M.S. Dhoni lands in the list of hit biopics or join the list of flop biopics. Let's analyze<br/><br/>Movie starts with the final match of India V/S Sri Lanka at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Dhoni hits winning six and helps India to win the World Cup 2011. Then movie went into back flesh and shows us the childhood of M.S. Dhoni, shows us struggle of M.S. Dhoni to be a famous cricketer. After many attempt for Indian Cricket team, He does not get chance. One day He got an offer to job as TC in Kolkata. He accept the same and went to Kolkata for job, but due to his passion for cricket, He left that job and again went to his home town. After several tries He get chance to play for Indian Cricket team. One day while traveling in plan, he meets to Priyanka Jha (Disha Patani) and they fall in love with each other. These relationship is no long relationship, as Priyanka met with a car accident. After these incident, Dhoni is little bit upset and can't concentrate on his game. One day suddenly, He met with Sakshi (Kaira Adbani) and they start meeting to each other. They fall in love and get married. After long back flesh, story continues where its stop. The final game of India V/S Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>M.S. Dhoni has everything to offer to the audience. Drama, Romance, Superb performances, tight screenplay and story line, which hooks to the audience till end though movie has run time of more than 180 minutes. Director Neeraj Pandey was known for his Thriller movies like 'A Wednesday!', 'Special 26' & 'Baby'. Currently these year as a Producer also he has given super hit movie 'Rustom'. These time Neeraj Pandey has tried different genre and he has excellently handled it.<br/><br/>If we talk about Performances, Sushant Singh Rajput has done excellent job and given complete justice to the role of M.S. Dhoni. He carried the full movie on his shoulder. He is back bone of Movie. Anupam Kher as 'Pan Singh' (Dhoni's father) performed very well. Other Actors- Disha Patani as Priyanka Jha (Dhoni's Girlfriend), Kaira Advani as Sakshi Dhoni, Bhoomika Chawla as Jayanti Gupta (Dhoni's Sister), Herry Tangiri as 'Yuvraj Singh' helps movie to move forward and have done decent job.<br/><br/>Overall, M.S. Dhoni is the most magnificent Biopic comes out from Bollywood in recent time. Must Go For it. Worth Watching."

The entire theater (which would be around 10 people on the first day of release) was laughing at every point in the story because of its stupidity, even the ""tragic"" moments at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>PS : Show me one cricketer who can hit a ball so high and hard, that it would break the floodlights : Watched it because I had a few hours to kill and in hindsight I should have just wasted those three hours staring at the sky then watching this movie."

","Sushant Singh Rajput's talent comes full circle with 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story'. As the cricket legend, Sushant gives his all in a performance, that comes across as an embodiment, rather than an impersonation. <br/><br/>'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' explores the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, right from his journey from being a ticket collector, to a trophy collector and the world-cup-winning captain of the Indian Cricket Team.<br/><br/>Director Neeraj Pandey chooses a worthy true-story as his latest project, but succeeds only partially. The film is too long at 3-hours & the Writing is never remarkable. Of course, Dhoni is a man made of pure merit, who's seen tremendous struggle, before emerging into a phenomenon. But, 'The Untold Story' has an average Screenplay, that arrests in parts.<br/><br/>Pandey & Dilip Jha's Screenplay is alright. Despite choosing to tell the story of a real-life euphoric figure, the Writing never soars. It works in parts & works best when it sees its protagonist off the pitch. Also, the Dialogue are surprisingly weak. Definitely, a much stronger Screenplay was the need of the day! Pandey's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Various Artists, is melodious.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Sushant is great, no two options on that! Of the rest of the cast, Anupam Kher is remarkable as Dhoni's father, delivering a genuinely heartfelt performance from start to end. Rajesh Sharma is wonderful as Banerji, who's the first to realize Dhoni's potential. Kumud Mishra excels as well. Bhumika Chawla as Dhoni's Sister is nice & its refreshing to see her on-screen after so long. Kiara Advani as Dhoni's Wife & Disha Patani as Dhoni's Girlfriend, are strictly okay.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' rests on Sushant Singh Rajput's genuine talent to sail through."
"ajaipdeep","10","1","2","12 October 2016"," Great Direction + Great Acting + Great Story = Great Movie
","Before I start, I am not a Dhoni fan as many of you may think and I am a great fan of Yuvi. So whats so special about this movie???????<br/><br/>IT WAS MADE PERFECTLY. Even some tiny details (like birthmark) was portrayed in this movie. Rajput's acting was marvelous. As he said, he really became MS rather than copying him. He may not look like him, but sure can be like him. I'd also have to say that it was a fanboy approach Neeraj Pandey took in this movie as he focused mainly on how MS Dhoni became the Captain Cool, we love and hate and did not give attention to the mistake's he made.<br/><br/>Also, many of us did not know about the life of MS other than he was TC.Neeraj Pandey made it clear for everyone that the road from a TC to a cricket captain was not easy and it was a lot difficult. It also showed us the tragic story of Priyanka Jha.<br/><br/>Another thing I would like to point out was the portrayal of YUVARAJ SINGH, I mean Herry Tangri looks and acts perfectly like him.That attitude he has, MAN IT WAS DAMN AWESOME<br/><br/>Overall, it was great and I am suggesting this movie to all of you guys."
"Pramitheus","8","1","2","8 October 2016"," There is and will be only one MSD
","The man we know, the story we don't. Dhoni and his story is worth being made as a movie and thank you Neeraj Pandey for bringing our Captain Cool onto the big screen with such finesse.<br/><br/>Starting with the acting performances, Sushant Singh Rajput probably got his dream role and he doesn't leave an inch where you can point out that was overdone or wasn't like Dhoni. He has absorbed each and every nuance of Dhoni and has become a replica and as most are saying, the amount of practice that he has done he does deserve to play for the Indian team, even if it is a charity match alongside the real Dhoni. Every character has been cast with extreme care and all of them do their job very well. Disha Patani does seem a bit cold but considering this is her 1st movie she can be given a pass.<br/><br/>Coming to the direction, Neeraj Pandey gives a emotionally driven biopic. The 1st half is filled with how Dhoni was before he became MSD right from his childhood to puberty to adulthood. The problem is with the 2nd half which feels a bit stretched but as it is important phases of his life it wouldn't have been fair if it wasn't shown. It just adds to his character and makes us feel how much Dhoni can actually take before breaking down, and boy it's a lot. Editing is almost seamless. Very nice use of minimal graphics to put Sushant in Dhoni's place<br/><br/>My final verdict: There are many reasons to not watch this, you may not like cricket or you may not like Dhoni, you may not like biopics, you may think he got it too soon. There is only one reason to watch this and that is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. If you love the guy and respect what he has done for the Indian cricket team I'll urge you to go watch it because there is and will be only one Mahendra Singh Dhoni."

","M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian biographical sports film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. It based on the life of Indian cricketer and the current ODI and T20I captain of the Indian national cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni, along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The film chronicles the life of Dhoni from a young age and the series of life events that finally culminates to his stardom in the realm of cricket.<br/><br/>The idea of the biopic was put forward by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey, after encountering an incident at an airport after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. Development began two years later, with the consent of Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey was later approached to helm the film while he was working on Baby. Pandey recruited a number of people for researching into Dhoni's background and his life events. Dhoni eventually became a consultant on the film.Great movie must watch such inspirational story will definitely rewarded. I have now started finding movie on www.flickstree.com.

Kiara Advani and Disha Patani look fresh and promising. Anupam Kher as usual impresses everyone with his acting acumen.

"freewebstennis","10","1","2","5 October 2016"," Recommended!
","I recommend people to watch it. Well I gave 10 rating not because it was super awesome but I felt there were many haters who are rating it too low. So I want to balance it out. My original rating would be 8/10. Why you would I recommend it?<br/><br/>We all want to the life of Dhoni before world Cup. After world cup we all knew how popular he became and it should not be considered as untold story. So haters who are pointing about controversies not presented in film must learn that it's about an untold story. <br/><br/>1st half of the movie was truly inspirational and we appreciate how Dhoni chose cricket after having tough times. It also shows that it was not just pure talent and work but a set of things that drove Dhoni to choose cricket. So it looked very real to me. Not everyone can become cricketer but sometimes destiny also chooses you and Ganguly chose Dhoni ;) It was fun to watch Yuvi's character but I expected more of him probably in second half but it was not the case. <br/><br/>2nd half felt slow with the love stories. It's not that I hate love stories but it had some unnecessary scenes where I felt it started to drag. That's where I felt this movie lost some points. However, the climax with the world cup final was awesome. So overall I would rate it 8/10. (2 points minus- for the love story drag)<br/><br/>I recommend people who want to know how Dhoni lived before the world cup, go and watch it. He is like us and it is a good film!"
"rohonnag","9","1","2","1 October 2016"," A Straight Sixer !
","This movie is, as they say in cricket, a sixer! It hits it right out of the stadium and keeps going! M.S.Dhoni follows the story of India's most successful cricket captain, right from his birth to his victory at the 2011 world cup.<br/><br/>First off, let me say, I am not a big fan of cricket, or follow the sports closely. But despite this, the movie works on a very human level. Even non cricket fans who have a basic idea of how the game works, will be able to enjoy this film. Having said that, this film is an ABSOLUTE treat for cricket fans, they have shown all of dhoni's real matches with the lead actor's face morphed on the real person. So we get shots of the hero being hugged by Tendulkar, Yuvraj singh etc. its quite amazing to watch and it reminds me of similar accomplishment in 1994's Forrest Gump, though this movie is far more extensive in that regards.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, they managed to get most of it right. The Story and plot is based on the real life and hence there is drama but no melodrama or over the top scenes. Lets talk about the acting, Sushant Singh blends into the role of M.S Dhoni perfectly, it feels like we are watching the real person, his attitude, his smile, the way he speaks. The actor gets it perfect.<br/><br/>The rest of the entourage is perfectly casted and acted, the Bengalis in the story LOOK, talk and behave like bongs (I am one, so I can tell if its fake or real). The parents and relatives of Dhoni is done competently and believably.<br/><br/>The art direction in this film is amazing, it feels like a documentary, the sets or locations are SO authentic. Small houses are actually small and claustrophobic. The props are era appropriate. Kudos to the art team.<br/><br/>Now we come to the direction of the film. Neeraj Pandey is one of indias best and often under-rated director. He has the eye for detail, but he doesn't sacrifice the moments for details sake. His direction has subtle humor without any huge laugh out loud moments. One particular scene, when the lead is sitting in pouring rain in the train station, watching his destiny pass him by, it's amazing in cinematography, art and direction wise. Right before this scene, we see the lead actor pass a WORK in Progress sign, thereby explaining why in the middle of the day on a huge junction an entire platform will be empty. That is a director's talent right there. Details and emotions both!<br/><br/>Lastly the music. Right from the trailer, the music was amazing, they use it rather well in the film and the score really sells the film. There are no songs per se, they mostly just accompany the scenes. But this movie wouldn't seem half as good if the music wasn't done SO well.<br/><br/>Cricket fans will obviously go and see this film, but this one manages to reach all audiences, from the smart multiplex audience to the single theaters, there is something for everyone. Make no mistake, this film is already a hit because of the real person's super sports star status. But the film being good will contribute to its sustainability and reaching the non-cricket fan masses too. I personally really like biopics, especially sports ones, which are more uplifting than usual and in doing so, Neeraj Pandey has made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Rating : 9/10. A masterpiece and rather well made, genuine and uplifting film with an amazing score."

"chitreshgupta","10","1","2","4 October 2016"," Sushant Singht Rajput Should Take Home An Award For M.S. Dhoni
","I tried really hard to be objective about this film, but eventually I decided it's futile. If you make a biopic on the most successful captain of the Indian cricket team, on the man whose technique was so unique, sports journalists had to invent a name for his particular shot, on the man who brought home the World Cup, one cannot be detached. So there, I really liked M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, because I really like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the legend, but that doesn't mean it's perfect.<br/><br/>Sushant Singh Rajput has given his soul to this role and it shows. He's mastered the helicopter shot (which has an interesting origin story), his mannerisms and body language are spot on. Before the interval, we see Dhoni's struggles, some already documented and some not. Anupam Kher does a fine job as his father who just wants his son to get a stable job, Bhumika Chawla is decent as his sister. The supporting cast is good too, though not fleshed out enough. There's one friend called Santosh, who really likes beer and is a good cricketer, but nothing more is shown of him. He drunk calls Dhoni too, but he's cut off abruptly and the next time we him, he's cheering for MSD. The reason for his call is never revealed or even acknowledged. I would have preferred more time to be given to his friendship than the love stories in the film. Disha Patani makes a confident debut as Priyanka, MSD's ex-girlfriend and Kiara Advani is nice as Sakshi Dhoni, but honestly, these two tracks really slowed the movie down. The director Neeraj Pandey, who is known to not play safe, sadly paid more attention to Dhoni's love life, instead of the very interesting 'politics' in the dressing room or the various and controversial selections that took place during his reign. Thankfully, they have shown a young Yuvraj Singh, played by Herry Tangri, who looks remarkably similar to Yuvraj and has got his swag spot on.<br/><br/>Santosh Thundiyil's cinematography is sleek, especially Dhoni's matches and his training montage. Shree Narayan Singh's editing is a little abrupt and sometimes the movie seems a little too jumpy. Special props to visual effects team who have made the super fit and buff Sushant look like a young skinny teenage boy and then super imposed his face on the real Dhoni while showing real footage of his matches. Neeraj Pandey has done a good job in fleshing out a character like Dhoni, especially his frustrations as a ticket collector, and his incredible journey to become the Captain Cool of the Indian cricket team. This film hits all the correct spots before every big innings played by the man. His unforgettable 148 against Pakistan, India winning the One-Day series against Australia, the 2007 T-20 World Cup win, all of them have been shown with a lot more drama attached (like we needed anymore). Sushant deserves an award for his impeccable performance.<br/><br/>WARNING: Seeing the real Dhoni's smiling face at the end of the movie might make you ugly cry, so let those tears flow."

","how many of us celebrate our failures rather than mourning over them? This movie has a lot to teach. A simple middle class boy becomes a legendary cricket captain and wins all big tournaments leading his team from the front. Such a story deserves recognition. At least for all those who think their lives are approaching a dead end. Sushant Singh Rajput is the star and soul of this movie. one cannot pick out a single loophole in the kind of act he has put up.The supporting cast including the outstanding as always Anupam kher, Rajesh Sharma, kumud Mishra, Bhoomika Chawla and others are superb. they all look to have mastered the conventional Bihari accent. the actresses got limited number of frames and have one song each and they have done a good job.

"arupghose","10","1","2","3 October 2016"," Cinematic excellence at it's absolute best!
","Doing a biopic is a tough job, especially when it is of a cricketer who is a national hero, loved like no other with a fan following no less than a big actor but hats off to Neeraj Pandey for nailing this one. <br/><br/>The film shows us the struggles of a young and determined Dhoni's ambition to become an Indian National team cricketer. The story grips you throughout! As you learn more and more about this amazing player and captain, your respect goes up for him by 10 times because of what he went through to get there. He isn't just your average man, and the film shows exactly why that's the case. <br/><br/>Neeraj Pandey is no doubt one of the best directors in the industry. His films are straight to the point, minus the commercial nonsense which too many of today's films contains. I loved A Wednesday, Special Chabbis and Baby so much, so I was so excited to watch this, and he hasn't disappointed. The amount of detail he has gone into is amazing. <br/><br/>As for the performances, Sushant's performance was breathtaking! As a cricketer myself, I can appreciate the work he put into really understanding the game and learning how to bat like Dhoni. It is safe to say that his hard work paid off - he's mannerisms, the way he walks to the creases and the shots were practically perfect and at no point do you think that this isn't Dhoni himself! This is no doubt his best work, and in my opinion the best male lead performance of the year to date! As for the two leading ladies, they both looked beautiful and did justice to their role. What can you say any Anupam Kher which hasn't been said before? He excels in every Neeraj Pandey film, and he does it again as Dhoni's father. All the other support case is excellent. I really like Dhoni's friend circle in the film and how they support him throughout all his troubles. <br/><br/>The music of the film is another highlight. Amaal Malik has done wonders and delivered one of the best albums of the year. Jab Tak, Kaun Tujhe, Besabriyaan are 3 of the best songs of the album and go perfectly with the film. Again, I'm happy there's no 'commercial' rubbish like an item song, which would have ruined the film. <br/><br/>Yes the film is over 3 hours but it honestly doesn't feel long enough. You won't want to leave the cinema hall because you'll feel you haven't found out enough about the legend. I can't wait to watch the film again!"

Dhoni - An Untold Story is a decent attempt at exploring and revealing the unheard story and unseen side of the greatest cricketers of his age.<br/><br/>First of all, Sushant Singh Rajput deserves a special mention above all; hats-off to his dedication to get underneath the skin of such a closed and reserved character. He embodies MSD in every possible sense: be it his walking style, accent and pronunciation of certain words, his batting style (along with the famous 'Helicopter Shot') and body language in general.<br/><br/>CGI is used in places where it was necessary to do so, it is a bit shaky at some places but overall does a fair job.<br/><br/>Herry Tangri (Yuvraj Singh) portrays his brief part brilliantly. Anupam Kher is again a class act as a concerned middle class father. Other characters support the story well.<br/><br/>Disha (who plays Dhoni's girlfriend Priyanka) and Kiara Advani ( Sakshi Dhoni) are good in their respective spaces.<br/><br/>Songs are kept at a minimum which viewers will not mind given the run-time it will add to the film.<br/><br/>People expecting to see the scandals in detail (or at all), his thinking during crucial high pressure situations on-field, his wicket-keeping skills in the making are in for a disappointing ride (I was particularly annoyed about them not showing what a brilliant wicket-keeper he had become)<br/><br/>However, his journey from a goalkeeper in school to a railway TTE in Kharagpur is shown elaborately, which is not entirely untold but still presented from a fresh perspective.<br/><br/>Dialogues are excellent as well in some places (A K Ganguly's pep talk to Mahi on PF 8 is worth a mention here!)<br/><br/>The length is a bit concerning given that they'd have skipped some romantic sections entirely to save the viewers' ordeal.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of cricket and M S Dhoni in general, then go for it!"
"skalwani","7","1","2","1 October 2016"," A peek at a slice of life of a famous Indian sports figure
","I went into this movie on the day it was released in North America, watched it on the big screen, with an open mind. Not since ""Lagaan"" and ""Chak De India"", have we had a decent sports-oriented Indian movie, which evokes a great deal of joy, pride and satisfaction. Happily this movie does that job and remains true to the title (despite several folks thinking it was incomplete). We get to see how this sports icon of India, grows up as a child in a province which discourages sports as means of making a living, the numerous struggles to gain acceptance, the subtle behind the scenes machinations, political maneuvers, highs and lows, extreme disappointment and despair, the almost drowning like sensation of feeling trapped as a misfit in the stagnant existence and finally summing up the courage to break free.<br/><br/>I also loved the touch of non-cricket/non-sports related history of the main characters, no spoilers here, but the director has done a decent job of capturing the emotional hits taken along the journey of life. Very stoic responses to many of the roller coasters, several of the folks you meet along the way dispensing philosophical metaphors. The women cast in the movie did a very good job, played their roles and made it very believable. The support of the true childhood friends, the small town sights, sounds and smells was well done. If there is a slight flaw it was the use of computer graphic/video imagery where they superimpose the actor's face on the real video clips, came across as very amateurish or were too obvious. The director was able to coax out of all the cast the characteristic trait of deference and demeanor one sees in that part of the world, gave it an authentic feel.<br/><br/>A worth while watch for all Indian sports lovers and families as well."

","M.S.Dhoni The Untold Story (2016): Biopics are getting good response these days in India.This year we already have Airlift,Neerja,Veerappan etc......Now its the time of Indian Winning Captain and one of the best finishers of the world...The Man who gave 2 world cups for India...M.S.Dhoni.Directed by one of the most critical acclaimed film maker Neeraj Pandey,this movie has raised expectation since its project announcement.Sushanth Singh Rajput had did a lot of makeover such that he can easily makes us believe him as Dhoni.So how is it??<br/><br/>Plot: The movie follows the journey of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a budding cricketer from Ranchi becoming the most successful captain of Indian Cricket Team . The movie begins its screenplay with the ICC Cricket World Cup Final (India vs Sri Lanka) in the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is watching the match live on screen. He decides to take the stand, and tells the authorities that he would go for batting if the wicket falls down. Dhoni takes up his bat and leads down the stairs amidst the roar of the crowd. The movie then sets to a flashback in Ranchi, Bihar, India set in 7 July 1981.<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Performances: Sushant Singh Rajput is the major highlight of M.S.Dhoni.He lived in the role of Dhoni with such a ease that we never see him as Sushanth but we can see only Dhoni on screen.Sushanth spent a lot of time observing Dhoni's style and living.Hats off! to his dedication level.Anupam Kher as Dhoni's father,Bhumika as Dhoni's sister and Disha Patani as Priyanaka,Dhoni's first girlfriend(who died unfortunately) did an ultimate job.<br/><br/>2)Screenplay and Direction: Neeraj Pandey did good job in directing this biopic.Screenplay is very engaging especially in first half.Dhoni's child hood is brilliantly made.<br/><br/>3)First half: First half is very good.It deals with Dhoni's unknown life,his child hood,his job etc.. are well made.Especially the role of Yuvraj Singh is brilliant,though its only for single scene.<br/><br/>4)Music: Music by Amaal Malik is decent with good BGM and songs.<br/><br/>Minus Points: <br/><br/>1)Missed perfection: M.S.Dhoni The Untold Story has missed a lot of interesting points which make Dhoni a special one.This movie only concentrates on his individual scores,striking batting but never shows his most influential captaincy and coolness.The way he changed Indian team and introduced new players has never got any scope in this movie.<br/><br/>2)Duration: This movie has lengthy duration of 3hr 10 min.I wont say that it lags but few scenes could have be trimmed for effectiveness.<br/><br/>3)Predictability: M.S.Dhoni has nothing special to stand out from other biopics.It is highly predictable except his love life and his secret of his helicopter shot.:)<br/><br/>So,M.S.Dhoni The Untold Story is a decent attempt on Dhoni's life but nothing special stand out in this.They have missed a lot of untold things and shown mostly the known things.<br/><br/>My rating 7.25/10"
"oazam","7","1","2","1 October 2016"," This movie brings back all the great memories of M.S Dhoni during his career as a batsman.
","After watching Emraan Hashmi's Azhar, it came to my mind that Bollywood wasn't just ready to make a biopic, but this movie made my interest go up thanks to none other than Neeraj Pandey. <br/><br/>M.S Dhoni is Neeraj Pandey's new movie starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The movie revolves around Dhoni's career and his relationships.<br/><br/>Honestly, this film was outstanding. Sushant Singh Rajput deserves a bow for this. He played Dhoni so well that the gestures and skills he used in the movie were simply great. He is on his way of deserving for the Best Male Actor Award in the upcoming award festival. Even Anupam Kher, Disha Patani, and Kiara Davani were just simply phenomenal in their respective roles. The direction and music was simply brilliant and the tone was shifted very smoothly.<br/><br/>But the only negative factor that I have for this movie is the script. I felt that this script was generic in terms of showing a documentary than a movie. The movie is suppose to have some funny moments and some outdated moments but I don't think the script had these elements. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is great in terms of good performances, direction, and music. But the screenplay of the movie made it boring on some occasions but its still a great film. M.S Dhoni- The untold story is worth watching at a cinema near you. <br/><br/>Neeraj Pandey and SSR- thank you for winning our hearts."

","Watch Full Movie here https://goo.gl/gY6bxd Mr. Neeraj Pandey great work, method using for portraying this story by outlining persistent shots taking rather that picking traditional and beaten method for long, mid and close . This new style was genuinely necessary for this games show film. Along these lines you get the right feel of on screen happenings however in beginning 30 minutes camera work doesn't bolster chief's vision well. It gets obscured while panning and delicate while moving yet after that it is great. Story depends on M.S.Dhoni genuine so nothing to say in regards to it. Screenplay by Director himself and Arun Jha is great. They have never gone over the edge or attempted to perform the scenes superfluous. There are such a large number of adorable and fresh scenes, as Dhoni chatting on detached phone and even this scene has a decent summit ahead. Another major in addition to purpose of this film is its bizarre yet sweet love scenes, similar to the introduction of Priyanka, Dhoni first love interest, then introduction of Sakshi dhoni, both scenes are too great. Sakshi conversing with her flat mate is likewise suitable and adorable, setting up and taking forward her character when Dhoni says that I knew you wouldn't come alone to meet me. This film has exceptionally compelling enthusiastic remainder as well and after long time downpour in passionate scenes didn't bother me. Discoursed are great. The way Khadagpur railroad officer Mr. Ganguly, a fine on- screen character, depicts parts of life to Dhoni as reference of cricket is extraordinary. Altering should be particularly specified.<br/><br/>Editorial manager Mr Shree Narayan Singh has conveyed a fine and consistent work. The method for mixing the genuine footage and reel one is simply astonishing. Without demonstrating every one of the stalwarts on screen you never feel that they are not present. All shots are so brisk. Credit goes to Director too for his vision. Without taking any names in some debated edge they capably make you comprehend everything. This film is loaded with execution shocks. Credit goes to throwing chief Vicky Sadana. Sushant Singh Rajput is brain blowing. You need to give careful consideration that he is not genuine Dhoni. He has not done this by copying but rather adding fine measurement to his character so you imagine that if genuine one would be in this circumstance. He would have responded in same way. Disha Patani as Priyanka is extremely charming and acts well as well. Kiara Advani as Sakshi is great. She sparkles in an enthusiastic scene. There are bunches of extraordinary performing artists as well. Anupam Kher (Father), Mother (great on-screen character), Bhumika Chawla( Sister), Rajesh Sharma (Sports instructor Banerjee), Kumud Mishra (Coal mines officer), all are pitch great. On-screen characters in part of his companions are likewise great, as Kranti Prakash Jha as Santosh, Chittu demonstrates his bore in the scene when he passes on the pitiful news to Dhoni over telephone. On-screen character who played Sardar is additionally great. Music by Amaal Mallik, runs well with film yet expressively all tracks are overwhelming. Manoj Muntanshir's verse Like Mukhda 'Mal De Suraj Ke Munh Par Malai, Burbak Badal Par Kar De Chadhai', I enjoyed it yet Antra gets to be long winded. I missed some straightforward expressive resonant tracks, which extension was in film."
"harshit_pande","8","1","2","1 October 2016"," The Untold Inspirational Story of M.S. Dhoni
","2016 can easily be considered as the year of biopics and real- life stories. Some good ones being NEERJA, SARBJIT and AIRLIFT. And so the tradition continues with NEERAJ PANDEY's M. S. DHONI: THE UNTOLD STORY. As the title suggests, it is the untold story of the Indian Cricketer and Present Captain ""Mahendra Singh Dhoni"" and how he played a key role as the Captain and a Player to finally lift the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 against Sri Lanka after a long hiatus of 28 years. The running time of the film is 3 hours and 10 minutes which is quite long compared to any of the film released in recent years but even then the drama doesn't falter much and justifies it's length. The credit for this goes to the crisp editing and an equally supportive screen writing by NEERAJ PANDEY and NANDU KAMTE.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is that part of Dhoni's life which we don't actually know. His childhood, his family, friends and the people around him. And the second half is mainly his personal and love life and his International career as the Indian Captain. Coming to the first half, it is comparatively much better than the second half the sole reason of which being; it is the lesser known part of his life. His struggle has been shown to us in a way that is relatable to the people of all age groups. The biggest plus point of first half are the characters supporting MS Dhoni to reach his goal. The cricketing scenes in the film have been handled beautifully and provide the necessary excitement to the audience. Overall, the first half is very good and manages to sustain the interest of the audience.<br/><br/>Then comes the second half, although it is entertaining with the two leading ladies adding up to the romantic life of the Cricketer but somewhat the biography becomes a bit of a hagiography. It portrays MS Dhoni as if he can do anything and that winning the world cup was entirely his effort and only if a bit more of team work and his leadership skills were focused upon; it would have taken the movie to an all new level. But the climax is love ðŸ’œ, it will give you the goosebumps as an Indian and would take you back to that magical and joyous moment of winning the World Cup.<br/><br/>SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT shines as Dhoni and undoubtedly gives his career best performance. He gives a subtle and balanced performance quite similar to Dhoni in real life. ANUPAM KHER as his father is amazing. DISHA PATANI as Priyanka Jha and KIARA ADVANI as Sakshi Rawat (as the love interests of Dhoni) look beautiful and play their part sincerely. Two of the supporting actors stand out as far as their performance is concerned namely------ RAJESH SHARMA and KUMUD MISHRA. Even in their small roles they make big impact.<br/><br/>Overall, M. S. DHONI: THE UNTOLD STORY is a must watch film and entertains despite a few drawbacks in the second half. I would give this an 8/10."

","""Dhoni finishes off in style, a magnificent strike into the crowd, India lift the World Cup."" These lines every Indian would like to relive over and over. The man spearheading India to two World Cups. MS Dhoni. A film on him would surely make waves. MS Dhoni: The untold story, has managed just to scrap through as a decorous, typical movie. The direction team has shown pretty much what they have wanted the audience to see, steering clear of any controversies, or aberrations whatsoever. First things first, this movie gets high points because Sushant Singh Rajput exhibits an undeniable level of perfection in portraying MS Dhoni. The walk, the body language, the look in his eyes, the smile, even emulating all the cricketing shots, all are mesmerizing to say the least, for a man who doesn't look like Dhoni. The movie being over a tedious 3 hours long, does test your patience but comes through overall. The first half is engaging and quirky. The movie shows the 'untold journey' of Dhoni's childhood till the famous six that he hit at Wankhede that gave us goosebumps. The journey of the hero, starts off with Dhoni as a school going kid in Ranchi who prefers to be a goalkeeperÂ but is eyed by the school coach as 'good replacement' for a wicketkeeper for the school team. Little does he know he has the hunger of a man craving for success and what a brute force he turns out to be. The movie shows the struggles of Dhoni starting from his hometown, where he's a local hero, to missing out on India U 19 world cup team, to haggardly oscillating between his job and cricket practice; we see it all. We see the frustrations of the one termed as ""The Captain Cool"". However what drives him to meteoric rise is his steadfastness, focus and persistence. The movie is well plotted upto this point. But what happens after Dhoni has attained a hero's status all over the country? The 2007 World Cup loss, after which his effigy was burnt outside his home in Ranchi, the winning of the T20 world cup where he displayed calm nerves of a steel : that is where we see the birth of leader, are depicted as normally happening events that just come and go. The death of his girlfriend, what effect it has on Dhoni? lThe film runs through the major signposts in Dhoni's career, but we never get a sense of how victory and defeat affected the man or altered his game or personality.Â That is how we see Dhoni, a legendary leader. But the film isn't saying that. Being a three hour long movie, you shouldn't have excuses to not put this on your movie. Overall the movie is a good watch, because it's manages to stay stimulating the whole team and we have the director to thank for that. Dhoni's encounter with young Yuvraj Singh is one of the most riveting scenes of the film, the casting team has done an excellent job in finding Herry Tanghiri who's looks match with Yuvraj any given day. Among the actresses, Kiara Advani scores a little higher than Disha Patni, who is likable, cute and has a good chemistry with Sushant. But you can't blame Disha, given the fact that she had such a short role. The rest of the cast does its job conviniently."

","So here it goes, ever since I got to know that the movie on MSD is coming I knew that I had to watch it no matter what , glad that I managed to. Now coming to the movie, most of us already knew part of his life story but what it does is that it tells us the story behind the story we heard of. First half beautifully captures Dhoni's struggling days in Ranchi. To make the movie more realistic they shot on actual locations like his school, Mecon colony and even on railway stations. The frustration when everyone recognizes your talent but you can't go anywhere carrying that has precisely been shown. His days as TC & the insecurities can be read on Sushant's face while portraying Dhoni. Glad that movie has given importance to unsung heroes , yes his friends who were always beside him in making Dhoni what he is. <br/><br/>Second half was concentrated in showing us more serious side of Dhoni and selection chores he went through .Also, his relationship with Sakshi. The scene where Dhoni receives his team India jersey for the first time really gives you goosebumps. People saying that movie is long , I mean how can you show biopic in just 90 minutes I am glad that they didn't compromise on that aspect. The plot that they could have better shown should have been his interactions with players and strategies before let's say world cup final, apart from that I enjoyed this one and would highly recommend"

","Biographies on sports folks have been generating quite a buzz. Films like ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"", ""Mary Kom"" and ""Paan Singh Tomar"" have been able to make a mark on silver screen. Much has been talked about probably the best captain India Cricket ever had but nobody know the background of what made the legend which creates curiosity to see the film. With outstanding trailer making it an event film, is ""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story"" worth your patience ? Well, let us check out ...<br/><br/>""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story"" gives you account of the never-heard story of the most successful Indian Cricket Team Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (played by Sushant Singh Rajput) who shined with his admiring captaincy that led India team won the world cup in 2011.<br/><br/>""M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story"" is being directed by Neeraj Pandey who has given marvelous films like ""A Wednesday"", ""Special Chabbis"" and ""Baby"". The film successfully gives the coming-of-age drama of Dhoni's background, various folks involved in helping him and the opportunities he gets to move ahead. But when you want to realize the real character of the legend-in-making that is where the film falters. The first half of the film is stupendous which gives the account of real situations in Dhoni's life. The highlight definitely being the ""helicopter"" shot appropriately played by Sushant Singh Rajput along with the never- heard story of what went behind the making of a great player. However, the it is second half which spoils the mood with never ending romantic love story which causes a speed-bump. To make it worst, too much of song will completely bore you and editing takes a back seat. Pandey loses the track and focus shifts completely. Even the climax which talks about the India winning the World Cup trophy against SriLanka should have been more thrilling. Music is another let down and none of the songs were impacting. <br/><br/>Despite the shortcomings, ""M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story"" is embedded with superlative performances which will keep you engaged. Sushant Singh Rajput goes into the character of Dhoni and you will like him especially in the Ticket Collector part. But again, he needs to work on his expressions which I see lacking him in his previous films as well. Anupam Kher as usual is splendid. Bhumika Chawla is just about okay. Rajesh Sharma is brilliant. <br/><br/>Overall, ""M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story"" pays tribute to real-life hero but disappoints as a film. Decent 2.75/10<br/><br/><ul><li>Ketan Gupta</li></ul>"
"saikatwsm","8","1","3","30 September 2016"," Sushant delivers a match winning performance as DHONI
","If you are a die-hard fan of Dhoni, this film would unquestionably be awesome for you. Despite its overrated glorification, what makes it a good film is the hard work put by Sushant Singh Rajput in precisely portraying the inspirational story of a middle-class boy from Ranchi who made it big; from a ticket collector to the captain of the Indian Cricket Team. However, this film does not cover any of the hard controversies Dhoni had been a part of. His incompetency with the elder players (Sehwag and Gambhir), rivalry with Yuvraj and the love hate relationship with media and the BCCI board went mostly unseen. But as you see the film from Dhoni's eyes, the movie is quite justified as one hardly find himself faulty for any decisions. All in all, the film has hit enough sixes to keep the chant 'Dhoni Dhoni' alive in the theaters. <br/><br/>My prediction on BO Collections: 114cr-120cr"
"adhyayan_reviews","7","1","4","30 September 2016"," Instant Blockbuster !!! Still a case study of lost opportunities.
","Cast: Sushant Singh Rajput , Disha Patani , Anupam Kher Herry Tangri, Kiara Advani , Bhumika Chawla , Rajesh Sharma<br/><br/>Director: Neeraj Pandey Screenplay: Neeraj Pandey, Nandu Kamte Dialogue: Dilip Jha Music:Amaal Malik<br/><br/>Story: 3.5 Screenplay: 3 Direction: 3.75 Performances: 4 Dialogues: 3.5 Music/BGM: 3 Technical Aspects: 3.75 <br/><br/>Overall: 3.5 <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>The film begins with the climatic portions of Ind v SL World Cup 2011 final as MSD gears up to promoting himself in a surprise decision.And we all know how it ended.This strong shot kicks the tires for the film which then switches all the way back to 7 July 1981 where Papa Dhoni is anxiously waiting in the maternity ward with his daughter. Little does he know that a legend was in the making.<br/><br/>The film spans a good 180 minutes and makes best use of the first 90 delivering the 'untold' and 'unknown' fragments of the childhood and teenage years of MSD.Director Neeraj Pandey spends ample time churning out small and big details with equal ease.<br/><br/>Mahi a lanky school kid in Ranchi, who actually wanted to play football, crashes into destiny with Dhoni's school coach discovering his talents at wicket keeping, his father's initial reluctance and later acceptance of the fact that his son is better off as a cricketer than as a Government employee and Dhoni's own struggles to make it to the Indian team, as he works as a TTE at Kharagpur station.<br/><br/>The film moves breezily in the first half from one incident to another, as we get invested in Dhoni's life and career. Several moments stand out like Dhoni seeing his father wake up in the night to water the ground, his first match with his future rival Yuvraj Singh, and him not coping with his railway duties. And yes Sushant Singh Rajput is terrific.<br/><br/>The film then takes a gear backwards in the second half which I believe is what hindered this otherwise great film from escalating to levels of absolute brilliance.The script begins to flood us with the romantic interests and exotic locations and plentiful songs.A lot has already been documented regarding the love-affairs of MSD and it did not warrant as much screen-time as it got which slackened the pace of matters.'<br/><br/>The makers skim over the MSD who we have known as 'Captain Cool' and all the controversies his decisions led him into.Neither do we get to look into the mind of the master-strategist whose ingenious abilities of assessing a problem while keeping his nerves and then literally hitting them out of the park is unrivaled.We even don't get a proper glimpse at Dhoni the athlete, the cricketer which is also a downer.<br/><br/>But then apart of this the film basically gets everything else bang-on. The strength of the film is in its beautiful characters played so brilliantly by each one of them.The bigger story is of the people who supported Dhoni to become what he is.<br/><br/>The direction is fabulous and kudos to Pandey for keeping the film so real and so grounded especially when it comes to a bio-pic of such an ultra popular figure.The film seamlessly blends actual figures with the film's re-enactment which is a huge plus.<br/><br/>Sushant Singh Rajput has undergone massive physical and mental changes and the end result is that he could easily pass as MSD on any day.An absolutely terrific performance and might just be career-defining.In fact the level of acting from all actors is so high that it seldom feels like a bio-pic and more of a documentary almost like a mirrored reality.<br/><br/>The dialogues are well written and suit the tone of the film and the brilliant production values(especially the quality of cricketing depicted) along with the spectacular background score make sure your eyes remained glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The film does idolize Dhoni in a many-a-places but then doesn't leave many opportunities to prove that he is just like us.. an ordinary man who just did n0t give up.The film ends on a high with the conclusive moments of the world cup finale.These are the very moments that are etched in our collective memories and Pandey pushes the right triggers to evoke national pride.<br/><br/>In conclusion the film should not be missed by anyone who has ever admired Dhoni nor by Sushant fans.Others can still watch it for being a wholesome family product albeit with some patience.<br/><br/>Did you like the review???<br/><br/>visit my blog for more : https://nxtbondreviews.wordpress.com"
"mitrajtrath","8","0","1","30 November 2016"," Neeraj Pandey's mediocre is still a good Bollywood flick
","Neeraj Pandey's latest sticks exactly to what the film says ""the man you know,the journey you don't"".Rising above all the achievements and controversial issues of the skipper's life,the film puts forward the untold journey of a boy from a small town & how he went on to become the man we know now.<br/><br/>The film begins with a stylish screenplay depicting the night of 2011 world cup final at the Wahkhede stadium.Then a look back into the early life of MS Dhoni making it a very engaging first half.With greater details, it takes a deeper look into the childhood of the skipper,his teenage achievements as a budding cricketer and the dilemma he faced while choosing his career opportunities.Not to forget the early meet of Dhoni and Yuvraj in the CoochBihar trophy.All that ends in a promising manner until a flawed 2nd half decides to continue.A look into the romantic life of the wicket-keeper batsman was the weakest part of the film. 2 back to back relationships studded with songs made the film loose its momentum.Somehow in the final minutes the film managed to come back into the game and it seemed as if India was lifting the world cup for a second time.<br/><br/>I agree it's flawed but there are still many good parts of the film. An incredible performance from Sushant Singh Rajput.The matches were beautifully portrayed with the director taking care of copying every single piece of action of Dhoni from real to reel.Seemed like Dhoni just came up with a plastic surgery!!Yet the film could have been made shorter and more focused.<br/><br/>Overall a feel good factor works throughout with a whole lot of stories to tell.

","M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is nowhere close to what I was expecting out of this film. I usually admire biopics no matter how they are written or directed. But it's not the case with this film since I already knew who Mahendra Singh Dhoni is. Most of the times we like what we don't know. And what we know is never enough. This is what happened with this film.<br/><br/>Directed by Neeraj Pandey, the film is all about M.S. Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) whose early phase as a Cricketer is full of struggle and hard work. This is perhaps the case with all the cricketers out there. But Dhoni does everything on his own and ends up captaining the Indian cricket team, which is inspirational.<br/><br/>In spite of that Neeraj played his emotional card and gave the film a typical Bollywood flavour, which was not necessary since we love Dhoni for what he is and his emotionally shattered love life hardly makes any difference. Fantastic acting by Sushant which clearly shows the amount of efforts he had to put in.<br/><br/>M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story surprisingly turned out to be a huge disappoint. If you are a fan of Dhoni, you will definitely admire this film. But if you are a fan of Cricket, this is not for you. The reason being, the film is so Dhoni-centric that there's nothing else. Not even Cricket, except Dhoni's legendary World Cup-winning shot.<br/><br/>This film could have been much better if there wouldn't have been an overdose of Dhoni's love life for nearly a quarter of the film."

","One day I missed my school to watch India vs Pakistan match and Dhoni scored 148!This is my untold story! <br/><br/>the trailer gave me goosebumps but the movie didn't give me goosebumps! So what? Its still enjoyable! <br/><br/>Once again Neeraj Pandey have done a great job. I think the main problem is its script.Though the first half is great,second half is average and predictable(except a twist). <br/><br/>Sushant worked hard to copy Dhoni's style and yes he did it magnificently! All the other actors also did a fine job.<br/><br/>No question about acting. I think this movies box office performance proves that Dhoni is not only a player but also he is a brand !"
"pranayjalvi","7","0","1","3 October 2016"," Movie succeeds in portraying Dhoni's story
","The film is a must watch for every cricket lover because it aptly tells the tale of an extraordinary man. The struggles are real and so is Sushant's acting. There isn't any shocking revelation, just inspiration and determination of a born talent who along with right people by his side, became the legendary captain.You have to give credit to Neeraj Pandey to keep it intriguing enough for you to get hooked throughout the three hours. Although it could have focused more on Dhoni's rise through the years instead of his personal life, but that doesn't let the movie down.Tight screenplay and good performances makes this one a good watch. I go with 3.5/5 for Dhoni's biopic directed by Neeraj Pandey."

","Its just because of MSD everyone is giving 10 , i will also award this movie with a score of 10 Just because its biopic of a real legend. 1st half was for them, who are cricket lovers and dhoni lovers But specifically if we talk about. 2nd half that made an Imapct on those people who are haters or people who are not aware About msd . There was a clear indication that why he always remained cool and calm as For him winning or losing never mattered its just a part of his role and life offered to him . There is a reason why dhoni never celebrated in wc2011 and many other activities which he came across and achieved . <br/><br/>As he suffered with something at the initial stage of his career . Did you ever realize in the movie why did he only celebrated the 100 he scored against Pakistan 148* in which he removed his helmet and raised his bat up , because till that time he was a normal person . But after that he got emotionally hurted , hearing upon his first gf **** And from then till now he don't have a point to be happy or sad .... Thats y people say him he is cool and calm .... But actually things made him go that way.<br/><br/>This is MSD ... Thankyou for taking your country to next level ... Regards Kushagra bajpai"

","I was not impressed with the trailer, but I had to watch this movie because Dhoni is from my state. I was born and brought up in Jharkhand. Once Dhoni became popular everyone has respect for Jharkhand. Jharkhand was synonym with Dhoni's Gaon (village).<br/><br/>The movie was very well directed. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half, I didn't want it to stop. Second half was a bit slow, love story could have been handled differently.<br/><br/>Sushant Rajput gave an impressive performance. Supporting staff, school teacher, Dhoni's friends, match commentator, coach were also very good.<br/><br/>My Rating: First half 9. Second half 7. Music 6. Direction 8. Overall 8."
"shrivick","7","0","1","2 October 2016"," A big treat MS Dhoni's fans
","The Biopic shows different stages of MS Dhoni from his childhood to 2007 word cup. The movie is really about the untold things that happened in his life<br/><br/>Actors were not disappointing even for a single shot which I saw on the screen.<br/><br/>The movie starts with 2007 world cup and ends with the six. Dhoni steps forward ahead of Yuvi since it was Muralidharan.<br/><br/>Characterisation <br/><br/>I'm challenging the readers of this review â€“ Sushanth will make you forget real MS Dhoni when you watch the movie. This guy has done an epic role. This will be spoken all his career.<br/><br/>Herry Tangri You will be surprised to see this character on the screen. The behavior and body language that he showed on the screen is same as Yuvi's. He has done an excellent work. <br/><br/>Disha Patani The lady has also done an excellent work. Wonderful expression she gave on the screen. She made me cry. It wasn't because of her but the real Priyanka Jha. <br/><br/>The other characters played by Bhumika, Anupam Kher, Kiara Advani including all the supporting roles are really good. Background Score The Directors should give more importance to the background score and Music in order to make the audience stick to the story.<br/><br/>Screenplay<br/><br/>Though the movie is slow and lengthy it was the script that holds our eyes towards the screen. The curiosity to know what happened in the life of Dhoni driven the entire play. Since it is a Biopic nothing additional things can not be added to script apart from the life of Dhoni. The politics by Gautam Ghambir against Dhoni is missing. Detailing about becoming the captain of India and Craig Chappell is also missing. <br/><br/>Overall Review Must watch for Gautam Ghambir The biopic is really enjoyable. The movie will never disappoint any MSD Fan. The actors have given their best. A treat for MSD fans.<br/><br/>https://goo.gl/Pp4Lvq Do watch in theaters and avoid piracy"
